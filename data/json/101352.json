It was a company trip so we didn't pay for our room itself. The only downer... the fact that that as a couple we didn't get a king bed - we got a double beds (actually I think one of them was a single). Even when we had flight delays and stayed another night, although the company requested a king bed we still got the two beds. It was a small thing considering the hotel is really very lovely. The hotel rooms were spacious, a nice walk in closet with safe, big screen tv and a balcony with view of the resort and the ocean. All of the staff were very nice and always very courteous. Every wake up call we got, we were also told what the weather would be like that day. Always had the Maui news under our door in the morning (even though we would often wake up around 5:30 AM) and the rooms were always made up well. There isn't much of a beach in front of the hotel and the ocean right by the hotel is a bit rocky. It's no more than a 5 minute walk to get to a nicer beach in front of another resort and all of the resorts are connected with a nice beach walk. The waves can get pretty big (this is from a mainlander with no experience surfing). A pretty strong undertow but lots of kids, boogie boards and surfers were able to have fun in it. The Hyatt makes up for it's smaller beach area with a beautiful layout. The grounds of the hotel are spectacular, lots of interesting paths with lots of flowers, little man made rivers and waterfall. You saw different birds along the way like Penguins, Swans, Ducks, Flamingos. The lobby atrium also had some tropical birds out during the day which was a nice touch. The pool is nicer than a lot of the other hotels but the water is cold, too bad it wasn't heated but that may have only been an issue because half of our stay was rainy. Nice big hot tub made up for it! Fast water slide and cute kids play area that are separate from the adult pool where they also have a hoop set up for some water sports. Lots of deck chairs around the pool and kids area for sunning if you don't feel like going right out onto the beach. 10-15 minute walk to Whaler's Village via the beach walk. Lots of joggers took advantage of the path if they weren't keen on jogging in the sand. We had two events at the Hyatt with our company. One was moved in doors due to rain - but the band was still great and the food was good as well! . We also enjoyed the hotel luau, great show, again, lots of good food, open bar and wonderful hula dancing. We tried Japengo once just for a few drinks, it was raining but had a nice view of the beach front and staff were really nice. We ate at Swans Court for breakfast every morning - fast omelette station, a great selection of breakfast pastries, fruit (papaya and pineapple were delcious), hot food and even miso soup. Overall it was a great stay and would stay here again on our next trip to Maui.

Since I was unable to book a room at a Marriott property in Kaanapali Beach, I gave Hyatt a try and boy am I glad that I did. Prior to my visit I contacted Hyatt Gold Passport to determine if they would provide a trial Diamond membership based on my Marriott status. They obliged based on the condition that I complete 12 Hyatt stays in the next 3 months which I agreed to. Based on my positive experience at this property and a less than ideal experience at the Marriott in Wailea I have decided to shift my business to Hyatt. I had read some mixed reviews about this property and was not sure what to expect. While the property is not new, renovations have kept the space fresh and aesthetically pleasing. The lobby is open is grand with views of the pool and ocean. The grounds are meticulously maintained and there is an abundance of wild life including penguins, flamingos, and other tropical birds. Check in was a breeze. I was promptly assisted at the Diamond Check in and both my wife and I were given lovely orchid leis. The guest relations rep upgraded us to a deluxe ocean view room and arranged to have wine and seared ahi sent to the room. The folks at this Hyatt property went out of there way at every turn to make our visit special. The employees at this property seem to like what they do and this goes a long way in making guests feel welcome. The Regency Club offered a wide array of food offerings and the service was both friendly and efficient The grounds are massive which is both a pro and a con. It can take a while to get from one place to another but the upside is that the resort did not feel terribly crowded despite being fully booked. The pools were expansive and built to blend in with the lush tropical surroundings. The pool area was serviced regularly by attendants and drinks were reasonable by resort standards. The pool was a bit chilly. I would have liked to see the pools heated but few in Hawaii seem to be. You have likely read other reviews about the beach being rocky and that is true. The Hyatt does not sit on the best stretch of sandy beach but it is only a short walk to find wider stretches of sand and larger surf. You can walk the boardwalk or beach to access other properties along Kaanapali beach. Check out Whalers Village for retail and restaurants. If you are looking for quaint this is not the property for you but if you want to have a wide array of dining and activity choices than the Hyatt offers families,couples and business travelers a great value.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cCrowded but lovely\u201d", "Author": "Honeymooner909", "ReviewID": "UR126255044", "Content": "We stayed here for the last 7 days of our honeymoon....the hotel room was great, but the shower and toilet area were a little tight as they are right next to each other with a door for privacy. the views were great and the food throughout the hotel was great--we got the breakfast buffet as a package deal through our travel agent, Jen Byrne at theTropicaltravelers.com. She really set us up with everything we love--pool, snorkeling, beach! The beach bar was fabulous--we enjoyed swimming up to it for drinks. The walking path through all the hotels on Kaanapali is convenient but very very crowded and narrow. We enjoyed walking down to the Sheraton's beach for AMAZING snorkeling and a wide open beach that had a safe way in and out--the beach at the Hyatt is tiny and there are quite a lot of rocks when getting in and out of the water. Overall it was a great hotel, just crowded at the pool and walking path (not the beach though). the Luau was also good at the Hyatt--but don't pay the extra VIP fare--not worth it--we are so glad we just paid the regular price.

The only minor negative was that the room we stayed in was showing it's age with some wear and tear, however it was kept very clean by the staff. Typically areas around the pool are packed by mid morning and instead of fighting the crowd, we opted to renting beach chairs for $5 a day. The beach only had a handful of people on it and you could listen to the surf and watch the whales with your toes in the sand. That beats laying around a pool anyday! I would also advise on making a couple trips into Lahaina for shopping and experiencing some of the great places to eat. While you're there you have to have some Hawaiian shaved ice - it was amazing. Driving the road to Hana was beautiful but plan it taking the entire day. Leave the resort by mid morning or it will get too dark to see all the beauty of your drive.

The front desk gave us an awesome photo album and free bottle of champagne for our special occasion which was unexpected and really great! I thought the rooms were nice, but, seeing as we were Hawaii, we tried to stay out as much as possible. The restaurants are all pretty pricey, so we only ate at the Swanz for breakfast. Breakfast was included in our rate, which I highly recommend because their breakfast buffet was simply amazing. We would eat so much great food in the morning that we were never really hungry for lunch. The pool was huge! It even has a grotto bar with TVs. There's also a basketball hoop and water slide, which, as a guy in my early 20s, I had a lot of fun with. The grounds were so beautiful and well kept. You can literally walk up to flamingoes and swans in their garden! There was a lot of construction going on while we were there which was a bummer, but I'm sure they've finished by now.

It takes forever to walk anywhere since its kinda built like a maze (similar to vegas style hotels). The zig zagging paths in and around the pool area make it a chore to get out to the beach, and the fitness center is all the way in the corner of the property (by the luau). It is however a beautiful hotel, with flamingos, penguins, parrots, and other exotic wildlife. It has beautiful gardens and walkways. You definitely feel like you're staying somewhere special. The hotel beach isn't that great, its a narrow beach that basically disappears when its high tide. The hotel is close to other beaches within walking distance. The pool area is large with lots of deck chair space available. Its a wonderland of a pool, complete with waterfall, and a bar inside a cave. The hottub is large too, can definitely fit more than 10 people. There is a kids pool separate from the main pool, with a fake sandy beach area. However night time swimming or hot tubbing can be difficult due to poor lighting. The restaurants at the hotel are top notch, and the entire hotel has a great \"outdoor living\" type feel, where the line between \"inside\" and \"outside\" is blurred. PROS: - Excellent location. 10 minute drive to Kapalua (great beaches, excellent snorkeling, golf, restaurants). 5 minute drive from downtown Lahaina, which features great local shopping, restaurants, ice cream and coffee joints. It's also where the Lanai ferry departs, and where a lot of boat tours and dinner cruises depart from as well. There is also a Safeway and a Foodland (grocery stores) in Lahaina too. - Large comfortable rooms. Walk in closet, lots of counter space around the sink. There's a nice flat screen TV with HD channels. Also plenty of lamps and plugs everywhere. There is also a separate non-minibar fridge for your snacks / drinks. - Friendly service. Concierge and hotel staff are eager to serve. You feel like you are special. CONS: - There is a $25 resort fee charged per day. Besides internet and self-parking, I'm not really sure what you get for that $25. One complaint I would have is that the inroom coffee should be of better quality if you are paying $25 / day resort fee. You get the basic motel quality coffee, powdered creamer and plastic tube stirrers, I was expecting actual liquid creamer here, and maybe even complimentary bottles of drinking water per day. - Self parking lots are kinda far. There's a closer lot that's smaller, and fills up quick. The main lot is accross a field. Both parking lots aren't well lit at night, and people suck at parking so many cars end up taking 2 spots. TIPS: - On checkin, valet parking is free until 11pm that night, so don't self park when you first get to the hotel - If you are living on the north building, you can enter the hotel via the 1st floor stairway if you are self parking (there's a \"doctor on call\" sign from the outside). This will save you a lot of walking. Use your key to open the door from the outside. - Buy drinks from the Lahaina Foodland / Safeway since you have a fridge in the room - Do not stay on the first floor if you are a light sleeper, especially if your room faces the parking lot - Priceline bid the hotel 2 weeks prior to your trip.

Matches that of any hotel on Maui - Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, Ritz, you name it. Genuine. Greeted with an \"aloha\" on the vast majority of occasions. It is clear this Hyatt has trained its employees well, and they appear to be happy going about their jobs. From front desk check-in, valets, grounds staff, towel staff to housekeeping, the staff is doing well. And they should be considering their rack rate can be $400/night. Location: for my money, it's here or Wailea. Nothing new to add from other reviews. Walking distance down to Black Rock, one stoplight down from the Westin Villas in front of which is a wonderful, uncrowded spot to snorkel. Swam with a turtle for 10 minutes there with nobody around. Whaler's is close. Nice path to get a workout in the morning. Price: Well, some people think $400/nt is reasonable or okay. I don't, especially coming out of high season. We booked at less than 1/3 of that. Resort fee is $25/day and gets you gym access, \"free\" self park, and wireless. Deal with it. It is a reality of travel these days, but it still feels like a nice big slap in the face. Had I paid rack rate, I would feel a bit cheated. Restaurants: didn't eat in any b/c I am of the firm opinion that hotel food generally stinks. Apparently some of their spots are quite good, but I wasn't willing to take a chance on any of them especially given their resort prices. Use your fridge for breakfast and Happy Hour on your lanai and splurge on nice dinners. Pool: divided with kids (2 waterslides) and adults (+ a basketball hoop) with a grotto (and bar) in between. Bar isn't swim up. Dark in there! No issues with getting seats. Activities: no kids, but I'm sure this is a good spot for them. TONS of couples here with young children. Having stayed at a lot of properties on Maui on all sections of the island, the Hyatt meets or exceeds the best. Sure, there are hints of the property's age but the service and location more than make up for it. Room are all newly renovated and they utilized the space well with a warm, traditional but slightly modern feel. You can find nicer rooms but you will not find nicer service.

There were nights where we slept with the slider to the balcony open so we could listen to the waves all night. Our kids loved the pools. They mainly stayed in the kiddie pool area. The area in the pictures below show this. There is one area where the water is only about 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 feet deep (where you see all the floating animals). This area also has a small slide for the little kids. The area right behind that area (beyond the nets) is around 5 feet deep. There is a much larger slide that empties into that area. Kids must be at least 48\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3 tall to go on that slide. The slide empties into water that is about 9 feet deep. My older son, husband and I loved the slide. My younger son wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tall enough to go on it but he loved the smaller slide. The larger slide take 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7 seconds to slide down. There is a larger pool area that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend any time at. The water is deeper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4 feet and up.

About the only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complaint\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that I have is that I wish there was a pool area where the depth was around 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 3 1/2 feet deep. There were some areas, right where you get in that were around that depth but they quickly got deeper to around 5 feet deep. The kiddie pool was quite shallow and 5 feet deep is too deep for most kids. I had read some reviews that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so favorable before we went. Many people talked about some construction that they were doing to update the hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to say that that seemed to be over when we were there. We saw no signs of construction. And as you can tell from our room pictures, the hotel is very up to date. There were also some comments complaining about parking. We had absolutely no issues with parking even when the luau was happening. There are 4 parking lots that you can use. Two are fairly small in the front of the hotel (to the right as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering the resort). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a rather large parking lot in the back of the resort (the entry is to the left right before the circle for valet parking). We never had a time when we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find parking in one of those 3 lots. However, if those are ever full, you can also park in the self-parking lot near the golf course. We did have a little mishap with our reservation we made for Camp Hyatt. We booked Camp Hyatt and a dinner at Japengo through the e-Concierge site. We got confirmation notices on both. However, when we went to Camp Hyatt to drop off the kids, it was closed. We went to the Concierge Desk. It took about a half hour but everything got resolved and we made our reservation at Japengo. Although Japengo is pricey (as some have complained), that is to be expected on Maui and the dinner was one of the best I've ever had. And the kids had a great time at Camp Hyatt. They made \"stained glass\" crafts and watched the Smurf movie. We loved our stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui. We found everyone we encountered to be very friendly. The grounds were absolutely beautiful and the kids loved the pools. There was so much to do at the resort and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located at Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach.

The rooms are layed out well, and you are able to move about easily......BUT the biggest drawback, especially of the ocean fron rooms...no matter what floor you are on..We were on the 20th) are extremely noisy. I truly enjoy sitting on the balcony and watching the whales and the beautiful sunsets, but each afternoon-evening until at least 9:00PM sometimes later, there was loud live music being played at both of the outdoor venues, and somestimes three. Each resturant...Japango, and Umulu had their own performer with different types of music...so the noise that one heard in the middle was not really pleasant. Out of the 7 nights that we were there, 4 of the nights they had outside parties on the lawns below. One night it was a birthday party of about 100 people with a live band that was great, but went until 11:00 or so, mixed in with the other venues music was not very peaceful. The other large parties were obviously companies who were using the hyatt for their meetings. Great idea, but Hyatt should have alternate area for these types of events so that the guests not involved with the business can have some peace and quiet that one pays for when on a \"relaxing\" vacation. Our room was a nice prime room,and certainly was not inexpensive. We should not have been subjected to the cacophony of noise and lack of privacy . The resturants Japangeo,and Swan court serve very good food...again not inexpensive...but good. The service in japango is slow and disappointing. The settings are beautiful. The main pool is nice but crowded with the usual people who awake at 6:am to through their towels on a chair, and don't show up till noon.. They have a seperate smaller area especially for kids which includes a water slide etc. and is nice. We have stayed at this hyatt in the past, but this time the experience was somewhat more challenging. We won't be returning to this property. If you don't mind the noise on a continual basis, this could be a hotel for you. It has the location and the setting, but you pay dearly for both.

But if the Hyatt wants to call themselves a five star and they have the staff right there and the lei right there - and I say \"Hi Im checking in\" - they need to be on the ball. The Deluxe Ocean View rooms are recently renovated and they do have a nice view of the sea, Lanai in the distance as well as lush garden-like grounds below. Ask for a room on a higher floor to receive the best view possible. These rooms are nice and tastefully decorated; not \"too Hyatt\" and not \"too Hawaiian\". Good large sized closet and robe, but no slippers. Private triangular balcony with table and two chairs. The staff were nice and mostly from the mainland USA. For example, we met so many people from Boston, all wonderful and very friendly. The restaurants we tried at the hotel were too expensive and not very good. Even the breakfast buffet; not very good. Plus it is inescapably indoor/outdoor and therefore there are lots of birds flying around your food. (We had a delicious dinner at the Honua Kai down the beach, prices much more reasonable in comparable if not better location.) The hotel is way to big something like 800 or so but it feels like thousands and thousands. Took me 10 minutes to hustle from my room on the 8th floor down to the main lobby area. But because the hotel is too big there are many shops including a large Macy's and everything you could require. The expansive grounds are gorgeous, very well maintained, floral and lush. Meandering pathways, Asian Gardens and penguins. So many amenities here to choose from. A great number of pools - though not always open - and a groovy Grotto Pool Bar! Valet was friendly; efficient. One thing I must mention that truly impressed me: housekeeping. We took the Haleakala Sunrise Volcano tour and had to leave the hotel at 2:30am. I was so happy to find my room had already been made up - upon my return to the hotel about 10:00am. Could hardly believe it! It makes sense though. People who take these tours do not like having someone interrupt them while they're trying to catch a few zzzz during prime maid service hours.

My husband and I were upgraded from ocean view to ocean front ( see attached pics) and we couldn't have been happier with our room.

My Maid of honour and I visited the heavenly spa the eve before our wedding. Loved the massage and the thermal bath/steam rooms. I also worked out at the gym every day prior to our wedding and it was top notch! Love the little extras like cold face cloths and lemon water! The Hyatt grounds are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful.

The pool is fantastic, the service top notch and many of the waitresses remembered my favourite drinks from day to day. Although the drinks were expensive we didn't find the pool side restaurant too pricey and the food was delicious, especially the tuna salad! We only ordered room service once to the room and although we loved our breakfast on the lanai, at $85 for two we only did it once as a morning after our wedding treat! Many reviewers have complained about the beach at the Hyatt but after spending an afternoon at the beach in front of the Sheraton we all agreed that we loved the beach down our end better. Although the beach is narrower it was way less crowded, the ocean much calmer and just a more peaceful atmosphere with less people around. We walked by all the hotels on the boardwalk and besides the Westin which looked very nice, we thought the Hyatt was the best looking hotel on the strip!

We received water and shell necklaces and we were quickly taken to our room with baggage delivery via a very friendly bellboy. Location, location, location! Talk about amazing, with a walkway along the beach, one way to a beach, the other to Whaler's Village area and beaches...walked this daily/nightly with our kids...GREAT GREAT GREAT, cannot say enough about it. Rooms are on the nicer side, and I do not know what anyone would complain about. There is even a spacious walk in closet with ironing board, robes, etc. There are 2 fridges, one is a bar, the other is for your own stuff, which we always fill with Costco goodies before arrival. Word to the wise, have the tray of yummies removed immediately, or you will be charged because it is 'weighed' and any movement can cause charges to you. Beds are platform beds, so pretty low to the ground, which didn't bother us at all. The pillows were great and we all slept VERY well during our stay. The grounds of the hotel are really neat with all the wildlife (my kids adored R2-D2, Luna, Roger, Shrek) and has a very Asian vibe, as most Hawaiian hotels do. And the upkeep was pretty spot on. The pools (although could use a little tlc) are nice, and VERY busy and the setup is a bit awkward. This hotel isn't a romance hotel by any means, so keep that in mind! There are a lot of kids and with kids comes chaos, especially when mom and dad have checked out to be in 'vaca' mode. And at the pool is no different. You will get splashed at unexpected times, you will hear laughing and goofing off and you will see kids... The kiddie area is really a great area for kids under 5. Above that, they'll get bored fast. Also, there is only 1 hot tub, located right NEXT to the kiddie area...don't know who's idea that was... They offer free pool classes and snuba (scuba/snorkel) demos daily which are neat little perks. They let my 9 yr old son do it multiple times; we didn't buy the trip as it is pretty pricey...but he did enjoy it a lot in the pool. There is staff everywhere at this hotel, always cleaning, picking up, etc, so I was pretty surprised to see some slack in the cleanliness. I kinda felt like their thoughts at the hotel was to clean what's seen but leave the unseen uncleaned. For instance, in our room, there looked to be maybe soda spray by our bed/lamp that was not caused by us, and was not removed/cleaned the whole stay. Or, the sand collected in my kids shoes was never vacuumed up from the corner I pushed it into during our entire stay. And the little nooks and crannies that kids find in hotels, those areas were in need of some tlc. This said, the hotel did not lack in clean open spaces that people frequent, just makes me wonder... Food-wise, only ate at Umalu's 2 times, during lunchtime next to the poolside via poolside service, which is AWESOME, but yes, expensive, get over it! You don't have to order! My family loved the garlic fries, biggest basket of fries I've ever seen! And I absolutely adored the Chop Chop Salad. It's the best salad I've EVER eaten in my entire life. Parking...it's been said, I don't have much more to say. Yes, you have to pay. Yes, the parking is limited. Yes, they are tiny spaces. This is ALWAYS the case in Hawaii...ALWAYS. f you're going to enjoy anything on the island, try The Pacific Whale Foundation's activities.

The resort is really very impressive it has a beautiful setting right on the ocean with extensive gardens, numerous pools and extensive and well-kept landscaping with a range of birds and other animals. I experienced a luxury king room that overlooked the main swimming pool and towards the beach. This room was well appointed with computer-sized safe, mini-bar and a separate fridge. There were nice toiletries, fluffy towels, very comfortable bed and large plasma TV with a good range of channels. Room had patio sliding doors onto a very small balcony (lanai) that received lots of sun and was a great place to view the sunset. Room was cleaned up each day by cheery and pleasant staff. Indeed all staff in hotel were exceptionally nice and provided a first class experience. Pools were clean, had ample loungers, and waitress bar and food service was pleasant. On the negative side, the breakfast buffet was fairly expensive and was only of standard quality. Sure, it is located in a beautiful location open to a waterfall and pool with swans gliding by, but seating appears limited as there are often long line-ups to get in. There was a custom omelette station, but lines were long and slow and the cook was overworked and grumpy. There was also the conventional mix of cereals, muffins, breads as well as other cooked items such as eggs, bacon and sausages. Interestingly, they also offered a Japanese-style selection (miso soup, etc). I did not experience hotel lunches or dinners as I was told there are many better places in nearby Lahaina. Warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do not leave a plate of food on your table as it will be attacked by flocks of small birds; wearing a hat is also a good idea as these well-fed free-loaders to require frequent bathroom breaks. Another negative was the evening show (luau). In fact it was so bad in so many respects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food, although plentiful, was of poor quality; waiter service for open bar was so slow, I had to serve myself; wine and beer quality was extremely poor; and the show itself was dreadful, particularly the smarmy/cheesy MC and the faux-rock stage setting was ridiculous.

There is a cool water slide on the other side of the Grotto bar but be careful, the water at the end of the slide is very deep. This was a bit of a shocker as I shot out the end of the slide.

If this is you continue to read this review. (keep in mind we are a couple that is upper 20's and lower 30's, 1st time to Maui) Trip: Jan. 22-Jan.28. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt for business and leisure. Conference: The only thing I didn't appreciate is, I wasn't allowed to eat breakfast with my husband in the conference buffet area, unless we wanted to pay $40-$50 per day for me to eat with him. Rooms: The rooms offer a great space, beds are comfy, great closet space and counter space by the mirror. The only complaint about the room would be the partial ocen view, if I was to recommend anyone to not waste the money on the partial because you had to look around the corner to see the ocean. Either splurge and get the ocean view or just get a downgraded view. Service: I loved the service! They use your name at most restuarants, they offer great service in the hotel, poolside, and throughout the restaurants. They also allowed us to check in an hour early which was great after traveling for a whole day. Restaurants: Our favorite was Japengo, we ate there 2 nights. My suggestion is to make reservations to get a seat on their gorgeous terrace seating or indoor seating. The first night we didn't have reservations and had to eat by the bar which was excellent as well. But the second time they gave us an awesome table with a breathtaking view of the sunset. Umalu: Great nachos and salads by the pool. Swan Court: Excellent breakfast buffet. I also ate off the menu which was excellent, the service here is one of the best in the hotel! The only thing I would have liked to see is the ability to order more items a la carte versus having to get such large portions off the menu. Location: It is walking distance to Whaler's Village, which is a bunch of great shops. Walking distance to other great restuarants including Longboards and Hula Grill (recommend the Gado-Gado salad and the fish and chips)! You are also able to walk to many tourist activities including certain dinner cruises and sailing excursions that pick you up on the beach. The Hyatt is located towards the end of that hotel strip making it just minutes away from downtown Lahaina which offers more great restaurants (Hard Rock Cafe, Cheeseburger in Paradise, etc), shops, and a Safeway for groceries. However, I would avoid Lahaina when a cruise ship is docked, it is jam-packed with people. Great snorkeling right in front of the hotel tons of fish, turtles, and more! Rent the snorkel gear for $40 for the whole week!!! Concierge: The desk was very helpful and towards the end of the week we canceled one of our excursions and because we gave 24 hour notice they gave us a full return. They also assist in setting up dinner reservations. Hertz: Do yourself a favor and rent a car before you arrive. They are able to get you a vehicle through the hotel if they are not sold out, but they charge a lot and the lady that helped us was not overly enthused about checking different prices before we made a choice on what to pick for a vehicle. Fitness Center: I used the fitness center every morning. I did go early, around 4:30-5 am, after about 6 am it does pretty full and could be difficult if you are hoping to snag a particular piece of cardio equipment. But overall the equipment is some of the best of the Life Fitness brand. They offer sanitized headphones, water coolers (regular water & lemon flavored), cool towels, wide variety of equipment. Pool: Since I was up early I was always able to get a good spot by the pool. The pool is great, relaxing, and quiet (they don't play loud music). I could see this being a big complaint by late-risers, because people show up early and place items on the chairs to hold spots and then I watched some people not show up until 10:30 or 11:30 to use their chairs. I usually laid by the pool at 7:30 or 8 am and stayed until mid-afternoon. The rule is supposed to be after an hour your chair is gone, but how do you regulate that? Therefore, my suggestion follow what the trend is, if you want a good spot, get up early place items or towels on your chairs before you go to breakfast. Since this is a family resort I was worried about kids being around splashing, screaming etc. But they placed the kids pool on the other side of the Grotto bar and bathrooms between the two pools keeping most of the kids on the kids side. Besides they have a huge waterslide and a lot of fun kids stuff to do by the kids pool making all the kids want to be over there. Resort Fees: The resort fees are kind of a bummer, they should just add it to the room total. We did get wi-fi for approximately for four days, I think they should give free wi-fi to the guest of the hotel if they are going to charge the resort fee of $15 extra a day.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stillwater, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cRegency Club Worth It\u201d", "Author": "mubbs", "ReviewID": "UR123832490", "Content": "We just returned from the Hyatt and I must say was very happy with the exception of a couple of things.

The Regency Club made our stay fantastic with soda and water available throughout the day plus breakfast,snacks, pupus and dessert. Well worth (to us) the extra cost. My negative comment is that even the Regency Club has that goofy snack tray taking up valuable counter space and is \"motion sensitive\". It is in the way all of the time.

While the Hyatt beach isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very good or swimmable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all you have to do is walk along the beach for a few metres and you will find a much better swimming area. We stayed in a secluded and quiet area in Kauai, so we were happy to see that the Hyatt was in a much busier location in Maui surrounded by plenty of restaurants, at the same time it was a short drive to more secluded quiet beaches/areas. Our room was nice and modern, spacious and clean. The only negative was the bathroom, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really picky about bathrooms and I hate when 4 or 5 start luxury resorts have the shower over the bath and a plastic shower curtain! The Service was good and efficient. The Hyatt grounds are superb, it is like a zoo, there is wildlife everywhere including penguins and parrots that talk! One day a monk seal flopped itself down for the day on the Hyatt beach, that was amazing to see. The pool area is huge and has a swim up bar which is always a cool feature. We attended the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drums of the Pacific Luau and I would not recommend it. It is far too expensive for what you get. The food is cheap buffet food and while the performances are ok, it is definitely not worth the amount you pay. For half the price you could go to another Luau which would probably be of the same quality. One activity I definitely recommend doing is hiring a car and driving the road to Hana.

I parked in the valet lot, and the walk from the parking lot to the hotel is dark and dangerous. Secondly, maid service is not up to what I considered four star. I had to contact the management at 2:30 when my room was still not cleaned. In all fairness to management, a basket of goodies was sent up to my room. Nice, but not necessary. And in fact, my room has not been made up before noon, any day since. Third, the rooms are somewhat dated, as it the bathroom. More importantly, the bathroom smells of mildew and mold. I could not see black mold, but the smell was ghastly. The bed IS very comfortable, on a positive note. Fourthly, lunch options do not exist! I am here for a conference- I am basically held hostage here. There is only 1 restaurant, and that is a self-service pool bar! Very noisy, crowed, and no real choices---and I am here for 8 days.

Typical hotel buffet, however, the view is beautiful with the swans and other birds. BUT, the small birds are a big nuisance and quite annoying. They fly around all over, and if you leave the table to go back to the buffet, the birds swarm all over your plate and cup. YCCH! Lastly, customer service needs improvement.

Spring for Regency Club rooms - the snacks are great, free beverages, pastries, fruit, coffee, etc. is an awesome perk. And, given the price of Hawaiian meals in general, this can easily pay for itself as you may not feel like doing the full meal thing after beach / pool or for breakfast. 2. The breakfast buffet is a life altering experience. Not only is the food great (I'm still craving guava pancakes and fresh pineapple), but the view is epic and service spectacular. 3. I also ponied up for the full ocean view. I don't in any way regret this. Especially after grabbing some coffee in the regency club and bringing it back to the room. Something about crashing waves with your coffee on the lanai.. it's literally the greatest way to start a day. You'll notice I don't score high marks in value - this is in no way a negative, but rather, a warning to all those cheapskates who haven't adequately prepared for how much a vacation to HI will cost. I didn't find the Hyatt to be excessive in any regard, and actually booked a great bundle deal through Costco, but be prepared for everything to be expensive from that point on. This includes paying for valet and not trying to save a minuscule amount on parking, understanding that resort drinks will run a steep tab, and the words \"great deal\" will likely never cross your lips until you return home. A few additional Maui travel tips: 1. Don't rent from Alamo or any of their sister companies (Enterprise, National). Message me if you want to know the nightmare that was my car rental. 2. One of the best meals we had was at a roadside food truck called Big Beach BBQ in Makena. You can find them on facebook. Their fish tacos will change your life. 3. Another great meal I recommend is the Mahi at the Fish Market located in Paia. Go there. Eat. Be happy. 4. Skip the tourist trap that is a luau. Just trust me on this one. Your money is better spent elsewhere. 5. The Road to Hana is a long and painful experience, especially as the driver. Stopping at the 7 sacred pools made it worth every minute. The rest of the drive?

Overall we enjoyed the resort and facilities, although it wasn't our favorite location in Maui. Kaanapali was the first mega resort development in America (built in 1960s), so the beach is lined with various hotels, restaurants, shops -- which isn't exactly what we wanted for our honeymoon. If you want \"true\" Hawaii, then I recommend spending a week in Hana. Back to the hotel though... we had an oceanfront deluxe room in the middle building (in front of the pool). Construction was going on during most of our stay, although they were just finishing everything up for Christmas. We had a lot of fun with the tropical birds in the lobby (especially Luna and R2D2, an African Grey), and the penguins were enjoyable as well. Breakfest buffet was a bit disappointing due to the bombardment of finch birds. I wouldn't be surprised if most guests (unknowingly) eat bird poop every day. Hopefully Hyatt will take care of the bird problem soon. After reading about \"Tour of the Stars\" in my Frommers guidebook, we decided to partake in activity at the resort. What a joke! I could see the stars better in my binoculars, so be sure to save the $25/pp fee. On a positive note, the Hyatt staff were really nice (especially at the concierge desk and the bartenders at the pool restaurant/bar).

We stayed a total of 10 days arriving before Christmas and leaving prior to New Years. Though it was a little more crowded than in the summer months,... believe it or not, we still felt blessed to be in such a wonderful resort. The construction everyone was talking about was completed a few days after our arrival and since we were aware of it from other reviews prior to our visit, we were not surprised. But it was a nice treat when they cleaned up and moved out opening up a beautiful entry to a beautiful resort. THE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE!We stayed on the top (9th) floor of the Lahaina Tower (facing east) with a great sunrise each morning and a GREAT ocean view. Though it was sold as a \"partial\" ocean view, we certainly were not cheated. (see photos). Our daily room cleaning was emaculant. Not a flaw or item out of place each day. The grounds are well kept and clean. The surroundings and views are awsome as you look out over the facility, the wide open ocean, and Lanai across the way. The pool areas were very crowded and every one of the hundreds of chairs were occupied each day. This obviously looks great to hotel management (and particularly bar tenders) but for paying customers, it's kind of a bummer to see such crowds. It did seem uncomfortably crowded at times as most of the hundreds of chairs are \"touching\" so if you are a couple, expect another couple to be \"touching\" your chairs as well. As prior reviews, you do need to get to the pool by mid-morning (9:30-10) to get a decent chair. Much earlier to get prime areas. Seems silly, but true. The employee service was fine as it pertains to us. Though we did order a couple drinks during our stay while sitting around the pool, we did NOT eat at any hotel restaurants. the prices are very high and from reading previous reviews, we were not intersted in \"exploring\". We took their word for it. Besides, at $12 (+tax/tip) for ONE a pool side drink, we got the idea. Eating in the fun places in Lahaina was much more of a treat anyway. A FEW TIPS AND \"AUTOMATICS\" TO KNOW... You can self park for free at any time by using 1 of 3 FREE self parking locations (2 before you reach the hotel entry and one in back near the Lahaina Tower, Spa, and Luau. We NEVER paid a dime in 10 days for valet. (It's $18 a day). There is a $25 a day resort fee. No way around it. Be prepared for that. There is an \"electronically VERY sensative\" snack tray sitting in each room. If you even breath on it or accidently bump it, you will be charged and astronomical amount for the item. We were actually warned by our hotel bell men when we arrived as he said, \"be careful of that, it's very sensative\". We actually called and had it taken out. They will do that. If interested, see what it would cost to get the top (9th) floor. We truly enjoyed where we were and though we did not get the prime, ocean views, overlooking the fabulous grounds, we still had a quiet area looking over the vast Lahaina area, a pretty decent ocean view, and mountains.

The grounds were very lovely with all the plants, trees, flowers & birds. We stayed in a partial ocean view room that was more than adequate. It had a small walk-in closet with a safe that accomodated my 15.4\" laptop without any problem. Our room had robes although our friend's room didn't. There was a fridge for our own use as well as a mini-bar fridge. They had a large tray of snacks in the room that would be added to your room if you desired (we didn't need to since we stopped at Costco). Our room overlooked the parking lot but still had a nice view of the ocean. The pool was beautiful & they had an area specifically for kids. One comment I would make was that the hot tub was close to the kids pool. It would be nice to have an adults only hot tub. It wasn't too much of an issue at night & the few times we were in there when there were kids they were well behaved. Another reviewer disliked the towel cards & wrist bands. We used our towel cards to get towels but never used the wrist band. Once we had our towles we didn't have to use the card we would just trade in our towels for clean ones. I had NO problem with any of this since ALL beaches in Hawaii are public... If you pay a lot of money for a resort you don't want to be competing with the general public or people from other resorts for chairs that you should have first shot at. You can self-park for free which we appreciated. If you wanted to pay for the privilege of valet you could pay for that. Yes the spaces are small & people park over the lines. We determined that it was probably the locals that didn't want their car doors banged-up... Can't blame 'em. When we were going out to the car the one time we had to park out in the far lot they shuttled all 4 of us & our gear out there in a large golf cart. That was a nice service since we had so much stuff with us. For those of you who might need to see a doctor during your stay, there is a doctor's office right in the hotel. It was quite convenient & my husband had to utilize it for a respiratory issue. I thought Dr. Heather B was great & I don't think I could have gotten my husband to go if it hadn't been right there at the resort. Our package through Costco included the Breakfast Buffet. We thought the buffet was wonderful-- even better (in a lot of ways) than on the cruise we were on the week before. Had the buffet not been included in the cost we would not have paid for it. It was quite pricey but we experienced great service in Swan Court. We enjoyed the birds flitting around & swimming in the pond. Our package with Costco took care of the daily resort fee as well. If your package doesn't I think it costs around $24/day. We ate at Umulau the night we checked in. The food we had was average at best. We didn't order drinks there. My husband & I went to Happy Hour at Japengo. The drinks I had were good (wouldn't have wanted to pay full price) & we enjoyed the appetizers we had at a discount. If you look around you can find different coupons for non-Happy Hour times. You could find one for a free calamari appetizer but the best one I found was in the Menehune Maps (got this at the Dr's Office) that if you mentioned that you saw the ad you could get 1 entree free with the purchase of another. That would make it a decent deal. One thing I would note is that we spent a lot of time away from the resort exploring other areas & beaches. I don't know that I would spend the money to stay at such a nice resort next time. i don't feel that we utilzed the resort as much as the expense....We ended-up extending our stay 4 add'l days & we moved down to Kihei to the Days Inn.

Our \"Oceanfront King\" rooms had a great view of Lanai Island and the beautiful grounds below. The atrium lobby is gorgeous, with exotic birds as well as attractive plants. The staff was generally very helpful and friendly, and especially the valet parking staff. Every time we called for the car before we left our rooms, it was waiting when we arrived at the front door. The valet staff helped mom in & out of the car and offered directions etc. The rooms were comfortable, and nicely decorated. The layout is a bit dated, with very small bathrooms but with a large dressing area and a walk-in closet. But all is not well, as there were some things that just weren't right. For example, the pass-through door to the adjacent room had obviously been forced and badly damaged sometime in the past, but the repair was amateurish; some galvanized plates from the home store installed with ill-fitting drywall screws -- like you might see at a Motel Six. By the looks of it that repair was NOT new, and why Hyatt can't do a professional repair is beyond me. We paid the full $550/night rack rate too. Other issues... throughout the hotel mahogany was used for doors and other trim; it is VERY attractive but much of it is badly weathered and needs to be renewed and varnished as it detracts from the otherwise very nicely appointed facility. Lighting is poor throughout the atrium and in the hallways of the main building, especially around the elevators. I understand wanting to be \"green\" and save energy, and I understand muted lighting to maintain the ambience. But I found it uncomfortably dark and mom (age 87) had difficulty walking through many areas. Another area that is poorly lit is the valet-parking drop-off area at the hotel main enterance. We arrived after dark, and this area was quite chaotic with cars and people coming and going in sometimes unpredictable ways. The staff here is excellent but they really need better lighting in this area after dark. And if it rains, you'll get soaked since there is no covered area at all. The signs along the approach road are attractive monument-style signs, with a floral pattern and interally illuminated. The hotel names are hard to read at night, though, since the black letters making up the hotel names are pretty small and not easy to read as you drive by. So double-check the directions before you get there if you are arriving after dark. If you have trouble with stairs, this is may not be a good resort for you. Getting to the mid-range restaurant \"Umalu\" is not possible without going up/down about 20 stairs, which was a problem for my mom. We asked staff twice about getting down there without stairs, but were told it wasn't possible. Similarly walking through the gardens there are several areas where stairs are not avoidable. So if any of your party have some difficulties with stairs, you may want to look elsewhere. We ate at the Swan Court buffet for breakfast every morning, and it was pretty good. The open-air setting is gorgeous, and the swans etc floating nearby made it very enjoyable. Unfortunately, there were dozens of very aggressive smaller birds (sparrows?) that were bothersome. I made the mistake of going back into the buffet area to get a glass of juice and by the time I got back (90 seconds?) the birds were swarmed all over my plate of food. So if you leave your food unattended, cover it with your napkin. Once we figured that out we had no more problems. Son'z at Swan Court is the dinner restaurant at the same location; we ate there once and the food was very good. Umalu is more informal, with burgers/tacos etc. The fish tacos I had were really very, very good; some of the best restaurant-bought fish tacos I've had. The seared-ahi salad was OK but not great The in-room WiFi was reasonably fast and easy to access. No additional cost for us. One thing that was a bit lacking was places to sit and read or enjoy the view that are out of the sun. There are lots of spots near the pool or beach to get some sun, but for those of us that would prefer to sit in the shade there weren't many options. But on a more positive note, the view from our room was gorgeous.... a full view of Lanai and down the coast to Lahaina. There was a nice table outside on the covered patio that made it easy to sit and enjoy the view. The housekeeping staff was efficient and friendly too. So there you have it; great view rooms at a very attractive resort with a helpful staff. A little bit of varnish on the woodwork and some attention to lighting in some areas would help.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corydon", "Title": "\u201cFirst trip to Hawaii - 4 star facility, 3 star service\u201d", "Author": "Brian K", "ReviewID": "UR122332319", "Content": "The Hyatt on Maui was the third resort we stayed at on our recent trip to Hawaii. Read my reviews of the Halekulani on Oahu (an awesome 5 resort) and the Fairmont Orchid (great grounds and hotel but lacking on service) on the bid island to compare and contrast. The Hyatt is located at the start (or end depending on your perspective) of Kaanapali Beach). It's a big resort with lots of rooms and since we were there over the December holidays it was very busy. The grounds were nice and they had some unusual features. They had penguins (yes penguins) at the resort as well as gardens with other wildlife (birds) to view, a nice touch. The pool was large and had two wateralls, a large slide and a bar under the waterfall. The pool wasn't heated though so it was cool getting into to it. The beach area is very nice and you can see some of the other islands from the beach front. There is a great walk along the beach that goes past the other resorts, some shops at whalers village and all the way to black rock for snorkeling. They have free self parking but the lot by the hotel is small so plan to walk or use the valet service ($18 a day). The room was comfortable but the hotel needs a renovation. The doors way are dinged up pretty bad from years of moving luggage in and out and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor looks a bit dated. Also, the hallway in our area smelled smokey (not sure but some of the rooms may have been smoking rooms). Also, the first day we were there it was windy and the resort lost power three times for a few minutes until the generators kicked in. We were at the restaurant by the pool when it happened the first time and were told we got the last hot plate of food for a while. In terms of service, it was OK. You need to have your expectations set first. Here are some examples. When you check in you get towel cards that you trade in for towels at the pool. One towel per person. Not the best if you want to lay on a towel and dry off with another. Plus they tell you if you lose the pool card they charge you $25. We didn't lose it so I am not sure if they enforce this or not. You get your towel card back when you turn the towel in for the day. Pool chairs were a real problem. They didn't have enough. I guess someone didn't do the math. People come out early and drop towels on chairs to stake their claim making the best chairs go quickly. They patrol the chairs and if your towels are left unoccupied for more than an hour they can be taken (they leave a tag on the chair indicating they have been by). The restaurants seem fine except for the small breakfast and coffee stand near the lobby. The two folks working there did not seem to be having a good time and it showed. The lines were long and they were trying to push you through. They ran out of food both times we stopped there so choices were very limited. Yes I know it is peak season but plan for it. It comes the same time every year. Bottomline is overall I would rate this resort around 3.5 to 4 stars. It felt like being at busy resort in Florida but with the awesome Hawaii views and weather. They have the facilities to do better but the rooms need an update and could make better use of the grounds they have available to spread things out (they have a large open area next to the North tower that could be better utilized for the guests).", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorse Than Your 8th Grade Class Trip\u201d", "Author": "sweetlifer", "ReviewID": "UR122312607", "Content": "Checking in with a confirmation # thru an agent?

The property itself is well maintained, the lobby is airy and open. It was covered in scafolding, however so hard to appreciate the full beauty of it. Pros: The overall hotel property was very nice, including the pool area. They have an awesome waterslide (yes, even for adults), that my Husband & I went on several times. The views of the beach are beautiful. There was a nice selection of restaurants with fair prices (keep in mind I am from NY though so may be consider pricey to others); good food & good drinks. There was also a great breakfast buffet (which was included in our room rate). Awesome selection and yummy food! We rented a car and it was a very nice central location. We were able to explore the island in both directions and it was a short trip to downtown Lahaina, which is a fun place to go to eat, shop and enjoy the nightlife. Cons: We booked through a travel agent who wrote \"HONEYMOON\" on every piece of our travel itinerary. Despite that, the Maui Hyatt put us in a room with 2 double beds. When we complained, the hotel staff essentially said - too bad, we don't guarantee rooms. The rooms themselves were very old, the bathroom was the worst part - small, dark and the shower barely worked. After coming from the Trump in Oahu, I was shocked by how much the Hyatt failed in comparison. When we checked out, I expressed my displeasure and was told to write a note on a piece of scrap paper. Needless to say, I never heard back from Hyatt. We travelled to the Hyatt in Kawaii after Maui and that room was world class! I think they need to lower their rates in Maui while they complete their reservations and come to terms wtih the fact that the hotel is NOT top notch. My advice - stay somewhere else! The rates are not worthy of the crappy accomodations you get in return.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hungary", "Title": "\u201cWill be Lovely Once Renovations are Complete\u201d", "Author": "lgbudapest", "ReviewID": "UR121934063", "Content": "My teenage daughter and I stayed here last week for 4 nights and we really enjoyed our stay. The lobby and reception areas are in the process of being renovated, and once this is complete - will be lovely. Right now it's a bit confusing trying to find one's way to reception, self parking etc etc. Once you know your way around - it's easy! It's a large resort with beautiful gardens, penguins, flamingoes etc. Here's my review: - Room: We had a partial ocean view room in the Lahaina Tower. Room was very spacious, well laid-out, lots of nice little touches, if a little dated in parts. Liked: dressing room, separate powder area. Comfy beds. Did not like: Overlooked the Luau area and it was noisy at night. Hallways are very dated with really old fashioned carpet. - Breakfast in Swan Court: We didn't really like the birds flying around the food and near our table, so ate here twice only even though it was included in our room rate. Servers were really only interested in the tips they would be getting. - Fitness Centre: Loved it. Great equipment, everything worked, nice touches e.g. chilled water, chilled towels, 24/7 access. - Pool Area: Loved it. Large enough to never seem crowded; no problem getting chairs; some nice touches like water coolers, ice blocks. Did not like: only allowed one pool/beach towel per person and they are very strict about this! - Self Parking: Self parking is a short walk away, probably to try to encourage people to pay for valet. It's not a problem because hotel constantly has a minivan driving between the self parking and the hotel to shuttle guests. Important note: We went for a swim in the ocean and my daughter got stung by a sea urchin, which was a nasty experience. We went straight to the pool attendants for help and they were great - did everything they could to help us. Security escorted us to on-site Doctors on Call, who were ok but not amazing - really only interested in how I was going to pay the bill.... That night ordered dinner through room service and food was good, if a little pricey. Overall - a really nice resort, great pool, lots of nice little touches.

We got a nice high room very near to the ocean front side of the hotel so we had a great view of the water. The staff here is efficient, helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and had a nice balcony. We actually overlooked the luau setting so we got a free Hula show any night we chose to sit out on the deck. Tips on this place. Skip the fancy breakfast site unless you want to get up early or stand in line for 15 minutes or longer. Instead go to the Japengo coffee bar. The fancy restaurant that is located here is not open in the a.m. so you can take out from the coffee bar and sit in the fancy restaurant any morning you choose to. You should have a car on this island. We drove north from the Hyatt to the end of the road out past the Ritz Carlton properties. Very pretty area and not crowded. We also drove up to the top of Haleakaka which in about 25 miles goes from near sea level to 10,023 feet. This is not a drive for the faint of heart. There are guardrails along almost all of the road but there are numerous curves and you must stay alert. Unlike the Heavenly Road to Hana there are quite a few turnoff or vista areas. This ride is definitely worth it. At the top, there are gorgeous views of a surreal world. You can also see the top of a mountain on the big island on a clear day. One caveat, don't do the ride if the weather is windy and rainy. You will not enjoy it nearly as much. The best tour in our opinion is the Heavenly Road to Hana. Book this through the hotel but make sure they charge you what the brochure tells you the resort quoted us $25 over the brochure price and we corrected them. Don't drive this yourself. It is much curvier and narrower than the Mt.Haleakala road. There are numerous blind curves where the road is barely 1 1/2 lanes and there are not that many turn off areas until you get to Hana. The few that exist are often totally occupied. So book a tour and enjoy your trip. Sit on the left side of the bus for the best view of the water or on the right side for the best views of land side fauna, flora and waterfalls. Do schedule a tour with lunch or take your own food. Our tour lasted 12 hours for about 70 miles of driving. The tour operators also will get you educated along the way. It is easy to miss little gems. Back to the hotel. We enjoyed the casual dinner dining around the large swimming pool. Service was fast and friendly. You can go into Lahaina for food which about 5 miles from the hotel. There are some night restaurants there. Check trip advisor before you go because there are some real dives in Lahaina. It is a town that is past its prime but still has some nice shops and restaurants. The hotel is adjacent to several other resorts. There is very good dining down at the Whaler's Villaege shopping center about a half mile north of the Hyatt. We bought some nice clothing in the shopping center and found good food and reasonable prices at Leilanis on the Beach. We ate there 3 times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. You cannot get any closer to the beach than this and the sunset views are sensational. Final comment is we would stay at the Hyatt Regency again if we returned to Maui! Be prepared for a $25 resort fee per day for amenities. This covers your high speed, a very good athletic club and more.

We just returned from a week at the Hyatt Maui and had a wonderful time. Yes, there was some construction taking place, but it didn't interfere with our enjoyment of the property and I didn't notice ANY noise from the work being done. The service at the hotel was wonderful and we were given beautiful flower leis upon our arrival and an upgrade to an ocean view room without even asking. The thing that keeps us coming back to the Hyatt is the superior design of the resort grounds. We consistently find the Hyatt to have the nicest, lushest, most verdant grounds of all the resorts in the areas we stay. The Hyatt Maui has a tropical paradise of a pool area right on the ocean. It features two waterfalls and a fun lava tube slide. Since the Hyatt is the last resort on the strip, there is less foot traffic from tourists, which is also nice. The drinks and food service at the pool are great. HINT: adults can order off the kids menu, so if you want a turkey sandwich, don't hesitate to ask. It's half the price and adult portions. The fish tacos on the regular menu are tasty, so give those a try, too. Money saver: Purchase the aqua blue refillable sports bottle at Umalu. One flat price includes unlimited refills of iced tea, soda or juice. We would rinse our bottles out each night in our room and could take them with us on day trips off the property. Our \"partial\" ocean view room (which looked onto the ocean so I'm not sure what was \"partial about it) had a walk-in closet, robes, in-room safe, and a refrigerator, which was very convenient for storing beverages and other snacks. The room appeared to be recently renovated, nicely appointed and the view from our balcony was perfection. There are three towers at the Hyatt, all with great views. (We stayed in the Napali tower and found it to be most convenient to the parking lots. If you rent a car -- which you should -- this is worth noting). The only downside to the room was the bed. While it was comfortable enough, it was a lower Asian-style platform bed that didn't have much cushion to it. Not my personal favorite of hotel beds, but I slept fine. The thing I loved was the lack of noise at night. We could leave our balcony door open and all we would hear is the ocean and the waterfall of the pool area. The Hyatt Maui is a great hotel for adults. There were not a lot of kids running around -- which was another plus in our book. We would definitely recommend the Hyatt and we will definitely be returning. LOCAL SITES TO SEE: Luau: Old Lahaina Luau. It's the most authentic and terrific food and entertainment. The food at the Hyatt's Drums of the Pacific Luau gets high marks, but the show was not very good in comparison. Local food: Try Aloha Mixed Plate. You can get luau-style food there, but if you want to drink alcohol, make sure you don't sit in the back patio. Paia Town. It's sort of a \"hippie\" town -- very laid back with lots of cute shops. While there, definitely go to the Paia Fish Market Restaurant and try the Ono grilled fish sandwich. Amazing!!! Kihei: This is where the locals live and there are some great discoveries here. Some great snorkeling, too. Surfing: We liked the Royal Surf Academy. They guarantee to get you surfing or your lesson is free. The classes were smaller than the other surf schools we saw out there. Our instructor was awesome and a lot of fun, and their photographer was shooting 10 frames per second and caught some great action shots. Lots of fun! Snorkeling: We tried different spots trying to see some turtles. The first tip is to get in the water no later than 9:30 AM. This is when turtles feed and you will see plenty. If you get there earlier, you can even see some sleeping. Black Rock was the most convenient spot to the Hyatt and we saw a huge turtle within 30 seconds of getting in the water. Kalekala: You MUST do the sunrise trip. It was worth every dime and the pain of getting up at 1:00 AM. It you haven't witnessed something majestic in life, this is it. Be prepared and pack WARM layers. You will need them, as it is freezing cold at 10,000 feet in the dark. Kaanapali Golf Course: We played the Kai course, which was nice. It wasn't the nicest golf course I've seen, but it was relaxing and enjoyable. Get an earlier start time to avoid the bustle of the tournaments.

My parents stayed here shortly after the resort first opened in the early 80s, and we took their recommendation of staying here over someplace else in Maui. So glad that we did! Check in was quick, which was a welcome relief after the wait we endured at our hotel in Waikiki. Immediately after hearing that it was our honeymoon, we were provided with several goodies, including a voucher for a free bottle of wine and welcome leis. Our Oceanfront Room was perfect, at the far end of the hallway on the 8th floor in the Napili tower - quiet, spacious, and a spectacular view of the Pacific and the island of Molokai! Although the dark wood throughout the hotel is a sign of it being an older property, the amenities and service make up for its age. Although this isn't an \"adults only\" property, there are clearly areas of the resort that are more geared towards adults than families with children. We only spent time at the Lahaina pool as opposed to the Napili pool, which also put us closer to the Umalu bar for lunch time. Poolside drink service appeared to only be available at the Lahaina pool, and the Grotto Bar also isn't child friendly. We opted to slurge on the private oceanfront dining for our last night, and the food, scene, and service were worth every penny that we spent on it! Although many people complained about loosing pool chairs after leaving them vacant for over an hour, I actually really appreciate that the pool staff does monitor chair usage. It definitely helps make it easier to go someplace else on the island in the morning, and then still find chairs at the pool in the afternoon. My husband and I are huge sushi fans, and had a very disappointing sushi experience while in Waikiki. However, we ate at Japengo our first night in Maui, and were so blown away from their rolls that we ate there a second time during our stay. We also highly recommend the luau, especially paying the extra money for the VIP luau seats, which allowed us to enjoy more time at the pool that afternoon and less time waiting in line for the regular seats. I could go on and on about how positive our stay here was. Despite the fact that scaffolding for the renovations was up and blocked some of the view from the atrium out to the ocean, it didn't really bother us since we spent so much time outside as opposed to inside the atrium. Parking was also tight, but when space is at a premium, what else can you really expect? Maybe that's the big city side of me coming out, who is used to tight parking garages and being aggressive about acquiring parking spaces. The only bad part of our stay at the Hyatt was having to leave and return to reality.

Anyone can park there regardless of whether or not they are staying at the hotel. We called the hotel security and he was very unsymathetic to what happened.

The hotel itself is built in an atrium-style, so there is a large, open-air courtyard in the center. In the courtyard there were tropical plants and flowers, Koi ponds, parrots on giant copper rings, tropical penguins, indigenous cultural statues, etc. Outside of the hotel (but on the grounds) the pool was large, perfect temperature, and had plenty of seating, different depths, a grotto, a poolside bar, and a roped-off kiddy pool. Only steps away from the pool is a strip of beach where the sand was soft, the water was warm and chunks of coral reef were regularly washing up. I did see sharks (plural) a couple of times during my 5-day stay, and they weren't too far off the shore (10-20 ft away). There are also quite a few great little shops, with all you need for souvenirs or drinks, snacks, and toiletries. Although mostly on the more pricey side, the dining was really great! I went on my honeymoon, and my husband and I had breakfast in swan court twice. The meals were filling, fresh and delicious, and the view was awesome. Swan court is a medium-sized, open-air restaurant that opens up to a view of a large pond with white and black swans, a waterfall, tropical vegetation, and the beach. Soothing and beautiful. My husband and I visited Japengo twice, and the views are amazing (swimming pool, waterfalls, ocean) and the food was very modern, creative, aesthetically pleasing, and delicious. Great drinks, too! Now for my dislikes: Our dislikes generally were with the room itself. We got a partial-ocean view room, and the view from the lanai was great, so that wasn't a problem. The bed and pillows were also very comfortable. Unfortunately, the walls were very thin, and my husband and I were forced to wake up to (and hear) every word a man and his apparent mistress were arguing, and then some. Cringe. Also, on the days that my husband and I opted for room service, I realized upon coming back to the freshly made bed that the mattress did not have a fitted sheet on it (just a regular flat sheet, tucked in) which would come untucked throughout the night. Also, the lightweight down comforter was not in a duvet. It was simply tucked between two sheets and folded back. When that got moved around throughout the night, the stained comforter was hanging out and was a bit yucky (which is why it should be contained in a duvet). The toilet, bathtub, and bathroom door were all a bit too close, so the floor plan in that sense was poorly designed. Lastly, we were confined to seating on the bed, because the couch had very questionable white, crusty stains all over it. Yuck. That aside, overall it was a great, beautiful and romantic spot.

If you continue along further on the boardwalk you will find Black Rock with a great beach and snorkeling. The hyatt rooms were clean and comfortable and perfect for two people. There was a small fridge to store some snacks and waters in the room. The town of Lahaina is a five minute drive from the hotel where you can spend a great day shopping and seeing the sites of the town. If you like to golf like we do the Hyatt is across the street from the Kaanapali Golf resort that has two fabulous courses to choose from. The construction at the hotel was not a bother. Yes the lobby was located upstairs and there was parts of the main walk through that were roped off, but it was really not a bother. The work did not start early in the morning and stopped prior to you being back in your room to get changed for dinner. It was our honeymoon and they provided some nice gifts including a bottle of champagne with one of our dinners (we enjoyed it at Japengo restaurant).

The Hyatt hotels on Kauai and Oahu were amazing. The Maui Hyatt is not. We leave during the day just to get away from here.

The lobby construction was apparently planned, but they found cracks around the outside of the building which needed emergency repair. We hear the construction during the day. There is a penguin exhibit under scaffolding. The penguins are hiding in a corner shaking. It's very sad!!!! We were never warned of the construction. 2. Pool chairs are pushed together in rows, like sardines. It's really odd. You can't slide between chairs to lay down...you have to get on from the front of the chair and inch back. 3. They have turned the back service entrance into the lobby entrance because of the lobby construction. 4. We have to park in a self park area which has parking spots the size of golf carts...because that's what they're for. 5. Self parking lot is dark and dangerous. Employee told me that's where they park and they've been requesting lighting for years, but management has done nothing. He also says there have been car thefts because of the lighting. 6. The view from our hotel room is of a cemetery. 7. There is a crazy amount of birds that fly into the breakfast restaurant. I'm talking hundreds. They sit watching you and fly under your table to get crumbs. If you leave your seat for a second, they swarm your food. They have green fake owls as a lame attempt to keep them away, but the birds actually land on them. 8. Rooms are outdated. 9. Low water pressure. 10. There is no beach. 11.

It seems unreasonable that not only Is there noisy construction going on, but you're forced to spend $18 a day to valet your car when the undersized self parking lot is full. And even worse, while talking to some other guests, their parking was comped the whole trip! We booked a \"partial ocean view\" room, which consisted of a corner room, over looking a parking lot. When we called to discuss, we were told that partial ocean view is only 25% ocean view. Now I'm now math major, but this room was not even close to that. We were moved twice before finally having to ask for an upgrade to a deluxe ocean view. Which they accommodated, for an extra charge per night! I asked the person at the desk if she could take care of this for us and she told me \"Not if she planned on having a job tomorrow.\" SERIOUSLY, the Hyatt Corporation is going to fire you for putting the guests first?

They also had a Relaxation Area once your treatment was over which offered comfy lounge chairs with windows overlooking the ocean. It was so quiet and you could sit there and listen to the waves crashing. If you have the money in your budget then this is well worth it. We dined in their new restaurant Japengo. It was amazing.

We stayed for a couple of nights in early September as we were breaking up our time between Wailea and K'pali. The Hyatt is a wonderful property and one of the first on K'pali. Unfortunately it's at the more rocky end and the immediate beach access is not good. But with a little walking you have the entire sandy Kaanapali Beach at your feet. The one thing people are not posting in their review...and I am not sure why is the \"Kaanapali Perfume\" and how it is so awful at this end near the Hyatt. We deem the smell \"stink fish\" cause its just that bad. If you can get past that then you are good...mind you it's not just this hotel, but many areas of Kaanapali...so I recommend staying up at Kapalua or head down to Wailea. Yes the hotel was under construction even back in early September. We were NOT advised of this (we booked direct with the hotel and used my Hyatt points). However since it was the beginning stages and the tarp had just gone up we were not too disturbed...however, it was rather unfortunate that the great view of the ocean from the lobby was hindered but I do understand that they need to do their rennovations during the low season. AND that this property is in dire neeed of updating...it will be worth it in the end. We were on the concierge level in the Atrium tower. It is worth getting a room that gives you access to their club lounge as the breakfast there alone is well worth it..plus you get killer views from the lounge.

Prior to going I'd read the reviews of the current construction and got extremely apprehensive about staying there. I then spent hours researching other options and finally concluded that it was still most convenient to be at the Hyatt since my conference was there. Yes, there is construction and some drapes over parts of the stupendous atrium lobby, AND, it is IN-significant. The whole hotel/resort is GORGEOUS. Beautiful layout, with parrots, koi swimming in pools in several areas. The large waterfalls and gardens are so soothing. Beautiful marble antique statues are tastefully placed along the public spaces, it felt a little like a private museum. The huge swimming pool has at least three large, natural looking waterfalls that are better than many massages if you just stand under them for a couple of minutes. In another area I just floated on my back with massive Bougainvillea hanging over the water, brilliant flowers against the blue sky. A stranger swam by and asked me if this wasn't the best pool I'd ever been in? I said, 'yes'. Even with the construction. The Hotel is still possibly one of the nicest, most spacious and elegant hotels I've been to for a long time. Since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hawaii, the lobby area is very open and is mostly just a way to get from one area to another. There are many other areas to hang out it. When I arrived I was astounded at how fabulous it was, since I was prepared to find another hotel. And that some of the other comments were SO negative. The bathrooms were fine. the sink and counter is outside the shower and toilet area. We were first located in the Nepili Tower. If you are seeking greater quiet, I recommend the inner side of the either tower. If have children it might be more convenient to be in Nepili, since closer to childrens part of pool. We moved to the Lahaina tower since the ballroom/meeting room was there. The view (delux ocean view room) was astounding, every day I was filled with gratitude at being there. Hearing the ocean waves and the waterfalls in the gardens and the view below of the pink flamingos, swans, other birds, flowing water in the gardens. The outer side of that tower will hear the nightly luao (ends about 8pm though). The view from that side is of nice mountains. The Japango restaurant was excellent. and yes, it is a Hyatt so all is probably a bit more expensive than other hotels. I bought breakfast groceries on way in. So indulgent to eat out on balcony each morning overlooking the waterfalls, gardens and ocean! The poolside restaurant was also fabulous, I had Jerk ahi tuna over salad w pecans almost every day. I wanted to try something else, yet it was so delicious I kept getting the same thing. The comments about the staff sounded a bit contrived to me before I went, like they were too good. And, that really was my experience, as well. The bellmen, front desk people, waiters, most everyone seemed to be genuinely happy to be working there. They were so helpful and nice. This was also the case in several stores we visited in the town near the airport. I think people are happy living in Maui and then working in the Hyatt. As to the construction, yes I could hear it if I walked thru the lobby between 8-5, yet, at the pool it was negligible, only once in a while did i even remember that they were doing construction! the poolside musician was also easy and low key. I often dislike music in public spaces, and I did actually like this. There were many places to lie down, I always found empty chaise lounges, which seemed different from other posts here. there were several areas I selected where I could only here the ocean or waterfall rather than music or any construction noise. And, the hotel was sold out for some days of our conference. the beach was also totally fine. sandy right into water about 30 feet to the left of Lahaina tower (if you are facing the ocean), where they rented the snorkels, which I did three times. Best in morning before the waves stir up more sand. I put my head down in waist deep water, started to swim and saw about 30 big 2' silver fish with blue stripes and tons of others. later in day I saw fewer fish right there. they say its better at the black rock reef, I just ran out of time. Turtles too just another 300' further to the left. the beaches are surprisingly empty except for people walking. further down the strip it gets wider and there were more people laying on beach.

The room was phenomenal...we were in a full ocean view room above the main pool and the room was massive with couch and tv and a great balcony. We spent the first day at the hotel pool, which is very nice, but it can be difficult to find a chair to lay on and there is NO real beach to lay out on here. Even after our research this was still a disappointment, but we ended up taking advantage of the great Kaanapali beach walk that is a mile walk along all the resort hotels in Kaanapali...we ended up sitting on the great beaches in front of the Westin and our favorite beach, Black Rock in front of the Sheraton (about a mile walk from Hyatt on the \"beach walk\"). It was a nice stroll, but not fun to do multiple times a day on a relaxing vacation. We're very active and even we got sick of walking far for a nice beach. The restaurant by the pool is ridiculously expensive, dont eat or drink here. Walk to Whalers Village and have a nice meal at Hula Grill or leilanis. The hotel grounds were fun to walk around, flamingos, penguins and other animals all over.

We went immediately to the concierge and they told us they estimate how much they think we will charge to the room per night, and they pre-charge you that amount!

We booked the trip through a travel service back in April after extensive research (including reading several positive reviews on TA). I had been following the reviews indicating that tarps were up and construction forthcoming. Then, three days before we left, my travel agent emailed me warning of construction starting right before we arrive. Looking at some of the negative reviews on TA since the construction started, we decided to cut our stay at the Hyatt short and move to South Maui for the second half of our trip. We had enough activities planned to keep up away from the hotel in the beginning. We were trying to keep an open mind but I am definitely glad we made this decision. Let me start by saying that the grounds at the Hyatt are beautiful. They are lush and tropical with flowers and birds of all sorts and waterfalls. From what I could see of the tarp-covered lobby, it looked like it was beautiful as well with a fish pond and dark wood and apparently penguins that were on temporary vacay due to the construction. There also are a ton of shops at the Hyatt for browsing or picking up gifts. During our stay we walked around to the other hotels on the strip and felt the Hyatt definitely was the most beautiful. Unlike several others we encountered, we were aware of the construction when we arrived. Many others arrived and had no idea and didn't learn until check in, which I think is unacceptable. We also were pleasantly surprised at check in when we were offered a room upgrade to the Regency floor in the Atrium tour and a credit for the inconvenience of the construction without even asking. I thought this was a nice touch and they seemed very accomodating about it. The woman who checked us in did say that she had \"no idea\" how loud the construction is because she apparently isn't there during the day (we checked in at night), which seemed a bit disingenuous. We thought this was a good start to the trip but then the next morning while we were trying to relax at the pool, the construction started. It was constant jackhammering and drilling and really killed the ambiance at the pool. You also have to walk right past it from the lobby and down some make-shift stairs before you get to the pool. I know they were trying to address it by having live music but it really didn't help. I could even hear it through my ipod at full blast, and I didn't really want to block out the sound of the rolling ocean with blasting music. It was really quite unfortunate as the pool set up with the pool side restaurant Umalu is quite nice. You could relax by the pool and order food and drinks. The construction also could clearly be heard in our room on the top floor of the Atrium tour. I would strongly recommend people looking into this hotel before the construction is complete to seriously reconsider if peace and quiet near the pool is something you are hoping for. And, definitely request one of the other towers. To address some of the other comments I have seen consistently on the board: The rooms are defintely nothing to write home about and the tray on the counter over the mini fridge is outright ridiculous. It is way bigger than it needs to be and takes up any usable space. I triggered a charge just trying to move it over to make room for some snacks we brought. One positive is that they give you an empty fridge to store your own goodies. The bathroom was small but no smaller than our S. Maui hotel so maybe this is the norm. There was a huge closet and lots of drawer space. I am used to a low bed but I can see how this could be a bit uncomfortable for some. We had a similar type of bed in S. Maui too so again maybe this is some Hawaii norm. The lanai is a tad small, not enough room to really move around but given the construction noise, we didn't use it at all. Our room was deluxe ocean view and the only view of the ocean was from craning our head around from our lanai. If you want to see the ocean from your room you need to book ocean front. Self parking is a hassle. The spots are so ridiculously small that we gave up after a few nights because the stress of getting in and out of the spots (in our compact convertible) wasn't worth it. Also, with the luau going on, if you don't look for a spot before 4 p.m. or after 9 p.m. you are unlikely to find anything. When we moved to S. Maui the hotels had much larger parking spots and one reserved for people that they could access with their room key, keeping it for guests only. Swan Court. We liked the breakfast at the Swan court. It was plentifull but did get a bit boring after 6 mornings. We always arrived before 7:30 a.m. and didn't have to wait for a table. We would see lines, sometimes really long, as we were leaving. Definitely look for a package with breakfast included or go somewhere else. I wouldn't pay $30/person for the buffet. The service is good if not a little rushed. The view is quite pretty. We ate at Umalu one night and Japengo another. Both were good with good service. The guys at the bar at Umalu are super friendly. The few days we went to the pool, we didn't encounter a problem getting pool chairs. We went after breakfast and there we chairs. This could be due to the fact that sitting at the pool was quite unpleasant due to the construction and perhaps people were spending their days elsewhere. I can say that Sunday, when the Hyatt indicated there would not be any construction, the pool was crowded but we still found spots. If you wait until the afternoon, it was a little more difficult. A few comments about the pool -- the chairs are super close to one another. It is hard to walk around them and you are practically on top of others. We noticed this was the case at most hotels but the Hyatt layout made it look more difficult to move around. Also, there are very few umbrellas so there is very little shade. Definitely bring a sun hat because we did notice that the chairs under umbrellas were the ones taken first. Lastly, a lot of the chairs face onto the beach walk. I find this unpleasant as the beach walk is quite narrow and crowded. Your view of the ocean is blocked by the for-rent cabanas along the \"beach\" and people are constantly walking past you. In this regard, the Hyatt seemed to have the least amount of property to set up chairs as the other hotels along the strip. Also, as others mentioned, there is no real beach at the Hyatt. There is a very small one near the spa or you otherwise have to walk down to the Westin/Sheraton. At the end of the day, if you are considering staying in Kaanapali, the Hyatt could be a great hotel if you keep in mind some of the annoyances (small spots, lines later at breakfast and little shade). But definitely keep in mind the construction when making your determination; it really detracts from the overall experience.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cThis was not a typical Hyatt experience AT ALL\u201d", "Author": "happysun16", "ReviewID": "UR120308043", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights after taking the south road back from Hana.

Like some of the other reviewers, we were only made aware of renovations when we checked in. What a mess. Tarps and noise everywhere. It is too bad, because some of the animals (like the penguins that have been removed) would have been fun to see. It is interesting that this 'emergency renovation' had to be done right before busy season. Our partial ocean view room was a room with a view of the self parking lot. When you went outside and looked to the side from the balcony you could see the ocean. Not cool. I thought about complaining or asking about a better room, but seeing as though we were only here for 2 nights, and knew we'd be drinking on one of them we didn't bother. The valet parking was on the extreme opposite side of the hotel from where our room was, so we decided to self park (the lot was directly underneath our room). Driving the south road from Hana was a piece of cake compared to the self parking. The situation is absolutely unacceptable. We had to wait for a tiny tight spot. While we were parking we saw one car hit another while trying to get into a spot. Not ok. The Hyatt should be offering complementary valet (at least for the rooms on the side of the hotel close to the valet) if there aren't sufficient self parking spaces. There are 2 different check out times on the back of the door of the room (11 and 12). When we called to see if we could push it to 1 or so (my boyfriend is gold passport at the Hyatt), we got told NO, checkout is 11. Ok then. The bright spots at this hotel were the buffet breakfast (we had a 2 for 1 with our room rate) and the Japengo restaurant where the sushi was outstanding (we ate there both nights). I have been to many other fabulous Hyatts (Toronto, Lake Tahoe, Singapore etc etc). This hotel did not provide a Hyatt experience. Seriously it felt like we were at the Motel 6...

Ka'anapali is a good location - more chilled out than Lahaina, with a great beach, but you're only 10 minutes drive away if you want to take advantage of the shops and restaurants in Lahaina. Hyatt is at one end of the Ka'anapali beachfront strip. There is quite a nice beach close by (outside the spa) or you can do a 15-20 minute walk to the Black Rock area for the main Ka'anapali beach. Whaler's Village (with shops and restaurants) is a similar distance. We used the self-parking exclusively while we were there and we always found it very easy to find a space (other reviewers didn't, maybe October is quiet). It was a short walk from there to the main hotel. Our room (partial ocean view with king bed) was a good size, had good facilities and was nice and clean. You get free wi-fi and free local calls which is handy for confirming any trips or bookings you might have made before coming. The resort area is very pretty with lots of water features, swans, flamingos etc. The pool is big and has a great water slide. The cocktails at the Umalu bar are nice (and can be sipped by the pool) and the singers were always good. Very relaxing! We found the restaurants okay but thought that there were nicer places along the strip (Tropica was our favourite). The breakfast buffet is great but it's quite expensive - if it hadn't been included in our room rate I don't think I would have paid the $30 per person each day (plus tip). All in all, if you normally go for 3 or 4 star hotels like us but want a bit of luxury for a special occasion, I think you'll like the Hyatt - just be prepared that everything, from the mandatory \"resort fee\" to the food and drinks - is expensive, so even if you get a good deal on the room rate, you will end up paying more than you think! Now the bad news - as other reviewers note, the hotel is undergoing fairly hefty reconstruction at the moment and says it will do so until December. Various parts of it have been shuffled around and there is loud construction noise at various points throughout the day. I remember sitting by the pool with a singer and a loud pneumatic drill in the background. The poor singer almost gave up.

This was our first visit to Hawaii to celebrate our anniversary. Since I read here on T.A. very conflicting reports from recent readers, I want to be very specific here and truthfully state what I saw & experienced . Firstly, readers ladydi of 11/6/11 and sulunz of 10/31/11 were right on, accurate ! Sorry Renee N of Honolulu but I believe you are either a \"shill\" or somehow tied into this hotel or perhaps stayed out a little too much in the sun. When we checked in, after 2 long flights from New York, we were then advised for the FIRST TIME that there was some repair work being done at the hotel but it wasn't noisy or disruptive. Note: we were NEVER advised beforehand of any renovations <including hotel's Reservation Reminder sent 1 week before our arrival or in my conversations/emails with hotel's concierge.> I add, I am a Hyatt Gold Passport Member and have stayed in some of their 5-star properties worldwide. Please note, I estimate this construction started after Oct.15th from what a hotel employee told me so of course T.A. readers who stayed here before then did not have to deal with construction. Hotel stated in writing upon arrival that work will last \"until approximately December 20th to complete\". I wouldn't bet on that !! Being tired from our travel, we checked into our Ocean-Front Deluxe Room on a High Floor in the Atrium Wing <most desirable wing for ocean-views, central location, etc.>. After immediately hearing loud noises, which I'll get to, we debated on changing hotels but didn't want to go through the hassle. So, the reason we left the hotel during the day is because this is what you have here: -The Main Entrance to the hotel is blocked off by fences, etc. and looks like a contruction site, which it is. -We could loudly hear from our terrace and ALL OVER THE POOL area most of the time, 9am-4pm the almost constant noise of heavy-duty power saws and occasional sound of sledge-hammers and get this <which I observed> a large pneumatic or hydraulic jackhammer mounted on an excavator !!! I add, there is no beach in front of hotel to sit on anyway. -The very pretty <main> Atrium Lobby is completely shut down, except for minimal safety lighting. -Renee N forgot to mention that to drive to the hotel entrance now being used, you must first pass the hotel's loading docks, not very pretty !! -There's a lot more I can add, including the 2-story ugly temporary staircase that leads to the pool, huge tarps covering parts of the hotel, \"hardhats\" <nice guys doing their job> can be seen working on hotel floors and other areas, and MORE !!!!!! -I add, some other guests we spoke to during our stay felt exactly the way we did. Of course we tried to make the best of our stay and thankfully the next hotel on our trip was the Koa' Kea Hotel & Resort on Kauai which was heavenly. -So, I say farewell here by quoting the late Groucho Marx: \"Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes\".......", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGlad we relocated\u201d", "Author": "ladydi2109", "ReviewID": "UR120215828", "Content": "We were originally booked at the Hyatt after reading reviews of the resort for years and looking forward to our stay. Days before our departure, which was Oct. 28th, I read on this forum that there were major rennovations being done to the hotel. This did not sit well with us, as we were anticipating a week of relaxation. We called our travel consultant, Maui Kay (mauikay.com) and she was able to relocate us at the Westin. During our stay we walked down to the Hyatt to see if we made the right decision in relocating. We agreed that we did. The main lobby is full of plastic tarps and construction workers. The animals were non-existant. There were two flights of make shift stairs leading down to the pool area (although I'm sure they had elevator access somewhere). There was constuction noise and the pools seems crowded and noisy. The decor inside the Atrium where the shops were was elegant looking. Lots of wood. Fancy shops and expensive stores. The Swan Court looked out to a lagoon that seemed dirty. It was far from being ocean front. The word \"stuffy\" came to mind while touring the inside of the hotel. We are in our mid 50's and thought the place was outdated and boring. I can't speak of the rooms, as we did not view them. We did attend the luau there and were pleasantly surprised. The show was teriffic and the food was good. Be advised that the drinks offerred by the servers on a tray were watered down, but you can ask the server for something else, seemingly free of charge. Several people at our table had wine and other mixed drinks and I don't recall seeing them paying for them. The picture they take of you upon arrival cost $20 and you get a shell lei. The flower leis are a good deal at $5. Several people we spoke to during our week on Maui who were staying at the Hyatt were very disappointed with the construction and said they would not have stayed there had they known about it.

Our room was in a tower all the way back in the hotel and was actually pretty nice. We had a comfortable Kind bed and a small seating area with a couch. Our balcony offered a view of the sea, but also of the Luau area. This means you get to enjoy the Luau every night if you happen to be in your room (and even with closed doors it's very loud).

The pool was certainly big enough, but around 12 o' clock the sunbeds seem to run short. Getting a towel with a towel card feels a bit like a hassle, especially since they require you to wear a wristband after you get your towel. There's not much of a beachfront, you have to walk over to the Marriott for a somewhat larger beach.

Hopefully the fix-ups will be done soon. The hotel itself is obviously older, but is so extensive and the grounds so pretty that ultimately it doesn't really matter. Many, if not most, hotels are like this in Hawai'i at any rate...the beautiful scenery takes center stage. Very good service, from front desk to maids to restaurant staff; all attentive, welcoming and friendly. The pools and grounds are very nice with waterfalls and much tropical foliage. Well defined and really fun kids' area keeps other areas mostly adult-oriented. Grotto bar and pool slide add interest, and there is a fair choice in restaurants, although it'll cost you a pretty penny to eat there, eg. two burgers and onion rings at U'malu = $50, two plates of pasta at Swan Court with tip = $85 (no drinks!).

Constant jack hammering, cutting, and pounding from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. daily was simply unacceptable. We actually left the resort 6 out of 7 days because of the noise. No refunds, discounts or adjustments were offered. I honestly expect more from Hyatt but they obviously do not care about their customers.

Breakfast was included with our package and even though it was good it lacked change and imagination on a daily basis.

It was activated by movement and we had to constantly be careful not to bump it when getting into the mini-fridge or placing things on the counter near the bathroom.

It wasn't too obtrusive. The pool is fantastic and the main water slide was pretty fun. WiFi was included (nice!) and parking was free. However, there are a very limited amount of spaces and if you did not get a space then you had to pay $18 for valet. There was also a $25/night resort fee. The hotel's \"beach\" access was pretty pathetic. The waves pretty much came right up to the grassy areas and there really wasn't much room for sitting on the beach. The water area was pretty rocky and full of sharp stones and coral. It wasn't very pretty or accessible. We ended up walking about 1/2 mile down the path to the Westin section of the beach.

Common Areas -- the lobby & interior landscape is a great example of an open-air courtyard that fits Maui well. Just off the lobby is a nice, small outdoor bar with a great view overlooking the main pool & ocean. Great place for afternoon happy hour! Fitness Center -- very nice, sizable facility with plenty of cardio machines, free weights & other equipment. They also have refrigerated towels, fruit-flavored water and the cardio machines overlook the ocean. There is also a walking/running path along the ocean that fronts several other resorts -- this is great, but also very busy. Pools -- a couple pools, with a water slide, water fall, basketball hoop, and swim-up bar. The pools are also quite busy, and it can be difficult to get a couple lounge chairs next to the pool. Restaurant -- if you can get a package that includes the breakfast buffet at Swan Court, this is a great all-inclusive breakfast.

For our honeymoon we wanted a nice hotel in Maui. Well the Hyatt was the farthest thing from it! We were orginally booked at the Sheraton down the road, however we came across a sale at the Hyatt so decided to rebook there. Upon arriving there was construction everywhere which we were never informed about. If we had know about the construction we would have never stayed. Upon trying to checking in at 11am we were told they no longer had any king beds and we would have a room with two double beds because they are completely sold out. We are a honeymoon couple we did not want to see two beds in our room! I was very unpleased because I had called to recomfirm our reservation in an oceanview room with a king bed each day for three days before our arrival. I was ever willing to wait for a room until check in time to get a king bed, they told us they would not have one so we had no choice but to take this room. The girl at the desk did nothing to make us feel better about having to have two beds. The funny thing about this is they did have king beds because we met people that checked in later that day that got a king bed. Our view of our room was a nice one of the ocean and the sounds of saws and loads of construction. We never even used our balcony or opened the window because that was not what we wanted to hear on my honeymoon in Hawaii! The stay here just went downhill from there. We tried to use the pool the next day and were made to wear wrist bands like we were at a carnival. They advertise there \"swim-up\" pool bar or should I saw their swim up to the stairs and get out of the pool bar. Its false advertisement. The drinks were outrageously priced and to get towels was a nightmare! We were given four towel cards that allow you to turn in one card for a towel. We were there for 4 days and there was 2 of us, are we suppose to share one towel a day?! Apparently, because when we went to get a towel after our short time at the overcrowded pool the guy working there told us we could only have one unless we had another card which we did not because it was in our room. My husband being the great man he is gave me the towel to walk back to the room and he walked back wet and cold. The next day we decided we would venture out to a beach away from the hotel since the one in front of the hotel is not really a beach. Well after walking 10 minutes to our car I forgot to get towels so we drove around to stop at the front desk for towels. When I asked for towels they told me I could go get them at the pool (at least a 20 minute walk) with my towel card. I asked if they could just give me two for the day so i did not have to walk up to my room to get towel cards and then to the pool to get towels. I would have given them my room number but without hesitation I got a no. I told them to forget it and we would just go buy towels. After a lovely day away from the hotel upon arriving back they had closed the parkign lot in the back of the hotel where we had been parking. Now forced to park in the valet lot but did not have to valet the car. Well after driving around for 30 minutes to find a spot and walking 20 minutes back to our room we decided to order a bottle or champagne. Well like everything else the girl told me they would get it to us when they had time because it was not a rush. Wow now that's some customer service! About an hour later we got our champagne which we couldn't even enjoy on our balcony. It was an awful stay and that isn't even everything that happened. We have stayed at motels with better treatment and less accomodations. After staying here we will never stay at another Hyatt ever! Our entire stay felt like we were inconviencing the employees by being there. The staff is nothing but rude, inconsiderate and non-empathetic. I have worked in hotels, restaurants, car rentals and as a travel agent I know customer service and they could have at any point listened to my fustration and turned my mind about them around. However, we just left there with a terrible taste in my mouth and will never recommend this hotel to anyone. I wish we had stuck with the Sheraton.

I work for the 4th largest engineering and construction company in North America... and I travel for work. We have corporate accounts with Hyatt, Westin and a few others... The Hyatt Regency Maui was one of the worst experiences of my life. It's so bad.. that I will never stay at one again. Here it is.... About 3 weeks ago I made reservations for 10 nights. Partial ocean view room with a King Size bed. We arrived at about 11 pm from our flight, and here is what we got. 1. They changed our reservations to two double beds, and claimed that my wife and I booked two double beds instead of a king size. At first I was slightly annoyed, as they tried to pin the blame on me.... but at the same time there was another couple beside us that was facing the same issue. EVEN... if it was my fault (which I highly doubt that I would book to double beds with my wife)... they forgot the single golden rule (customer is always right)... they should have humored me... try to make it a little better. But they did nothing... they just blamed us... and the other married couple beside us. 2. Once when they stated that the hotel was fully booked and they could accomodate a us with a king size bed... I left the situation alone until the concierge hands me this piece of paper with my room key that explained that they were doing construction everyday from 9am to 4pm. It made sense now what they changed our king size room... they were probably fixing most of the place for the busy December season. I am so mad at the fact that they did NOT tell me about the construction while I was making my reservation... or email me this update anytime prior to showing up. REDICULOUS. I checked out the very next morning as the sounds of saws and jack hammers was not what I was expecting from a $330 / night room... plus.. the main lobby area was covered in scaffolding... oh, and also, the valet was at the back corner of the hotel. It took us about 10 minutes to walk to our room. So in the end... I checked into the Westin down the street, and here is what the Hyatt missed out on... $330 / night @ 10 nights = $3300 Beach cabana @ $55/day = $550 Breakfast @ $45 / day = $450 Drinks by the beach $50 / day = $500 Valet @ $20 / day = $200 Grand total for just this one trip = $5000 (approx.)

Great happy hour btw-the Mai Tai's rocked! The bartenders are awesome. We vacationed with our kids who loved the pool and water slides. My fav was the waterfalls. TIPS- -Order the Italian Pie at Umalu with an order of onion rings for lunch. -Go to Japengo for dinner and sit in the bar's lounge out by the Tiki torches. We ordered the kids meals, some rolls and had four beers. We were happy with the value. The waitress even took the time to explain to our kids what they were eating. -Take time to explore the hotel's landscape and museum artifacts. -Smile, a lot! -Say Aloha and Mahalo to the staff. -Don't swim in front of the hotel without shoes on. -Sit, stay, and watch the sunset from the pool with a Mai Tai. -Go down the water slide at least once. -Get an ocean view room.

The same can be said of any one of the resorts at this location, so I would definitely find the best deal. It is within walking distance to the Whaler's Village--but it's sort of a long walk--3/4 of a mile?--and there aren't many eateries there. I got a very decent rate online for the room; however, once we got there, we quickly realized that feeding a family of four at the hotel would be ridiculously expensive. The breakfast buffet, for example, was $30 a person, which would have been $120 for all of us. For breakfast. And--there were no low-cost options. We ended up eating in town for every single meal, which was a bit of a hassle, as we would have to wait for our car, tip the valet guy, etc. Then there is about a 20 minute drive to the town. The prices for drinks at the bar were also ridiculous. No big deal--the town was quite charming--but I wanted to mention the price in case a family (like ours) thinks that because they find a good deal on the rooms that this will be an affordable place to stay. It's not--unless you stock up your mini-fridge, which is completely do-able. There were also all sorts of fees added to our bill (ie parking, resort fees, etc.) so count on adding about $60 per night to whatever rate you think you are getting. As others have mentioned, the hotel has this huge contraption with candy bars and snacks in the bathroom that takes up most of your counter space. It is weight controlled, so if you or your kids so much as touch it, you will be charged. This was laughable. It sort of looks like a spring-loaded trap. But hey--it's still paradise!

If I had written this review half-way during the trip, I would have given it a \"perfect\" rating. A couple of things have happened that just miss the mark for me, but overall the hotel stay has been great. First, we are staying in a Deluxe Oceanfront View room. That's the best part of the stay for us. We are on the 20th floor and have a fabulous view. We've stayed in the Westin a couple of times and the Fairmont Kea Lani, too. By far, this is the best room view. It truly is the closest room to the ocean that we have stayed in plus we have a great view of the pool. I kept hearing about the smallness of the room. Maybe because we expected the worst, we were happily surprised. The room isn't huge like the Kea Lani, but I think it's bigger than the Westin. The room is a normal hotel room size. I will mention (because I was interested) that a refrigerator is in the room that has the minibar stuff, but they also supply another empty refrigerator. A huge tray with food in it to purchase takes up a ton of room in the bathroom, It's bolted to the piece of furniture in there and you can't move the food or it automatically charges you. We could have used the extra space, but it hasn't been horrible. I think the beds have been fine as far as comfort. The breakfast buffet was included in our rate (and many others as well from what we could tell). It's an okay buffet, but we did get tired of the same things day in and day out. I loved the Fairmont's breakfast buffet so it's hard to compare anything to that. Again, I don't mean to sound petty. It hasn't ruined our trip or anything like that. There has always been a line to get seated but it moves pretty quickly. We did the wildlife tour of the hotel - it was interesting and fun. We also did the lei-making. My daughter enjoyed it. Both activities were free. We paid for the Tour of the Stars on the roof of the hotel one evening. It was okay. The Director of Astronomy seems to love his job, but for the price, I wouldn't do it again. We did a few other activities that I will rate separately. We decided to do the Cirque Polynesia, but we are doing that tomorrow evening so I can't say much about it yet. I will say that children are free with an adult ticket. We found out by accident when I looked online. Overall, the hotel location is nice because it's not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali, but it is within easy walking distance of the Whaler's Village and other hotels. Last week I would have said that I would definitely stay here again. A couple of things have happened that have kind of made me think about looking at other locations for our next trip. One, the availability of pool chairs. Although this sounds petty, it was a big deal to us. As we had a view of the pool, we could easily see when people were saving those seats with their towels early in the morning. A few hours later, the people had never come back but the seats were still being held for them. We were surprised that in October the hotel would be this crowded. Seats were at a premium. The pool staff makes a half-hearted attempt to remove things after 60 minutes. I never saw this happen. I did see them put a couple of signs on seats saying that they would remove items, but it didn't appear that they did so. A few days ago an Arbonne skin care group arrived at the hotel. Nice ladies, but they aren't in meetings. They are at the pool every day. The pool staff told us today that the ladies would save seats for their friends and when they put signs on the chairs, the ladies would remove them so the seats wouldn't be taken by others. Very frustrating when you've been searching for a seat for an hour and no one has sat in several all day. I took a picture of the pool this morning from my balcony at 7:30 am - most of the seats were \"taken\" by towels and only two people were even in the vicinity of the pool. I think the Hyatt is missing the boat here - they need to do a little bit more and be strict about this policy and have someone monitoring the situation. We are all paying to stay here so we should all have an opportunity to get a seat. We picked the Hyatt in very large part due to their pool but we haven't been able to enjoy it much at all the last few days. VERY frustrating. Another item that we didn't know about was the construction. Perhaps we should have but we didn't find out about it until we arrived and found the front entrance covered and scaffolding all around. The lobby really doesn't have any ambiance due to the construction. It's only done Monday through Friday, but it's loud. We received a letter tonight saying that it will continue through December 20th so just be aware of it if you are traveling during those dates. They are having to make repairs to the lobby ceiling and are re-doing their entrance at the same time. Not as big of a deal as the pool to us, but it would have been nice to know. They have relocated the front desk, conceirge, bell desk and little coffee shop to the Lahaina Tower during the construction. Last, but not least, the parking situation is not so hot. We expected that though. We did visit a few other resorts and they seem to have a better parking situation, but I think it might be tough in this part of Kaanapali. Again, not a deal breaker for us. In summary, our stay was great but the pool could easily be a deal-breaker for us. We love to go on beach vacations and have stayed in Hawaii, Mexico and the Caribbean. We understand about the reserving of chairs. Most resorts try to monitor the situation. The Hyatt really doesn't have a handle on it and I don't think realizes that the pool is a big part of a vacation for many. I will say that the pool is nice and the waterfalls and lava tube are great.

The pool area, shops and lobby of the Hyatt are fantastic. The pool area was very crowded all 5 days I was there. The breakfast buffet was very nice (very expensive, but it was included in my package) and I ate at one of the hotel restaurants one night, Japengo, and had an excellent meal.

The hotel is undergoing some remodeling so the open air lobby had scaffolding marring the ocean views, but otherwise this property was fine. We stayed in an ocean front room in the Napili Tower and it was a delight. At night we slept with the patio doors open and we fell asleep and woke up to the sounds of the ocean waves - just perfect. The room was clean and comfortable for our family of four. A mini-fridge in the room was useful for chilling bottled water and beverages. The bathroom was a bit small, but we liked that the sink area was separate as it helped everyone move along in the morning. Housekeeping was wonderful - they brought extra towels, left extra soaps/shampoos upon request and were very prompt when we asked for blankets to take up to Haleakala during our planned visit. The staff was just so courteous and cheerful. We also utilized the Regency Club which was a nice treat. Here the staff was exceptional, chatting about the day and sharing tips. They were also very attentive with respect to placing food and keeping the areas clean for guests. We really loved the pool area though we did have to send one of our family members to secure shadier spots early in the morning. You can opt to choose chairs facing the ocean or facing the pool, and some a bit of both. The only strange thing was the towel policy - you receive a card to exchange for one towel and when returning the towel, you got the card back. At checkout you had to make sure all your cards were turned back in. Weird towel accounting method that was not properly explained. We found the pool attendants just a bit brusque if not slightly rude about the policy. If anything, they need some refreshers on smiling (I'm sure they're fed up and bored all day long just handing out towels or watching out for unattended chairs, but still they should have been a bit more friendlier). The walk to Whalers Village was lovely especially near sunset. Lots of shops if you want to spend the time. Also, a nice hula show in the evening around 6:30, I think. The concierge was very helpful - if you think you'd like to plan any excursions at all, book early as slots seemed to fill up and we had to \"re-arrange\" our itinerary a bit to fit things in. We took advantage of parasailing and ziplining. We had booked surfing as well for the teens, but it got canceled due to unsafe wave conditions for beginners. The highlight was the visit to Haleakala at sunrise - no guarantees of views given, but worth attempting. We used our car rental only once to head out to Napili/Kapalua Bay areas. So glad we did as the beach areas in those locations were wonderful and not too crowded. To secure a parking spot, we headed out fairly early (before 9:30, I think). Meals are slightly on the costly side on property, but if you'd like to explore there are other options in Whalers Village and Lahaina. Just a matter of preference and convenience. We would definitely return to this idyllic retreat in the future.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHyatt Regency Maui - Excellent\u201d", "Author": "OnIslandTime", "ReviewID": "UR118637735", "Content": "Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui 8/26-30 and really enjoyed our stay.

We have vacationed in the Hawaiin islands over 50 times, but this was our first time returning to this hotel as we usually stay exclusively at more upscale 5 star properties and honestly Maui our least favorite Hawaiian island. The locals call it \"Mauiwood\" as quite a majority of guests tend to be from LA. I prefer not to run into friends, neighbors and business associates on my vacation. The Kaanapali are reminds me of Waikiki with its very busy beachfront walkway from the Hyatt to the Sheraton at Black Rock. While the Hyatt is on the narrowest strech of sand and they do not reccommend swiming right there, this is the best location in our opinion as it is at the end of the walkway. We took a chance and overall we were quite happy that we returned. We will be back and definitely stay in this suite again! This is a beautiful 4 star resort and we were very pleased with the way the hotel has been maintained. It certainly does not show its age. The Aloha spirit of the staff is exceptional...much better than at The Grand Wailea and The Four Seasons Maui! This hotel caters to a completely different clientelle and it was refreshing to not be poolside with everyone talking on their cell phones about how rich and important they are! My only serious service issue has to do with room service. It is only available for breakfast until 11am and for dinnerafter 5:30pm. There is no room service at all during the day!? We like to come up from the pool to cool off and relax and have lunch and cocktails in our room, as well as late afternoon cocktails and snacks but this was not to be at this hotel. When I called down I was informed that there was a takeout menu from the hotel restaurants in our room and I was free to go down, order and carry up whatever I wanted. I probably should have contacted management as I'm sure they would have accomodated us, but I chose not to, my mistake. Please Hyatt Maui...change this...especially in your suites. You will make a lot more money and have happier clients. We ended up driving into Lahaina or up to Kapalua for lunch quite a few days. When we arrived back at the pool the day of my call after eating in the pool restaurant which is the only one open for lunch, our pool cocktail server (can't rememner her name but she was from Lanai) asked how our afternoon was going. When I mentioned no room service and being in the presidential suite she said had we asked her, she would have hapily delivered to our room as she was \"old school\" service oriented and believed that the customer should never be told no. I think this is one of the main reasons why this property is a 4 star hotel and no longer rated as 5 stars. At check in we were granted a paid upgrade to The Presidential Suite for all 11 nights.. With taxes it ended up being about $1,800 per nite. Well worth it for a 2,300 sq ft suite that rents for over $6,000 per nite! It is located on the top floor of the atrium tower on the Regency Club floor. The suite is gorgeous. It consists of an entry way with hawaiian antiques, then you step down into the \"V\" shaped large living room which wraps around the corner of the hotel and provides ocean front views all the way to golf course and west maui mountain views in the rear of the hotel. The living room has a raised bar type table with 4 chairs, 2 large sofas, coffee table,a dining table for 8 as well as the \"den\" area to the left which has 2 more sofas, coffee table, chairs, large tv, DVD and Bose stereo system. This part of the suite had 5 balconies but unfortunately only 1 of these had and was large enough for chairs! There is a kitchen with full refrigerator freezer, coffeemaker and the necessary appliances and dishes/glasses. No mini bar in suite?? We are not the type to go out and stock your own refrigerator on vacation and would have loved a mini bar in the master bedroom. There was a seperate door to the hall from the kitchen which made it easy for staff when you had room service. Right outside the kitchen in the \"den\" area there was a door to an adjoining golf-mtv view room in case you wanted to book this as a 2 bedroom suite. Back thru the living room and en route to the master bedroom there is a office area containing a desk with a computer and printer which made it easy for us to check in on our boys at summercamp. There was also a lovely powder room as well as a room with a large daybed, chairs and another large TV and a balcony with 2 teak chairs that they call \"the library.\" This would not work as a 2nd bedroom, except for an infant or small child unless you wanted to share your tub or shower in the master bedroom. The master bedroom was quite large with a seating area, another large tv and then a raised area for the bed. We are very picky about beds and linens and were quite happy with this bed. The master had a large, but very narrow balcony with 2 teak chairs and small coffeetable. My only real complaint here is with a suite of this size, at least one of the balconies should have had a chaise lounge, but alas the balconies are too narrow. Maybe when they decide to do a renovation, they will decrease the size of the library room to make a larger balcony and put in some lounges. From the master bed you stepped up into a hall with 4 closets, then into the center of the master bath which had a nice dressing area with seating. From here if you turned left you had the ladies side of the bathroom with long counter (no granite or marble??) with sink and makeup area . There was a seperate ladies toilet. There was also a 1 person sunken into the floor jacuzzi tub which I only used once because it was a bit scary stepping so far down to get into it or climbing out of it. There were glass shelves above with nice bath products and battery operated candles to create a nice ambiance. Unfortunately the lighting on the ladies side was no where near as bright as on the mens side of the bathroom. The men's side contained another counter and sink, mens private toitet, a small open shower and a nice sauna. For a suite this size, the bathroom is very dated and desperately needs a renovation if it is to rent at anywhere near full price. The shower only had 1 showerhead and someone had cracked parts of the pink marble on the walls/floor and they had used some really bad, mesy caulk to fill it in. Housekeeping was 5 star excellent. Our 2 housekeepers Lucrecia and Elvie were very friendly, always inquiring about our day and exuded the aloha spirit! They noticed the huge flower arrangement my husband had ordered me thru the concierge before we arrived and left us a nice note from them wishing us a Happy Anniversary! It was a very nice touch and one that was most appreciated. We enjoyed the pool area every day and never really had problems finding lounges, even if we arrived after 10:30am. Water was clean and refreshing. Except for 2 days, service was excellent. Being July we had expected to see more families, so the overall quiet was very nice. Unfortunately on a few afternoons toward the end of our stay, the activities staff turned into \"cruise directors\" and walked around the pool with a small megaphone trying to recruit kids for a 15 minute jump into the pool contest. This contest took place in the deepest area of the pool right by the entrance to the pool restaurant. This area was usually mostly adults who had to move to make way?! Unfortunately we were seated about 4 lounges down from that area one day. We were asked to be judges. I stayed and judged as I was enjoying the sun, my husband bolted for our suite. Afterwards I was given a free drink coupon for my efforts. We learned to sit in other area of the pool for the rest of our stay. A few evenings they put out a large inflatable movie screen in the sand by the kids side of the pool to show \"dive-in\" movies. We had 2 excellent late diners at Sonz at Swan court. Very nice food, an extensive wine list and excellent service. We watched them turn away many people without reservations. We also enjoyed 2 dinners in their Japanese restaurant, Japengo and 2 dinners sitting at the sushi bar there. We know good fresh fish as one of our best friends is Japanese, owns one of the best sushi places in LA and we have been with him to Tokyo Japan and eaten sushi after the 5am Tsukiji fish market auctions. The sushi was excellent and we really enjoyed talking car racing with all the chefs. We thoroughly enjoyed room service dinner altho the menu is very limited. Umulu, the poolside restaurant was ok, not great for lunch. We only had 1 breakfast there...unfortunately it is cafeteria buffet stlye for breakfast and we both got sick within the hour. Breakfast was included in our room rate but we never went down to Swan court...the lines were too long. We had room service or else went to the regency club lounge and brought it back to our diningroom table. There used to be a lobby bar, but sadly that turned into a take away type coffee and pastry place in the morning. Your only 2 bar options are the poolside Umulu or Japengo, both of which do not have sunset views. Entertainment...If you did not go to the Luau, there was sadly no Hawaiian entertainment. They did have 2 hula dances as well as 2 male dancers come over from the Luau for 2 minutes at sunset to blow the shell signifying sunset. The hotel brought in a college orchestra from LA who entertained poolside in the afternoons and evening. We would sit on our balcony and enjoy the music. They were good but played close to the same set each night. On 2 days they took over 1/5 of the pool area near the bar and restaurant and set up a large stage. They could have set it up mid afternoon so guests would have more space by the pool. The days it was up it was more difficult to find a lounge certain hours. Overall it was a very nice 11 days and we very much enjoyed the presidential suite. Hopefully they will do the much needed bathroom renovation and them we will happily return...even if we have to pay close to the rack rate.

Dave, helped us book outside activities and they were all wonderful and suited to what we wanted to do. We ate breakfast all but one day at the hotel. We went on a snorkeling trip that one day and left before we could get breakfast. Everyday the breakfast was outstanding. You could special order an omelet or go through the buffet line.

We had an ocean view room and it was wonderful. Every day we sat on our lanai and watched the parasailers as they went by. The gardens that we saw below were well taken care of and we couldn't have asked for more. People that say it is outdated obviously haven't stayed elsewhere - hotels don't remodel their rooms every year. The beach wasn't the best but you could walk in either direction to get exactly what you wanted for a beach site. We sat by the pool for a few hours each day and it was easy to get a spot but if you wanted shade you needed to get there early or watch for one of the umbrellas when they opened up. The lava shoot was so much fun. We aren't kids but we loved it. The pool area left nothing to be desired. The bar girls came around on a reular basis to make sure that you were well hydrated. The swans, parrots, penguins and fish were relaxing to look at and try and talk to (parrots).

Two big beds and the best part was the VIEW! We had an ocean view and were on the 7th floor. Everyday I looked at palm trees and the ocean. It also overlooked the swan/flamingo garden area. The grounds were really beautiful and well kept. There was a little bit of construction going on, didn't really bother me. If you eat at the little cafe/breakfast bar area near the koi pond some of your view will be obstructed but it didn't stop me from eating there twice. Mostly I ate at the hotel. I loved Umalu, the quesidillas, fish tacos and cobb salad were wonderful! I had the buffet twice at Sonz, it was buy one get one ( I wouldn't have paid full price for it). It was decent. There was an omelet bar, fruits, pastries, and sushi. The firsttime I went was arund 7am and there was hardly any line but when I went at 8am I stood in line for about 25 minutes. I enjoyed the little breakfast bar that I mentioned before. They had starbucks coffee, some pastries, fruit, and breakfast sandwiches. The beach in front of the hotel isn't the best but its fine to wade in. Mostly I walked the 15 minutes or so to whalers village area and the Sheraton(which has the best beach by far!). I never went to the pool (why go when there is the ocean?). It was crowded by 9am and cleared out around 6pm. I originally planned a spa day at the Westin but do to my sunburn I ended up cancelling and instead got a pedicure from Spa Moana (Hyatt). $85 is a little steep for 50 minutes. The foot massage was nice, although it seemed to last about 5 minutes, if that. The view of the water is relaxing and afterward I stayed in the relaxation room for about 15 minutes (water and fruit were offered). I probably wouldn't go back to the spa as it seemed to be the most expensive of all the hotels on Ka'anappali Beach. Upon check out I was overcharged $80 ( a room charge that was not mine).

Also make sure you get a package that includes your breakfast. Breakfast for 2 was 62.50! And if you are into the gym and spas these are the best facilities that I have ever been in. We received a couples massage and it was truly unbelievable. They let you use their facilities all day for the day you receive treatments. For instance, our massage was at 5, we got there around 3 to use their hot tub, steam room, sauna, and to shower there. Fresh fruit, coffee and tea were also provided. Another tip would be to get to the pool early! We got clean towels the night before the towel window closed (around 5 PM) so we were set for the next morning. We were at the pool by 830AM. It is bright and sunny then! We laid out and enjoyed the amazing pool til about noon or 1 then ventured out around the island. Same for the breakfast buffet. I read reviews where people had to wait in line. We were at the buffet around 730 every morning and we never got the long line. There isn't a lot of space to lay out on the beach right in front of the hotel, but if you take a short walk down to the other resorts, you can enjoy the beach there. Also, you can rent chairs from the resort and go to the many other amazing beaches in Maui! We are definitely beach people, but the pool at the Hyatt was amazing and we didn't mind spending our mornings there. I did read reviews about a lot of kids around the pool. I did not experience this. There is a separate pool for kids and I didn't notice many kids around the resort at all. The Japengo restaurant was really good, expensive but good. Drinks at the resort were very expensive (Mai Tai $12) also but that was to be expected so we went to the Safeway, 5 min away and stocked up on our alcohol. I also read reviews complaining about the $25 a day resort fee. Well all the resorts have a fee and the Hyatt does not charge you for parking, internet and gym like the other resorts do.

The breakfast buffet (At the Swan Court) was superb, perhaps not too many variety but the quality and taste were perfect. We had to wait inline for 20-25 mins but we've never felt inconvenienced. It was worth it. The view while having breakfast was amazing. **The positives are: the property is well kept and maintained including the rooms. Food is exquisite (breakfast at the swan). My 7 yr old loved the pool and the lava tube. the service was excellent. Not a long walk to Whaler's village unless you're lazy and don't want to take a nice stroll along the beach. Negatives: parking was very limited and never could find a parking spot starting in the afternoon as they had the Luau every night. However, they let us park in the valet parking with no charge. We had to go either left of the hotel or to adjacent hotel's beaches to get a good spot for swimming but that wasn't a big issue for us. Just enjoy waking up to the priceless view. **I want to extend my thank you to the housekeeping department since they were very helpful in returning my son's wallet as he left it on our last day in the room. They mailed it to us Fedex within 2 days at no cost. Thank you for the wonderful service. We can't wait to go back again!! Thank you Hyatt for making our Maui experience one of a lifetime!!

This would include the front desk, the Spa, restaurants, and housekeeping. - Property was well taken care of - They were able to accomodate an early check in and late check out (12:30 PM) - Umalu Restaurant was ok - Breakfast at the buffet at the Swan Court was good with eggs cooked to order - The room itself (partial ocean view) was fine and more than met our needs and expectations - Our flight left at 8:50 PM and having the Spa Access allowed us to enjoy another full day in Maui. The Spa has excellent facilites and all of the amenities one could ask for including razors and shaving cream Cons - Beach is almost non existent ( this is supposed to be a beachfront resort hotel). We found a fantastic beach called Polo Beach located behind the Fairmont in Wailea and the one behind the Sheraton in Kaanapali is great as well - Our partial ocean view room overlooked a cemetery - SInce the beach really couldn't be used, most people took advantage of the two nice pools available. The problem is that people lay their towels over the lounge chairs early in the morning to claim them and you had a difficult time in finding some, expecially those placed under the umbrellas - The wait time for the breakfast at the Swan Court was about 20 minutes. There is another one at the Umalu restaurant which we were told had the same food without the eggs cooked to order - Their location with respect to the good beaches and Whaler's Village (Shopping Center with several restaurants) was further away from the other resorts on Kaanapali beach. All in all, we had an excellent time (who can't in paradise???) and we made do with some of the resort's shortcomings.

Our strong recommendation to anyone reading this would be - DON'T stay here! Stay at another hotel and location (perhaps Wailea - my wife had stayed at the Fairmont, Wailea a couple of years ago and only had wonderful things to say about the hotel and beach). My wife and I are seasoned travellers, having stayed in all types of accommodation (budget to five star+) all over the world. There were a number of reasons why we were so disappointed with our stay, but in the interest of presenting a balanced view, we've listed the positives and negatives of our recent trip to Maui: POSITIVES: 1. Great customer service. Like anywhere in the United States, the customer service was very good. All the staff were attentive, helpful and friendly, and we had no issue with the staff at all. 2. Japengo restaurant. The food at Japengo was really tasty, flavoursome (the sushi in particular) and reasonably priced for a hotel. It was the best food we had in Maui (although we didn't have a car so didn't travel too far from the hotel). Make sure you book dinner (or at least pre dinner drinks) around sunset so you can enjoy the views. NEGATIVES: 1. Price of rooms. We stayed in an ocean view king sized room and for the price we were paying per night were extremely disappointed with what we were paying versus what we were receiving (in the context of all the other negatives below). 2. Dated decor. Both the rooms and the hotel itself is in desperate need of renovation. We could not believe that given a) the number of rooms at the hotel (also a negative) and b) the price they were charging that the hotel could be so dated (brown, old carpet etc). The owners of the Hyatt Regency are obviously trying to save money by not reinvesting in their property and unfortunately it is clearly evident. 3. Lack of beach. The Hyatt Regency Maui has no beach to speak of. Even if you did spend 15 minutes walking down to Whalers Village for a swim in the ocean - be warned that the beach itself is not a good one for a relaxing, leisurely swim. The beach suffers from strong rips (no lifeguards), waves breaking right on the foreshore and isn't really very clear (certainly not turquoise / aqua blue). Whilst this is an issue for the Hyatt Regency, it is also an issue for all hotels on Kaanapali Beach and we'd strongly recommend not staying in this area if you like an ocean paddle. 4. Lack of shade at the pool and \"beach\". We were bitterly disappointed with the hotels lack of shade around the pools. In this day and age with the prevelance of skin cancer, we were disgusted that there were only a few pool chairs that had permament umbrellas and shade. As a consequence we quickly found that these disappeared early in the morning as people (rightly or wrongly) reserved them for the day with their towels. This meant that I ended up waking up at 6:30am every morning to try and secure a shaded seat (who needs to sleep in on their holiday right?!). To capitalise on this lack of shade, the Hotel did offer to rent out chairs (they came in a pair) with shade covering for about $50 / day or shaded cabanas for $150 / day. I suspect that this is a trend that most hotels in Kaanapali follow, however, I don't understand why they can't just invest in umbrellas that give the guest the option of having shade or not. 5. Room. Notwithstanding the dated look of the rooms, they also suffered from a strange smell and very small bathrooms. Again for the price you are paying, we felt it was inappropriate. 6. Breakfast. If you have breakfast included (we did), you will probably end up eating at Sonz which offers the best breakfast option at the hotel. Unfortunately as the hotel has underinvested in appropriate breakfast eating areas you end up waiting 15-20 minutes each morning for a table for breakfast and then another 5-10 minutes if you'd like a freshly cooked omlette. We don't think its appropriate to wait this long every morning for breakfast. 6. The $25 / day \"wireless / gym / parking\" charge. This is just a marketing charge. As far as I can tell if this isn't an optional charge ie if you don't have a computer or car or gym gear, which it wasn't, then it should be added to their advertised rate and not \"added on\" to the advertised rate. Just further evidence of hotel management doing everything they can to try and squeeze every single dollar from their guest without actually giving them anything for it. 7. Other matters. We won't go into it too much, but its fair to say that the spa treatments are ridiculously expensive (and from the look of them not worth it) and there is limited transport options unless you have a car (buses are available, but they come every hour or so). We don't normally write reviews etc on any websites, but we thought it necessary that we present our views on the Hyatt Regency Maui and strongly encourage anyone thinking to stay here (or on Kaanapali Beach) not to.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTrip of a lifetime\u201d", "Author": "Kenmnc1", "ReviewID": "UR118153610", "Content": "A trip of a lifetime.

We loved the rooms, very peaceful and roomy, beds were low to the ground so the kids had no problems climging on/off. The mini-fridge was nice to keep their milk cold. At age 4 and 18 months, the kiddie pool was great. That completely occupied my kids, especially the kiddie slide. The adult slide was surprisingly fun for the hubby and me. Grounds were beautiful and unlike other reviews, I thought the beach was nice, if you went to beach on the side that they day wave runners. It's kind of next to the parking lot area, but I think most people miss that part of the beach and it's actually very nice. We enjoyed getting lunch at the pool bar (took it to go for a picnic), although very pricey something like $22 for a CB/FF when buying an adult meal the kids got a meal free. The kids meals were large so both kids ate one meal and the burgers were half pounders with a huge order of fries, so we split that making lunch actually cheap. We had picnics almost daily on the beautiful grassy lawns under a palm tree, it was perfect! The only negative for us was that we walked to the Sheraton a couple of times to snorkel black rock and also walked about 3 times to Whalers Village area to eat at Leilani's (fish tacos and hula pie are great!), with an 18 month old and barely 4 year old in tow this made for a long walk. Don't get me wrong, the walk was manageable or we wouldn't have done it so often but it was tiring. I personally like the location of the Westin Hotel, more central but then again all the resorts are beautiful and I wouldn't change our choice solely because my son loved the kidde area so much. Also, the breakfast buffet was included and convenient but IMO it would not have been worth the cost. The food that was ordered from the menu looked better and less expensive. Other than that, Aloha Mixed Plate is another great place to get food on the go for a picnic. It is located in Lahaina, one of the best/reasonable meals we ate.

We were upgraded and flourished with gifts to celebrate the occasion I contend the service here is as close to perfect as possible particularly considering the size of the hotel. As an example, after checking in we were wandering towards the beach/pool area tired and probably looking lost we were approached by Kekoa Mowat who (unsolicited) asked if he could help direct us, after pointing us towards our destination near the beach he offered to get us towels (which were in the opposite direction) and a few moments later he appeared with said towels in hand and a smile. He refused a gratuity. Later that evening we received a card from him congratulating us on our 30th Anniversary. These touches have always been a hallmark of our experience at the Hyatt.

This is a huge problem and made us not want to eat the breakfast that was included with our room. We figured out that we could get it to go and eat it from the pavilion. That worked ok but was a hassle. If you don't have kids stick to the adult side of the pool - much calmer. The pool bar serves great drinks. Try a lava flow. Yum!

The room was always cleaned extremely late in the day. I noticed a previous guests lip gloss under the bed. Also, there was can of a previous guests beverage under the tv. These things were there for the entire 6 nights we were there. The bathroom looked like it had been partially remodeled. They seemed to have stopped with the bathroom door and bath tub. The pool was nice, but is probably a little too deep for most people. Half of the pool is 8 or 9 feet deep. It didn't bother me, since we had brought our own tubes, but there was hardly ever anyone in that part of the pool. You need a towel card to get towels for the pool and have to turn them in to get new towel cards after you use them. It was a pain. We stayed at Hyatts in Waikiki and Kauai and neither of them had this annoyance. The room was quiet; we couldn't hear our neighbors. Lots of people put towels on the pool chairs and I never saw them. Maybe they only enforce the 1 hour removal rule during the high season. There were some nice shops in the hotel: Maui Hands, Macys, a sundry. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Whaler's Village and a few restaurants. We at at Umalu once. It was ok. The prices were pretty steep at for the food; there was no kids menu here. They have a happy hour at Umalu and Japengo. There were plenty of other restaurants outside of the hotel that were cheaper. Front Street in Lahaina has a ton of restaurants and shopping, which is a short drive away. We called the guest request number to ask about a later checkout after having been told by the front desk to call in the morning. The woman on the phone immediately said no; she never asked what room we were in or anything. We later walking down to the front desk and a very nice front desk man said it depended what room we were in; we were in a room that allowed for the late checkout (1pm), which was very helpful. The real low point of the stay was the parking/valet situation. Upon our arrival we stated that we wanted to check in quickly and then we would park our car ourselves. We clearly stated we did not want our luggage removed from the car. One valet guy said no problem and he'd just move our car over to the side. After we checked in, I noticed our bags were on a cart with a bellhop standing by. I was very annoyed by this, but I was annoyed even further after we returned from getting our bags dropped off by the bellhop to find that our car was nowhere in sight. It was not parked on the side as we were told. And that valet person was nowhere in sight. It took another 15 minutes for the other valet person to find out where our car was and bring it back. There is also a luau at the hotel every night. It is very difficult to find a parking spot at night because of this. We continuously drove from one parking lot to another and did not find a spot. Then, we were back in the valet situation again. You also don't need any kind of parking pass to park in the hotel lots so anyone could park here at anytime. They really need to focus on making parking easier for their guests. I'd definitely stay elsewhere next time.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on earth part one\u201d", "Author": "lovebnbs", "ReviewID": "UR117711181", "Content": "I loved everything about this hotel.

The bathroom was suprisingly small. The inside of the hotel lobby was very beautiful. It had no ceiling and so the sunshine flooded in.

Before I start on the little minor issues, I have one big, huge, complaint I must share and it is the sole reason, I will not stay there again... ~ YOU CAN'T ORDER PIZZA AND HAVE IT DELIVERED ONTO THE PROPERTY. HYATT IS THE ONLY HOTEL ON THE ISLAND THAT DOES NOT ALLOW PIZZA GUYS ON THE PREMISES. You have to go and meet the pizza guy a mile down the road at the entrance. (if you are curious as to why I would need pizza in the first place, please see comment directly below) It still baffles me that you can get a pizza at the Ritz or the Grand Weilia but not the Hyatt, crazy. Cons - ~ I have a very, very PICKY 8 year old when it comes to food (sensory issues, etc)...I tried everything to get him to eat but to no avail. The buffet for us wasn't a very wise choice for us (even with the second person being free) because all he ate was fruit loops, however the buffet was very good for me, especially considering it was \"free\" but I will tell you right now, DO NOT GET THERE AFTER 7:30AM because the line is AWFUL!!! 6:30-7:10am is the best time. My own friendly suggestion if you get your meal complimentary, just eat and leave, don't just sit and chit-chat and take up space, I felt horrible for all the people waiting in line. I'm not one of those persons that feel I'm justified in taking up space just because I can. Especially if I got the meal for no cost in the first place... ~ The pool was CROWDED! So get up about 6am and reserve a spot. I know this is frowned upon but seriously, you will NOT get a chair otherwise. Be careful though, don't try to reserve it for 3 or 4 hours before you get there, besides that not being very nice, they will move your belongings. ~ The tables at the pool were ALWAYS sticky, everyday. Bring baby wipes or a damp cloth otherwise anything you stick on them with be sticky too. ~ Our room was very nice but we were MILES away from everything! It's a hike, let me tell you, if you'd been meaning to start that exercise routine but never got around to it, ask for the far tower and you'll be all set! ~ The beds were very comfortable but very low to the ground, futon height. So be very aware of your toes, I can't tell you how many times I nailed my toes on the base of the bed. ~ The food was WAY, WAY, WAY expensive. Not entirely their fault I'm sure since it costs considerably more to get things/items to the island but gee-ma-knee, be prepared to cash in your kids college fund. ;) ~ The lobby was extremely small and undersized/understaffed. You'd think with a hotel that massive it would have an entrance to match. ~ The Valet guys were great, expensive but worth it for me. I tipped them 5.00 each pick up and drop off. I thought I was being a cheapO only giving 5.00 but apparently they usually only get 2.00-3.00. :) ~ THERE IS NO BEACH...I read the reviews and I thought it may have been a bit of an exageration but nope, there really isn't any beach. A little to the left and a little more the farther right you go but none in front. I don't personally like spending time on a beach away from my own hotel, Remember that whole sensory issue I was talking about earlier, well I need to be close to the room to help him de-stimulate. ;) - OUR ROOM WAS NEVER CLEANED BEFORE 4pm so any nap time wasn't going to be an option for us..The silly people would clean the vacant rooms before ours, doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

A bit higher than I would have wanted to pay but I guess it's summer season. Just under $200/per night plus the resort fee.

Parking can be an issue but valet will park your car for you complimentary if you let them know that you were not able to self park. There was a bit of a wait when checking in. They booked us for a partial ocean view room but we wanted a room closer to the pools so in exchange they gave us a resort room with a parking-lot view on the 2nd floor with a $150.00 resort credit that we could use. Not bad! Beds were so comfortable. We all slept early and very well. Bathroom facilities were roomy. Great service. Pools were great. Kids took advantage of the complimentary snuba and snorkeling lessons. Wonderful beach front property. Everything was impeccably clean and you did feel that you were in a 5 star resort hotels because of the small touches: cold towels and pineapple flavoured drinking water in the fitness center with an oceanfront view to boot! Very impressed with Umalu. At first, we thought the prices were exhorbitant, $20.00 for a burger, but when the food was served, we thought it was worth it due to quality and presentation and portions were huge. Can't say the same for Japengo. Very disappointed, $12.00 for a california roll! We expected something better than the normal food court sushi but it was just average. Beautiful grounds with the flamingos,penguins and parrots. They have many free activities that you can avail of. Lei making, hula lessons, resort tour, penguin tour but we only stayed for 2 nights so we weren't able to take advantage of them. They have a screen in the lobby that tells you what activities are available for the whole week, so take note of this. They even had a \"dive-in\" movie each week where they show a children's movie in the pool area in the evenings. Just be aware that you'll be doing a lot of walking since the hotel complex is huge.

Like everything on Maui, it is pricey, and this is one of the most expensive. Pros: Elevators are fast. I don't think I waited more than ten seconds for one the entire week. The housekeepers and most other staff are very friendly as you would expect. The pool is great for the kids. Mine is an eight-year-old. Self-parking is free and convenient. Cons: Beginning with check-in, they didn't have the room I had booked months ahead of time available. The clerk kept disappearing behind a door for several minutes at a time to \"check availability\". Next, they disclose a $25/day \"resort fee\" that was never mentioned. It was also not disclosed that the hotel was undergoing major renovations. Large areas of scaffolding covered by canvas blocked the ocean view from much of the main building. When I went down to the desk the next day to request the room I booked, the disappearing act began again. I'm not exaggerating when I say the clerk disappeared twice for ten minutes only to return saying the room wouldn't be ready until the afternoon. I have a feeling this works with many guests who would just give up and walk away. Back to the resort fee. It is supposed to cover things such as in-room coffee, etc. The coffee is a tiny coffee maker with the cheapest grade of coffee packets they could possibly find. Like you'd expect at a one star motel. If you're not a fan of Starbucks, like me, you are in trouble here. That's ALL they serve in the entire resort other than the stuff in your room. The \"game arcade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that my son couldn't wait to see; not a single game working. I had to be refunded the several dollars I had dropped in the various games only to be told nothing is working??? Even my eight year old recognized that as pretty lame. On two or three occasions, my room key failed to work and I had to wait for security to bring another one. These guys apparently felt it was my fault since they never apologized for the inconvenience. They only seemed really annoyed, ask for my ID and handed me a new card. These are just a few things off the top of my head. I don't normally write these reviews but I really felt this was worth taking the time.

Paid for concierge level, which allows you to avoid the long lines at the breakfast buffet. Also thought we paid for full ocean view, Regency Club Ocean front, but when we got to our room we were on the side of the building opposite the sunset and had to look to our right on the lanai to see the ocean. Being from the midwest and enduring long bleak winters I called the front desk immediately to get this corrected. To me it was troubling that I thought we paid for the best view, yet we still looked mostly at mountains and no sunset (two years ago when we stayed at the Marriott on the Big Island, we got upgraded and got more than we paid for) This was a deal breaker and would have colored my entire vacation. Fortunately, Victoria at the front desk didn't need much convincing and moved us to room 2210, the top floor, almost to the corner room nearest the sunset. That made all the difference. Didn't care about the room size or anything else. It also made us closer to the concierge room, so we didn't have far to walk to pick up our yummy breaksfasts (fruit, breads, cereal, hot egg dish - AWESOME coffee) and bring them back to our room. So I LOVE Victoria - she understands hospitality. Other stuff: was a little taken aback by the african & non-native wildlife & art (parrots, flamingos, etc.) but my 9 year old loved them; I would have preferred more of a hawaiin theme. Umalu's tuna burger without the bun is awesome - great slaw. We were there last week in July and were entertained by a great band several nights of our stay - really added to our vacation. We rented a cabana and were able to reserve the exact spot we wanted - liked that. Liked the Maui Hands gallery in the hotel, and actually liked that there was a Macy's there (small - just beach & swimwear) because I had to buy a cover-up and they had a great selection. Used Camp Hyatt twice and thought it was only okay - asked my daughter what she learned about on Hawaiian Culture day and she said there was nothing about hawaiian culture covered - they just painted on a tile. But at least my husband and I got to go snorkeling during that time. Resort staff was great.

I have to say that I was dreadfully disappointed with the hotel accommodations and service, especially for a Regency resort and especially for 300 plus dollars a night. Next trip we stay at The Four Seasons, Fairmont or Grand Wailea. I arranged the trip through JetSetter who had sent me an offer for 100 dollars less than I had already booked with the Hyatt direct, although my Hyatt deal included FREE breakfast. I was not able to get the 10 nights I needed through jetsetter so had to book to extra 2 nights with the Hyatt who would not honor the same price and forced me to pay an extra 100 dollars for both nights even though the reservations were linked. They said they can only honor the discount to the agency and some other marketing double talk they mentioned. I say this is just rude and a chance to squeeze a few more dollars from a guest but as you will see this is the hotels business model, with 25 dollar \"resort fees\" and 18 dollar a day parking since every self park lot is full every night. To their credit they did comp the parking upon check out. I was worried about having 2 separate reservations and confirmed the reservation link several times with the hotel and JetSetter. I must say jetsetter staff and personal were prompt, courteous and professional. A great outfit but they need to be more selective with their hotels. Low and behold when I checked in they could not find the reservation for the two nights, only showing the JetSetter 8 nights and the hotel was full to capacity, even though I was holding a printed confirmation. A stressful start to an expensive vacation. It took over 20 minutes for the woman to emerge from the back room. I had to ask other people to track her down. During that time we were subjected to the awful banging and screeching of scaffolding being erected right over our heads. The noise was deafening. No one told us the hotel was under construction when we booked or offered an y discount based on this remodel. I was told this was \"Emergency-Remodeling\" which sounds scary. Was the hotel collapsing? I was also subjected to an upgrade charge to have an \"ocean view\" which I thought I already had. I had already upgraded on JetSetter from partial ocean view to ocean view (there were only 2 choices) Naively assuming that \"ocean view\" means \"ocean view\". How na\u00c3\u00afve of me. The geniuses at the Hyatt have devised a way to charge multiple tiers for the ocean view rooms, with partial ocean view (20%) to ocean view (I guess 60% view). If you want an actual ocean view you have to get FULL FRONT DELUXE OCEAN VIEW. What a scam? I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode. Why not add a few more levels while you are at it? High floor ocean view and low floor ocean view, right side of the building ocean view or left side of the building ocean view? They charged me 25 dollars extra for this. They also charge 25 dollars a day for a \"resort fee\", apparently 300-400 dollars for the room does not include use of the pool or facilities. If I decided not to pay this does that mean I can't swim at the resort? They Hyatt never misses a chance to squeeze the customer. Nickel and diming like a shoddy Vegas property, not a 4 star family resort. Finally they found the reservation. The room was supposed to have 2 \"Grand Plush\" beds a Hyatt TM which they even boast of as the most comfortable beds in the industry. Some nerve! The marketing folks at Hyatt have never slept at a Westin I guess. These beds were small (queen/double) and are cheap mattresses with minor pillow tops on top of hard beds on cheap wooden platforms and headboards which rattle. The wood platform is 1 foot off the ground, with no box spring so you have to practically roll onto the floor to get out of the bed. The beds are hard and very uncomfortable. The rooms are also dated even after a remodel (popcorn ceilings?) and are very small. The bathroom is so small one person can barely fit in it with the toilet butting up against the tiny bathtub. I have seen bigger bathrooms in $39 dollar rooms in Elkhorn Nevada. The rooms are small, the terrace is minuscule and the ceilings in a supposedly remodeled room still have the 80's popcorn. The biggest thing in this 300 dollar plus room is the minibar setup (profit center) and sits where a chest of drawers should be. Your clothes have to go on shelves in the tiny closet. The hotel was overbooked I was told. How this is possible I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know since there is a finite number of rooms but the hotel and pool area were overrun like an ant farm. The Hyatt offered a free breakfast package to the masses I guess, so the Swan Court breakfast restaurant had 100 people on line every morning just to get in. It was like the line for the Matahorn at Disney. There was also one toaster for all these people in the buffet so just to toast a bagel took 15 minutes. The pool has I would guess 1 chair for every 30 guests and almost no shaded areas so it is a battle to get seating, forget shade. If you want a good spot at the pool you are required to wake up with the sun and stake your claim. The Hyatt pool police will move your stuff every hour if you leave it so someone must be present at the chairs at all time. Other guest swarmed around us and literally attached their chairs to ours or moved us as to share the shade. It was like being at an 80% off sale on Black Friday. I was surprised the hotel did not offer roll out umbrellas for guests, even for a charge. We ate at Umalu, the Hyatt midscale restaurant which also supplies the pool food as well. The service was so bad our first night, taking 30 minutes just to get an ice tea that Gordon the manager comped our meal and sent us a gift basket. Very nice fellow. He is a professional and handled the situation very well. On his invite we tried it again for lunch as his guest and it was a little better. Mistakenly we went back again for dinner as the food when it finally arrives is pretty good. The next night the service was even worse with two tables seated after us getting fed before my daughter even got her Mac n cheese. Apparently for dinner they are woefully understaffed. Overall the appeal of this dated, tired property (even with a remodel) is the pool area and grounds which are exceptionally fun and beautiful and the location as the first hotel on Kaanapali has great unobstructed views of the mountains. It offers great beaches and many beach services, but the terrible service and tiny, uncomfortable rooms was so bad I would have to sadly look for other accommodations in Maui, and I spent my honeymoon here 25 years ago. Better than I guess since it was newer. I do recommend JetSetter though. Great deals, customer service, good locations, and good offers. They need to strike the Hyatt from the list I think if they want to market their as an upscale travelers club. If anyone form the Hyatt would like to contact me I would happy to speak with them. jeffg@super72i.com As of today neither JetSetter or the Hyatt has offered me any compensation for an extraordinary expensive and disappointing vacation.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cA solid hotel but with several disappointments\u201d", "Author": "jafojaz", "ReviewID": "UR116832477", "Content": "We stayed at the main section of the hotel with connecting & corner ocean front view rooms.

The walk from the desk to our elevator passes through a nice selection of stores, jewelry, Macy's, linens, clothing, etc. I didn't spend much time shopping but one could make an afternoon of visiting the various stores and galleries on the premises. We all shared a room with an ocean view and for a fairly standard room, I appreciated the layout. The bathroom area had a separating wall from the bedroom area making it much more convenient for changing clothes and made it feel like much more space. They stocked the bathrooms with generous sizes of shampoos and lotions which were nicer than your standard hotel products. They were replaced several times over our week's stay. The view was breathtaking and we enjoyed a glass of wine each evening watching the sun set over the ocean from the balcony. The beds were platform beds, sitting low to the ground and weren't amazingly comfortable, like I have come to expect at a Hyatt. Not horrible, just not that .....ahhhhh factor. The grounds are spectacular. My youngest loved taking close up pictures of the swans, flamingos and other wild life on the grounds. We dined at the Swan's buffet each morning and the selections were good with made to order eggs. It was a treat to eat in the open air overlooking the ponds, waterfalls, and beach. There were a lot of birds that flew in and were little thieves. The waiters worked constantly to be sure there were no unattended plates for them to feed on but they were still fairly rampant. It was a small price to pay to have the beautiful open feeling. There was typically a long line between about 8:30 - 10:00 each morning but the lines moved very quickly and there never seemed to be a dip in the buffet due to crowds. We did not dine at any of the other restaurants. The beach is a bit rough and not as clear as the Black Rock area but we had fun with the body boards as the waves were pretty decent. The pool area is very nice but the other reviewers are correct in saying getting a chair could be a challenge and getting the cocktails server's attention was difficult. I celebrated my birthday while at the Hyatt and my husband treated me to a few services at the spa. My scrub/wrap with Jewelie was wonderful, she was warm and professional (making it much more comfortable when you're in such a 'vulnerable' :) state), my massage with Alexa (oh darn, I'm thinking that's not right on the name but I'm sure it starts with an A) gave me one of the best massages I've ever had. Again, the perfect professional. Then my facial....I won't give names here but what a let down. The esthetician talked non stop (about herself) and the facial itself was very basic and rushed feeling....what you'd expect from someone right out of school with the standard massage manipulations. She taught dance and kept commenting on how hot she was for a woman of her age. I found it odd and not the least bit relaxing. I thought maybe I was being too hard on her but overheard another client saying basically the same thing the next day at the pool. I may be a bit picky here but I managed a day spa for 5 years and for spending $130 for a standard 50 minute facial, I felt like it was something I could have received at an esthetician school. The workout area was nicely stocked was not overly crowded the one time I visited. Housekeeping was a bit slow to get to us and we had to call one of the nights to get the room serviced. Not a huge hiccup but it would have been nice to return from our day at the beach to the room being clean and it rarely was until after dinner. There is free parking in the back , a really nice feature. They also have a luau there and the visitors use that parking so you needed to valet at night......nice touch since they don't charge you for it when you are unable to park in the lot.

Do to the hotel being full we did not get the room type reserved, the restaurants were very slow and food was okay for a day or so. However, they do not really have an order off the menu breakfast other than in the buffet...makes no sense. The other buffet is down by the pool, but food is largely the same as the other buffet with less selection. While the hotel is on the water there is little beach. The beach is much better down by the Westin and you can catch catamaran sail tours by the nicer restaurants at Whalers Village. The beds in are terrible. Many in the reviews seem to love them? They are 6\" off the floor mattress only on a wood platform with a foam topper! Cheap and uncomfortable if you are normal size. Managers not helpful either.

I couldn't stand the crowds - at breakfast, at pool, the luau crowd competing for parking in the evening, tour bus size groups checking in every evening. The front of the hotel with valet parking is just crazy. While we were there with kids, it was ok but i wouldn't stay at this resort for a honeymoon or an adult only trip or for a relaxing getaway. Even the employees seemed overworked a bit. We were greeted with lots of Alohas and smiles at the Hyatt in Kauai from every empoyee we encountered. But here in Maui, not much of Aloha going on. While we didn't encounter any rude employees, the overall service was not much to speak of. The resort gardens are beautiful, birds and wildlife were an added bonus with kids. We did the astronomy tour and that was amazing. This place reminded me of the mega resorts in Mexico. There is no beach to speak of. We rented chairs and umbrellas at the Sheraton by the black rock and had drinks and lunch at their Cliff Dive bar and that was money well spent.

The ladies in the regency club lounge were wonderful and took great care of us and our kids, giving us lots of ideas of fun things to do on the island, and even giving us boxed snacks to take with us one morning. We spent one afternoon in a beach cabana, while the kids played in the waves. The best beach is more to the north (right) along the beach, near the end of the cabanas. Its some distance from the pool, but there are fewer rocks compared with the left side, where I managed to whack my head on some coral a couple years ago bodysurfing. Speaking of which, if you snorkel, go out a little ways at high tide and its great. Lots of fish and healthy coral. At low tide you can't really make it out that far, and the coral nearby shore isn't that nice. The last day we were downgraded out of the regency club due to availability.

Rooms were clean and well maintained, but a bit small. Hotel itself is dated, but there clearly has been an effort to re-invest and stay true to the Hyatt standards. The pool area is great for kids, and you better like kids as there were many. If serenity is what you seek, best to avoid during school vacations. Also, the one hot tub, and it is a very nice hot tub, was always occupied by parents and their babies. Having raised my own children, I'm not sure I understand why anyone would put their babies in 104 dregree water! We passed on the diaper soup. Lots of the usual chair hogging going on with towels placed on pool lounges and not occupied. But, good for the Hyatt, they enforced their 60 minute unoccupied rule well. My only complaint is the pool area is not large enough to accomodate sufficient chairs for all guests. Shade and poolside were at a premium. Other hotels we visited along the breach appeared to have larger poolside areas. Highly recommend the cabana chairs along the beach. $50 for the day gets you a reserved beach side spot, great service, shade and soft recliners. Japango restaurant is great for sushi, Swan restaraunt has an excellent breakfast buffet. The beach area quite narrow and a bit steep. You need to be careful swimming as there is a reef and lots of rock just a few feet off shore. But this also means pretty good snorkeling and good surf. Bring water shoes. If you want your room cleaned early, you need to let the hotel know, otherwise you may find it not done before 3PM. I give 5 stars for service. Everyone was friendly and had the \"aloha\" spirit. Value gets a 3, only because there are better properties at this price. Sleep quality a 4. It was great, just not perfect. No hotel gets a 5 from me for this because, well it's a hotel and there will always be someone making a noise in the hall late at night. Cleanliness a 4.

I'm in my mid-30's, and I think I went down that thing at least 50 times during our 5 night stay...and I'm not exaggerating. You can choose and ocean and/or pool facing lounger. How great is that!

This place is not cheap, but I did feel that value was worth the money (please keep in mind part of the trip was paid for by wife's work). If I had to be super nit-picky, the maid service was a bit spotty and the food was generally good (not great or excellent). But other than that 5 stars all the way. Rental cars in Maui are super cheap...if you get them from the airport. We took a shuttle to the hotel, and then rented a car and had to pay $125 airport return fee. This hotel has free parking, so I would recommend getting the car from the airport and parking at the hotel. Hotel is a bit further than a walf from Lahaina, so it definitely comes in handy. Plus, there is a refrigerator in the room, so getting some provisions at the market will definitely help reduce some of the food (beer) costs incurred during your stay.

The trip itself was a bit of a disaster (we both got very, very ill), but the hotel itself and the staff of this amazing establishment was a lifesaver. The hotel is difficult to find, I will admit, but once we made our way there, we felt as though we were in a tropical paradise. The lobby of the hotel is open air, and is full of exotic birds, penguins, flowers and pineapples. It opens out onto a terraced view of the ocean - truly breathtaking. The Hyatt is at the far end of a walkway connecting all the beach-side Ka'anapali hotels with Whaler's Village and Black Rock. It is very nice to stroll along that walkway and people watch, or check out the other hotel's restaurants if you get tired of the Hyatt's. We booked a package with daily breakfast at Swan Court. It was yummy. We ate one night at their Sushi restaurant (which was so-so, very fresh but nothing special - my husband and I are spoiled as to sushi, being from California), another night at their special occasion restaurant Son'z at Swan Court (which was good, but I must admit we either ordered the wrong things or it was way overpriced - though the atmosphere was SUPER romantic) and several lunches at their casual Umalu poolside restaurant (which again was overpriced but hit the spot with both fresh food and yummy burgers). The pool area at the Hyatt is very impressive, with at least two separate areas, and more pool side chairs than you can count. They have a swim up bar in a grotto area, a large jacuzzi for late night which we found to be uncrowded, and waitresses who wandered through the crowd to take orders for pina coladas and other cold refreshing drinks poolside - it was paradise! Activities from the Hyatt were easy to get to and easy to book. Their concierges were beyond helpful. We had a jam packed trip and they helped to arrange practically everything: ziplining, stargazing, out of hotel restaurant reservations. We booked a couples massage side by side on the ocean. Very relaxing, and very romantic. Also, I just have to mention that right off the beach there is a company that does para-sailing. This was one of the highlights of our trip. Now, finally, what makes this hotel my favorite of all time and reserves for them a special place in my heart... I mentioned at the start of this review that my husband and I got sick on our honeymoon - when I say that I mean we got VERY sick. About two days into our week long trip, my husband started coughing up blood and running so high a fever that he woke me in the middle of the night just from his body temperature. I was in a panic - we were far from home, Ka'anapali is 45 minutes from the nearest hospital. In the early hours of the morning, I ran down to the concierge desk to get directions to said hospital, only to find out that the Hyatt HAD A DOCTOR'S OFFICE ON SITE. And they got us in immediately. I dragged my husband downstairs, and he was seen within 30 minutes. He had a bad bronchial infection, but they were able to prescribe antibiotics, I could fill the prescription at the local Lahaina pharmacy, and he could recuperate in the comfort of the hotel room. In 36 hours, when I came down with the flu, we knew what to do, and they squeezed us in again, diagnosed, etc. We had terrible luck (I am still so sad about it) but it could have been much worse if we had been trying to drive each other to a hospital 45 minutes away, coughing and hacking the whole way, both of us running fevers. One call to the concierge and they were able to cancel the reservations we needed canceled for the rest of the trip, too, and get our money back when we could. They were great advocates for us when we couldn't be for ourselves. I would visit the Hyatt again in a heartbeat! Sure, they are expensive. You do have to pay a resort fee. Well worth it - take a look around! Sure, they are tropical, so there are some bugs. Good luck finding a place without any!

The only sore spot was this hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI wish we had stayed somewhere other than the Hyatt. I apologize for the length of this review, but I feel the details are necessary for you to understand why we rated this hotel so poorly. This is from an honest, easygoing person--not one of the TA \"one-hit-wonders.\" We arrived in the afternoon and were given a corner room in their Atrium Tower on a high floor, as I had requested. The room was in their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd category, which I had booked (no upgrade). No problems at check-in. Upon getting to our room, we thoroughly inspected it for bugs and found it to be clean. We left for dinner and returned to the hotel for bed. We both settled into bed to read for a bit. Then I noticed a little gnat/fly on my nightstand along with a little ant. I got up to get a tissue from the bathroom, and there I found a couple of more ants on the bathroom sink. Upon further inspection, there were ants crawling everywhere on the bathroom counter. I hurriedly moved our things off the counter. When I checked back by the nightstand, I noticed a number of ants over there (AND on the window curtain, which was next the next to the nightstand) as well. I called down to the front desk and they said they would send somebody up to spray. I waited 5 minutes and decided we needed to move\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI was not going to be OK with this room. So I called down again and they offered us the exact same room location on the floor below us (basically the same view). I knew this was a bad idea, but I accepted at the time. We packed up our things and I went down to get our new keys. We immediately went to the bathroom to look for ants and found the same problem here. So, I called down and they said the only other available room was in another tower. I said that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine and requested help with our bags to get over there. After waiting 10 minutes for a bellman to arrive, we got tired of waiting and took our things down to the front desk ourselves. I asked if they had any suites or Club rooms available, and if so I would PAY to upgrade into them, since we had to change rooms anyway. They told me they had nothing available, but did give us a coupon for free dinner for 2 at their poolside restaurant Umalu. We made our way over to the new room, this time in Lahaina Tower. It was a nice room, and it was definitely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanfront.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the view was nowhere near the same as it was on the lowest of 7 floors in this tower. To me, it felt like the room was a downgrade, and since we were on our honeymoon and I had requested a high floor I felt like Hyatt dropped the ball here. The entire room move process took us about an hour. We had arrived on Oahu 2 days earlier, so we were getting accustomed to Hawaii time but we were still jet-lagged a bit. By the time we finally got settled in our Lahaina room, we were exhausted and nervous about finding unwanted critters. The next morning (Thursday), I stopped at the front desk and told them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we just haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to relax here, and I feel sick that I paid full price for that room last night.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At that time, they offered us half off the first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room rate and 2 tickets to their Luau. We were already going to a Luau, so I suggested maybe something more relaxing, like a spa treatment for the 2 of us. She tried calling the spa but got no answer, so she said she would just credit our account an extra $100 and we could go to the spa if we wanted to. I find this interesting because 1) The Retail Value of their Luau for 2 people is $200, and 2) $100 can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy you anything in their overpriced spa for 1 person, let alone 2. We said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thanks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and thought everything was OK. By Saturday afternoon things just were not sitting well with me. We did not do anything wrong, but we felt like they just stuck us off in some corner to get us out of their hair. So, we went to talk to the front desk again. I had a lengthy conversation with the front desk personnel about our situation. She \u00e2\u20ac\u0153checked with the manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and told us there were no suites available, but offered us dinner for 2 at Umalu\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 To which I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand, we are unhappy and Hyatt has not figured out how to please us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She responded with something like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We feel we have compensated you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for your issues on your first night. And your room is in the same tier that you booked.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I did not want to ask for anything\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI wanted Hyatt to realize the mental struggle that our stay had been, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like they ever truly got that. The front desk worker was at the point where she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything and asked if we wanted to speak to a manager. We said yes and got to talk to Kirstin (might be Kirsten\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot sure). Kirsten says they have tried, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our room is in the category which we booked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and she basically wants to know \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what we want.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Again, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to us. I told Kirstin how frustrated we were and that we looked at other hotels. If anything, something that could help us relax would be nice\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaybe something in the spa for the 2 of us or one of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanfront huts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ocean Hales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Upon hearing this, Kirstin immediately says she can book a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cabana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for us. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cabana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ($50/day) is NOT an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ocean Hale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ($150/day). I ask if the Ocean Hales are out of the question, and she backs down and seems to think one would probably be available for us. I ask to have it reserved for Tuesday, and she says the pool manager will call me for sure. Later that night, I get the phone call that a cabana (NOT an Ocean Hale) has been reserved for us on Tuesday. I asked the gentleman if any Ocean Hales were available, because that is what Kirstin and I talked about, and he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not at this time, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll monitor it for you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sure you will. When we checked into our Cabana on Tuesday, I noticed a number of the Ocean Hales were empty. I looked on the check-in sheet (which was obvious to understand) and saw that not all of the Ocean Hales had been reserved yet for the day. So even though they had availability in their Ocean Hales, they did not offer us one. As for our room being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the category which we booked,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I told both the front desk and Kirstin that it simply wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the same room and I would be happy to walk them up to each room and compare the two. I told them they should have more categories if they count them as the same. And again, we are on our honeymoon and I requested a high floor. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to resonate with either of them. Throughout the conversation with Kirstin, her expression was rude and gave us the impression that we were a problem. Throughout the process Hyatt seemed to want to know what we wanted. When I reluctantly asked for a suite/club upgrade, spa treatment, or Ocean Hale, they only offered their Luau, dinner at Umalu, and a cabana. The items they offered us are not high-value items and really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a difference to us. Every time I talked to the front desk, the worker had to go to the back and talk to the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis took FOREVER. They simply did not see things through the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I will never forget the line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we feel like we have compensated you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They never put themselves in our shoes and did anything that made a true difference. They just tried to give us meaningless stuff over and over again In addition to the above problems, here are other issues we have with this hotel: - Parking is an adventure. Had to wait 10 minutes one night just to get into the self-parking lot, and struggled to find a spot on a number of occasions. When we checked in, the valet told us that if we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a self-parking spot we would have to spend \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd $18 a day to valet it. - Hot water in the bathroom sink seldom got WARM, let alone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - The food is WAY overpriced. No way we would have eaten there if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a free coupon for Umalu. - To eat anywhere else, it can be a hike. The hotel is down on the end of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali, so you have to walk a ways or drive. - There is virtually no beach in front of the property. - The pool, luau, and other live music make for noisy oceanfront rooms, as others have noted. We had the luau right outside our room every night. It was ridiculous. They also make for a noisy pool-going experience. It was hard to relax with the hoard of people always present on the property. I wish we would have stayed at a number of the other properties on Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe actually checked out a few and if I could do it over we would have picked the Sheraton. A condo might have been a good option, too. ANYTHING would have beaten our experience here. We will NEVER stay at another Hyatt hotel in our lives. They did a terrible job of understanding our situation and accommodating us on our honeymoon. If Hyatt responds to this post expressing their remorse, I will be astonished because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have any while we were actually there. Honestly, we had a wonderful time in Hawaii and will always remember it fondly. But I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let our amazing trip cloud the view of our terrible Hyatt experience.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New YOrk", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "Stasnyc", "ReviewID": "UR115628785", "Content": "Stayed for 3 days Just love it Customer service was impeccable Any problem was addressed immediately Will be back", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNoisy oceanfront rooms\u201d", "Author": "RicGPDX", "ReviewID": "UR115622816", "Content": "In terms of staff and amenities, the Maui Resort is up to the kind of Hyatt quality you'd expect.

The live music can run from 4 - 11 and when they brought in a large band, conversation or watching TV in our 9th floor room was almost impossible. Also, unless you choose to partake of the hotel's rather limited (and very pricey menu), you'll need to drive or take a fairly long walk to the nearest convenience store or small restaurant that offers light meals. The hotel's own small sundry store only offers candy, cookie and potato chips for snacks. We were also a bit offended by the electronically monitored snack tray ($3 candy bars!?).

Seems most people are here on a package so explore your options. Room: We upgraded our package in advance to a Deluxe Oceanfront Room. Our particular room was on the very end about as close as any room to the beach, so a very good location and view also with a balcony with seating for two. Average size room and small bathroom. The room was in good condition and comfortable from the soft renovation but you will notice some things are dated such as the popcorn ceilings and old fixtures. Parking: We utilized valet on a couple of nights when self parking was full and there is no charge. Avoid parking in the Napili Tower self parking (first self parking as you drive in). The spaces are so small it seems they were made for compact only and it is always full. If you do park there, expect some scratches on your car. Use the Lahaina Tower self parking lot if you are on that side of the resort. The spaces are much larger and it is overall less crowded. Too bad I only figured this out on the last night of our stay! Contrary to other reviewers who had billing issues, we had no issues at all. Seems they have that process figured out. Restaurants: Japango was excellent! Umalu at the pool was very good as well for a casual option at all times of the day and service very good. Don't miss happy hour 4-6 and again at 10pm! The breakfast buffet: Yes, there is always a line but it typically moves very quickly so be patient (9 - 9:30 seemed to be the worst time). As an option, the resort lets you eat at Umalu if you don't want to wait in line. We didn't do this as we liked the food/selection very much at the buffet. Don't go here if it is not included in your package. Way to expensive. The birds flying around the restaurant were cute on the first day but after 6 days it was quite annoying. Pool/Beach: We didn't spend much day time at the pool. The pool is 24 hours, which was very nice and we did utilize it at night. People put their towels down and leave so all the good seats are taken early. There is supposed to be a 60 minute limit on your chair being empty but I could not tell that it was enforced. We opted to pay $50 one day for a cabana on the grass/beach and so glad we did! Happened to be cabana 26 and the beach in that section was very nice for swimming.

Maui is unlike most islands, a commercialized fantasyland looking tourist area, each resort is funneled into a large resort complexes, and the Hyatt Maui is at the tail end of the largest resort complex on Maui: Kaanapli. Location: The Hyatt Maui is a large resort, but that is no reason to give it any worse or better of a rap than any other. Many Hawaiian resorts, perhaps all near Wailea on Maui are larger, larger than a measly 10 acres for sure. The Hyatt Maui is located in Kaanapali which is a beautiful area, but the Hyatt's drive from the airport is a long one. Beautiful but still taking about 40 minutes from the airport, and traffic jams can occur during the summer and winter, the peak seasons of Hawaiian. The Hyatt Maui is about 40 acres or so but actually feels smaller if you have ever been to its cousin resort the Hyatt Kauai on Kauai. But nonetheless the resort feels private being at the farthest end of Kaanpali. However if you are feeling the need for a change from the measly 4 restaurants on property, sadly you are out of luck because Whaler's Village is basically a thirty minute walk away, and black rock a forty. However if you really love to walk or jog you can get there in fifteen (either place). So the location is not terrible, and is by no means a way to say that you will not stay there. Property: The Hyatt Maui is a large property, with at least three gardens. Some with gazebos, wedding gardens, ocean views, rope bridges, waterfalls, so plan to see it. The resort is terraced on a small hill with ocean views and wildlife everywhere. Yes, like other reviewers have said, the atrium lobby is a beautiful place with large chandeliers with shells painting onto the lights and most of all small wildlife like penguins and tropical birds, a fancy name for some named Parrots. The Penguins are also there, and no noise echos through the lobby like i have heard other people say. The small atrium is a pretty sight and i recommend having a room there (in the atrium tower) if you can have the chance. The property is small compared to some other mega resorts down near Wailea or in Kauai, but it still is a beautiful property. The prettiest on Maui for sure! The sprawling nature is something i found not so much a discomfort. You can walk through a large shopping complex complete with a small Macy's. Here these walkways that extend from he atrium also are air conditioned so you can walk around everywhere. Beach/Pool: Out of everything on Hawaii, to me the beach and pool are the most important. Sadly the Hyatt Maui has a strange beachfront. The sand is small, compared to other properties down the road, and while you can take a fifteen minute walk down to the Westin and have a nice white sandy beach day, the Hyatt's beach is not so special. A bit farther down near the ballroom area of the property you will find a slightly more generous stretch of beach in which the sand is a bit wider in length. However the beach near the pool is not so special. However once you swim into the beach the waves are not to high even during high tide and for anybody who hates swimming or beaches, there are hammock right near them where you can lay down and just watch the waves go by! Hyatt always has great pools. The Hyatt Maui has two pools. One large and more of an adult pool with some waterfalls and a basketball hoop hung on the fake waterfall rocks to the left. The pool is deep, pretty, but the real fun is farther down. If you go further into the waterfall a small grotto is formed where the rocks sort of envelop you into a small channel near a small bar that is not a swim up bar. No, you have to get out and order a drink, but it still is better than having to walk out of the pool and go over to order a drink, so people shouldn't complain. Anyways the other pool is the activity pool with a small kids play area with fake sand and some squirting fountains. A small slide is here. Rocks are all around the pool, forming a large canyon and a rope bridge is overhead, something my son enjoyed so much that it actually got me worried it would fall. A small tubular waterslide that is inside rock is in this pool. That waterslide is very scary, and because it is so dark i recommend only younger folks try it. The pools are nice, and shade is everywhere. Chairs and towels do fill up, and there aren't that many cabanas but the pool is still nice. While it actually is large, it can feel tiny if the larger pool bores you. However the pool is still a very Hawaiian esque landscape, and every fun to enjoy. It is the main draw to the resort. Restaurants: While we were at the Hyatt one of the restaurants was under construction, which made dining limited. However i had stayed here once before and remember the dining at that particular restaurant to be Asian food, and was very good for the cheap price. The main casual place to eat is Umalu, an informal place with live entertainment at night, sit down lunch, and poolside service too. The place is good food, but as with all Hyatt food it was expensive, and if you are a bargain hunter try to include dining in your package when you go to Hawaii. The main restaurant is the Swan Court which also has a buffet breakfast. The place is great for dinner, but when we were there it was like a ghost town by eight thirty. However the food is excellent, with nice wine selection, and the steak and pastas are simply incredible. Room: We had an upgrade to an ocean view in the atrium tower, but all the rooms overlook the ocean to some degree (don't complain if you have a view of one of the parking lots, chances are you also have an ocean view to the side). the Mountain view rooms was one I had two years ago when i stayed at the Hyatt for business and it was excellent but the rooms were recently renovated. The beds are like all Hyatt beds, a bit low to the ground, but also very large and comfortable. The rooms are expensive, but booking a package is what i recommend. The bathrooms are large size for Hawaii and the view we had over the ocean and pool was like out of postcard or a travel website. Simply suburb even for the price. All in all the Hyatt Maui is a very nice place. Yes like all Hawaii places it is expensive but judging the hotel itself at that press time, the Hyatt Maui is great. It does have a long drive to its property, the long walks to Whalers Village are a bit of a downer but the resort feels more like an escape than anything else. The beachfront is generous further down the property towards but not quite at the Marriott next door. The pool is great for the Kaanpali area and is the largest besides the Westin, and the most artistic pool out of all of the them. The dining is great, and with the latest restaurant revamped, or at least i heard it was, the Hyatt will have no trouble being compared to the Wailea resorts down the road. The resort is a great place to relax, and I hope i helped anybody looking for to stay on Maui!

Our travel agent booked us a partial ocean view room because she said it is very common to get an upgrade to ocean front on your honeymoon. This was not the case for us and our view from room 2001 (main tower) wasn't anything special. The room itself seemed great at first glance - sitting area with a couch, table & chairs, flat-screen tv, duvet cover on bed, refrigerator, etc. But once we looked closely, there were stains on the countertops & mirrors, there was a substantial gap under the door which was weird since nobody else seemed to have a big gap. When I called the front desk to ask why we didn't have a weather strip under our door when everyone else seemed to have one - they told me to shove towels under the crack so insects, etc. won't crawl into our room. My husband was disgusted that the front desk told me to shove towels under the door rather than fixing the situation by installing a weather strip everyone else had. When he confronted the front desk, they offered to fix it the next day, and gave us a $50 credit for lunch by the pool. We actually couldn't open our door wall and let the breeze come through the room UNLESS we shoved towels under the door - because the door would bang loudly. Very frustrating. In addition to the problem with the door, our refrigerator was broken. After arguing back and forth with the girl at the front desk about it being broken (she insisted that we hit the cool down button too many times), we finally had someone come up to confirm what we already knew - it was broken!!!! Then, after making many calls, they decided to have someone remove the stuff from our mini bar refrigerator so we can use that one. Turns out the mini bar will lock you out after a certain period of time, so after loading our groceries inside it we had to wait the next day (for about 30 minutes) for a maintenance guy to unlock our own fridge so we could get it all out. UGH!!!!! WE ARE ON OUR HONEYMOON!!!! Talk about being inconvenienced! We should have complained about the refrigerator but it was our honeymoon and we didn't want to concentrate on the negatives especially after having an amazing time in Kauai & in Oahu before arriving in Maui. The grounds were beautiful. The breakfast buffet was AWESOME. We were very happy that we booked the package that included breakfast. The beach in front of the hotel seemed too rocky for us. We just walked down towards the Marriott (right at the edge of the Hyatt property), laid our blankets down on the grassy area and swam there. It worked great for us. We brought our cooler there since it wasn't part of the Hyatt waitstaff area. The food in Maui wasn't as good as Kauai or Oahu but we had our best meal at Roy's in Maui. Leilani's was horrible. The fish was hard as a rock! The Old Lahaina Luau was fantastic but the food wasn't anything to write home about. Sansei Sushi near the Ritz was AWESOME and they have great deals on sushi on Friday nights I believe. Check out their website before going. Can't wait to go back to Hawaii...

The people are very friendly, the rooms are nice and the location was pretty central to all the fabulous restaurants and things to do on Maui.

There are a wonderful assortment of animals including all sorts of birds (parrots, penguins, swans). The pool there is nice. There is a section primarily geared towards kids with caves, waterfall, slides and a shallower wading area. We stayed on the club floor which is nice so the kids could get a cold drink whenever.

So overall very family friendly. They have a takeout option at some of the hotels restaurant and the sushi was very good. Rooms are not particularly large and I would recommend requesting a mountain view or FULL ocean view. The only disappointment was the lack of beach on the grounds. Immediately right behind the hotel is a very narrow strip of sand and the waves can be rough. If you walk a little towards Whaler's village/Sheraton they have much nicer access to the beach and a protected cove with gentler waves which are much safer for the kids.

The rooms were very nice and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN - which is a major plus because I am a germaphobe. Extremely spacious with a mini fridge that we used to store our snacks and water bottles. Definitely utilize the Safeway grocery store 5 minutes up highway 31 (as the hotel can be pricey) and be sure to sign up for their discount card if you are interested in saving a few dollars. For a partial ocean view room, our view was spectacular (60% ocean, 40% resort/golf course). I can't recall our room number, but it was on the 8th floor of the Napili building. The grounds of the Hyatt are immaculate. There is basically an exotic zoo inside the lobby surrounded by beautiful landscaping. Every morning we would head down to the Starbucks for our coffee and just enjoy the view of the ocean. Definitely eat at the sushi restaurant if you are into that - it was great. Umalu and Sonz were also delicious. My only gripe with Sonz would be during the breakfast buffet, tons of birds were flying overhead and would often leave droppings, which was gross. I wish the Hyatt would do something about this.. otherwise, the food was pretty good. To sum it up, we had an absolute wonderful vacation and could not be happier that we stayed at the Hyatt.

We met several people around the pool. We had breakfast each morning included - exquisite view and incredible selection and service! I took advantage of the complementary water aerobic classes - fun! Overall the hotel was super pretty but a little impersonal. The food was delicious and the room was comfortable. You will need to walk down to the Marriott or the Westin for a good swimming beach. The beach is beautiful to look at by the Hyatt but not much sand and it is a little rocky. There is a walkway that takes you past all of the hotels and leads to the shopping mall called Whalers Village with lots of good choices for dinner.. I think you can't go wrong staying here but if we returned we might try the Marriott or the Westin - that way you have the swimming beach and you are closer to Whaler's Viillage.

My parents were also staying at this property during all but 1 night of our stay and Jeff at check-in was extremely helpful and went out of his way to get us connecting Oceanfront Club rooms, which we greatly appreciated. I had remembered his name from TripAdvisor when we checked in and was relieved when he was the one that assisted us. The ladies working in the Regency Club was very friendly as well and always remembered my son's name when we went in there for snacks. The Regency Club breakfast was as good as the overpriced buffet, although since the buffet was included in our room rate we felt like we needed to eat it every day. The food at the breakfast buffet was mediocre at best and if it wouldn't have been included in our room rate, we would not have eaten it more than the first day. Our son normally loves pancakes and sausage but wouldn't touch the rubber pancakes and pink-tinged sausage on the buffet. Swan Court is truly straight ouf of a scene from \"The Birds,\" where if you leave the table for a second, the birds gobble up any bread products left on the plate (However, they too stay away from the pancakes/sausage)! We checked out on Father' s Day and the birds were sure to give my Dad a \"present\" down his back - assumingly from a bird who sampled the sausage. The pool area was very nice with the waterfalls, basketball hoop, and water slide. Our son just loved the kid's slide. Keith the lifeguard was great and talked with the kids all the time. The rest of the guards were more or less like sleeping mimes. The hotel looks slightly dated but the grounds are actually quite nice and the view from our room was wonderful. If you want the view, be sure to book an Oceanfront Club room (highest 2 floors looking straight out to the ocean/island of Lanai). We rented 2 cabanas one day and although we had them from 8-5, it wasn't \"prepared\" until close to 10:00 and Camp Hyatt decided to do what looked like an archeological dig directly in front of us for an hour on the beach. I'm assuming they didn't find much! My dad and I got in the ocean for a couple hours. This was not a great area for swimming, as the ocean floor ceased to be sand once you got more than 10 feet from the shore. It felt more like a mixture of extremely sharp coral and volcanic rock. Overall, we got lots of wonderful pictures and enjoyed our stay here. We didn't eat at the other hotel restaurants but you're a short drive to Lahaina or walk to Whaler's Village, where there's plenty to do. We golfed at Kapalua Bay and it was awesome as always and was in much better shape than the one right next to the Hyatt. We also rode the Sugar Cane Trane in Lahaina and our son enjoyed it. The prices of everything were of course fairly outrageous but that was to be expected. The $25 resort fee should really be tacked on to the room rate if the hotel needs it that badly because otherwise the guests definitely feel ripped off. The Wi-Fi was at least 10 times slower than the Internet on my cell phone but I didn't need it anyway. Due to the prime location, kid's pool area, and for the most part the very helpful and friendly staff, I would recommend this hotel to families traveling with children.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "travelblog3", "ReviewID": "UR114710409", "Content": "A wonderful hotel for family as well as children.

Whoever our housekeeper was, we tipped her big because she came in when we came out and straightened up after us a couple of times each day and being a mother of two on a vacation with my hubby, I really appreciated this. Beach is secluded but small. We didn't mind. We just wanted water to cool off and we only laid out a couple of times because we were busy elsewhere. The grounds - can't say enough about how well they are kept and how beautiful. We walked during our downtimes and during the fifth night found a few spots we had missed. I loved saying \"hi\" to the penguins in the morning and seeing which birds we could watch and talk to that day. We don't mind walking so loved the location - secluded but within walking distance of whaler's village. Fifteen to twenty minute walk to shops/restaurants on a beautfiul walkway by the ocean. Because we took this numerous times, we saw other resort lawns and were VERY glad we stayed at the Hyatt! Oh and if you can - get breakfast included. It was in our deal and thank goodness. We at a $60.00 breakfast every morning to a wonderful view of swans swimming, flamingos loitering and a wonderful man-made waterfall. It is an open air restaurant so there are birds. I had to laugh when I saw a reviewer complain about the birds. HELLO? Didn't you read reviews - open air restaurants means birds will be around. We loved that though. They didn't bother us, none pooped on anyone while we were there, and it's not like they were flocking to tables - they were just here and there and we enjoyed watching them.

The staff were all very nice and the location was great.

We went in the middle of June and the crowd was pretty evenly split among younger couples, families with kids and older couples, with most of the kids at their own pool. The beach is about 5 feet away and very nice. The only downside was the cost of food and the lack of alternatives. It's a hotel districts, so your food choices are often limited to other hotel food and their prices. I think Burgers were about $15-$18 each. Beers were $6. Cocktails were $12. So, for two burgers, fries, two drinks and a tip, you're looking at $60. The buffet breakfast was $18 each. The rooms have a mini fridge and there's a grocery story five minutes away for you to stock up on simple stuff. That being said, everything we ate from the hotel restaurants was great. One bit of advice, you can buy sports bottles at the hotel's Umalu market for $19. With that you can fill them up with unlimited juice and soda for the rest of the trip from their soda/juice fountain.

My wife and I do not have kids, so we do not want to be splashed or bothered by kids when sitting (and paying for umbrella chairs) at the adult pool. - Expensive - Room service menu and restaurant menus come from the same restaurant. Prices are not only higher (to be expected), but standard items become a la carte items when ordering the room service (i.e. French fries with sandwiches are included at the restaurant but become a la carte for room service). A general commentary for Hawaii; if you are a couple and can keep yourself interested, go to Kauai. It is quieter, more romantic, more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-guided\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, less touristy, and lusher.

The reviews seemed excellent since recent renovations were completed. I am a Hilton Honors member and was a bit nervous staying at a non-Hilton property because Hilton is almost always exceptional. Stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island last year and felt it was going to be hard for a resort to compete with this \"ultra-mega\" exceptional resort. But, my hats off to the Hyatt Regency Maui. Our stay, with some minor exceptions was wonderful from check-in to check out. The recent renovations, although not luxury, are only a small step below. The property is gorgeous and well kept. The staff, with very rare exception, were attentive, extremely polite and welcoming. Janice at check-in made the process quick and got us to our room quickly. She was excellent. The renovated deluxe ocean view room, although a bit smaller than I would have liked, was roomy enough for my family of four and nicely appointed. The pool was fantastic. Had read reviews about the beach being too small. Maybe, just in front of the pool, but just past the cabanas was big enough with plenty of beach for the kids to play and the sand in the water was not rocky until quite a ways out. The 150 foot water slide was a hit with the kids. My daughter is barely under 48' tall. Thanks to Josh and Emily and there excellent judgement she was given a wrist band and had a ball on the slide. I still have a problem with the policy as I know a number of kids who are 50\" tall who would have floundered at the end of the slide as a child's height has nothing to do with having the ability to swim. And although Tim (another lifeguard) was hesitant about allowing her on the slide (and offered some lame explanation about the policy on the third day and some big Hawaiian dude who wasn't very pleasant on the second day, with some assertiveness on my part, she rode the slide daily and was fine (as I knew she would be as she is a very good swimmer. You people need to tell your attorneys/policymakers to rethink this absurd policy. Nonetheless, Josh and Emily were awesome. They remembered us by name throughout our day and deserve commendations for their outstanding customer service. Tim and the \"big hawaiian dude\" need to be informed that they should get the corn cobs out of their \"you know whats\" (That is for the customer service people at Hyatt who I'm certain will read this review). The frequent complimentary Otter Pops daily were a nice touch. The only other issue we had was some small issues with housekeeping. On the second day, went to our room after a day at the beach to clean up an 3:40PM and the room had not been serviced. Some other issues with the quality of housekeeping as well. Addressed my concerns to the manager. They arranged a specific time for our room to be cleaned daily. Tim, the housekeeping manager took care of my concerns and was very receptive to my issues. He sent us a small gift basket for our troubles as well. Thanks Tim. Just the kind of thing you would expect at a 4 or 5 star property. A very nice touch. The food was very good. Although there are great places outside of Hyatt to eat, and mostly ate off property, did dine at all the restaurants and enjoyed them all. Expensive, but what on Maui isn't? Breakfast buffet would have been a huge waste of money as we could have never eaten $100 of breakfast a day, but was included with the room for all four of us. Very nice spread of food, fresh fruit, hot items, etc. Just not worth $100 a pop for four people. Have an issue with the resort fee as should be included in the price of the room. And the wi-fi you get for the resort fee, in a word, sucked. To charge for the better broadband wi-fi is really crappy. And the self parking was a struggle daily. Should have a gate for hotel guests only with non-gated for public beach access. All in all, a fantastic stay.

The restaurant Japengo which is part of the resort was quite possibly my favorite while in Maui (We experienced some pretty good restaurants Pacific'O & Lahaina Grill). Japengo provided excellent sushi, seafood and wine as well as impeccable service. The entire restaurant, much like the Hyatt itself, is open to the outdoors allowing for breathtaking views of the ocean and sunsets. The pool was a great spot to cool off and get some sun. Drinks were available from both poolside wait staff and \u00c5\u00aamalu (the restaurant attached to the pool area) There is a full bar under the waterfall, however we never found ourselves there. One downside to the pool was the lack of lounge chairs come 12pm. Its a great place to be and everyone seems to agree. Be prepared to do some searching to find two empty chairs together. Spa Moana is an experience. Total relaxation. A great facility located right on the water and short walk from the lobby & pool. Massages, steam rooms, hot tubs, saunas & gym.

It is located near Lahaina which has lots of restaurants and shopping. My room was nice, but not extraordinary. There is a daily resort fee of $25 which is pretty standard at resort hotels, but I was very annoyed that you have to pay $$$ for using the business center internet. They do have free WiFi in the room, but I didn't bring my laptop. Shouldn't this be included in the resort fee? I think so. After the 1st day, I found out that in the town of Lahaina, there are some very cheap internet cafes. Much better deal even including the high end cost of gas in Maui. The hotel has several restaurants, but no quick sandwich place. There are 2 sundry stores that carry snacks and souveniers. Umalu is the more casual restaurant on the property and it has a great location where you are outside overlooking the ocean. The food is good though a little expensive. Walking distance from the hotel (about 10 minutes) is Whaler's Village shopping center which has several good restaurants. I particularly liked Hula Grill. I worked with the concierge (Jiang) on some activities. She planned some very good excursions. Snorkeling with the non-profit Pacific Whale group was excellent. Molikini and Turtle Bay. Saw lots of tropical fish and sea turtles. They were very helpful to a novice snorkler. The Road to Hana trip with Valley Isle Excursions with Tim as the driver/tour guide was awesome. There were 11 people in the group, so not too big. Tim was full of interesting information and clearly enjoyed being with the group. He showed everyone the best photo ops and took pictures of anyone who wanted to have photos taken. The drive is long and stressful and I'd definitely recommend taking the tour instead of doing the drive. I used Polynesian Adventure for a drive to Mt Haleakala for sunrise. This particular tour I would not recommend. The driver drove well and had lots of information, but was the single most boring, monotone guide I have ever had.

Since it's the end of the boardwalk, its not as heavily traveled as some of the other hotels on the beach. Essentially, the closer that you get to the Whaler's Village, the more crowded is the boardwalk. I appreciated that it was less crowded. The staff was right on target for me. Professional, yet casual as you would expect in Hawaii. The poolside restaurant, Umalu, provides consistent and good food. The food in general on Maui is expensive and the food at the Hyatt is no different. Expect to pay around $20 (per person) for casual meals and $40 for dinners. We ate at many of the boardwalk restaurants and Umalu was the best or among the best. The Maui onion rings were unbelievably good. (note: for some of the best cheap eats on the island go to Okazuya at 3600-D L. Honoapiilani Rd.)

No need to worry about food and beverages...the service at the cabanas is timely. If you want privacy...choose cabana #24. It's a small thing, but the safe in the walk in closet (yep, a walk in closet) is at eye level and extremely convenient. What was less than good. There were times when the water in the shower would suddenly get cold...very cold. This is not something that I would expect from a Hyatt. The AC unit is against the opposite wall from the bed.

This pool flows through a CAVE (yee-ah!) past the pool bar into the other smaller pool which is really just on the way to the awesome adult water slide. * The adult water-slide --- normally they are boring and safe but this one was fantastic. I think I did it 20 times altogether! It is a tube, so its dark, and shoots you out pretty quickly at the bottom. Quick tip: keep your body straight as a board with your back arched....you'll fly! * The gardens around the pools were fantastic; there is a drawbridge over the smaller pool which is pretty cool * Wildlife. Meet Spike and Fluff the birds on the Napali Tower - they are super cool. Then there are the Penguins and the Parrots and the Swans.... Other tips: The beach here isn't very nice and the public beach adjacent that the hotel recommends wasn't very nice either. Either head up towards the Westin or plan a day away from the Hotel. Also, Valet parking was $18/night ... if you are a do-it-yourselfer self parking is free and just a short walk from the main entrance.

I will start with the positives first: 1. The staff at this hotel were fantastic - extremely friendly and helpful - especially Jeff on the front desk who was very welcoming and professional. 2. The grounds of this hotel are beautiful - the gardens, waterfalls and wildlife were beautifully maintained and was by far the most attractive hotel on that strip of the island. The location of the hotel was also very good - only a short walk away from other hotel restaurants and the local shopping complex. 3. We booked an Ocean Front room with a balcony and the view was impressive - of both the beach/sea and the hotel gardens! 4. The facilities in the room were very good. The High Speed Internet was reliable, and there was a fridge that you could use for storing your own food/beverages, and a facility to boil water for tea/coffee. 5. We hired our own car and the hotel provided FREE car parking which was fantastic. All other hotels I have stayed at always charge for parking. 6. Finally the Buffet Breakfast was excellent - well worth including this in your room rate as it can set you back $30-40 a day otherwise. The dinner at Swan Court was also delicious - thumbs up for the food. The negatives for the hotel are as follows: 1. The bathroom in our room was very outdated and not at a 5* standard - considering we paid for a Deluxe Ocean Front Room, at a much higher rate than their standard room. The bath/shower was not clean and was showing its age. The bathroom was also too small and cramped and could only have one person in it at a time. 2. The recreational space for the guests around the pool is limited (considering the number of rooms that this hotel has). The pool was always very noisy and you could not enjoy a couple of quiet hours sitting by the pool. Not good for people seeking R&R. 3. The beach front sun loungers can only be used after you pay a rental fee. For a 5* hotel with expensive room rates, it would be nice if the price for these lonugers were included. 4. There are a number of resort taxes that you need to be aware of, and we only found these out during check in/out.

I have been to this hotel 3 times and originally in 1985 when it was new. It is still a beautiful hotel with a great staff and the best value on the beach for this type of property. While I agree that there is some wear and tear on the carpet in the elevators, some wood moldings around doorways that have nicks here and there overall it is still a very nice hotel with a great pool and location. It is very close to Lahina and Whalers Village ( 15 minute walk) for shopping and eating . The restaurants on site are good but more pricy than those on the beach or in Lahina and Lahina has some great sunset views as well. However the portions are filling and not way out there in price. We stayed on the Regency Club floor water front .The morning breakfast, evening appetizers and snacks were fantastic as well as the service and friendliness of the staff ( shout out to lisa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122lani hope I spelt it correct ) . I am told it is now owned by the Marriott but run by Hyatt which originally concerned me since I always put the Hyatt at the top tier of the hotel chain properties. It is still a great place regardless. The beach has a lot of erosion and at low tide difficult to use due to coral, but a short walk down the beach solves that issue if you prefer the beach to pool. The concierge is great booked us a zip line and Helicopter tour with very convenient times or locations. They also have a Scuba program that will allow training in the pool and then a guided dive to about 25 feet with your instructor off of the beach. Rob the instructor was great, took underwater photos, as we saw sea turtles and other tropical fish right off of the hotel. Conversely we left here and went to the Grand Weilea for 3 days to play in the pool there ( I have been there 3 times as well ). At the Grand Weilea , they require all cars are valet parked $20 ( not incl tip), use a computer to print boarding passes $13 ( Hyatt provides for free all set up with all the airlines as well as parking options ) and have lined the activity pool with Cabanas to squeeze yet more out of you after paying $650+ a night to stay there with water view room . The Hyatt has a policy ( and a good one at that ) for the pre-dawn chair grabbers that put a book or towel down as a base of operations and then disappear for hours that they will check and if the chair is vacant an hour or more after they have left a note , they will remove the items and make it available. The beach is long and activities abound. If you are looking for a Hotel in this category that you want to get a bang for your buck when you are spending $550 or more a night, this is the place .

We checked in on April 16th with no hassle and stayed until the 23rd. The resort grounds were clean and well kept. The staff was helpful and attentive, as they should be as this is considered a more high end and pricey resort. Every day we were at the pool. The worst part of the resort is not the staff or the facilities, but the guests. Often times, people would leave articles at the pool side lounges to \"reserve\" them. So if you want to head to the pool, make sure you do so early. Sometimes, we would see these \"reserved\" chairs remain empty from 8 in the morning until around lunch time. Again, not a complaint about the staff or the Hyatt but more the guests. Also, this is a family resort, so sometimes after we turned in for the night, there were kids running through the hall and screaming at each other, which did take away from our sleep quality. The resort fee had increased since our stay last year, to $25 a room/night. This became somewhat pricey as we had two rooms for the week, spending an additional $400 in fees. That said, you do get access to a coffee bar for that fee as well as wireless internet access in your rooms as no additional cost, which was a change from last year. If I have only one negative, it would be the resort fee, but I understood that fee would exist before going on vacation, so I planned for it. We did dine on site several times. Umalu's is good for informal dinners in the evening when you don't want to walk to Whaler's Village. Their flat bread pizzas are great as well as the pork tacos, certainly recommend those items. Also, dining poolside during the day was a great option and when we return, we plan to do more of that. Also, a new restaurant opened up since our last visit, called Japengo. I had recently dined in the Japengo at the San Diego Hyatt, so I recommended our family go there at least once. Just be warned, the prices are steep but you get what you pay for. Everyone was happy with the food there, even though the tab for 4 of us came out to around $140, with no drinks. My wife said their steamed local, snapper was the best fish she had ever had. I had the cashew chicken which was very good as well. I wouldn't recommend you dine there if you have young kids though, as the food and menu is more grown up. Our resort package included breakfast every day at Swan Court, which is really a great value and a good way to start the day. We did eat breakfast there every day during our stay and we were never disappointed. Just know that birds will come and visit you to try to snack on your leftovers. Some people are disgusted by this, but we had no problem with it. Again, some guests were being bad and throwing food to the birds or allowed their kids to throw food on the ground, which encourages the visits from the feathered friends. Not much the resort can do about guests, other than try to clean up quickly, and they do a good job. The buffet is around $40 a person, which is worth it, but is a better value if you get the breakfast included with your room. Some of the rooms have undergone renovation since our stay last year, which some new furniture, carpets, etc. This was a nice surprise to see the rooms refreshed. Overall, we were very happy with our second stay at this resort, and I am sure when we head to Maui again in the future, we will probably stay at this resort again, as long as the level of service that Hyatt provided remains consistent.

Upon arrival we were greeted by over-friendly staff and the check-in lady was extremely courteous and efficient. We were blown away by the foyer and lobby section featuring a giant chandelier, palm trees and a crescendo of tropical birds and plants, to name but a few. The hotel never seemed too busy or felt crowded, and you could easily acquire all types of services offered, from concierge assistance to dining. The restaurants included a Japanese and 2 pacific cuisine options, all offering fairly expansive views over the resort. The main restaurant acted as the buffet hall in the morning and doubled up as their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restaurant at night, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSonz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which unfortunately we did not try). The buffet itself was superb, which we of course grew accustomed to every morning! There was a full range of fresh cereals, fruit, breads, cakes, cold and hot foods plus most other foods on request. A feature of this buffet was that the front of the hall looked out onto the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lake and the robins, ducks and swans all frequently joined us at breakfast time! (hence the name Swan Court I imagine). Although included in our package, this buffet to non-guests of the hotel would set them back $30USD per person, so fairly costly some might say. Once settled we took a leisurely stroll around the grounds and the array of freely-walking penguins, flamingos and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSpike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (African Crane) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but to make you smile! Grassy plains, bridges and lush waterfalls adorn the exterior which really made this an idyllic setting, day or night. We particularly favoured the pool area which had the adult pool on one side and the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent on the opposite side, separated by a cave in the middle (with bar!), in which you could swim though waterfalls to enjoy an underground cocktail in the water! There was a water slide too which would appease the moderate thrill seekers. Our room partially overlooked the ocean by Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach, the only obscurity being some palm trees which we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too belligerent about! The bedroom/lounge and bathroom were all of satisfactory size and the chambermaids did a decent job when required. We were pleased to have a balcony also. The Expedia desk in the hotel (located at top of stairs by Swan Court) offers discounted prices to many of the islands activities and excursions and the staff there were excellent. Resort Fees include a newspaper and access to the tennis courts and gym, which has even more machines/weights than the over-priced one I pay for in England! So to summarise, the Hyatt Regency Resort and Spa in Maui is an idyllic haven of relaxation and bliss, with a plethora of superb service.

Some of the wallpaper seams are loose as an example. We had some issues with the TV reception that was fixed but it took a couple of calls. Our biggest negitive is the size of the pools and the associated pool area. Because this facility can hold the number of people that it can, the chairs in both the pool areas are on top off one another. Our group had 500 people as an example, and at the high times for the pool, there were not enough lounge chairs and the ones they had are literly inches apart. This was not a big deal for us because everyone knew each other. But if I was a family visiting and had to be this close to a group of strangers, it would feel like Coney Island.

They clearly did some updating but the overall effect was still 1980. For years I have wanted to stay at this hotel and we got it for $150 per night through Priceline! So, that was good. The hotel gardens are very nice now BUT the two waterslides were closed for repairs. There are NO steps into the adult main pool. One woman got herself down the ladder but was very concerned about hauling herself up as she had just had shoulder surgery. The only steps were in the bar area where you had to swim around the waterfall. Here's the big disappointment: Swan Court. We loved Swan Court and have had brunch there for years even if we did not stay at the hotel. The railings leading from the entrance to the lower seating are cheap painted metal and are extremely chipped. Good grief! That is a star in this hotel. Furniture is sun bleached, breakfast marginal. $28.95! Even the swans stayed away. So, for dinner, we went elsewhere.

Second time, we had a partial ocean view which was nice. Overlooked the luau! Free show from the baby balcony. First check-in resulted in Hyatt Gold Passport points for our meal charges and stay credit. Second time, no. Beds were just OK, nothing like a Westin Heavenly Bed.

The pools, the water slide, the grotto...it was a kid's dream-come-true! One day last June I was surfing around Costco's Travel site, and found a killer deal for the Hyatt on Maui. Without hesitation I purchased 12 nights for my family (son age 9 and daughter age 6). Perhaps I should have done more research because upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely sound of jackhammers and nail guns! The slide was closed, the pool was filthy (broken pump), and the ocean front room I splurged for overlooked the massive construction project! I have to admit that all the construction really did ruin our stay at this marvelous hotel. And the worst part was that the staff (well, some of the staff) were very rude and defensive about it all. When getting towels one day, I asked if anyone knew when the water slide would be fixed, and one of the men behind the counter very rudely said, \"we're on a volcano in the middle of the ocean--things don't happen quickly here lady!\" Another time I was ready to move hotels because I couldn't take anymore jackhammers, and the woman at the front desk assured me that the construction would stop for the weekend. Her exact words were, \"Hang in there one more day!\" When one pays a fortune to stay at a nice resort, one should not have to \"hang in there!\" As it turned out, the construction continued right through the weekend and we even had the added bonus of a pressure washer! Just writing this review is making me angry again! Phew...now that I'm all upset, let me talk about the bright spots: 1. The rooms are gorgeous! We had a Deluxe Ocean Front with 2 beds, and it was perfect for our family of 4. Not crowded at all. LOVED the decor. The rooms were far better than I expected. 2. The Swan Court breakfast is amazing!! It was included in our package (thank goodness--it would have cost our family about $100 a day otherwise!). The kids were in awe and couldn't wait to get up and eat breakfast. Many people complained about the birds in their reviews, but they didn't bother us at all. Provided entertainment for the kids. 3. The parrots, fish ponds, and penguins were adored by the kids. The Hyatt does a great job of letting people feed and play with the animals. We thoroughly enjoyed them. 4. The location is wonderful. Kaanapali Beach is definitely the place to stay with kids. Yes, the Hyatt beach has eroded and it's smaller than the other hotels, but we still had a great time making sand castles and playing there. It never bothered us one little bit. 5. The food was fantastic at all of the restaurants. Umalu makes the best ahi salad and sushi rolls. And anything with the pulled pork was to die for! 6. I think we would have loved the Hyatt if there had not been construction going on. Sure, some of the staff is a little \"snooty,\" but most of them are very friendly and make up for the others. We're actually excited to return next year and see how it is without the chaos and noise. We got a tip that in June Costco usually runs a Kaanapali special, so we're keeping our fingers crossed that it's for the Hyatt.

We had a massive ant infestation in our rental car on day 3 of our 7 day trip due to the valet parking our rental SUV right on an anthill and after repeated requests they still never cleaned it out. I did not expect such lack of care at what is supposed to be a nice hotel chain. I asked for help on the 2nd day the car was brought to me by the valet full of ants(how could you not see them they where EVERYWHERE even my 3 yo was squishing them while in her car seat) and after waiting for 15 min I just drove off and wiped the car down myself. the next day we were assured they would clean out the car, but again thy brought it back full of ants. Finally they offered to just drive us to our dinner reservation, which they booked for us(yes we did tip the concierge for that) and upon arrival we found out they hosed up and booked us for two nights later(we were leaving the next day). The beds were awful as well, my back still hurts! The kid pool needs some upgrades/replacement of the turtles and dolphin which all showed wear and tear exposing the foam inside(yuck and not sanitary). The only thing I can say we liked is the Cobb salad, the gourmet PB&J we kept ordering from the poolside cafe and their BLT&A was awesome although both were way overpriced. We did have a few nice encounters with the in room dining gentlemen and housekeeping ladies. They were all very kind to my 3 year old and left her lots of chocolates and bird cards and were very fast to respond and thorough to clean up a broken glass in our room which was totally my fault. We also liked the bird tour and feeding the Koi everyday at 0900.

But I would stay in off season next time I go.\u201d", "Author": "MelissaBradley", "ReviewID": "UR94078722", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel during the begging of the summer time, I think in June but not sure of the exact date. This is traditionally one of the busiest times for Maui visitors and during our stay the hotel was packed, as were all the hotels there. We traveled with business associates and our families of young kids. We each stayed in Ocean View rooms with a King bed. The rooms were large with pull out \"bed' couches in each living room. They felt like mini suites. The view was really only from the balcony but when you were out there it was dead ahead and beautiful. However, the hotel is very large and the property on which it is situated has expansive grounds so the ocean is actually pretty far from the hotel rooms in most cases. So, I like to break it down into The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. So away we go... The Good The rooms we stayed in were clean, smelled clean (important to me as many hotel rooms smell musty or moldy) well furnished and spacious. The room looked recently refurbished, it had nice dark wood floors and plantation shutters that opened up to the Lani. The rooms also had lovely bathrooms. Even though this is called an Ocean view King room, it was very large with a living area. The \"Ocean View\" is really when you are on the balcony and not to visible from the room. This was fine for us as we were not spending a lot of time in the room. However, be cautious of this because if you are sitting in the room or on the bed their really isn't much of a view. The hotel had plenty of decent restaurants but all were very crowded and service was hit and miss. The cleaning staff, bell service, concierge, etc. all was average as far as service. The Bad If you only travel to Hawaii occasionally you might want to avoid the \"peak' months for a hotel such as this one. You have to consider how many rooms they have here and when it is sold out or nearly sold out how many people will be sharing the common areas, such as the beach and the pools. The place place was uncomfortable to me with so many people. The pool was a mess. It actually gave me anxiety to be there. The Ugly OK.. the pool architecture looks really cool with the man made rocks, caves and waterfalls, but send a group of little kids in there and you are asking for trouble . It's hard to keep track of where they are. They get lost fast and the \"caves\" have slippery, slimy floors that little kids can easily fall on. Mine fell multiple times. I think it would be perfect for the preteens and teens . They all seemed to be having a ball. The kiddie area of the pool. called the Keiki Lagoon ( age 5 and under crowd), again, looks really cool, as it is shallow and has sand like a beach that leads into the pool area. This part of the pool was so over crowded with diaper wearers and the water was really too warm to be comfortable which leads me to the \"yucky\" part. Here it is ... there are hundreds of people at the pool, and the bathroom, in the cave near the pool is almost always empty or nearly empty. Do I need to explain more? I think not. Hectic is the word I would use to describe the pool scene at the hotel. Another factor for over crowding I believe is that many people walking by on the path from nearby hotels spot the pool and just \"crash' it even though they are not guests. There are \"guest room police\" constantly monitoring the situation, but in the baby pool it was ridiculous. Too many people! And do you want to wait in line everyday for your wrist band to prove you are a guest? I think they have to pool to close to public access, but you can't really move a pool very easily so I suppose that problem is not going to go away. Conclusion: In defense of the hotel, all of the hotels along this strip seem to have the same issues with crowds . We had lunch at the neighboring hotels and it was ditto for the scene. This hotel however seems to have the best pool, with the \"cave\" bar, waterfalls, and the huge water slide(s) . I plan to bring my kids back to this hotel when they are in the preteen years. I'll grin and bear the crowds, or most likely come back in off season. Also, as far as hotels in Kaanapali area, as apposed to Waliea. I think this is one of the nicest hotels in Kaanapali. Kaanapali has a lot of stuff to do, Waliea, is more quiet and less crowded but is much more expensive. Kaanapali probably makes more sense for most familes. If you do go to Waliea everything, and I mean everthing costs more. So your trip ends up costing a lot more. Could be nearly doulble the price or more, for many things like restaurants, sundries, etc.. If you thought this review was helpful you might want to check out my other reviews.

If you walk all the way down to the spa, there is an area of beach connected to the larger, public access beach, where Hyatt has 14 chairs and 5 umbrellas to rent. They are also first come, first serve in the morning. This means that you have a nice, sandy, large, virtually uninhabited beach with the benefits of a chair and an umbrella, all of which you'll probably share with a maximum of 13 people. I never saw any kids here and the noise from the pool area didn't exist. I thought it was as close to a private beach as I'll ever get and I loved it. No bar service but worth a short walk for the peace and quiet. Ask for a room in the Lahaina tower and you'll be closer to your room from this spot too.

We reserved an ocean view at a premium and did not get the Regency Club floors. Why? We were never informed as to the reason(s). Information and security is questionable at this Hyatt. Our initial \"ocean view\" consisted of a partial view, two large palm trees with ocean view between the fronds when the wind blows. I got down to the front desk to get another room and the room had this overly loud musician attempting to sing \"Brown eyed girl\" blazing, the second choice was better. Somewhere between the first room and the second choice while moving rooms, I left my stainless steel diver's watch. I called Security, who promised to call and leave a message with status. No Security called or did they just keep it? All I can tell you is that it was hectic and disorganized place. I was more of a bother to them. The presentation of the hotel is typical Hyatt but aged. The economy must have really hurt the hotel because they are not keeping up with the cleanliness of the elevators or the brass. The front lobby entry sofas are sagging and not pristine. The \"Alohas and Mahalos that I keep hearing from staff are all hollow or said with a plastic smile. The rooms are smaller and the shower smelled of mildew. I complained but nothing was done to remedy the situation. The Regency Club meal deal was never presented to me as an option and when I inquired, I was not qualified because I was on vacation and not on business....rather than make a disappointing situation worse, I elected to be a \"local\" and just sleep at the Hyatt instead of \"resorting\" there. My gain, their loss. In the 7 days, the room was cleaned 4 times. My wife had to call the front desk for towels which came a few hours later at least a couple of times. So I am not impressed with this abnormal service by Hyatt which typically is first class. So, I took care of the ocean view, dealt with the loss of my wrist watch, sucked it up on the lack of security or room service. Now let's consider the rest and leisure situation. Remember that loud singer that drones out attempted songs loudly so you can't sleep? The volume is way too loud. The volume of bad singing drowns out the ocean and perhaps the party types that aren't feeling any pain can handle the screeching. The Luau at the Hyatt is So So. You would need to power down a half dozen free Mai tai-s or Sunburns to make the show better. The astronomy roof top experience? Let's face it. It's just trying to be something its not. My wife and I walked to other hotels in the area and found them to be dated both in appearance and the people. The cost of the room was nearly $700 per night for seven nights after all the additional Gold Platinum Member privileges. What people do not realize is that the fees are tacked on that may over a hundred dollars more a night. You pay $25 for Internet per day which is also tied to other privileges that one would never use or should be paying for. Let's talk parking. It's $15 a day once you keep you vehicle overnight the first night until you depart. The best thing to do is to valet the car to unload and before 10PM move the car to the parking lot next driveway to the left on the public beach access parking lot with the Hyatt tag on your rear view mirror.

I'm not much of a pool person which was just as well because there aren't enough loungers and they get mostly taken by people with towels around 7 in the morning. The only ones left were in awful places with no easy access to either the pool or the beach. The alternative was to pay for a cabana which again did not have access to the beach. We didn't eat at the hotel at all except for the Luau (much better than the one at the Hilton in Waikiki) as it was all very expensive for what it looked like, but Lahaina offers a lot of choice so I was happy to be forced out of the hotel grounds. The grounds are really beautiful and well taken care of, as are all the buildings. The housekeeping staff is fantastic and everything is really clean. The cocktail bar next to the penguins pool was always empty but we stopped there one night and they served us amazing cocktails so well worth giving it a go.

As Diamond Passport, we were assigned an ocean front room with Regency Club access, but not on the Regency Club floors. We have stayed at this property many times in the past eighteen years and can say that we can rely on the fact that our experience at this resort to be much the same every time. The Hyatt Regency Maui may be a four-star rated property, but it is definitely not in the same class as the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua or the Four Seasons, Grand Wailea or Fairmont Kea Lani, all in the southern area of Maui which has a totatlly different aura from the Lahaina and Ka'anapali areas. The Pros: Great location in Ka'anapali, minutes walking to Whaler's Village, minutes driving to Lahaina. There is plenty of activity in this area including shopping, water activities, and restaurants that run the gamut from cheap and authentic to moderate and delicious to very expensive and overrated. The hotel itself was built in the 80s, but the property and grounds are pristine. The pool complex has everything to satisfy the entire family, from waterfalls to waterslides, to a grotto bar. The penguins, parrots, swans and ducks that grace the property are entertaining and make the HR Maui feel very tropical. Rooms are tastefully decorated from a fairly recent remodel and have flat-screen TVs. Beds are extremely comfortable. Service is efficient and friendly from check-in to check-out, but not over the top. Dining options have actually gotten better recently with the addition of Japengo (Pacific Rim) where the old Cascades was located. The space is beautiful with indoor and outdoor dining options, an outdoor bar an indoor sushi bar. Our food there was superb although service was a little slow, but I won't complain because they did not rush us and that seems to be the norm more than the exception at many restaurants these days. Umalu is another nice outdoor dining option. We had lunch here quite a few times. Food is good, but definitely on the pricey side for what you receive. Son'z at Swan Court was a great dinner experience and we highly recommend it for not only the food, but the service and atmosphere. It is now part of the same group that owns Nick's Fishmarket at the Kea Lani and Sorrento's. We had the breakfast buffet included in two of our paid nights. If you can get breakfast included, it is worth it if you are big breakfast eaters . . . there is plenty of variety, eggs made to order, an abundance of pastries, fruit and other hot items. Plus, the coffee is delicious! If you can upgrade to Regency Club, it is so worth it. Everyone who works in the club has the true Aloha spirit. It is probably the main reason we come back to the Hyatt Regency Maui so often. Even in the Regency Club, the breakfast and appetizer selections have improved greatly from a couple of years ago. One thing to note, however, is that alcoholic drinks are not included . . . The Regency Club was also recently remodeled. It is quite different from the RC of days gone by with its old-style Hawaiian feel. Now, it is ultra modern with more communal areas to eat and mix with other guests. Jury is still out on this one . . . The Cons: No leis at check-in. I don't know if they just overlooked us, but the couple who checked in prior to us got lei'd. The resort fee. Like other posters, I'd rather not feel nickel and dimed. Why not just include it in the rate? Towel Cards. It seems like everyone handing out towels has a different policy. Sometimes it is one towel per card, and sometimes they give you as many as you want. And the wristband - who wants a tan line on your wrist? Pool lounges. The first two days the place was mobbed. We had to get down to the pool by 7 am to claim chairs. The towel desk does not open until 7:30. We learned to hang on to two towels everyday until the end of the trip so that we could put them out early and go have breakfast. I also didn't see much monitoring except the first two days. Umbrellas. My biggest pet peeve. They used to have chairs with their own umbrella-like tops lining the outer parts of the pool and many moveable umbrellas that you could put up and down on your own. Now . . . fixed Palapas (stationary thatched umbrellas that don't tilt and you can't put them up or down). And there are not many of them . . . so shade is at a premium! Evening entertainment. From our main tower room we could hear the nightly entertainment until about 9 pm every night. Not great if you want to sit out on the patio and relax and listen to the surf or carry on a conversation. We could even hear the music over our TV.

This is a hard review to write, because it is so mixed. I love hotels, and I am pretty picky about rooms and service. My Hawaii favorites are the Mauna Lani (big island) and Halekulani (Oahu)--this hotel is not in that category. Though we have stayed at Hyatt Regency Kauai many times, Kea Lani, and Sheraton Maui. Don't come here expecting service of a Kimpton or Four Seasons--and it's not the Mauna Lani or Halekulani. It's just not at that level. I read the TripAdvisor reviews very carefully before booking, so my expectations were set in the right place (not too high). Some other reviewers mentioned that the staff seems unhappy. I'd say maybe burnt out. A few little tweaks that would not cost the hotel money would make this a much better hotel and a much better review. The front desk was not enthusiastic; the towel cards are silly and the staff telling me I can only have one towel (when I pay $400/night and a \"resort\" fee) is a turn-off, insulting and sets a negative tone for me--of course, I made them give me more, but why do I have to negotiate on vacation? The breakfast wait staff for the buffet was mostly terrible (a few exceptions, of course)--when I did not want the buffet (ordered off the menu), but my son ordered it, they would not let me drink his coffee--it was ridiculous, since coffee was included. The exception to the apathetic service was the housekeeping staff--they were awesome--rooms were clean, refreshed, and they were always upbeat and friendly (I do tip the housekeepers); the bell desk was fine, too. We had a room in the Napili Wing, which I think is the best location at this property--it's quieter--the main building (Atrium) is right in the thick of things, and the ocean front views there are pretty, but look over the grounds--depends what you like. If you want ocean front at this property, you will have to book it--they are unlikely to upgrade you, and, the ocean view rooms I could see were very varied in what view you would have. We sat on our balcony quite a bit, watched the whales, and listened to the ocean all night. The renovated rooms are understated and very tasteful, but not luxurious, which was fine. I thought the food was too expensive. Yes, I get it, I'm at a hotel, but a few bucks cheaper and we would have eaten there much more, so I think the hotel loses money by way overpricing the food (when we stay at the Mauna Lani, for example, we eat there quite a bit). We ordered ice cream from room service one night. Three scoops of vanilla, sauce and nuts (they did not make it look nice, no whipped cream or cherry, no water on the tray) cost $20. Seriously. I could see $12 or even $15. So we learned our lesson-no eating at the hotel. We also ate lunch at the Umalu. Again, too expensive for what it was and how it was presented, and the mahi-mahi was not fresh. We just walked down the lovely boardwalk to Leilani's and Hula Grill many nights; also ate at Star Noodle, which was wonderful. There is no swimming beach, so I think next time we'd stay at the Sheraton. However, having said all of the above, this is a beautiful property. I love the old style of the buildings, the beautiful woodwork, the decor of the common areas, and the gardens, ponds, and birds are a nice touch. The pool staff come around occasionally with frozen otter pops (complimentary) and cold towels. Those were very nice touches, which I appreciated. So, overall, it's not a bad hotel. Very relaxing atmosphere, pretty grounds and pool, decent rooms. I think if the staff were more welcoming, and were trained to be more service-oriented (Kimpton or Four Seasons style) this place has the potential to be near-perfect. Shopping in the hotel (Macys) was kind of nice!

There is that wonderful(?) resort fee of $25 which I find insulting. Just put the fee in the price of the room. It is taxed the same as everthing else, you have no choice but to pay it and it covers things like internet and the workout room. Standards these days. We had one front beach room and 2 partial beach view rooms. The rooms are clean, small, generic rooms with tiny bathrooms. The balcony was big enough for 2 chairs and a triangle table. Not much more. A positive was that they were quite sound proof so we did not hear out neighbors' conversations. Lots of pillows and the bed is fine. The housekeeping staff came at odd times of the day to clean so you never knew if the room would be freshened up when you returned at 11 or 4. The hotel promotes green living but the housekeeping staff still takes all the wet towels everyday even if you hang them so they won't. One morning my daughter was woken at 8am by housekeeping wanting to clean her room. Our AC was very noisy and maintenance came right a way and fixed it. They are so concerned about the minbar that the snacks sit on a pressurized tray and if you pick something up for more than 10 seconds it is automatically charged to your room! Guess I haven't stayed in a chain hotel in a while. The food in the restaurants was quite good. The waitstaff attentive and friendly. Drinks are very expensive and happy hour only discounts 1 beer and the mai tais (which actually came in a smaller glass so not really a bargain). The pool is large and never very busy. Guests have a habit of reserving lounge chairs with their belongings very early in the morning and then not using them til midday. The pool staff will go around and put timed notes on chairs around 10am. If the chair is not occupied in a hour they pick up the towels and belongings and keep them behind the counter. This seems very fair. I booked several day trips before we arrived through the congierge and everything was correct when we showed up. Big plus. 2 people in our party played golf at the Ka'anapli North Course which the hotel will take you to in a golf cart. Unfortunately, they did not feel it was a priority to pick them up after. After the golf course called 4 times, and waiting over a half hour, the men walked, with golf clubs, back to the hotel. The grounds are beautiful and clean. The Hyatt has several exotic birds that sit out in the fresh air daily. The view across to Lanai is lovely. Beach in front of the hotel is narrow but opens up wide in front of the Westin and Marriott. Surf is a little too rough for small kids. There is a walking path in front of all the hotels which ends at Black Rock and the Whalers Shopping area. There are several good restaurants and bars with live music. We went to the Hyatt Luau one evening and had a fun time. The show is entertaining and professional. Overall we enjoyed ourselves completely. We just felt that the hotel never gave anything extra to the guests.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAttempts to be upscale but misses the boat...\u201d", "Author": "wookiechickie", "ReviewID": "UR91887861", "Content": "I've travelled all over - I'm a 1K flyer each year and have stayed is some swanky places. I'm 32 and been to Hawaii 8 times. I'm trying to demonstrate that I'm not a novice. This trip was my first to Maui though and I booked late - we ended up at the Hyatt for the day after Christmas - Jan 3, 2011. First thing, yes it is a hectic week. Regardless, the first day that we went to the pool it was chaotic. The hot tub had about 15 children in it...more like a toilet bowl. There weren't ANY chairs and there weren't attempts being made to assist the clearing of towels 'holding chairs'. My boyfriend got the 'all you can golf' package at the golf course across the way. It's not too long of a walk (10-15 minutes), but with clubs? There wasn't a shuttle or transportation offered. I ordered an omelet one morning - 40 minutes wait in the restaurant! For an omelet? It just seemed like we were lost in the shuffle without any attempt to provide those 'things' that make spending $3500 (plus the 2k for food/golf/etc.) worth it. Oh, the the cost of food is silly, but I'll forgive that because it is typical in Hawaii/resorts. But HERE IS THE WORST PART: we paid $300 for the New Year's Luau. I've been to 2 great luaus before in Kona...this was a JOKE> it started at 9PM (VIP was sold out so we were general admission) so we got there at 8:30. We couldn't even find the end of the line...HUNDREDS of people in it. We stood (me in heels) waiting until 9:30 without the line moving. We then decided to abort and went to the onsite restaurant and ate, had a drink THEN walked back to the Luau. We walked in, sat at a table (no decorations, nothing to make it nice) and our table STILL hadn't been called for the trough...I mean buffet! It was 10:30! We went over to look at the food - cheap slop. We were so far away from the stage (nice tree in part of my view) that it was worthless. We simply left. So, after the $100 at the restaurant and this $300...awesome night. I have to say, this resort simply goes through the motions and hopes you remain happy because of the view and the fact that you are in Hawaii. It's a pretty dated hotel though our room had been remodeled. Oh, and though the ocean is in front of the hotel, you have to walk down a ways to access sand/beach. If you can get a cheap deal and lower your expectations then stay here. But if a week trip for $5500 (hotel bill total) comes with expectations of luxury - go to the Ritz or Four Seasons or a boutique hotel.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAccomodating and lux\u201d", "Author": "OregonCoastLover1", "ReviewID": "UR91050228", "Content": "This was our 2nd time staying at the Hyatt Maui.

We went to the Hyatt Luau which was delightful - went Whale watching (wish I'd booked earlier for the Catamaran but the giant Pacific Whaling vessel was good too - so don't miss out in whaling season), my husband and daughter learned to surf which they saw was the highlight of the trip - both took to it well and want to carry on surfing now. Even though the weather on all the other islands was bad, we had one rainy day out of the 9 we had in Lahaina at the Hyatt - just perfect!

The resort is nice with very friendly service, but the rooms are dated even after the renovation. However, it's clean and safe. They just need to replace some of the old furnitures and update the carpet and apply a new coat of paint. The appliances and bathroom needs major upgrade. The building looks very 80ish from outside and inside. The landscape is beautiful. Prices are fair since everything in Maui is overpriced anyway. The food is not bad, but needs to be more creative with the breakfast. It's exactly the same everyday and when you're paying $34 per person, you expect the menu to be a bit more refreshing. The room has a large wide flatscreen TV with internet access. We got the deluxe full frontal ocean view room. It's nice and clean, but agree with others that the bathroom is small and needs some major plumbing upgrade. There's no hot water at all. It's only luke warm or sometimes it suddenly turns cold. Complained about this and they send someone to look at it, but the problem couldn't be fixed immediately since it involves major overhaul of the boiler to keep up with the demand. Fortunately, Hawaii is warm enough to take cold shower, but this is unacceptable considering it's a Catagory 6 Hyatt. It has a very dated look The people there are very friendly, which did compensate for some of the poor quality and condition of the hotel. The hotel is large, almost Vegas style large but without the bling. The beach is alright, kinda small. Sands not very white and water not too clear. Another problem there is parking. The front lot is small and gets full very quickly, so you'll have to try the rear parking lot. The parking spaces are tight too, making it easy to get your rental dinged or scratched. Overall, we still had a good time and would definitely do business with Hyatt. They still offer great value with above average quality and service than many others. Hopefully the next time I return, they'll have updated and better maintain the place. During our stay, they were getting ready for the grand opening of Jepengo, so we didn't get to try it.

Pioneer Inn in Lahania for breakfast, located in the plaza next to the giant Banyan Tree, and the Hula Grill at Whaler,s Village in Kannaapali, for lunch or dinner. To consider avoiding, Zip Lining in Kapalua, overrated, expensive for what you get, not much for views, too much walking uphill. Must do, but not for people afraid of heights, Paragliding off of the volcano, my 10 y.o., did it with me, from 7000ft. could see 5 islands, incredible experience, we can't wait to try again and again, Proflight Paragliding, my wife will consider doing it next time, and she's scared of heights! Now on to the Hyatt Regency in Kaanaapali, not too kid friendly, pool just OK, slide did not work the whole time there, pretty to look at but boring for kids, the so called Game Room, glorified closet, not much there, extremely short on beach frontage, too far a walk from Whaler's Village, a shopping complex with restaurants, like Hula Grill. Also, the resort fee provides free wireless internet, but that wasn't explained to us, so we paid for a wired connection.

The grounds and pool were beautiful & immaculate, and the room was very nice & comfortable (though the air conditioning could get loud once it hit to 70 degrees or lower, not a big deal...we just kept the room temp at 71 degrees!), the on-premises restaurant Umalu served great food in a casual environment near the ocean.

The concierge staff were also very helpful in booking activities for us (kite-surfing, whale-watching & a sunrise bike ride down Haleakala) and recommending delicious nearby restaurants that were off-premises. We also took advantage of & highly enjoyed the progressive martini happy hour! Our visit went very smoothly, from check-in to check-out. The only suggestions I would have are for the concierge when booking kite-surfing lessons. We only had one day to do this, at a cost of $300. When we got to the company that gave the lessons, we discovered that at least 3 lessons are needed before you can even get on the board, and we didn't have the extra days to take multiple lessons, so it would have saved us time & money had we known this. I don't fault the concierge, as I don't think he knew, but something to be aware of in the future. Also, there are a number of penguins in a little pond near the lobby. While I fully recognize that many guests probably loved seeing the penguins, as an animal lover, it made me sad that they were confined to a little space, when their natural setting would be the open ocean.

I'm not sure what more those complaining about the bathroom could've wanted! Make sure you book your trip with breakfast included, if not it will cost you quite a bit. We ate at both Umalu and Sonz at Swan Court. Both were incredible. My husband liked Umalu because they had \"to-go\" containers for your coffee. I liked Swan Court because of the omelet station and wider variety of the buffet. You can't go wrong with either. They were great. Being that we live on eastern time, and Hawaii was five hours behind what we were used to, we were always up early! We went to breakfast every day by 7 and never had to wait for a table. We reserved pool chairs after breakfast and always got a spot wherever we wanted. The poolside drinks at Umalu are delicious, try the spiked pink lemonade! They were a bit expensive at $11, but I expected things to be more expensive, we were in Hawaii, after all. We did have the regency club plan, so I thought the regency room had free drinks, but it did not. Just reduced price drinks. But, the appetizers and dessert in the club were great. We didn't take advantage of it enough because we were always hungry for dinner so early! We ate dinner out at different restaurants every night so we could enjoy the Maui experience, and coming back, we NEVER had a problem finding a parking spot. We had friends staying at the Westin who visited our hotel for a banquet, and she raved to me about how nice our hotel was with the open air lobby and all of the decor. We were so happy with our stay at the Hyatt, and I am sad that I wasted any of my time worrying about what our experience would be like. Please rest assured that if you've booked the Hyatt, you will have a great stay.

The bathroom (toilet and shower/tub combo) was very small, but fortunately we were staying under the family plan and had two adjoining rooms, which made it easier for the four of us to get ready. The biggest issue was the lack of sound proofing in the rooms. We could frequently hear people in the hall or upstairs, but the most difficult time was the evening the hotel had an outdoor party for the Maui Invitational basketball tournament. The music kept the kids up until after 10 pm. The grounds are very nice and the pool, waterfalls, bars and restaurants are all great. The waterslide was closed the entire time we were there (just before Thanksgiving) and so the kids were disappointed, but other than that they enjoyed the place. All the meals we had at the hotel were very good, but for breakfast both restaurants only offer a very expensive buffet. One restaurant is supposed to offer an a la carte breakfast but when we asked about it we were told to just get the buffet because it was cheaper.

I struggled with giving this hotel 2 star rating or a 3 star rating but finally decided it deserved 2 stars because I have given 3 stars to hotels I have enjoyed much more. Let me start by saying that we had a very nice trip to Maui and enjoyed our time around the pool at the Hyatt. Overall, our stay was really nice and we did enjoy the our stay at the hotel, however, there were several incidents that lead to my rating. Let me elaborate. I had booked the hotel using hyatt points on the regency club level for 2 nights and purchased 4 nights on the regency club level for the remaining 4 nights. The day before we were to leave for Maui, I received an email stating the regency club room was under renovation and would not be open. They had relocated the club room to the lobby level in a different tower. While this was only a minor inconvenience, I felt it was a little underhanded to sent me a note the day before I am to arrive. If I wanted to change my reservation to a less expensive non club level room, I could not because I was within the 7 day change/cancellation period. A minor nit, but still. We arrived to the hotel on Saturday night at 9:30 PM and attempted to check in. The desk person seemed confused by my reservation and said she had to speak to a manager about our room, when I why, she just said she needed to talk to a manager and disappeared. She reappeared 15 minutes later and said she had a room for us but it was not ready yet and said it would be a 'few' minutes. Again, I asked why and she said they had a late check out. When I asked why it wasn't ready because late check out was at 5:00 pm, she said it needed to be 'freshened' up (whatever that means). At this point I was getting frustrated as we had been traveling for 10 hours and my 6 year old son was tired (as we all were). Finally after 45 minutes, our room was ready. Again disappointment when we got to our room. It was a corner room (2208) and I had requested two beds since I was traveling with my wife and 6 year old. They gave us a king bed with a pull out couch. Nothing major, but we could deal. The room however was an odd shape due to the shape of the building and it being a corner room so our room was an bent L shape which reduced our space in the room. This meant when the couch bed was open, you really could not move about the room and could not get to the mini bar/fridge and door without climbing over the bed. The bathroom was the 2nd tiniest bathroom I've ever experienced and I'm fairly well traveled. This was smaller than any European bathroom I've ever seen. In order to close the bathroom door, you had to stand back against the wall (the only available space in the bathroom besides standing in the bath tub). We're not big people, but if we were, this would not have been a good place to be. In hindsight, we should have requested another room, but we just dealt with it. Finally on the room, the hotel was experiencing an ant problem, so every morning we'd wake up to ants in the bath room and if you had any open food in the room, it would be covered with ants when you woke up. I wasn't just our room that was experiencing the ants as we heard several other guests discussing this as well. I found this room disappointing for the prices they were charging ($350-$400/night). I'm sure not all the regency club rooms were shaped this way and had such a small bathroom. As for the service, 80% of the people in the hotel were extremely gracious and helpful (wait staff at the pool, activities desk were great). The 20% of staff that were not gracious were downright rude. Several of the people working the regency club room were unfriendly, rude, and unhelpful. I was very surprised by this. When we encountered someone like this, we learned very quick to avoid them if we ever saw them again. An example of this was a person working the towel stand. When I inquired about when the large water slide might reopen (as they had a sign saying it was closed until further notice), the person acted as if it was a ridiculous question and just said, we don't know. By the way, if you're going anytime soon and your kids expect the big water slide to be open, it probably won't be. We finally got someone to admit that it probably wouldn't be open for at least another month (as they are doing construction on the building by the slide. While we were disappointed by a few things, we did have a nice time: Things we enjoyed: Very large pool that has a fun section for kids and another portion of the pool is great for the adults. The swans, penguins, flamingos, parrots, and fish were fun to explore every day. The grounds of the hotel have held up very well and having the pool right next to the ocean is really nice. Food at all the places to eat at the hotel was above average and had something good for both adults and kids. Things were disappointed in: Room size (but this was probably just our particular room) Hotel is starting to show it's age. Rooms are getting a bit dated. The beach at the Hyatt is very small compared to the other hotels around this location.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cFelt like paradise from beginning to end\u201d", "Author": "covbrit", "ReviewID": "UR88544774", "Content": "My family and I just spent 5 nights at the Hyatt Regency Spa Maui. It was amazing! We had originally planned on 2 nights in Maui and 3 in Tokyo to use our frequent flyer miles but after spending one day at the Hyatt, decided to cancel our Tokyo hotel & plans and stay in Maui for the whole duration. The hotel is gorgeous. You walk in the main doors, reception is to the right, concierge to the left. Straight ahead is the lobby which has such an island feel. The right side of the hotel lobby is open and leads to the pool and beach. They definitely brought the outdoors in, with meticulously cared for tropical plants, such as pineapple and more. Throughout the lobby there were several bird cages and stands where during the day, there would be exotic parrots that entertained the children. \"Shrek\" and \"R2D2\" were the kids favourite and I think both parrots and kids alike were enjoying themselves! At around 0930 the hotel animal keeper fed the penguins and Koi and gave the children the food so they could participate also which the kids loved. They even had free Hula lessons and the kids learnt a cool Island Hula dance! Behind the lobby were gift shops and clothing and the entrance to Swan Court restaurant. The pool is great for kids. On the \"adult\" side, a basketball hoop kept them entertained for hours. Swim through the waterfall, past the swim up bar, through the next waterfall brings you out to a more \"kid\" friendly pool. It has a water slide, a rope bridge, sand area, small kiddie slide for the toddlers, and much more. Plenty of sun lounges so we did not have a problem finding a sun lounger for all 5 of us even at the busiest times of day. The pool grill served good food and was very reasonable and the pool drinks were delicious and not very expensive. From the pool you could look out over the ocean and the Hawaiian sunsets set off the day perfectly. The hotel is lit up beautifully at night time and in between the beach and the hotel there is a path you can walk the whole length from the Hyatt down to the Sheraton? I believe - we didn't make it that far. We would stop at Whalers Village - about a 10 minute slow walk from the hotel with some boutique shopping and some great open casual restaurants. The concierge ladies were very knowledgeable and friendly and having a Hertz rep on site was definitely a plus! This by far ranks up with one of our favorite family vacations and sitting in the hotel shuttle we were already planning our next trip back to Maui and the Hyatt Regency.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cLittle Paradise\u201d", "Author": "alc0586", "ReviewID": "UR88388386", "Content": "-The hotel was great!

Our room was on the 8th floor in the corner making it quiet except for when the luau was going on and then it became quite loud. The thing that disturbed me the most was breakfast in the Swan Court. The food was quite good, but the birds were terrible. If someone left there table upon completion of there meal as many as 20 birds would be all over the dishes making it pretty disgusting. I also saw waiters leaving stacks of dishes not covered on trays inviting the birds to cover them also. Would I return maybe maybe not.

We also ate a few meals at Umalu, the poolside restaurant. The food is expensive and just O.K. The hotel sits on Ka'anapali Beach, but on a very narrow strip. If you're a beach person like I am, this was disappointing. There's one wide spot down near the spa at the far end of the hotel but it's away from the bar, market and restrooms, and you don't find people sitting there. There are two pools - one especially for children. The main pool is very large and there are plenty of lounge chairs. Access to the shallow end is under the grotto - a very bizarre layout. And the last step into the pool is much steeper than the others - not a good access. My husband and I loved the massages we had at the spa - it's a very luxurious facility. The hotel has a luau (every night, I believe) and the luau was fantastic - great food and terrific entertainment. Cirque Polynesia (not affiliated with Cirque de Soleil) is also on the Hyatt grounds, and we enjoyed the show (despite the rain). There are very nice shops in the hotel, including a mini Macy's with great resort wear departments for men and women. Whalers Village, a shopping complex with several restaurants in all price ranges, is a short walk (about 15 minutes) down the beach walkway. And if you have a car, it's a 10 minute ride to the town of Lahaina, where there are lots of restaurants and shopping.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cFirst impressions the biggest\u201d", "Author": "DerrickD2010", "ReviewID": "UR85797188", "Content": "This hotel from the drive way was AWESOME.

After a long and tiring flight, it really makes a difference when you are received with a warm welcome and a fast check-in process. We were able to stay in one of the newly renovated towers and it was very nice. I have to say the bed or whatever mattress they have is fantastic! The open air lobby is beautiful and the hotel grounds are well-kept. The little shops are convenient, however save your shopping for Front Street. The Cascades restaurant was closed, and they were doing some construction work during the day here and there. Construction noise was never a problem for us during our stay. The lack of food options was the only major inconvenience resulting from the renovations. There's immediate beach access and although a little rocky, its a great place to find shells, sea glass, and coral. I highly recommend checking out the 5 Star Scuba class they have on-site near the pool area. My scuba instructor was the most patient and understanding guy ever! Really helped me overcome my anxiety and it was 110% worth it doing the open water dive! The concierge at the hotel is affiliated with Expedia. Be wary because the quality of service you receive highly depends on who is working that day. We were given coupons to local restaurants, but when our friends (also staying at the Hyatt) asked for the same coupons- they told us they never had them!? They also make every effort to sell you activities, so be on alert. When we wanted to cancel and refund an activity prior to their 48 hr cancellation policy, the lady at the concierge refused to assist us and was very rude.

After reading reviews on here and speaking to others we decided on the Hyatt Regency Maui for our stay on this island. After booking it, about a month prior to our trip we heard horror stories about children running around and as a result having the setting become less romantic. However, my husband and I barely noticed any children there then what would be expected at the end of September. Upon check in we were greated with a shell lei, mini photo album (which made my day), and a cool drink. Our room was beautiful but less then what we expected for our honeymoon. We stayed in the Partial Ocean view room and although everything was very clean, comfortable bed and sheets, and great view, the room itself couldn't hurt from a little upgrading. My husband and I however did appcreciate the in-room safe as well as the empty fridge that could be used. While there we only had the options of eating at umalu and swan court (sonz) due to construction and a recent closure of the Italian restaurant downstairs. However, umalu had amazing food and dinner at sonz was also amazing. Breakfast at swan, although plentyful and fresh, was occasionally ruined by the mass amount of birds that flew through the room. If you left your food for a second their would be at least 15 birds ON your plate. It did bother me that the staff was not the fastest in cleaning up after guests since this didn't help the bird problem. The buffet was included in our package so I can't complain that much. Food was very good overall. The luau at Hyatt was also a very good time and food was great. I was expecting there to be a long wait for food but they had several different stations set up so everyone was fed in a timely matter. The pool was great, but the ocean was a bit \"eh\". The beach (if you want to call it that) at the Hyatt isn't one where you can lay out on due to shallow rocks. You have to walk a good 10minutes down the path to reach the part of the ocean where you can enter the sea. It was nice how convienent other restaurants were to the Hyatt as well as shopping areas such as Whalers Village. My husband and I used several services at the spa which was a very nice treat. All the staff were very friendly throughout the entire experience. Beware though, try not to forget anything in your room b/c it's a trek back from the main part of the hotel.

The pools are gorgeous! You do need to get up super early to get a chair though. 2.) There is a free trolly that takes you to Whaler's Village. It's great for those of us who didn't rent a car. From Whaler's Village you can also take the city bus (fare is only $1) to downtown Lahaina to have fun on Front Street. 3.) The animals (flamingos, exotic birds, cranes, penguins) are a nice touch. 4.) Even though the hotel is quite large, the layout and maps make it extremely easy to get around. 5.) We had breakfast at Swan Court every morning and enjoyed the buffet very much. But, if you don't like birds, don't go here. They swoop down and snatch your food from you. Kind of scary!!! 6.) The shops there have a great variety of things--the bathing suits selection at Macys there is fantastic! I also loved the little booths with local jewelry and crafts to buy. These shops were super convenient and wonderful. 7.) Their drinks were strong and delicious. I liked the drinks at this hotel much better than any of the other places or hotels we have been to. Drink a lava flow! I miss them already. :( CONS: 1.) The food is pretty gross (excluding the breakfasts at Swan Court). We couldn't eat at any of the restaurants there. Take the trolly to Whaler's Village if you're without a car and hungry. Gross, gross, gross restaurants at the Hyatt. 2.) We had the smallest, darkest bathroom in the world. Are they trying to save money on electricity? If so, they did with our room--I could barely see the toilet or the shower. Come on! 3.) The beach is very rocky and tiny. You pretty much have to walk uphill everywhere on the small stretch of beach. If you want to spend the day at the beach, don't stay here. 4.) I think they should have provided all guests with a welcome lei (like they did for us at the Grand Wailea). It doesn't cost the hotel much, but would have been a nice added touch. 5.) Our room wasn't ready and the hotel was not very accomodating. Yes, they allowed us to leave our bags. But, nobody called us when it was time to check in or anything. They pretty much forgot about us. All in all, I would return to Maui and possibly stay at this hotel. There were a TON of kids there, so I would probably go back with kids next time. It's not a hotel to have a romantic, relaxing vacation. This is a hotel to move, move, move and see stuff. We still loved it, don't get me wrong.

Pictures do not come close. The smell of flowers in the air, birds everywhere, and plants galore. All employees greet you wherever you go and offer assistance if needed. Everything you can possible think of is right there in the resort. The grounds were so beautiful that guests from other resorts were walking the gardens and even swimming in the pools because they were so awesome. We have been unable to stop talking about the beauty that surrounded us and the hospitality. Our room was a Deluxe Ocean Front and was exactly as described. We did not have a microwave, but we did not realize that we just needed to request one. The balcony overlooked the pool and the ocean and was stunning. Even had cascading flowers growing in the flower boxes on the balcony. We spent a lot of time out there! Housekeeping was outstanding and tended to our every need. They were very mindful of our privacy (it WAS our anniversary) and very thoughtful. Our room was always spotless. The pools were out of this world. As previously mentioned, guests from other resorts came down to use the pools because they are so unique. The staff waited on us the entire time we were at the pool and made us feel spoiled. The towels were well laundered and very fresh each day. Swan Court is THE place for breakfast. We had an SOS package that included buffet and it was amazing. We have never seen a buffet like it (and my husband travels for work and has been all over to resorts, even on Kuaui and Oauhu). If you can, book a package with the buffet included. Our problem was that we were not hungry for the remainder of the day. We TRIED to eat other meals but we were very full! Oh and the staff at Swan Court treat you like royalty. And we loved the birds! If you leave a plate, they do come, but only if you leave it. They seem to know that you are off to get another plate :) We did try the Umalu buffet, but only once. It is nice if you are in a hurry. Ate dinner at Umalu twice, both times were great. Had the Ahi burger; out of this world good. Plus the live music. Really romantic. Speaking of music, it is playing softly everywhere you go. It is very calming and relaxing. This is THE place to go for romance. We had dinner at Sonz one night and it was great. The staff was all over everything we needed. The wine list is extensive and they also have a nice selection of other spirits. Our bill ran about $128 (we live outside of Chicago so this was a pleasant surprise for gourmet food and service). The Drums Luau is great. A must see. We booked ahead but could have saved money if we booked upon arrival. There is really very little need to leave the resort! They have stores filled with anything you need, a top notch spa and fitness center and access to every activity you could possibly want to book. Parking IS limited, however we stayed 6 nights (10/14/2010-10/202010) and found that we really did not even need a rental car the entire week.

The rooms look exactly like the pictures on their website and were quite spacious, the beds are very comfortable. In addition to the mini bar fridge, they have a second empty small fridge just for you, which was a very nice bonus as we had a 2-year-old with us.

Spa was gorgeous, massage was worth the money, and the view from the relaxation room can't be beat. The pools weren't overcrowded, and the beach was practically deserted. We tried a few different beach spots to the left of the hotel and directly in front, all enjoyable with gentle waves and warm water. All the resorts on Kaanapali Beach are connected by an ocean-front walkway that leads to Whalers Village, a shopping/restaurant area.

Yes, we booked our trip through Costco Travel and were quite pleased by the value of the cost, but it wasn't exactly Moetl 6 rates.

We have rated it 5 stars, if we could give it 6 we would. We have never been to a 5 star resort like this before so maybe we are getting a bit carried away, but what can I say - we paid our money and we were impressed! The residents seemed to me mainly 30 something honeymooners and middle aged (40 - 60) couples. There were a few children but not many. A comprehensive review would take too long as the place is huge, but the main reasons we loved it are: 1) Sheer scale and opulence of the building - the lobby is an open courtyard with a coffee bar, koi carp pool, parrots, penguins (yes, penguins), and palm trees several storeys high. It needs to be seen to be believed. Beyond the lobby is a small branch of Macy's, and other shops, mainly high-end souvenir shops. There is a choice of restaurants. There is a water garden outside which is home to flamingos and swans. The hotel grounds cover a huge area. 2) Beautiful scenery. The hotel grounds are lovely - well landscaped, plenty of greenery, several waterfalls so you have the relaxing sound of running water by the pools and bars. All the grass is maintained to putting green standards. Everything is spotless from the pool area to the pathways. 3) Proximity to beach and clean sea - 20 yards from hotel. Step out of the hotel, past the pool, onto the beach. Fantastic. The beach is very narrow outside the Hyatt so any sunbathing needs to be done by the pool really, but walk north along the sand for about 5 to 10 mins and there is a lot of sand for sunbathing. 4) The pool area - very large main pool (the only one we went in although I think there was a smaller one mainly for children) and the best on the Ka'anapali strip from what we saw as we walked past the other hotels. Plenty of sun beds to go round, there was never a problem. Swim under the large waterfall from the pool, into the caves, and there is a bar. There are waitresses walking around the pool asking if you require a drink from Umalu bar which is right next to the pool area. It serves great cocktails, several draught beers, very decent bar food (burgers, onion rings, seafood salad etc) all with a smile from the excellent staff - plus 2 screens showing live sport with the sound muted. Umalu is a lovely place to get some shade and cool down after a while in the sun. Just relax and put all those cocktails on you room bill - you don't have to carry cash around at all! There is a little area separated just off the pool area where you can get a professional massage, we had one and it was really good. There's a shop next to the bar if you want a snack, can of Coke etc - again - put it on your room bill. 5) Our room - plenty of space, clean and well appointed. Our balcony overlooked the hotel's Luau stage so we had Hawaiian music floating through the window each evening as we changed which was very pleasant. 6) The breakfast - breakfast was included in our rate and we were glad it was - never before have I seen a buffet spread like it! You name it, it was there - eggs, bacon, sausages, cereals, fresh fruit, tea, coffee, rice, blueberry cake, banana cake, belgian waffles, pancakes, grilled fish, yoghurt, breads and bagels of every variety, and the list goes on. Truly every taste was catered for. You can eat in Umalu bar and Swan Court, I recommend Swan Court for breakfast particularly. In the evening Swan Court hosts Son'z restaurant which we went to once but to be honest were not overwhelmed by the food (good, but not great considering the prices) so reverted to Umalu in the evenings. Those are the stand out bits for us but there are so many more including the Hawaii weather and the hotel staff, needless to say both were outstanding. It's worth mentioning that the nearest town of Lahaina is too far to walk really. There is also a gym and spa on site which we never used so cannot comment on it. We would recommend Hyatt Regency Maui to coupes mostly, and we hope to return one day. Perfect for relaxation and sun - and they just make it so easy for you.

Along with beautiful views all around, it was very lovely...now for my personal experience.... We went for our honeymoon and stayed at the Hyatt for 6 days. Having never been to Maui I was excited, though I do not like to submerge myself in the whole \"tourist\" attitude and attire. Kaanapali Beach is the ultimate tourist place and the Hyatt looked like most of the other hotels on the beach resort path. The birds in the lobby are beautiful. I thought they'd be noisy but they take them in at night so you don't have to worry about that. Our first night we got stuck in room 501, right next to the ice machine, with a very narrow door opening that was hard to squeeze us and our luggage through (we are not large people). The problem was that we could hear the ice machine right through the walls in our room. Constant noise like squeaky, running water pipes kept us up at odd intevals throughout the night. It got so bad we went to the lobby at 3:30am and pleaded that they let us change rooms. We were told by a very unhelpful desk worker that the hotel was completely full and the only room we could have was room 101....4 floors down next to that level's ice machine. I find it hard to believe that EVERY single room was filled, as it did not look that crowded the whole time we were there. We weren't looking for an upgrade, we just wanted a nights sleep after a very long flight. We were forced to go back to our room for the remainder of the night until 7am when another desk worker (Jennifer from Pennsylvania) was more helpful towards our problem and moved us to room 1629....a much quieter room with a better layout plan. The rooms in general seem very clean and comfortable. The cleaning crew does a great job and always leaves enough towels and other amenities. Our next surprise was when we were told to go to the Swan Court for our \"free\" breakfast that was included in our package. That was very nice, I enjoyed watching the little birds that flew in and out of the open air seating area. The service and food was good, but when we got a bill at the end we were shocked. It was over $60 for some fruit and a few strips of bacon and pancakes. We were told that all we had to do was sign it to verify that we got the breakfast. We both found this practice a bit peculiar though and had to question several staff members as well as the front desk management to make sure we wouldn't be recieving a charge at the end of our stay. We still felt obligated to tip our wait staff the usual 15% though, so inflating the charge to $60 made that higher too. Also...the snack bar in the rooms are on a weight sensor. I have never seen this either. My husband put our bag on top of the table next to it and one of the straps knocked off a Starburst package. We had to call the desk (again!) to make sure they knew we hadn't eaten it....no Starburst is worth $3 unless you're having a low blood sugar emergency. The parking in the hotel lot is so compact that you can barely maneuver in and out of the spaces even with small economy vehicles...and opening the car door is a difficult task as well. With most of the cars there probably being rental cars, I bet this is great for the rental companies to inspect to see how many door scratches and dings they can get you for when you return it. There's also limited spaces so if you do go out exploring anywhere on the island you have to come back at a reasonable hour otherwise you may not get a parking space. We had a late dinner one night and came back about 9pm and had to circle the lot for nearly 20 minutes until someone left. Upon checking out we were given a summary of charges and our \"resort fee\" was listed as $25/day. We were told by our not-so-competent travel agent that the fee was $15/day. Jennifer at the front desk again was very helpful and told us that was the old resort fee, but changed it for us without a fuss. Basically, I loved our trip, glad I got to see Maui, but I think I may try another hotel next time.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larkspur, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Hyatt Regency Maui is the ONLY choice on Ka'anapali Beach!!\u201d", "Author": "cwest2424", "ReviewID": "UR82917924", "Content": "WOW WOW WOW!!! I can't say enough about the Hyatt Regency Maui. We just got back at midnight and what a week we had!! We are used to going on cruises so I was concerned about how I would like staying at a hotel all week, but WOW, was the Hyatt the place to be! From the minute we stepped onto the property, we were treated like royalty. I will mention Victoria at the front desk by name because she was AWESOME!!! She made us feel at home right away. She had all of our paperwork organized and made check-in very painless. We got a great room on the 6th floor, ocean view. We walked into the room and were amazed by how gorgeous it was and what a view!! Just great! Our package included breakfast and we chose the buffet at Umalu every day and were never disappointed. The pool was great and not overrun by kids or crazy adults. The lounge-chair-saving starts early in the morning, so get your towel and stake out your spot! Dinner is expensive, but what do you expect...it's Maui! However, the food is excellent, so if you decide to eat lunch or dinner at the hotel, it's well worth the price. The shopping gallery is fantastic. Lots of different kinds of stores and even a small Macy's! I told my boyfriend that we didn't even have to leave the resort all week if we didn't want to! They had it all! However, we wanted to go snorkeling and take a sunset dinner cruise, so alas, we left the property! I would recommend booking things on your own as their Concierge service is not that great. Aside from that, definitely go to Whaler's Village for shopping and dinner. You can walk to it from the hotel. We took advantage of a 2 for 1 at the Luau right at the hotel and it was just great! I was concerned because food at Luau's can be gross and the show can be bad, but not so here! The food was excellent, drinks were not watered down, and show was great. STAY HERE!!

The rooms are the largest and nicest available for the price on Kaanaplai. Mountain view rooms are great. Very nice views. Ocean rooms are great too, but really...how long are you planning on staying in your room? Save some cash and get a mountain view. If you want to chill out on your lanai with some wine, still a great view to be had. Paying for breakfast is must here. If you can get a deal when you book your trip, do it that way. It will save you money in the long run. Did I say the breakfast is awesome? Well it is. It's a pretty unbelievable spread they have there.

First off the minute you pull up everyone there is very helpful. I will say they will nickel and dime you death if you let them. They place a $100 hold on your credit card each day, you can ask however to have this lowered to whatever you can afford. The resort does have $25 per day fee which does suck since it was $15. Every room has a snack tray that is weighted so if you eat anything or move it, it automatically charges your room. Make sure you get a print out of your statement we did have a lot of charges that were not correct. This is the only negative thing I can say about the Hyatt. However I would almost guarantee that all the other hotels are comparable to the fees here. The hotel is very cozy and beautiful, the grounds are gorgeous there are tons of shops inside, birds, flamingos, penguins, bars lots of private sitting areas around tiki torches and firepits. Breakfast is very expensive so I suggest tring to get this included other wise it will cost $60.31 however it is delicious. There are a ton birds that are flying in and out of the breakfast area but we never once had a bird land on our table, where you eat breakfast at half of the room is open to the outside, remember youre on an island. Anytime you eat outside anywhere you run the risk of a fly or bird landing on your table. We did the luau here which is called the Drums of the Pacific, and it was very good and there was tons of food and an open bar. The food tasted fine, we literally heard no one complain about it. I will say if you think you are going to get full on seafood here forget it. Hawaii apparently has a great deal of respect for there marine life so they only fish for specific fish each season so nothing gets over fished or endangered. Right now the only fresh fish the restaraunts serve is Mahi Mahi and Ahi. Drinks are very expensive at the Hyatt, like $12-$17 each they do have a happy hour and Martini specials though. We ended up going to the gas station and buying beer and vodka and hid it in our beach bag then added it to out orange juice. We did suspect that Maui would be expensive but we didnt realiaze how expensive, you can hardly do anything here for under $200 by the time tax is added in. If you plan on doing the Road to Hana you might wait if you plan to see waterfalls. Maui has not had much rain so majority of the waterfalls are dried up we did see a few but they were weak. If you do decide to do the Road to Hana we suggest taking a tour van, the road is extremely dangerous to drive youre up about 2500 feet and the road is very narrow with no gurad rails toward the end. So if you both want to enjoy it and take pictures you need to do the the tour other wise the driver will not see everything because you have to watch the road and drive very careful. We also did a dinner cruise with the Pacific Whale foundation and that was very nice. Definentley do Front st in Lahaina its a lot of fun, tons of shopping and cool places to eat right on the water. The beach at the hotel is practically washed away, we also went up a few hotels, however it was not much better, the tides come in very far everywhere. I really think with in a few years hardly any of the hotels will have much a beach, you could definently never lay a towel out on any of the beaches we saw. All in all our trip was great Maui is so beautiful, expensive but something everyone should experience. We do plan on returning and would gladly return to the hyatt. I would just remind your self if you plan on going here or any where in Maui that you have picked one of the most expensive islands to visit, so go with an open mind and dont be suprised by the costs of things here.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort!\u201d", "Author": "tilii80", "ReviewID": "UR82644661", "Content": "This is a beautiful resort with the best pool around!

After a surprisingly long drive from the airport, we pulled up to valet parking and proceeded to check in. I had requested and received a \"based on availability\" discount upgrade. We were assigned an oceanfront room on one of the Regency Club floors. This required a room key in the elevator to access the floor as well as the club on the top floor. The pool area is absolutely beautiful and reminded me of a Las Vegas type \"we have to outdo our neighbor's property\" pool. It has two sections connected by a grotto which houses a bar complete with flat screen TV's. It was fun watching NFL football in the pool! As the pool is between the hotel buildings and the ocean, we had a nice view of the pool as well from our room. We had already been to Maui on our cruise that was part 2 of our trip. We had seen sunrise at Haleakala as a shore excursion, and the only other major touring we were looking to do was the road to Hana. The tour desk in the lobby arranged for us to go with Valley Isle Tours for that trip. I originally considered driving, but we were given a huge SUV by the rental car agency, and I would not have been comfortable driving on that narrow, sometimes treacherous road with its one lane bridges and over 600 curves with that behemoth of a vehicle. The tour desk also booked a \"Tour of the Stars\". On the roof of one of the hotel buildings at the Hyatt sit two telescopes. For $25, we were led up to the roof - an elevator ride followed by a set of stairs and a hike on a catwalk to the telescopes. Our guide, who seemed quite knowledgeable about astronomy, found some interesting star groups, Jupiter, and eventually the moon for us to view through the telescopes. At the end of the presentation, \"Milky Way\" and \"Starburst\" candies were available to the star gazers. Cute, and a nice touch. A recommended activity if you like that sort of thing. Our room included the daily buffet breakfast at the Swan Court restaurant. The restaurant was located on a lagoon with, what else, swans! In addition to the swans, the public areas of the Hyatt had other wildlife such as penguins and parrots. The selection was quite extensive (and expensive - $30 pp if we were paying). The food was good with lots of fresh fruit, (I'm really starting to miss that fresh pineapple every day :-0 ) and even mahi mahi. We had breakfast there each morning of our 4 night stay with the exception of the last, when we ate in the Regency Club. The RC had a much more limited (continental breakfast) selection, but we were able to get in and out quickly before leaving for our flight home. The staff throughout the property from the valets, to the front desk, to the bellmen, was friendly, polite and made a point to address me by name; not unlike those at the Outrigger Reef Waikiki which I recently reviewed. I can only come up with one complaint, but it's (to me, anyway) a major one. In each room there is a minibar and a snack tray. The snack tray is weight sensitive, and we were told that if you remove a Snickers bar for more than 10 seconds, you were automatically charged for it. I can't imagine how much money the hotel spent on these technological marvels that would rival security seen in movies such as \"Mission Impossible\" and \"Return of the Pink Panther.\" With the Hyatt being a somewhat upscale property, I found it insulting that this device was in the room. Did they really think I was going to take a candy bar and not pay for it? I was afraid to go anywhere near the damn thing! In this high tech age, my wife and I had several devices that needed charging (phones, cameras, ipods, etc.). There was an available outlet behind the tray, but we were unable to use it for fear of disturbing the precious candy and triggering a charge that would need to be disputed. I would have preferred that the tray was not in the room at all, as we had no interest in any of the items it protected like Brinks. Aside from the armored snack tray, the room was quite nice, with a sofa, large flat screen TV with an excellent selection of channels, and a comfortable king size bed. I would not hesitate to recommend the Hyatt, and I would happily stay here again on a future (I hope) visit. Just be careful where you walk around the candy tray!

The pools are set up with a waterpark/pool for kids on one side of the grotto and a much larger (deeper) pool on the other side of the grotto geared much more towards adults. The grotto bar itself was a great place to get out of the sun for a little while. The fitness center was more than adequate to fit my needs. We didn't make use of the spa, but I heard quite a few good things about it while we were there. We also went to a Luau at a different resort, but caught a portion of what appeared to be a pretty good show at the Hyatt as well.

TripAdvisor vacationers are on the mark. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repeat what has been said already\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6will try to add new ideas/tips. The Hyatt resort is really kid friendly and great. Kids will not be disappointed. The water slides are fantastic and the hotel meals were delicious. My disappointment was with United (no food on the flight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c buy it extra) and no luggage included (buy extra). United was courteous to give us a voucher for $250 for our NEXT flight, but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going with them again. Cost-co offered a crazy special for this hotel, under $800 pp and mostly inclusive from LAX. It included a rental car, Hyatt 6 nights, and a ton of extras. Some we used more than others. We did not attend the hula or the cirque show 2 for 1, as previous attendees were disappointed. We did use the Ullu bottomless cups and most of the food we ate for lunch and dinner were charged to our room, and then removed with the $150 voucher at the end of the stay. That was quite a savings with kids eating free, so a lot of meals were included. You have to really watch the Hyatt and your charge card. Upon check out, we noticed several charged that were supposed to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Breakfast was included in our package, but they charged us for the kids (kids that eat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) each morning. Thanks to TripAdvisor, I was tipped off beforehand, and asked for a hotel statement the day before we checked out, so I could review the charges, and battle day before leaving. Hyatt Parking: with the huge group from the Cost-co special, there was little free parking, and no parking one night we returned back to the hotel late. When we asked at Valet, the nice guy said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just this once I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll let you slide \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just one night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and so we did Valet that night with him. Surprise: That night valet charge ended up on the Hyatt statement too\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was taken off after we asked him about it again. At check out, we only used $120 of the $150 free credit, so we ended up w/ a $30 left over, so we went to Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and tried to use it on some clothes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but no, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work there. Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count toward the credit, so I went to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weekend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd store and got a summer blue Hyatt bag $29. We liked parasailing with UFO parasail boat. They were very good. At 8 am, while walking to rent the snorkel equipment, we came across the beginning of the roasting of the pig for the Hyatt Luau that night. We found it quite interesting. First they heat the rocks, then put the pig on, then cover him w/ leaves, a wet white cloth, and then the dirt. Not something you see every day. We enjoyed lunch at the barefoot bar on the beach (toes in the sand) just north of the Hyatt and enjoyed the Maui Ocean Center aquarium near the airport. No big whales or dolphins, but it was one of the best we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. A diver goes in the tank 3 times a day to swim w/ the hammerhead sharks in a huge tank. Very entertaining. They also have an underwater walk-though tunnel to see the bat-rays, etc. Another tip\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6instead of paying the $50-$100 for the Hawaiian shirts to bring home, we stopped at Ross on the way to the airport. It was easy to find, and they had flowered Hawaiian shirts (made in Hawaii!) for $14.99.

We rated this hotel low on the rooms as ours was ocean front and the furniture was showing it's wear and the bathroom was very small and dimly lit.. We somewhat anticipated this as it is an old property. However, during our stay they turned the water off for a few hours one day on our floor in order to begin renovation work on the floor above.

Do not miss this resort!!!\u201d", "Author": "AttorneyVin", "ReviewID": "UR79152741", "Content": "Hyatt Regency Maui Date of Stay: 8/3-8/5/10, 2 Nights In a nut-shell, a nice Ocean Front Hyatt with excellent amenities and dining. If you are staying on the West End of Maui, this would be a perfect place to stay. Now, for my detailed review: I was eagerly awaiting my stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui, as I had used a Diamond Suite Upgrade Certificate to Upgrade my wife and I to an \"Ocean Suite\" for our Honeymoon. Upon reaching our \"Ocean Suite\" on the 4th Floor, I was disappointed. I would not suggest anyone use their Diamond Suite Upgrade Certificates at this resort, as the \"Ocean Suite\" is far from an \"ocean\" suite. The room is one large room, a sitting area with television, couch and small desk; then, there is a sliding-door partition that opens into the decent sized bedroom portion. The living area is far from \"ocean\" front, as the window looks out onto the top of a roof, the luau grounds, hotel parking lot and Highway 30. The only portion of the room that could even conceivably be considered an \"ocean\" view was the bedroom area, which had a standard balcony overlooking the ocean; however, being on the 4th Floor, the palm trees greatly obstructed this ocean view. Definitely not a good use for a Diamond Suite Upgrade; I would instead suggest that one simply book an ocean front room in the main building, as those are the perfect rooms. Despite that small hiccup in room assignments -- which, I may add, Hyatt Management was extremely wonderful at addressing -- we had an overall good experience at this resort, and the rest of the stay was perfect. I chose the Food and Beverage Diamond Amenity in lieu of points, and selected a nice Canvas Cabernet along with the Fruit and Cheese tray. The Diamond Amenity arrived promptly, and was a very nice presentation. Additionally, the General Manager provided us with a wonderful bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in recognition of our honeymoon. One great this about this hotel is that it allows one many on-site activities and shows. We chose to attend a new show, called \"Cirque:Polynesia\" that is held on-site, near the tennis courts, as well as the \"Drums of the Pacific Luau.\" Both shows were absolutely amazing! I would highly recommend both shows -- and definitely suggest paying just a little extra for the \"VIP Seating\" option. \"VIP Seating\" was only slightly more for each show, and it gave us seating in the first few rows for Cirque, and it allowed us priority entrance to the luau -- with front-row center seating, and first access to the food. Anyone who has been to a luau knows how congested it can be to get in -- everyone lines up and waits for the show at least an hour before, but with \"VIP Seating\" you don't have to, and you get first crack at the food. It is highly worth your while! Additionally, this Hyatt has a wonderful pool, complete with numerous waterfalls, grottos, a waterslide, and hot tubs. However, the pool chairs do fill up quickly, so if you want to spend a full day at the pool, I would suggest getting there early -- or, do what we did and rent a \"Hale\" or large tented cabana. For only $150/day, they have two large wooden cabana areas and two large tended cabana areas. The wooden ones were sold out, so we opted for the last remaining tented \"Hale.\" It may seem expensive to some, but it was absolutely worth the money! It is set up in advance with plush towels and an ice chest. The ice chest is full of water and also contains a wonderful fruit tray. The \"Hale\" sits just above the beach, allowing for easy beach access. It is equipped with two very comfortable and plush wooden reclining chairs, and a small table for food. I was able to stay in and remain cool and shaded, while we pulled a small pool lounger over into the sun for my wife to use. It made for a perfect day, and I would highly recommend it -- but, if you are considering this option, I suggest calling the Concierge to book this before you arrive, as they only have four of these wonderful full cabana areas (whereas they have plenty of the two-seater \"half cabanas\" that are prevalent throughout the islands) and they book up fast. The Regency Club was very well decorated, and, despite being crowded, we were always able to find a place to sit. Breakfast was the usual continental style, with a different warm entree each morning. The all day cookies and snack were the usual, as were the evening cordials and desserts. Dinner was a well apportioned mix of the usual, with a different hot entree each evening. The Regency Club is located on the top floor of the Main Building, and it offers amazing views of Kaanapali and the surrounding landscape. All in all, despite the initial hiccup regarding my Diamond Suite Upgrade, this was a wonderful place to stay, and I would suggest it for anyone wanting luxury accommodations combined with an incredible pool.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coto de Caza, California", "Title": "\u201cBest bet on main Kanapali strip\u201d", "Author": "Love2Travel92679", "ReviewID": "UR79070085", "Content": "We stayed here for a couple nights before checking into a nearby condo. I stay at Hyatt regularly for business and this hotel fully meets Hyatt standards. No, it's not the Ritz, and anyone thinking it is will be disappointed. But, compared to other Kanapali properties like Westin and Marriott \"next door,\" the grounds are much, much better (pools, walking areas, restaurants, public areas). The rooms were fine, about what one should expect for a Hyatt. I gave 5 stars, not because this is a 5 star property like the Ritz or Four Seasons, but because it fully earns the 5 stars for the category it is in which is a very nice hotel class for Hyatt, Sheraton, Marriott, Westin. The Regency Club access (available by paying more, or upgrade, etc) was excellent. A lovely breakfast and evening buffet, complete with complimentary bar drinks helped us save on pricy restaurant bills! Get the Rgency Club level if you can! (Usually offered as a free upgrade to Hyatt Platinum/Diamond levels - or a slight up-charge at time of reservation). Little kids will LOVE the kids pool area, especially the \"kiddie\" slide. Older kids will enjoy the \"adult\" slide if they're 48\" which is strictly enforced. I think a week here might get boring, but good for several nights before heading to another island, maybe? The one thing I will say about the kiddie pool is that they had a couple turtles and a dolphin play animals that are permanent fixtures for climbing on in the water. They are foam, and I know this because there was some delayed maintenance where the foam was starting to come through the outer layer. Not necessarily a hazard, but a little unkept and annoying - the hotel should repair these so the area is \"perfect,\" versus showing early signs of wear & tear. As for the beach, it is narrow, but quite nice in front of the hotel. The \"boardwalk\" oceanside is a BEAUTIFUL \"must-do\" walk that starts at the Hyatt and continues about 3 miles north (but you need to cut through the Westin about 1/2 way to continue towards North Kanapali). Perfect oceanfront path for joggers, strollers, and anyone desiring an amazing oceanfront stroll! The Umualu restaurant was convenient for B,L or D - no, not cheap, but \"reasonable\" for hotel standards in the area. Loved the sandy seating area at sunset with live music. Our only complaint with this hotel, which in reality was not really the hotel's fault, is that there seemed to be a lot of people there on a Costco \"package\" trip. You could spot these people because as part of their package, they were given large blue refillable drink bottles for sodas. At times, the pool seemed crowded with a lot of people with the \"blue bottles\" and at other times, we saw some people that didn't look like they really belonged (appearance & behavior wise) at a 4-star property - go figure, they were carrying their blue bottles around. When we've stayed at this hotel in the past, I remember the crowd as a little more \"refined,\" but it was still a great visit nonetheless. In any event, a great hotel for Kanapali and better than the neighbors (Westin, Marriott, timeshares, etc). Trust me, the people from the other hotels were crashing the Hyatt and it was not the other way around! Also, this hotel, like most, is probably best for several nights, then it's time to move on to Wailea area, or another island. I think more than 4 nights in same spot would be boring when there are so many other terrific areas of Maui and Hawaii to see!

There is a shallow, sandy area for the little ones, however, that is roped off from the main pool. The hotel uses a towel card system which is very cumbersome; I'm not sure of its purpose. I think a hotel of this caliber should assume you're not going to steal the towels. They use a wrist band to identify hotel guests that are currently using the pool- isn't that enough to fend off outsiders?

My husband and I were excited to be in Hawaii for our honeymoon and really looking forward to our stay at the Hyatt, which is generally a name you can trust. After a rather confusing check in (we were told our reservation was cancelled when it had been confirmed 2 days earlier) we were on our way to our room. The lobby was a little dated and felt more old Hawaiian but we were just excited to see the ocean, pool and check out the restaurants the hyatt website raved about. Upon entering the room, it seemed nice. We had an ocean deluxe room. As we got into the room and looking around, suddenly the age of this hotel came through. Not only were the bathrooms mildew ridden, but the walls were covered with water stains and peeling wallpaper. The deck looked as if though it had never been cleaned...the deck floor felt like sticky movie theater floors. To our horror we then saw a bug on the bed pillow...which as you can imagine lead to more bugs in the bed as we took the linens down. The headboard was full of dust. It was just gross! We called the front desk and were only offered a comparable room, but that housekeeping would come up right away to check out our room....housekeeping never came, management never showed a sign they cared about our sad experience even after showing them the bugs. We had a really nice hotel check in woman apologize but she was the only one. We never stayed at the hotel bc of the horrible service and lack of care. We told the hotel we were going to another hotel. They called us a cab and left us with the 30 dollar cab bill. Way to stick it to us hyatt! We ended up staying at the Ritz in kapalua and quickly realized THAT is what a honeymoon should be and surprisingly the cost wasn't that much more. I have always loved every hyatt I stay in with this location obviously being the exception.

We stayed there in late August of 2010. I rated this hotel as \"Very Good\" instead of \"Excellent\" because of the following. 1) Every night, the Hyatt has a luau and every night, self-parking is very limited starting about 430pm. Also, the parking stalls are just wide enough for a mid-size car to park...that's if the other cars are parked within their lines. Even then, only the most skinniest people can get in and out of their cars! 2) As I read the other peoples' reviews, they mentioned to request to be put in a room on the opposite side of the luau because of the luau noise. We were able to get a room away from the luau and were greatly relieved that we only heard the luau drums in the distance. 3) The Umalu restaurant was pricey, and the service was just so-so. The beef filet was very tasty and was a normal portion size. 4) The pool towel system is okay, Yes, you have to trade in a card for your towel, but Hyatt has to keep track of their towels somehow or else people would just not return them. 5) The beach just off the hotel is very rocky. 6) We had friends stay at the Westin Timeshare just north of us. Hyatt should do what that Westin did was have small wetted hand towels in the lobby so that you can cool down your face. I give big kudos for the Westin for this idea! 7) A good idea when booking your hotel stay is to say that it is your anniversary or something special. You may get a free bottle of champagne like we did...(well, it was our anniversary.) 8) The Breakfast Buffet included in the Costco deal is great. You just have to get to the buffet before 730am or else you will be waiting in line for a while. 9) We did not encounter birds swooping down like Afflred Hitchcock's The Birds on unattended tables like other reviewers put down. It is exaggerated. Yes, there were some birds, but the wait staff clean up the unattended tables fairly quickly to mediate the situation. Twice, I also saw an employee put bread crumbs out for the birds on the lawn across from the water pond so that the birds would not bother the guests eating. This was a good idea. 10) So, all in all, the Hyatt is improving. The partial ocean view room that we had appeared like it was refurbished recently, so I guess we lucked out. On the other hand, our other friends staying in an ocean front room in the other building said that their room looked dated. 11) The weight -sensitive snack tray in the room was apparent but was not a problem if you don't touch it. I was told that you have 6 seconds to put back the snack in the exact spot or else you get charged for it. Well, we never touched it, so it wasn't an issue. 12) Internet access was slow. Yes, I would recommend this hotel but it is not Shangri La.

From the very start, we were made feel very welcome. We arrived at the hotel at about 11.30pm, and the girls at the reception desk (think they were both called Melissa) gave us a bottle of water each, and also gave us a photo album for our honeymoon pictures. They invited us to a honeymooner's evening for the following night, where one of their chef's teach you how to cook a special meal, while you sip on champagne and mingle with othe honeymoon couples. It was a nice touch, which we enjoyed. When we got to out room, there was information left on our bed about all the hotel services, and the activities that take place in the hotel itself. If you were to stay in the hotel for a week, you would still not be stuck for something to do. The room was beautiful, nice and big, nicely air-conditioned, and had a Hawaiin feel to it, which I loved. Breakfast was included in our package, and we could eat at either of their restaurants, but we ate at Umalu every day. It was a buffet style breakfast, and there was plenty of choice. All the food was fresh, and they had the nicest pineapples I have ever tasted. You can see the pool and the ocean while eating, and it's very relaxing. While staying in the Hyatt we did many activities. They have an inhouse concierge, run by Expedia advisors, who help to arrange all sorts of activities during your stay. We did parasailing and jet-skiing, which are both located on the beach, and also did a helicopter ride (about a 35-40minute drive from the hotel) which was breath-taking. I would definitely recommend Blue Hawaiin Helicopters for their tours. We did a one and a half hour tour of the whole island of Maui, and we landed on the top of a mountain half way through to enjoy some pineapple champagne (yum!) while enjoying the scenery. Our pilot was extremely nice and gave us a great tour of the island. We did the Drums of the Pacific Luau, which is based in the hotel, and had a fantastic time. The food and drink was included, and it was delicious! I even took part in a hula dancing lesson! :) We also drove the Road to Hana on one of the days, and the views were just amazing! I've never seen scenery like it. The hotel itself is so beautiful, at night it is lit-up and looks stunning.

I had heard complaints about the lack of beach in front of the hotel, but a very easy walk to either side of the hotel takes you to plenty of sandy shore. It was never an issue. And a \"must see\" at the hotel is the \"Tour Of The Stars\" astronomy show! The 14\" reflector telescope called \"the edge\" allows you to view some incredible sites! My group got to see such incredible wonders as Jupiter and all her moons! Had we gone to the show just an hour earlier we could have seen Saturn and her rings! We learned a lot that night about the stars, planets and our moon which was full that night and quite the view through \"the edge\" telescope! The hotel is also very well equipped to entertain kids of all ages, especially the very young. Friday night we saw a Disney movie being projected on a big screen with fresh hot buttered popcorn and plenty of room for the kids and family to sit and watch. We saw different games being played around the pool areas for the kids and there was a basketball hoop on one side of the pool that saw plenty of playtime.

We were greeted by friendly staff that provided us with a cute Hawaii photo album and coupon (with purchase of a meal at the hotel) for a free bottle of champagne in honor of honeymoon. The room was spacious enough. It was an ocean front king room. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to see the view until the next morning and we were ecstatic to see nothing but the bright blue Pacific Ocean, palm trees and the island of Molokai. It was breath taking, like a page of calendar. The bed was big and comfortable, but the bathroom was a little bit on the small side. Our room came with a small balcony, but it was sufficient for our needs. There were better places to enjoy the view throughout this gorgeous property. We enjoyed a daily breakfast buffet as part of our hotel package at the Swan Court. The staff was professional, friendly and we were always served promptly, at the best table available. The food was good, the views were beautiful. The large doors, the mini waterfall and the view of the Pacific Ocean were exactly how breakfast on your honeymoon should be played out. The grounds are beautiful. We enjoyed walking around; taking pictures of the gorgeous Hawaiian landscape, pink flowers everywhere\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was breathtaking. And there were penguins in the lobby, real penguins! The location of the hotel was also fantastic. We took a short drive west and had many opportunities for picture taking, snorkeling, and some shopping. It is also right in Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali, which has a beautiful beach and the awesome Royal Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali golf course. The pool at this hotel was fantastic. It was the best pool I had ever seen, prior to staying at the Grand Hyatt Kauai (our second stop). There was a huge open section in the sun, with waterfalls and a basketball hoop. We swam through into a shaded portion, where there was another hidden bar and tvs. There was also a kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only section, which contained the little ones so we honeymooners could enjoy ourselves. There were beautiful flowers and rocks along the entire length. The tunnel slide was fun too. The pool staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We took our free champagne \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcto go\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when we ordered lunch at the pool side bar. The pool staff kept our bottle chilled at the swim up bar and refilled our glasses as we sat in the pool side chairs that faced the ocean. Throughout our stay we were offered cool towels and freeze pops. The pool experience was fantastic. The towel service was also efficient, with the towel cards and disposable bracelets. Why the Kauai Hyatt and five-star Halekulani didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t utilize a similar system is beyond me. It made getting clean towel quick and easy and also kept non-guests out of our pool area. There was construction going on during our stay. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly what wings they were working on, but they only did work during the day hours. I heard a little bit of drilling by the pool during the day, but this was drowned out by the live poolside band they had. It was not distracting and you hardly knew it was going on. Upon checkout, I was surprised to see the huge charge for daily valet parking. The negative of this hotel was the ridiculously undersized self park lot. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware that they were charging a pricey daily valet fee. I told this to the person checking us out and he promptly removed the charge from our bill, which was really nice. Good hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sweat the small things. They want you to come back, and if we ever are given the time and resources to make it back to Hawaii, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to spend a few nights at this Hyatt again.

The pool is awesome (for kids; packed and noisy for honeymooning adults), the rooms are comfortable and well-appurtenanced, and the hotel and grounds are beautiful, but it is just plain EXPENSIVE. Now, I have paid more per night to stay at a hotel, but in those places (and at some cheaper places as well) I have received complimentary beverages in my room, complimentary breakfast, sometimes bed service, always comfortable seating by the pool, etc., in other words, things that made me feel as though I was being shown hospitality. EVERYTHING at the Hyatt is extra, and the restaurants are also mind-bogglingly expensive and the pool too small and crowded for my taste, which just left me feeling like I was being ripped off the whole time. Even the \"partial ocean view\" room that of course, we paid extra for, was a ripoff--the balcony faced the parking lot, and we had to crane our necks around the side of the building to see the ocean. The room was also right next to the elevator, which was irritating, yet we still paid extra. As soon as I saw the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room I felt strongly that the hotel was doing everything in its power to NOT give us any value for our money, and this feeling was only solidified over the rest of our stay. Here are some more examples: The hotel sells and serves Starbucks coffee, which at first I was excited about, but it's watered down. This made me so angry. And of course, it's more than $4 for a large. The breakfast buffet at the Swan Court restaurant is $30 a person and has the exact same food as the breakfast buffet at Umalu, which was only (!) $18 a person, I guess because you have to eat outside? Who knows. Our travel agent told us she got us complimentary breakfasts, but I'm wondering if everyone just gets them and Hyatt acts like it costs money so that you feel like you're getting something free, when nearly every hotel in America at least gives you coffee free anyway. We had to sign a receipt for $34 for our croissants, pineapple slices and coffee every morning, I guess so that we'd constantly be reminded of Hyatt's generosity. That seemed to be their style--calling things \"free\" that you more or less paid for anyway. There is also an extra tax added to items charged to your room, which means the hotel makes a killing having waiters and waitresses in the pool area, where guests aren't going to opt to bring cash. At $6 a beer and tip, how am I not already giving Hyatt enough money? Isn't it EASIER for them to charge it to my room? We were comped a bottle of champagne as part of a honeymoon package. At the second hotel we stayed at on this trip, we got the same deal BUT the staff brought the free bottle directly to our room as soon as we checked in. At the Hyatt Regency Maui, you have to go eat at one of their two incredibly expensive on-site restaurants and order the bottle with your meal in order to receive it. Of course, the snacks in the room aren't comped and they are even placed on a weight-sensor JUST IN CASE you are criminal enough to eat the arbitrarily-priced $3 Starburst and try to replace it with a 68-cent package from a grocery store. Granted, a lot of hotels do this, but to me that's no excuse, especially at a resort--I still think it's incredibly tacky and personally insulting. Add the \"cost\" of snacks to my room, or don't put them there. Basically, you pay $300+ a night plus an exorbitant resort fee just to sleep and shower in this place. The resort fee is another thing: they say that it \"allows you to use the facilities\" such as the gym and pool, but one is not able to opt out of facility use in order to avoid paying the fee, so basically it's a tax. While resort fees are not unique to the Hyatt, Hyatt has come up with a way to give them a uniquely rip-offy slant: they claimed to be giving us a discount on the fee, charging us $15 a day instead of $50, which we thought was great until we moved to our next hotel, where the resort fee was only $5 a day, and without any \"discounts\" to speak of. So basically the Hyatt treats the resort fee as a means of misleading people about their rates in an effort to compete with other hotels. Maybe the hotel could save money if every time the cleaning staff serviced our room, they did not throw out all of the toiletries and replace them entirely, or they could get rid of the flamingoes and penguins they keep on the grounds, which didn't titillate me, but really just made me sad. I do want to say that the staff was AWESOME. Super nice, friendly, and fun waitstaff etc. It's just the hotel's policies I do not like, however my husband travels a lot and he wasn't all that surprised by them.

I've written nice reviews about their resort in San Antonio and Albuquerque. Their hotel on kaanapali beach on maui is no different: plenty of activities, geared to keeping your children engaged and entertained. Fishing, hair braiding, belly flop contests, gratis popsicles, simon says, hula lessons...all free for the kids. The staff folks are terrific. The hotel itself is nice enough so that you're comfortable, but not so nice that you feel like you're in a very rich person's home and you're afraid to touch anything (or let your kids touch anything!). The open air atrium features exotic birds, penguins, and koi. The pools are nicely designed: a smaller pool with slides, fountains, and adjacent \"sandbox\" and a bigger pool (connected through a tunnel with waterfalls) which is less kid oriented. The beach is very limited- not much sand to speak of, mostly a shore break (not very body or boogie board friendly). If you're looking for a nice, wide, calm beach to hang out on, I would not stay here. Given the overall atmosphere, I don't think I'd recommend this hotel to honeymooners or couples looking to get away. You might want to try a quieter, less crowded, more low key venue. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the hyatt is pretty crowded. There are a lot of people around all the time. It can get a little bit hectic (pool chairs get reserved, no parking spots, lines for towels, etc).

First of all, the walls/doors are way too thin. It was tough trying to sleep past 7-8am every morning. There was noise from construction, parrots saying \"Aloha\" every minute, kids running around... it was not a restful stay for us. Second, the parking was limited very far from our room. Thirdly, my husband asked one of the service workers which way the parking lot was, and he got the dirtiest look from her. Perhaps it was an obvious question?

I will start out by positively noting that the staff was excellent and very friendly during our stay and that the grounds were well kept and quite beautiful; the various exotic birds all over the property was also a nice touch. The room and most of the hotel was clean and quite comfortable. Now, if you have kids and you have money to spend, then by all means stay here. But if you're a couple that wants romance, class, and elegance, I would say go elsewhere. There were kids running, yelling, jumping, you name it, EVERYWHERE. The pool area was a cavalcade of kids doing cannanballs and screaming at the top of their lungs. Now don't get me wrong, I love kids and I respect the right of them and their families to let loose on a great vacation, but I just don't think it jives well when others are looking for calm relaxation and beauty. In other words, the Hyatt is trying too hard to cater across too many demographics and it's just not working (at least in my opinion). This all being said, I think most Maui resorts cater mostly to families, which is something I realize more now, thus couples might have to dig deep to find that special romantic place. Beyond the description above, I was completely taken aback by the constant noise of construction (jackhammers mostly) next to the pool area where they are putting in a new restaurant. I was displeased with the fact that there was no mention of this on the website or by anyone at the hotel prior to or during our booking process. I think a courteous mention of this would have been in order so we could have decided ahead of time if we wanted to deal with it or not. And although this would probably be too much to ask, a room rate adjustment for the trouble would have been nice too. I was displeased with the dining and retail selections. There were really only two very expensive places (non snack bar type places) to eat. With all of the space they have it would have been nice to have had at least one moderately priced place to eat; a seemingly natural thing to have considering all the families that stay here. There were also so many retail spaces that were not occupied by any stores. We're paying all this money to stay at a resort with stores and restaurants, and places that have everything at your fingertips - but alas, there was a very subpar offering of shops. I've heard so much about the renovation that's been undertaken at this hotel. I'd like to know what they've done because the place seems very dated to me. I felt like it was 1997 in there with all of the wood panelling and old looking decor. Our room was comfortable and clean, but again, it just seemed dated in terms of look and style. The bathroom in our room was extremely small, although there was a separate sink area adjacent to the bathroom which lent more space. I didn't like the \"nickle and dime\" feeling I got from the place either. I appreciate the Hyatt is trying to run a sound and profitable business, but I found the following issues quite annoying: -We got a voucher for a free bottle of champagne (demi bottle) for use at any one of their EXPENSIVE restaurants in honor of our honeymoon. Very nice gesture, and yes, we were going to dine at Son'z anyway because we had heard good things about it. But are you really going to force us to claim our free bottle by having to frequent one of your restaurants and spend a fortune on dinner in the process? The class thing to do would have been to have had a bottle in our room when we arrived - no strings attached - as other resorts/hotels do. -Second, while dining at Son'z (which was quite good by the way) there was an in-house photographer taking pictures of couples and families in attendance. You could opt to buy the finished product for $20 if you so chose. Okay, is this Disney World? No! What extremely expensive and purprotedly classy establishment would allow such a thing to go on!? Frankly, I was shocked. Lastly, the elevators that we used to get to our rooms (there are separate elevator banks for different parts of the hotel) smelled horrible. Every morning and evening going down and up those things, I felt like I was in a sweaty gym lockeroom. Febreeze much? Anyway, this hotel is fine if you have kids and all you want to do is lounge at the pool all day and watch your kids run themselves ragged (that is of course, after construction in the pool area is complete). Otherwise, I would look at other, more intimate options that could probably meet your needs in a more respectable and value-driven fashion.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHyatt was beautiful and in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "PSUalum", "ReviewID": "UR71967342", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt with our teenagers (17 and 14).

Our teens enjoyed the pool as well as playing ping pong and volleyball by the ocean. The ocean walk to Black Rock was nice. We stopped at Whalers Village to check out the shops and grab a bite to eat. The Hyatt was very convenient to Lahaina for shopping/dining, Maui Wave Riders (in Lahaina) for surfing, the blowhole, Dragons Teeth and Olivine Pools.

One drawback was that we had to get up early to reserve a beach chair in the shade but I am an early bird so it was no problem. The food was incredible- I loved the fish tacos at the poolside grill. The beach could have been better...it was short and not much room to relax on it. In Kauai we spent all of our time on the beach but in Maui we spent it all in the pool.

We rented a convertible and toured the island. We really loved the north west part of the island and saw many gorgeous beaches. We took a snorkeling trip to Lanai one day and it was okay but I wouldn't recommend it. We saw some pretty fish but nothing spectacular. The sailing trip in Kauai was much better.

We have also visited and stayed on each of the Hawaiian islands and our favorite is Maui. Starting with the rooms, the rooms on the club level are great.Staying on the club level has its perks and is worth the extra money because you get a continental breakfast in the morning, appetizers, drinks and desserts in the evening. Also you will meet alot of people and make some new friends in the process. Now back to the actual rooms- While true the bathrooms are small, the rest of the room is spacious enough for two people comfortably. We usually spend very little time in the rooms as we really love spending time outdoors at the beach, pool and site seeing. And really who comes to Hawaii to spend an enormous time in the room anyway? I have read several reviews complaining about the cost of this hotel. This is a four and half star hotel on beautiful Maui and you get what you pay for. The prices are comparable to New York City prices. So if you are used to that cost then you will not suffer any sticker shock. There is a resort fee of $15 added to your stay each day and there is a charge for internet service. But since we are on a tropical island in paradise we disconnect and enjoy our vacation. I also leave my blackberry at home and do not check email on vacation. Trust me it is worth it to totally disconnect and enjoy the aloha spirit. The restaurants at the hotel are good (We ate at umalu which had very good chicken) but you are better off going to Lahaina for dinner which is pretty much where the nightlife is. We went to the Lahaina Grill and it was fantastic. It gives NY restaurants a run for their money. Get the Short Ribs-you will not be sorry. Service is excellent and desserts are fantastic. We also ate at Ruth Chris Steakhouse and several others that were all good. We also ate at several other hotel property restaurants which were very good. Check out Duo at the Four Seasons-excellent. The Hyatt property is beautiful. The pool is the best on the island and while they have a small beach in front of the property thats ok because a ten minute walk and you are in front of the Westin and the beach is quite big there. Also you can walk about 30 minutes and you can go the Sheraton and snorkel at Black Rock which is very good for snorkeling. Having visited all the hotels on Kaanapali Beach I would say the Hyatt looks the nicest. Hawaii is a place where you can make your vacation whatever you want-activity and site seeing filled or just lay by the pool and beach vacation and we have done both and I can tell you that by the end of your vacation you do not want to leave this place. I joke with my wife each time that no matter how many days it is never enough. I would take a day to go to Hana. Do the \"Road to Hana\" Takes about ten hours but it must be experienced once. The road to Hana is a 50 mile winding road adventure and you will experience the true Maui. Waterfalls, botanical gardens, black sand beaches, the seven pools( do yourself a favor and swim in all of them). Also I would take another day and go up to Halakawa (Maui's volcano) You drive up and you go above the clouds very majestic. It is not as awe inspiring as the Volcano National Park on the Big Island but still worth a trip. At the end of the day go by Maui's only winery and go for some wine tasting. You will love it and I am a wine snob. I always take home a case of wine when I am there. I would recommend the Hyatt for several reasons- Location, Service, beautiful grounds, aloha spirit they have the whole package. People laugh when you say aloha spirit and say that the Caribbean is just as nice. I have been to beach destinations all over the world from the Caribbean to Bali Indonesia and they definitely lack that aloha spirit.

However, it was not the same paradise as four years ago for several reasons: (1) I'm normally not a big drink person, but I had falled in love with the mixed drinks because they used to make them with ice-cream. This is no longer the case, so the drinks are no longer unique or special. They are definitely not worth the $12. I ordered one, and couldn't finish it because it just tasted like pure alcohol. It was so disappointing because I had really been looking forward to the drinks. (2) The towel guys no longer give away free pineapple slices, and they no longer make drinks. I had thought the free pinapple slices by the pool was a nice touch, but now all you get there is towels. (3) Cascades patio restraurant is closed, boarded up, and under construction. You can't see it, and all you hear is jackhammering and sawing. You used to be able to sit here at night, drink your Blue Hawaiian (made with ice cream), eat sushi, and listen to relaxing Hawaiian music play while looking out at the ocean. Now, you have to go to he overpriced new restaurant called UMalu. (4) The Hyatt took out that affordable convenience store and put in an expensive restraunt/bar called UMalu which we could not afford to eat at. There is no longer a place to pick up a cheap pre-made sandwich or yogurt for lunch. UMalu is nice, but caters to the ultra-trendy, ultra spendy. They have live bands play by the pool now, which is edgy and trendy, but I preferred the relaxing Hawaiian music they used to play. It seems to attract teenagers/hipsters, not quiet honeymooners. (5) Our room (facing the beautiful golf course/garden area) smelled like sewage and was not in as nice of condition as our room in 2006 which faced the ocean. The room was slightly smaller and the bathroom doors needed to be replaced. For $400 a night, it could have been better. Other than that, it was exactly the same and as beautiful as I remember.

This hotel was a splurge for us, or so we thought it would be. Ended up a waste of our money. We were checked in by a sarcastic young girl who thought it was cute and funny to be rude. When I told her it was our 20 year anniv. she barely said congratulations then said she would give us wine which never arrived. We had ants in our beds for 3 nights. We did not bring one crumb of food or drink into our room. When my husband called the first night, they said they would send someone up. Half hour later-no one came. He called again, all the while being extremely calm and polite. They sent someone up 10 min later with some potently strong smelling spray. By this time it was 10:30 pm and we were planning to go to bed so we asked them to spray in the morning. They agreed to come at 9 am. My husband had to ask to have the bedding changed when he was forced to go down to the lobby at 11 pm to deal with the whole situation. When houskeeping came to change the bedding, they asked, \"We only have to change the sheets right?\" He replied \"No, because they were all in the blanket and pillow shams. The houskeeper gave me attitude when she came in. Saying, \"You must have brought food in the room!\" I told her no and that I noticed a few ants on the paperwork on the nightstand earlier in the day but none anywhere else. She then replied with attitude. \"You should have called earlier so we could come spray!\" Well, I was trying to be an easy going guest and accept that this is the tropics. But when they over take my bed, I have a problem. Anyway, they offered to move us to a room in a different tower with no Ocean front rooms like we paid for, with no reduction in our rate. The audacity! I could give endless examples of the poor customer service. Lets just say I have recieved better service at places I stayed for 1/4 the cost. The next day we waited an hour for the spray appointment and they never showed up. We had plans for the day and assumed they were running late and would take care of it while we were gone. NOPE! When we arrived again at night they had not done anything! The next morning we arose to ants in our bed with us. Still all we get from management is that \"I will make sure it is done properly.\" When my husband went down to talk to a manager, twice he was told she wasn't available and would call our room later. Of course while we are out trying to enjoy our day, we missed her 1 call. Finally on the 3rd night, they sprayed and we slept to the smell of raid while the ants took cover in our bathroom. Now for the property. The room is a typical hotel size room with a balcony that is tiny. The beds are extremely uncomfortable. Carpet has stains. Bathroom fixtures are rusted. The grounds are beautiful but impossible to enjoy because it's like being at disneyland with all the kids and crowds. The beach is basically, unusable. It's about 5 feet of sand during low tide and full of small rocks on the shore as well as large rocks in the water. The water in the pool is cloudy first thing in the morning. Which could have something to do with the couple my husband saw having sex in the pool from our balcony, yuck! Which by the way we could no longer use after the first night because there seems to be enough smokers surrounding us that there is constant smoke flowing to our balcony. Hyatts location on Kaanapali is the worst. There are jet skis, parasailers, and the beautiful banana boat filling our ocean view all day. Drinking seems to be the biggest past time. If you like cruises then you will probably love the Hyatt. We were looking for a peaceful Hawaiian escape. We will never stay in a Hyatt again.

Our travel agent had booked this trip for us. We were looking forward to spending our final 5 nights on the Kaanapali Beach at the Hyatt. We expected this location to be the quiet and relaxing/mellow part of the trip. Wrong. We did not realize that this hotel was so large (800 plus rooms); we also did not realize that there were at least 6 other large resorts sitting side by side on this beach, along with a large number of condominiums. We soon learned that Kaanapali is a mile long stretch of beach packed with tourists. It reminded me of a luxury Myrtle Beach. Many of the tourists were very rude; people were even blowing their horns in the parking lots! This was not at all what I expected to find in Maui. The Hyatt resort itself was very beautiful but the size was overwhelming, and in some ways it was a bit over the top with the whole fantasy experience (e.g., penguins, in Hawaii?). The pool was great but the chairs filled up early in the morning. We reserved a beachfront cabana one day, and staff brought us drinks from the bar, along with complimentary ice water and fruit. The beach was pretty but quite narrow in front of the Hyatt. Our ocean front room was well appointed and large enough. We had excellent service throughout the resort. We had a lovely dinner in Son'z Maui at Swan Court. The Swan Court breakfast buffet was tasty but very pricey and very crowded; we preferred the Halona Kai coffee bar. The rest of our meals were at the nearby Whalers Village (walking distance) or in Lahaina. The free self-parking lot was always full, so we had to pay for valet parking every day. We used the travel services to book tours to Hana and Haleakala; we also booked 2 snorkeling excursions(Molokini and Honolua Bay).

The Hyatt,. the check in was smooth and we had no complaints with that. The front desk was great and answered all of our questions even those that should have gone to the concierge.The concierge was also great, no complaints there.The room was exactly what we booked.However the a/c never worked to capacity, it cooled the room but we both would wake up sweating in the middle of the night. We told housekeeping and they didn't do much with our complaint. Housekeeping was mediocre. I nicked myself shaving my legs and didn't realize until I saw the blood on the bed. I didn't tell housekeeping as I figured they would see the blood. Well either they didn't see or worse they did and didn't care because they did nothing. We came back late afternoon and my bed still had the blood stains . The pool was fantastic, especially if you have kids. They have their own pool with slides and all sorts of things to do. If I had children I would highly recommend. After all is said and done would I go back, yes. The beach was o.k. You had to walk down maybe 50 ft. to find a spot that didn't have rocks . But they say that changes with the storm. Wailea has the best beaches we actually rented a car just to use the beach the last few days. The room we had was definitely spacious. The mattress was horrible. It was just a mattress no box spring. I had a back ache the entire time I was there. Since I've been home my backache is going away. the entire time I was there I was in pain. All said and done .If we went back to Maui which is unlikely would stay at one of the resorts at Wailea.

We went back and forth a LOT between where to stay on Maui, but were very pleased with our choice of the Hyatt. Pros: The resort lobby, shops, grounds are amazing---very upscale, elegant, and refreshing. There are many unique animals around the resort including a parrot that can say aloha! They have a luau every night that was fun, and we were able to watch it directly from our balcony each night! We stayed in the Lahaina tower, so if you want to go to bed early or don't like the luau music, then don't stay in this tower. The room view was my favorite part of the whole trip! It was jaw-dropping as we had a deluxe oceanfront room and we could see the palm trees/ocean while laying on our bed!! The balcony was actually pretty big and falling to sleep with the sounds of the ocean every night was priceless. The breakfast buffet had a large variety of food and our plan included it which was nice. Yes, there are birds that fly around, but come on, it is an open air dining area and it's not like the Hyatt can control every bird in Hawaii! They tend to stay away from people----they only \"attack\" the food that is left unattended. The pool was very cool---a separate little kids area and adult section separated by waterfalls and a swim up bar. They offer you cool towels, freezies, and have a pool waitress. Cons: The service at Umalu was pretty slow. One dinner we spent like $100 for the two of us, and didn't even get our water or soda refilled even once! We were so thirsty but our waiter was so busy or distracted that he didn't even refill our drinks one time. I think they need to higher a \"water filler\" like they have at Longboards at the Marriott next door. The only other thing is the beach/water situation. The beach is pretty rocky, strong undertow, and basically no beach! There is a small beach on the right front of the hotel, in front of the Napilli towers, but that is about it. But, I guess there could be pros to that? There isn't as much beach traffic, and you can sit closer to the actual water with a smaller beach. We did rent a cabana at the Sheraton one day and snorkeled down there----it took us like 35 minutes to walk down there, but that is always an option. Overall, I would def recommend the Hyatt to anyone! It was awesome and Maui is my new favorite Hawaiian island! We did things like sunrise on Haleakala, biked down the volcano, luau, snorkeling, parasailing, hiking to waterfalls, tour of the stars on the roof, etc. Hawaii is a magical place and really paradise in the pacific!

When we arrived we were overcome by the beautiful sites/landscape of the property, however we found it so big, we got lost trying to find our room, and the fitness area (which was at least a 10 minute walk for us). The room itself was nothing special and sort of outdated. The view outside the room was good (mostly trees were blocking our ocean view though) but there is really no beachfront so it was hard for us to enjoy the days at the beach, worrying if the water would wash our stuff into the ocean. The pool is big and nice though, however, people seem to leave their towels on the chairs early in the morning to \"reserve\" them. We got the free breakfast buffet included, otherwise we would have not eaten at the hotel for breakfast as they charge $30 pp for breakfast. We ate at the swan court one day and never went back as it took our waitress 20 minutes to get to our table to leave us coffee. Then we ate at umalu which was more of a self serve buffet which we preferred. It had a little bit less than Swan court but still enough to be satisfied. The only thing is that birds will swarm your breakfast so I had to make sure to swat the birds away as my husband went up for more food, vice versa. Also, We were promised as honeymooners, a lei upon check in which i had to request since they did not provide one for us, and we thought they would give us a free bottle of champagne but it turns out all they give is a coupon to their restaurant which you had to ask for it there. if you didn't want to eat at the restaurant at the hotel (which we did not) then you pretty much did not get the champagne. They also tried to charge us a $25 resort fee per day, when we booked we were told it was $15 so i got the front desk to change this. I just think its ridiculous that they charge this amount per day for the use of the gym and the morning newspaper. The location itself though was good as it was close to Lahaina which is where all the shopping/restaurants are. If i ever go back to maui i would probably stay at another hotel.

Everyone complains about the pricing at the Hyatt. It's expensize everywhere in Maui. Get over it, if you can't afford it then don't stay there. This hotel is on the stretch of Kannapali beach, home of one of the nicest beaches in Maui. Any avg. to nice restaurant/hotel in the area is going to be expensive. Hell, peanut butter is $4-$5 at the grocie store. The second compain is I here about the rooms. If your in Maui spending most of your time in your room then once again don't go to Maui. The rooms are perfectly fine and I had no complaints. From the time we pulled up to the time we left the service was absolutley perfect. From the bellmen to the Manager, everyone was extremely friendly and easy to deal with. We went for our honeymoon with breakfest included. As reported breakest is $30 a person and is not worth the price so I would make sure you get this included. You get to dine in the nicest area of the hotel that was once listed on \"life styles of the rich and famous\" as a top restuarant/view in the world! Look it up. The landscape I can't say enough about. It's absolutely sureal to see pink flamingos, peguins, birds and other exotic animals running around the hotel.

You can walk on the beach or a paved sidewalk along the 100 plus palm trees that line the way. There is free parking unless you want to valet overnight.

The staff is very accommodating, very polite, and always willing to extend a hand to assist with anything. LOCATION: I find that the hotel location is great. It is centrally located around many activities and sites you want to make sure you visit. Its just a hop-skip-jump down to the Whalers Village (shopping), Black Rock (snorkeling), LahainaTown (shopping, and eating) just to name a few. For those of you that also want to compare the Hyatt to something like the Grand Wailea I offer this as some advice. We also looked into the Grand Wailea and wanted to know if we made the right choice. So we headed down to the Grand Wailea and were not impressed at all. It is a huge grand hotel, however we did not find the grounds to be as well kept. And remember if you are concerned about price this is has a huge price tag. PRICE: I have seen many reviews mention that the prices are high and would have to agree. If you are a big drinker be prepared to pay the price. The average drink price is around $11.00 dollars. Try to avoid room service if you can because a simple lunch can add $60.00 dollars to your bill in no time. ROOMS: The rooms are of average size but nothing spectacular. The beds were very comfortable. ACTIVITIES: The hotel is centrally located and allows for easy access to plenty of other hotels, bars, restaurants and shopping. I would recommend using the health club for an early morning workout. You can use the treadmill or elliptical while looking out at the ocean. Another activity is the Hyatt's Luau. The Luau had decent food and a fantastic show. The show brings you through a series of different ages while telling a story about each one. Another activity is the Hyatt's Tour of the Stars (no, not movie stars the real ones). You have a choice of 3 different times to attend. You will head up to the roof with an expert on astronomy and look at different items around the big night sky. Of course you have to hit the pool. Its a great pool with waterfalls and fantastic service poolside. There are also separate pool areas for children that offer a smaller water slide, waterfall, sand play area and some water fountain fun. If you like to shop the Hyatt has some stores attached directly to its main atrium area. A smaller Macy's store is also there so you can get about anything you need. And if you like animals the Hyatt has some fantastic friends in its Atrium and Garden. You can see colorful talking parrots (usually 3-4 of them out daily), Penguins, Flamingo's, Swan's and much more. NEGATIVES: Occasionally you will have to spend a bit more time waiting for assistance at the front desk. (Any other place in the hotel this is not a problem) So there it is we hope this helps!!

Place is very well managed, and customer service is excellent! It is a huge hotel so not having an ocean view room located on one of the high floors could get old going to and from your room. There are however some complaints that I have. First is the cost of everything once your at the Hotel. With the cost to stay there I can't see the reason to absolutely charge out of control prices for everything else that they offer, especially the food (which is good, but way overprice even for Hawaii). Second is there is no microwave in your room so if you want to save some food for later there is no way to warm it up, I'm sure this is on purpose so you will go spend another 20 dollars for a cheeseburger. There are wonderful restaurants in Lahaina which is about five minutes in a car.

We arrived and were greeted with leis and pleasant bellmen. Upon checking in we had issues with the front desk on the length of our stay. Everything worked out and we ended up with our deluxe ocean view room that we had booked. Our room had a great view with two large balconies. Our friends were down the hall and their balcony was basically just a walk out. Our room was spacious but our bathroom, particularly the area with shower and toilet were terribly small. I would constantly bump my leg on the door trying to get in and close the door. The bed was comfy and slept well most of the time, with the exception of the time change from Texas. The hotel itself is beautiful. Open and airy. Lots of Koi fish, penguins, parrots, birds and flamingos hanging about. Tropical and pineapple plants all over. Large beautiful pool with waterfall, a grato and pool bar; and kiddie pool with tube slides-one big enough even for the adults. Also a small hot tub. Self parking was crazy!! I'm not sure where most of these people were from, but they parked over the lines and crooked and my husband ended up in a fender bender due to way another car had parked. Note: use the back lot...people park much better there for some reason. We did the breakfast included when we booked and it is well worth it!! Otherwise you're paying $30 per person for breakfast that is good, but after the 5th day of the same thing...starts to get old...fast. FYI...if you don't arrive early (to the restaurant with the omelette station), you will have to wait in a line up the stairs. There is another restaurant with breakfast buffet w/o omelette station that where the wait is not bad. When we arrived it was happy hour at the Umalu bar...Mai Tai's $5 and beers $3...not bad right?! Well drink up during that time because otherwise you're paying $11 a piece for a Mai Tai!! AND...if you're at the pool during the happy hour, get your happy butt up and go to the bar, because your poolside service does not honor the happy hour...CRAZY!! We learned that the hard way!! Location is good. Just a walk down the way is Whaler's village with lots of restaurant's and shopping. The beach right off the resort is small, but if you walk a little way down, it gets bigger. We had a rent car and knew that there would be some travel involved to the places that we wanted to go compared to where our hotel was located...not a big deal to us. The hotel also has a $25 room fee per day (as of June 2010). We booked prior to this and it was $15 for us. Not sure what this is for, but I think it's ridiculous!! On our last night, we were truly tired and just wanted to order in and hang out in our room. We called Pizza Hut and the lady told me that I would have to meet the delivery guy at the front desk, no big deal, right? Well, come to find out, Hyatt does not allow them on their property PERIOD!! We had to walk about a 1/4 mile just to go meet the delivery guy!!

Based on below reviews, decided to stay here over the Fairmont in Waliea. Although we visited the Fairmont and were unimpressed with their grounds, Hyatt wasn't much better. Let me be to the point: 1. This hotel is probably the largest on island if not in the state of Hawaii. Lots of people stay here, and it seemed crowded despite this being a down economy. (I asked front desk what their occupancy was and they said 98% and that was what it was going to be most of the summer due to large groups staying at hotel and business conventions). 2. Rooms, facilities, grounds were run down. This resort is in major need of a renovation. Won't happen soon though because of 1--why should they invest if people keep coming? 3. Location is so so. I wish we would have known this based on reviews below. If all you want to do is park yourself at the resort and see nothing else on the island, stay here. Otherwise, you end up doing a lot of driving everyday to see things (Road to Hana, Sunrise at Crater, certain restaurants, etc.) We regret not staying in Waliea which would have lopped at least 30 min each way off our drives to/from activities. 4. Pool is nice, but the chairs are PILED on top of each other to accommodate all the guests. 5. WORST bed I have ever slept on in my entire life!!! All they put down is a mattress--no box spring (might be why) (=cost savings to hotel). 6. Walls are incredibly thin. We heard our neighbors and their tv constantly. 7. Yes, the grounds are ok and seem exotic if you've been to no other resorts on the Island, but there is no beach (sure you can walk 10 min to Kaanapali which is nice but crowded) due to erosion. 8. Buffet breakfast was disappointing. Although included in our costco purchased package (so I can't complain about the $30 per person price), the lines into the restaurant, and once inside, the omelet station were long. Who want's to wait in line while on vacation? More problematic was the birds flying everywhere, crapping on the backs of chairs and on the lights, and waiting for you to get up to devoir your leftovers. It was completely unsanitary. And to top that off, the wait staff that only brings you another pot of coffee if needed and clears the table once done, likes to point out that it is customary to leave a 15% tip. Whatever. 9. High-speed internet (provided by T-mobile) was absolutely terrible. Need to get on every time you turn on/wake your computer. And then, it is extremely slow. 10. Things we did like: 1.5 mile walking/jogging paved path along the ocean; friendly front desk; Kaanapali beach access; Leilanis restaurant (15 min walk along path at outdoor mall---go there for fish tacos and hula pie--best affordable meal on Island); decent fitness center; and, proximity of resort to town of Lahaina.

After researching and looking at pictures on Tripadvisor for WEEKS, I finally decided on the Hyatt. I am so glad I did! The pictures simply don't do it justice. The hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful and the view from our room was breathtaking. Spend the extra money for an Oceanfront Room. We slept with our balcony door open every night and fell asleep listening to the crashing waves. Rooms: Our room was better than expected. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a flat screen TV, which my husband appreciated. The closet/bathroom area was well appointed and there was great water pressure in the shower. There is also and in room safe and refrigerator. Grounds: As I stated, beautiful. Please take a look at my pictures. I tried to capture a little of everything. Pool: Great pool area! Although there were many people there, we never really had a problem finding a good spot. People come down early and claim the Umbrella chairs by placing their towels down. This is supposedly against the rules, but no one enforced it. It wasn't a big deal though. With a sharp eye, you can find a spot. The hotel also offers beachfront cabanas. $25 for a 1/2 day, $50 for the whole day. They come with complimentary ice water (you'll appreciate it) and pineapples. There was also someone walking around passing out freeze pops (for free). Beach: DON'T BE ALARMED! The beach directly in front of the Hyatt sucks! Lots of rocks and coral. I was initially disappointed. However, a quick 3 -5 minute walk along the boardwalk took us to a much better portion of beach! You can also rent cabanas, chairs and umbrellas. Look for the building that says \"Water Activities.\" Everything is 1/2 price after Noon, so we were able to get a cabana for $25 for the whole day! Umbrellas are $8 and chairs are $5! GREAT DEAL Location: Great location. Whalers Village is a quick 10 minute walk along the beach. So is the Westin, the Marriott and a few other hotels. If you're tired or hot, there is a free trolley that will drop you off and pick you up. Breakfast: GET YOUR BREAKFAST INCLUDED! That is, if you like to eat. The breakfast buffet was AWESOME, but for $30/person, I'm glad it was included in our package. Breakfast is served from 6:30-11. Depending on what time you get down there, there may be a line, but we were always seated quickly and never stood in line long. The delay was caused by the hostess checking names on her list to determine who was eating free. Umalu Bar/ Restaurant - GREAT FOOD!!! Everything we had was good. Seriously. You can't go wrong here. Room Service: We ordered a pizza one night and it wasn't bad. I also had cookies and milk and they were pretty good too. Our food was to our room within 20 minutes each time. Staff: Everyone was nice! They even remembered our names! The only negative: The Hyatt is DEAD at night. They have live entertainment at Umalu for a while, but other than that, there is NOTHING going on. If you are looking for the nightlife, this is NOT the hotel for you. If you want to relax and enjoy your companion, it's a great place. We fell asleep in a hammock one night. Very romantic. Drums of the Pacific Luau: Honestly, we didn't go. You can stand on the sidewalk and watch it for free. After viewing a few minutes of it, we decided to pass. I wasn't impressed. For $95/person, I can find something else to do with my money. We don't do buffets, so it wasn't worth it. Gym/Spa: The gym and spa are amazing! I wasn't expecting them to be so nice. You can look out at the ocean while on the treadmill. There's also a steamroom that my hubby enjoyed. He had to pay $15 to use it though. All in all....great hotel.

It was our first trip to Hawaii, and decided to only go to Maui for our entire 6 day honeymoon stay. We chose the HRM because of its good reviews on TA. I've finally gotten around to posting my review of it!!! Play by play: Room: We had an oceanfront room which was very roomy until you hit the bathroom. Unbelievable small, basically water closet. For a hotel that exudes romance, I was surprised that the shower was really only meant for one. Loved the balcony, though. Spent some time there just listening to the sounds of the resort and the ocean. Location: Right at the end of the Ka'anapali beach hotel strip. Very close to other hotels, so you won't feel too secluded here. Definifely rent a car (if anything, a convertible). The airport is about an hour drive away and a lot of the great attractions/sites on the island are a good drive from the hotel. A car was a must. Food: We got the breakfast included deal at Son'z though travelocity and BOY was it worth it. My word, just amazing spread of food... the best we'd seen, that's for sure. I couldn't justify paying $60 (or whatever crazy fee their charging now) for it though. The sushi at Cascades was AMAZING... at least in December, when we were there. The Kobe slider at Umalu....... to die for. My word, I don't know what the put in it, but if you're a burger fan, you have to try it! Pool: Wonderful! Pretty darn cool waterfalls, and surprisingly, an amazing little slide! Beach: Ugh, walk a little further up the pathway (about 15-20 min) and hang out on Ka'anapali Beach instead. It is just too small for our taste. Activities: The spa was wonderful, but I can't say much else, since it was our first time at one. We got a couple massage and facial (for me), pedicure (for him!). The jet skis are fun, but waaaaaaay too expensive on the resort. Since the hubby had never jet skiied before we decided to splurge for him. Whaler's Village is just walking distance away... good shopping and dining there. Stop by Leilani's for happy hour drinks and Hula Pie! Also, snorkling within walking distance = Black Rock. It's ok... there are fish, and occasionally turtles. But more exciting, the cliff jumpers! You can join them too! We didnt do the luau at the resort... opted for the Old Lahaina Luau, since it is so popular, and it was our first time. Overall, great honeymoon getaway for a very reasonable price.

This kind of stuff is acceptable when staying at a hundred dollar a night hotel, but not when paying three times that amount.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cNO LOYALTY FOR CLUB MEMBERS AT HYATT MAUI\u201d", "Author": "living62", "ReviewID": "UR64784739", "Content": "it's a sad day when you have to write a negative review about a chain hotel that had always provided world class service. It took several weeks for me to decide if i should write this review but after reading some of the other posts i felt that i had no choice. we are platinum members of the Hyatt chain. we travel frequently , stay on the regency level(yes,even when we pay)and usually travel with at least 2 of our children . I booked a trip for late march into early April back on Feb 1st. with the Hyatt club platinum division for my husband, myself and our 2 younger kids aged 5 & 6. This booking was to be for 6 nights on the regency level at no cost per se but rather paid for \"with points\"(pretty expensive when you consider that our winter time Hyatt hotel in the Caribbean costs $790 per night). Upon booking i made it clear to the agent that my husband(who is a medical volunteer) had left several days ago in order to help the victims of the earthquake in Haiti and that we would be reuniting in Maui for a well deserved rest and i insisted upon a quiet room with 2 double/queen beds and a ocean view on the regency club level and was told that it would all be taken care of. I followed up on the reservation every few weeks in order to insure against any \"problems\"( we were meeting up with other families for the holiday on the eve of our arrival to Maui)Furthermore, upon arrival into the Hawaiian Islands our first stop was a short stay at the Hyatt Waikiki (which although dated, was outstanding in terms of service,location and amenities) . The front desk manager took the time to personally phone the \"sister resort\" since it was written all over my confirmation and he was assured that a \"quiet room with 2 double beds and a great view \" would be held for us. Well here it comes..... there was a very strong wind on that late march day and we arrived about 45 min later, add in the car rental , and we arrived about 5 pm instead of 3pm(not too bad since holiday dinner was set for 8 pm). Check in was a breeze, i was told by the young man that \"indeed it is a very quiet room with a nice view and 2 beds\" i was handed a key to the 20th floor (not the 21st which is where the club room is). i asked him why i was not on the 21st floor to which he responded \"o don't worry you will be so satisfied\". well..... QUIET INDEED IF YOU ARE SITUATED DIRECTLY BENEATH THE CLUB DINING ROOM !! mind you , they begin to set up at 5am and close after 11pm(btw, no view either). I called down to the front desk and was told that due to the spring break the hotel was completely booked and that if i wanted 2 beds that would be my only choice. If i gave up the 2 beds and placed my children on a pull out couch they could put me in another room also on the 20th floor but that was all they could do.. at first i was polite and remained calm but i felt that they were rude and very unapologetic. I had looked up the hotel on trip advisor, and had also noticed that as of late Hyatt has begun to either sell or/and \"upgrade\" non loyal guests into the regency club and they also unload rooms on various sites. so here i was, a devoted and loyal Hyatt customer with a husband who really deserved a break and 2 cranky kids and a holiday dinner fast approaching with an inadequate room that was most likely \"given away as a freebie upgrade to someone who never even stayed at a hyatt but got it for real cheap\". A young woman called me and advised me to take the room with the pull out couch since it would be much quieter and that she would place 2 cots in the room and reinstate points for 2 of my nights. The bellman,who was aware of what had happened, left us with our bags on a trolley and disappeared.I pushed the bags around to the other side of the floor and opened our new room. Great view....of the highway, we were glad that we left new york city and flew to Hawaii. The first thing i did was check for bedbugs which unfortunately can be a problem...for others...i can not say i saw a bed bug but the mattress had a rusty stain and i insisted that it be changed. It took a long time to bring the mattress up and when they did the rudeness was beyond ! i again went to look at the mattress whereupon a small ant was crawling across it! i quickly called to the men who brought it up to take a look since i thought i was about to loose my mind (or maybe i was on candid camera?) they were so slow to respond and rude that they did not see it. regardless i had reached the end of my rope. i called My sister to come get our children and take them to the holiday dinner and the men begrudgingly removed the mattress and unfortunately rolled it over my foot with no apology at all. We were about to leave and go to the Ritz Carlton when a wonderful manager appeared, i genuinely think he felt bad and he seemed embarrassed by what we had experienced. The entire housekeeping staff (at least that's what it felt like)came to clean the room, he reinstated all of our points and treated us to dinner and the spa. yet, we indeed missed the holiday with our family(irreplaceable) and we flew hours from the east coast for this. The next morning in the regency club i knew that more than half the people in the club had never before stayed on that level since people were openly discussing it (and if you read prior posts you will see what i mean). there were no tables , you were not allowed to remove alcoholic beverages out of the room (a first for us) and the idea of \"nut free\" was nowhere to be found (our child is deadly allergic). enough said? The rest of our stay was uneventful,there was no issue finding seats by the pool. The towel policy is a drag but unfortunately people do take advantage of hotel towels. The hot tubs were not hot and yes the gym was filthy and was filled with little kids they need to have someone attending the gym.The food, as at all Hyatt hotels, was delicious.did we enjoy? yes in a way that all people begin to relax and enjoy Hawaii. will we go back? don't think so , not to the Hyatt. It took 6 calls to get my \"points\" reinstated. When i spoke to someone in corporate i guess they figured i was a small fish in their big pond of corporations etc so who really cares? well Hyatt, in this day and age of financial uncertainty it would behoove you to treat your loyal non corporate customers a wee bit better and maybe you guys can throw in something better than a thread bare yellow towel? for shame!", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cCan't Match the Hyatt in Kauai\u201d", "Author": "badgerak", "ReviewID": "UR64431546", "Content": "This is very nice hotel with a fine location on the busy beach strip, if that's your thing.

The staff was very helpful and friendly and never seemed \"stuffy\", despite the high end nature of the resort. I've read other reviews talking about the beach and yes, the beach directly behind the resort is rocky, but if you walk literally 30 seconds in either direction the beach becomes sandy and perfect for swimming or snorkeling. The resort pools were the best we've ever seen. There is a larger adult pool and a kid pool with squirting fountains, waterslides, and sand to play in. This is where we spent most of our pool time. Waterfalls everywhere, even a grotto bar in a cave! The drink prices at the resort are outrageous ($12.50 per cocktail). We had one to indulge, but usually walked along the path to Whalers Village and found many beach front restaurants where Mai Tai's could be had for $3-4 apiece during happy hour as well as cheap food. The rooms in the hotel were clean and comfortable. If you have kids consider asking for a room in the tower close to the children's pool so the hike isn't so long. My only complaint about the room is they have various overpriced food items on a tray in the room ($3 candy bar anyone?) and if you even move the food a bit, you get charged because it's hooked to some type of sensor. The hotel did warn us about this at check in, but it was still annoying because all the food is on a counter above the mini fridge and is kind of in the way. I kept worrying we'd accidentally bump into it and get charged for the items. The resort also has a first class spa with cardio, free weights, and strength training equipment which is great for early morning workouts.

The hotel staff was friendly, and the concierge was great with the excursions. We ate at both the Sonz and Omalu twice and food and service were superb. Someone of the best seafood I've had and well worth the Maui prices. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary and they sent a bottle of champagne to our room, which was great. The grounds of the hotel are paradise, and I can see why the book we picked up at Barnes and Noble named it best Fantasy resort, because that's exaclty what the lobby and gorunds are. The pool, with waterfalls, penguins, swans and decor was unreal. The rooms were quiet and the staff was always willing to help. Yes, the pool chairs get crowded but we never had a problem finding one. Also, get the Swan Court breafast included in whatever deal you get, because it is great and would cost you $30 a piece otherwise. There was always a 15 minute wait no matter what time for breakfast, but well worth it. I checked the grounds of the other 4 resorts next to the Hyatt, and in my humble opinion it has by far the best layout. WE booked our trip through Costco travel and it killed all other travel options including AAA. Here's another tip that I found while on the Island. There's a Costco by the airport, and besides getting cheap Leis and Mac nuts, they have Hyatt gift certificates $100 for $79. You can use those to pay for dinner, or excursions if you charge them to your room. Also, we did the Skyline Ziplines, PWF Molikini snorkel and the road to Hana and they were all awesome.

The bathroom curtain was stale smelling when we first checked in, but it was promptly replaced after a call to housekeeping. The furniture is dated, but who really spends a lot of time inside the room? We had heard about the luau being the best in Maui, and it sure didn't disappoint. The fire dance was spectacular, and so were the other routines. The food was mediocre, but that's Hawaiian cuisine for you ;)... The location is great. Lahaina is a fun town with a whole spectrum of restaurants, shops and art galleries. Unfortunately, the beach strip attached to the hotel is not the greatest of Kaanapaali. Walk/Drive to the Sheraton grounds for the best portion of the beach, near Black Rock. My only other gripe was the lack of free internet access...But that was a blessing in disguise because it kept my wife away from her laptop ;)...

I realize that many rental cars look alike, but this should never happen. Worse, we had to rent another car for the day and a manager promised that we would be reimbursed for that cost.

All of the previous reviews are pretty well spot on. We had a deluxe ocean front room on the 21st floor which was a concierge floor. This was a great benefit as it included a continental breakfast, juice, sodas and snacks all day and then of course happy hour from 5p-7p which was cocktails and appetizers. There was then a dessert service after that. This was a complimentary upgrade that we received when we checked in. The service overall was excellent. Beginning at check in, around the pool, at the buffet (our breakfast buffets were included) until check out, the service was prompt and courteous. The views from our room were spectacular. The pool was very nice and we were out there for several hours every day enjoying mai tais and pina coladas. The people that say you have to get there are 6:30 am..........not sure what they were thinking. We never had a problem finding primo seating at 10am or at 1pm. The chairs are adequate but the towels are the thinnest, most worn beach towels I have ever seen. No prob....we brought some of our own. Like others have said, the location is 5 star but the hotel itself is dated. Low popcorn celings, worn furniture, small rooms and bathroom etc. This is what I expected when I went in and just what I got. If I had been expecting the Four Seasons or paid Four Season's prices, it would have been terrible. Back to the deal we got. I got the hotel for six night (deluxe ocean front) included buffet breakfast for 2, the resort fees and a $100 hotel credit along with an intermediate rental car for $1700 total. So with that in mind, and the fact that we were in Maui (paradise), we had a fabulous vacation. We snokeled Molokini, saw whales, went zip lining and went out for some pretty good meals. So despite the shortcomings of the hotel, the Hyatt Maui provdied us a base for a wonderful time. I would certainly recommend it to families as the children's pool is great and for a group of friends or couples. If it were my honeymoon and I were looking for something upscale, this is not the place. We used the spa and the fitness center on several occassions, both were top notch.

The balaconies (if you can call them that) are very small and can barely seat two people. But the grounds are beautiful with sounds of waterfalls and waves. There is a mini fridge and coffee maker. The beds are sort of weird looking being low but not very comfortable either. I woke up with a backache every morning, but that went away after moving around. The bathroom isn't anything to write home about either. Stay away from the snack try, there are sensors on it that detect any snack that is lifted from it - beware. The restaurants are okay with decent selection, although somewhat pricey. There is a $15 resort fee for each night (I've seen worse at other places). Overall I would say if your paying more then $200 a night, you're overpaying. It could be a great place once the place is updated (I was told later this year they will start updating it). But the 70's look with the dark wood paneling, low ceilings with popcorn and all the little shops on the ground floor reminded me of the 70's decade.

Upon arrival we were informed that the type of room we had booked was not available. To compensate, we were asked to stay in a lower class room for one night, and were then upgraded to an oceanfront room for the remaining 5 nights. We were also given 2 free tickets to their luau. We were quite happy with this. We also received a complimentary voucher for a bottle of champagne, to be used at any of the restaurants at the hotel. This wasn't much of a perk as we had to spend $100+ for a meal at their overpriced restaurants, just to enjoy a small piccolo of champagne. You would have thought that a hotel of this stature would not be so stingy with their guests considering the amount of money their guests pay to stay with them. The oceanfront room we stayed in for 5 nights was quite nice (if not dated), with a great view of the beach and the ocean. The restaurants at the hotel were expensive, so we mainly ate out at bars and restauraunts down the boardwalk (we highly recommend Longboards, kimo's at Lahaina, and the bar and restaurant in the Marriott hotel - the guys there were great! ) The pool is also quite nice - except you will need to get down there early (6am) for a lounge as people go and put their towels on the lounges and then don't come back for a few hours. The biggest issue we had with this hotel was in relation to debits taken from our credit card without our knowledge or consent - which overshadowed all the good things about this hotel, and ruined the end of our honeymoon. While we were staying at this hotel, a number of 'holds' were placed on one of our credit cards that we were required to give the front desk staff on check in for authorisation. These 'holds' were for random amounts for various purchases which we did not make eg: an online spa store. We did not use this credit card at all during our time in Maui. These 'holds' racked up to over $4000, and we only became aware of them after we left Maui to our next destination, when our card was declined for check in at our next hotel. This left us sick with worry, and ruined the remainder of our honeymoon. To make matters worse another of our credit cards had debits taken from it once we had left the island. It seems that someone was putting meals to the room we were in - even though we had departed. When we tried to call the hotel to get to the bottom of it they did not return our calls and messages - it was only when Hyatt head office stepped in some 2 weeks later that something was done about this. Hyatt head office were great in dealing with this problem, although no acknowledgement was made by them that there are some serious flaws in the way transactions can be made against a room or a persons credit card. We only wanted 3 things from they Hyatt. 1. an apology 2. our credit cards reimbursed and 3. acknowledgement that there are flaws in their system which they should look into so that it did not happen to another guest. We tried to explain this to the Hyatt staff however they refused to acknowledge this issue so to be honest once we had received our credits back we gave up trying to get through to them. All in all, this appalling behaviour on the part of Hyatt Maui overshadowed the good things about this hotel. We would definitely not stay here again.

For us the Hyatt was our least favourite of the 3 hotels we stayed in - mainly down to a few silly rules and charges. Good things: the room - comfortable, clean, spacious and well furnished - we had a partial ocean view room - but as we were in a corner room, we also had a view of the golf course/mountains, so we got the best of both worlds. View was great, glad I didn't pay extra for an ocean view/front room, as it wouldn't have been worth it. The front desk staff were very helpful/friendly and the lobby, grounds and pool area were all beautiful. Thought the penguins and flamingos were a quirky touch! The cocktails at the pool were delicious, and although at a slight premium, were large sized drinks, so felt OK paying a little more. Bad things: the add on charges - You can't help feeling that they're trying to make a quick buck out of you at every turn, when you've already paid more than enough for the room rate. We went into it knowing about the additional charges, but I think it's a question of value for money - if the hotel had been amazing in every possible way we might have felt a little better about it - but it felt like a lot to pay for what we got. Our room was $262/night including tax - the most expensive hotel of our trip by about $130/night, but we didn't really feel it was $130 better than the other places we stayed. Then there was a further $15/night resort fee - which as far as we could tell covered parking. The other things they say it includes (coffee making/access to the fitness center/daily newspaper/free local calls) are things which most hotels would include in their room rate anyway. They then charge you another $10/night for internet access - which is a bit tight, I think this should be included as part of what the resort fee covers. I think what I'm really saying is that the room rate + resort fee + internet fee of $287/night for this hotel was expensive for what we got - this hotel should be more in the $180 -$200/night range. One morning for breakfast we called by the coffee bar in the lobby and nearly fainted at the prices - $6.50 for a chocolate muffin?!!? We drove the 5 minutes to Safeway and paid less than $6.50 for 2 coffees and two muffins! $6.50 for a chocolate muffin is a rip off, no matter how good the view! The pool towel card/wrist band faff - none of the other hotels we stayed in had this rule - you exchanged your towel card for a pool towel - and then back to a card when you were done, and if you didn't return your cards on check out they billed you $25 for a mangy pool towel! With what they are charging I think they could stretch to letting you have a couple of pool towels without all the hassle of trading them for cards - it wasn't like they were so plush and lovely that you would have wanted to take one. And what if you wanted 2 towels, not one?! They also make you wear a wrist band - so that they can tell you are staying the Hyatt and not one of the neighbouring hotels, but I don't really know why - although the Hyatt had a lovely pool, so did the other hotels - it just seemed like another unnecessary rule.

We took the week of my teenage stepson as the vacation time this go around. The Hyatt was included in package deal from our club store. After booking and seeing reviews here, I was a little depressed that I didn't check on Tripadvisor first, so we were going to hold back judgement until we got to our destination. So the day of our trip comes and flying from the DC area, it is a LONG flight. We arrived at the airport at around 5.00 PM local time. By the time we got the bags and the rental car and made the drive to the hotel, it was about 6.30. Plan on about 45 minutes drive time from the airport to this hotel. We were very impressed as we drove up to the hotel looking at how well the grounds were kept. We dropped off the bags and then parked the car. Parking was a little scarce but found a parking spot behind the resort near the luau area. I think if you park late at night, parking is difficult but not impossible. Just something to plan around. A lot of people come to the luau and take up spaces, but they open up after the luau is over. No big deal. Checking in was a snap, took us about 5 minutes at most. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view room overlooking the mountains as well. We did book for a queen bed and double bed, but apparently there were none available, but our 13 year old doesn't mind sleeping on a sleeper sofa. And to be honest, we weren't planning on spending much time in the room other than to sleep at night. We were in Hawaii after all. The room over all was very nice, well decorated. The bathroom was very clean, no mold or other things around. Wife really enjoyed the bath supplies provided (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, toothpaste). The grounds of the hotel were magnificant. Birds were abundent all over the grounds. We spent many hours walking around the hotel and along the beach walk to Whaler's village. Breakfast for two of us were included in our package deal, so we ate at Swan Court twice and then at Umalu twice. Swan Court had a better selection, but if you didn't arrive by 8 or 8.30, there was a line to get in. We are early birds and would get there at 7 and maybe had to wait 5 minutes. We did have to pay for our teenagers breakfast, and that would run 35 dollars at Swan Court and about 10 dollars cheaper at Umalu. Yes, it is expensive but it is Hawaii, that is to be expected. I have travled for work to Honolulu in the past, and a continental breakfast at a hotel there ran 25 dollars, so I felt we got our money's worth at the Hyatt. The wait staff was always friendly, as well as housekeeping and other staff we interacted with. They seemed to be happy and in good spirits. The first full day there, we decided to stay on the resort area and be at the pool. The pool facility was great. Posters are right though, the chairs can get taken up quickly, but lack of chairs never kept us from the pool. We were able to find some chairs in the shade every time we went there. Sometimes, couples would offer to move over a chair so my wife and I could lay together, which was very nice. Seems like most guest were very pleasant and were willing to help out. We swam in the big pool, went through the cave to the other side, to the area where the rope bridge was and the big water slide. My stepson and I did do the slide a few times, and it was fun. I think some adults were bashful to try it, but after they saw me to it a half a dozen times, they decided to partake in the activities with the kids. When lunch time came, we looked at eating at the resort, bud didn't care for the prices or selection, so we walked to Whalers Village, which is about a 20 minute walk north of the resort on the walking path. There were better selections and prices to be had there. There is also an ABC store to visit for snacks and light flair. If planning ot leave the resort to dine out, if you go to Whaler's Village, the restaurants start getting packed around 5.30. We always ate an earlyish dinner at around 5.00 to avoid the crowds and the wait. This worked out very well, most of the time we got a table in 10-15 minutes. We tried to go at 7.30 one evening and it was a hour to hour and a half wait. We spent a few days of our week long vacation at the resort and was very happy with it overall. I can't think of one major complaint. The only gripe I have is that they keep a tray of food in the room as well as a stocked fridge with adult beverages. Just don't touch anything or mess with it. If you remove something, it is automatically charged to the room as they are weight sensitive. An accidential bump and a charge to your room could happen. I warned the wife and kid up front, and we had no problems, but smaller kids may be tempted to touch. Also, no free internet in the hotel which was kind of nice, beind disconnected from everyone and work, but some may find that to be a hinderance. This is the first time we have made the trip to Maui and want to go again in the future (too bad it takes like 18 hours of travel time to get there from the east coast). But the distance won't stop us from going back in the future, and the Hyatt will be number one on our list unless we find somewhere else substantially cheaper to stay at.

We were traveling with 2 teenagers and secured what we felt was a great deal, so we decided to take a chance. We were not disappointed!! From the complimentary first night of valet service ( really appreciated after a long flight), to the bottled waters and shell leis given at check in, we were made to feel welcome from the minute we arrived! I had originally booked one room for the 4 of us, planning to see whether we could get a second room at a discount once on site. Alas, they were sold out! I was almost happy to hear it, as it is a sign that things may be improving for Hawaii tourism after a dismal couple of years. So, knowing we might be a bit cramped, we headed to our room, a Deluxe Ocean View on the Regency Club level of the Atrium Tower. I booked Regency Club level because I knew we would have continental breakfast, snacks, drinks, etc. which when you are traveling with teenagers can be a huge money-saver. We were surprised at how nice the room was!! Not worn or tired as many have described. Perhaps some of the rooms have been updated. The view from the lanai was fantastic! We were very pleased. We had a king bed and a pull-out couch and were given a rollaway(no charge) as well. When the couch was opened and the rollaway set up, it was tough to get to the lanai without climbing over them, but we managed, and this was only at night and early morning. Yes the bathroom was smaller than what most luxury hotels have these days, but we didn't come to Maui to sit in the bathroom! The 4 of us had no problem sharing the space(not at the same time, of course!) Husband and son used the fitness center daily and thought it was great. The Hyatt is an easy stroll(10 -15 minutes) from Whaler's Village shops and restaurants, and about a 20 minute walk to Black Rock. I snorkeled there one day, but the reef in front of the Hyatt was beautiful as well. If you walk to between where the first group of blue Cabana chairs ends and the second group starts, there is a sandy entry. As you swim out, follow the reef to your right. There is some really nice coral and a large variety of fish and even some sea turtles! The Hyatt beach is nothing to speak of, but a one minute walk in either direction will find you on a wider beach. The package we purchased from Travelocity (Hyatt Sunshine on Sale) included buffet breakfast for 2 in the Swan Court . At check in, we were told that we could also use the buffet at Umalu, the poolside restaurant if we desired. This worked out perfectly! We would have continental breakfast in the early morning at the Regency Club, then would head to the pool. A couple of hours later, my 16 year old son would be hungry again(you parents of teenage boys know what I'm talking about), so he and whomever else in the family was hungry would go through the buffet line at Umalu (no lines, all self-service so no tipping required) There was lovely outdoor seating and frankly my kids preferred the more casual atmosphere. The only thing it lacked was the omelette station, but there were always a couple of egg dishes from which to choose. When the kids got hungry again (late afternoon), they would head up to the RC for some delicious cookies and a tropical juice or hot chocolate. It was a quick walk from the pool to the elevator, unlike some of the more sprawling hotels. Pool chairs were available as long as you got down there by 9:30 or so, but the prime spots (with some shade) were usually gone much earlier. The pool staff did a pretty good job of tagging unattended chairs with slips of paper noting the time they were observed unattended and I did see them remove towels from those chairs if they were still unattended an hour later. People, can I just make an observation? If everyone took a chair only when they actually needed it, there would be plenty to go around!! There were days when we went on excursions that we did not use chairs, or just used them after we returned in the late afternoon. I can't imagine putting a towel down on a chair KNOWING that I was not going to be using it until hours later. There were days that we did go to the pool early in the morning to get good chairs and then - WE ACTUALLY SAT IN THEM!! If our kids wandered off and didn't come back for awhile, we removed the towels from their chairs so that they could be used by others. It's just simple consideration for others. . .JMHO We loved the pool area at the Hyatt. We had the opportunity to visit some friends at the Grand Wailea during our trip, and the pool area there is insane!! Lots of fun slides and hot tubs and a really cool rope swing, but LOADED with little kids running around unsupervised and row after row after row of chairs around the pool. I wondered whether the kids would feel disappointed with the Hyatt pool after experiencing all of the attractions at the GW- after all, sometimes kids prefer the chaos!! I was really happy when on the way \"home\" to the Hyatt, one of them said, \"That was really fun, but I just like how our hotel is just much more \"chill\". The other sibling quickly agreed! They had read my mind. One day, while checking in at the pool desk to get towels, I mentioned that I was going to try to get the kids to go down the slide, telling the attendant that they hadn't bothered to do so yet, probably because they were too \"cool\" to do it. His reply: \"Ohhhh no!! Tell them that the slide here was built in the 80s, before all of the safety regulations they have in place now - it's no kiddie slide!\" Well, let's just say that they tried it, they loved it, and they used it every day after that, and so did I!! 7 seconds of hurtling at very high speed through the dark, only to be spit out into the 9ft deep section of the pool!! Definitely not for the meek!! The pool, as others have mentioned, did not seem to be heated, but after the initial plunge, it felt really comfortable to us. I didn't hear anyone complain about the pool temperature. There is a grotto bar/cave area that sort of splits the pool into 2 distinct areas - the kiddie area and waterslide, and the more relaxed side of the pool. I thought that was great. It made it easier for those with small kiddies to keep a close eye on them, and at the same time, made the other side of the pool less chaotic. We did eat lunch poolside on some of the days that we didn't venture out. It was pricey (eg. $16 cheeseburger) but plentiful, tasty and convenient. Around 5pm, the RC served cocktails and really yummy appetizers. We would always start there and then head out for dinner. After dinner, we would return for our nightly ritual of dessert at the RC(delicious rotating choices). A couple of nights the apps were enough, and we never made it to dinner! While I am speaking about the Regency Club, let me just mention how WONDERFUL the staff there is!! Sooooo friendly and helpful. There is even a concierge in the club to help you set up dinner, tell you about good beaches, snorkeling spots, etc. A real plus. Sorry for the long post, but I just want to assure those who have booked a room at the Hyatt Regency Maui - DON'T WORRY!! You will love it and you will have a great time!! We sure did. For those who have not yet booked, consider the Regency Level if you can, especially if you have kids. I know that some said they were offered RC room upgrade for $75. That is(much) less than it would cost to feed a family of 4 breakfast at the hotel, and you will get so much more throughout the day. It was also a nice place to go to read the newspaper or just hang out instead of sitting in the room if one wanted to get out of the sun for awhile. I'll point out that when I was pricing this package online, the cost varied (sometimes by thousands of dollars) from day to day and between websites for the very same package.

It was also a short scenic walk along the ocean to Whalers Village where we had lunch and shopped.

As people who tend to be drawn to \"off the beaten path places,\" we had no idea that we would end up enjoying it as much as we did. Most noteworthy... ROOM - Upgrading to the Ocean View room is worth it. We were blown away by our view of the ocean. Initially, we were apprehensive because we thought the room would be noisy (overlooking the pool, etc.). As it turned out, it was completely peaceful all the way around. SERVICE - The people at the hotel could not be any nicer. They were extremely friendly and attentive. We found ourselves commenting (often!) about how friendly - incredibly friendly - everyone was. GROUNDS - A short walk to visit nearby hotels will immediately clue you in that you've picked the best hotel in the area. The grounds are lush and varied. Speaking of the area... Like we did, you probably hear a lot about how over-crowded this stretch (Kaanapali) is. Again, we're not ones for crowds, but the area is truly beautiful and we didn't find it to be overly crowded. Don't let the location sway your decision. FITNESS - The fitness center is reasonably extensive, newer and large enough to accommodate the size of the hotel. You can run on the treadmill and look out onto the ocean. Very cool. MISC. - Self-park is free, Internet can be purchased in your room via T-Mobile.

We've been to Maui a few times before but this was our first time staying at this property and were pleasantly surprised with how much we liked it. Our check-in was quick and easy. We pulled up to the driveway and valet takes your car and park it for free until you come back later after checking in to your room. Great touch. We had contacted the hotel prior to our arrival for some requests and thankful that was granted (otherwise would probably have started off the vacation on a cranky note :) Noticed we didn't get the shell lei that others were given upon arrival. I guess not a big deal but we like these little touches that seem inconsequential to some:-) ROOM - Our bellhop was friendly and informative. He went over our room, and even called front desk to lock up the mini-bar fridge for us. There are 2 fridges in the room, one that is stocked up and one empty. All we needed was the empty one, and with small children it's a good idea to lock up the mini-bar fridge. Our room was exactly as what we had booked - partial ocean view. It was located in the Lahaina tower and overlooked the luau area. Not the best view but not the worst either. Some have noted that the luau noise bothered them. It didn't bother us at all since it was over by about 8 or 8:30 pm. In fact, we sat out there for a few minutes to catch the show. The balcony of the room though was tight. Not a place where I would like to lounge and relax. The room itself was decent in size. Although, the Hyatt Waikiki room we had was larger which is surprising b/c space is more of an issue in the Waikiki hotels. We did like how we had a full size couch rather than the chair with ottoman as we had in Waikiki. The bathroom was indeed small as most people have mentioned on this site. The vanity area where the sink is located is large and much better lit than Waikiki. Besides the bathroom in need of a renovation and re-configuration - the room was nice and clean. We also liked the walk-in closet with built-in shelves. The beds were comfortable enough although the pillows were on the small side. One thing we hated was the bedding! Ugh...it wasn't due to cleanliness or quality but rather why they couldn't just use a fitted sheet and use a proper duvet cover. Instead our duvet was placed in the middle of white flat sheets which inevitably came undone when you untucked the corners at the bottom. It was gross to find yourself waking up to no bedsheets underneath you. Because they didn't use fitted sheets, the flatsheets would unravel. So we had to settle for not untucking our \"duvet cover \"and lowered ourselves down the bed instead of trying to pull it up. Annoying... POOL/BEACH - this was the reverse of the Hyatt Waikiki (small pool but great beach). The pool here was outstanding. And it went on forever it seemed. There was a kids area - which we thought was by far the best we've seen so far. (We have stayed at the Sheraton, Westins, condos). We liked the kids area because it was shallow enough for even the littlest ones and it had a variety of things like a waterslide, turtles squirting water, a sprinkler-like area, and a sandpit. Right beside it, the pool continues to either the grotto section or the deeper areas - about 9 ft. It's hard to find pools nowadays that have depth like this. It was also where the big waterslide was located. So the main pool does connect thru waterfalls, bridges and the grotto to the other side of the kids pool area. Fantastic! The pool temperature was not as cold as I thought it would be. The pool at the Sheraton is frigid nex to this one! And if you do get cold, there is a great hot tub located by the kids area. Which I found too hot - but definitely a great place to be when the wind is blowing or if you get too cold in the pool. About the chairs, we actually went there at 7 am and got our chairs. But there was no need. You could get a chair anytime of the day but I can only speak for the kids area/ deeper pool section. Now as for the beach, it wasn't that bad BUT after seeing all the other beaches in Maui, and having just arrived from Waikiki where the Hyatt there has the best beach- it was disappointing. We're beach people so that was something to get used to. It's a good thing the pool was that fantastic which made up for it - plus we have always liked to try the different beaches in Maui. (If you are of the same nature, check out Kapalua Bay, Wailea beach, Kamaole beach, Makena, etc..) RESTAURANTS - we only ate at the breakfast buffet. This was included in our package. We really liked the idea of having breakfast included, it makes it that much easier esp. when travelling with small children. Staff were friendly and the food selection were plenty. It served all sorts of pastries, breads, the usual breakfast meats like bacon, sausages, and always had eggs benedict with a different twist each day. Had an omelet station (where you can also request for egg whites or fried eggs). All types of fruits - wish they had mangoes though! Great place for breakfast as it was located by the pond/lake area with waterfalls. Nice way to start your day:-) But fair warning, if you are afraid of birds, there are quite a few as it is an open-air restaurant. They are little ones though and generally don't bother you too much. As for the long line-up, we ate at different times and they all had lines. And if you come at 10 am, there isn't a line at all. However, we never waited for more than 15 minutes and honestly, it was okay as I brought the newspaper to read in line. Our dilemma was the tipping for this buffet. As mentioned this breakfast was included in our package - found out that breakfast was $30 per person. There is no way we would have bought this for ourselves if it wasn't somehow worked in to our package. I side with the camp that believes you really shouldn't tip at buffet restaurants. Esp when you fetch your own drinks! Only coffee was served to you but i don't drink that stuff. Oh and water was brought to you but they should just put that beside the juices, so you don't have to ask and wait for it. Anyway, it did bother me that I felt I was required to tip at 15%. They actually put a laminated note about gratuity - which i found tacky. I hear the voices that say that wait staff don't get paid enough, well, if that's the case then management should pay them accordingly. Dont' let the guests make up for their wages. It's just unfair to have to tack it on to your bill which is priced high enough for a breakfast buffet. And I firmly believe this for buffet service. Having said all this, we still tipped. Too uncomfortable if we didn't.. GYM - beautiful oceanfront location! I can work out everyday and feel inspired by the view alone. The gym was decent in size and a bonus was they had a group class room. The group classes offered were interesting (didn't have a chance to try it) and some priced well at $10. The only drawback for me was the flavored water. They had 2 water stations and each was flavored by lemon slices and orange slices. Ick. I wish they had the option of good old plain water. PARKING - the self-parking was free (or included in the daily resort fee of $15) and I believe located on both ends of the property. Since we were in Lahaina tower, we parked by the area there (right behind the gym or luau). We always found a parking space except for the one time we came home at 9 pm. Waited for 10 minutes for someone to come out and took their space. No issues with parking at all. LOCATION - this property was at the end of the strip of resorts on Kaanapali beach (with Sheraton on the other end). I think the hotels located on this strip have the best location in Maui. There is a nice path that leads you from one end to another. Great for walks or running. And along this path, you'll find an outdoor mall - Whaler's Village where they have restaurants and some great stores. Our walk from the hotel to Whaler's village was 15 minutes. Also if you don't feel like walking back after dinner at Whaler's you can catch the Kaanapali Trolley. It's a free service that shuttles you between the Kaanapali hotels and the mall. OTHER AMENITIES - this property has three towers and depending on what is important to you to be close to, you should consult the property map and/or the hotel. The grounds of the hotel was impeccable. The design of the gardens and all the animals are a sight to be seen. If you like shopping, then you'll love this hotel. They have a small Macy's plus other stores like sunglass hut, sandal tree, etc. They also have a laundry room. It is located in the Lahaina Tower - in the main lobby. Each load is $2 and they take quarters only. There is a machine that changes your money there. They have WiFi service for $10/day serviced by Tmobile. We had so much trouble with it. Very frustrating as it was hit or miss with the connection. Couldn't get it anywhere besides our room and that was only sometimes. At least front desk tried to make up for it by giving us a refund. But I do hope they find a long term solution to this problem. Or perhaps they should take a cue from Westin, where they provided their guests a room - business center - where they have access to use their computers for FREE. Time-limited of course, but at least it's there as a service which is valuable to those of us who rely on it. The bottom line is ..would we return to this property again? I think so! We do hope they fix the bathrooms though:-) We had a fantastic, family vacation and glad that we chose Hyatt this time.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daytona Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "Engel14", "ReviewID": "UR59717976", "Content": "Great hotel , great location, would love to stay there again but is a little bit out of our price range.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel on the Ka'anapali strip - so long as you don't mind skipping breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "D1JBS", "ReviewID": "UR59516185", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for one week on our honeymoon and were very impressed.

The rest of our stay was perfect, the large pool was busy but peaceful with a kids area located the other side of a large rock/water feature. Food in all the restaurants was first class and staff were always very cheerful and ready to help. Whaler's village was a pleasant 20 min stroll along the beach path that was illuminated at night and the Hyatt is the closest Ka'anapali resort to Lahaina - where there are many good value bars and restaurants that offer an alternative to the hotel's (which would be expensive to eat in all week). We took a walk along all the other hotels on the strip and the Hyatt was clearly the peach. The Marriott next door was too big, with guests lined up on sun loungers over the lawns miles from the pool and bars and the beach at that point is very windy. The Sheraton has a great location but is just a bland concrete building with very little to offer around the beach & pool. Here comes the only negative: Hyatt run a series of room packages the include free breakfast and as a result guest had to queue for 20-45 mins every morning. I passed the restaurant at 6.30am on the way to a dive trip and there was already a queue!

The gym is the best you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find in any resort. - Yes the Hyatt can be pricey, but this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise anyone for a name brand resort with these onsite amenities and securities. You are paying for location and conveniences. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to walk up to Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s village and buy amenities, or find casual food less expensive\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 or a top notch 5 star meal in Lahaina! - Yes the rooms are slightly fatigued. We stayed in an ocean front (upgrade from ocean view) and were more than happy. Carpet a bit dated, but everything else was fine. We found out from the front desk staff that the resort will be undergoing renovation starting in August, moving through each of the 3 buildings. - The beach isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best in this location, but very easy to walk up a ways and find more accommodating sand - Yes the breakfast buffet line can get long at prime time. Appearances can be deceiving\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we never waited more than 15 minutes. And they put out coffee for the inconvenience. - Yes the pool chairs can get sparse.

We had no major problems with our room. It was clean, we had a partial ocean view (room 608) which had a beautiful view of the grounds, ocean, and palm trees. Two minor complaints with the room, the bed is very soft so it may not be uncomfortable for those with back problems and housekeeping was generally late in cleaning the rooms. Others have commented on the size of the bathroom as well. The toilet/shower area is combined and a little small, but no big deal (although I would expect more from a 4-star resort). The dressing/vanity area is much larger but don't touch the snack tray Location - Very good location. Walking distance to Whaler's Village and just a short drive to Lahaina. The walk to Whaler's Village is very nice, down a lighted path that passes several major hotels and/timeshares. Food - We had the breakfast buffet (included with our room) daily and it was very nice and the location, Swan Court was just beautiful. A very calm and relaxing setting. We also had appetizers poolside at Umalu', also very nice. One complaint, the drinks were a little weak. Beach - As others have commented, the beach front is narrow/erroding but still beautiful and you're still able to take a nice stroll along the water. Gym - Well equipped and you can't beat the ocean view. Biggest complaint - no WiFi in the rooms (without surcharge). Should be included in the $15.00 daily resort fee. Also, the business center is run by a vendor seperate from the hotel and there is a .65 per minute internet usage charge.

My wife noticed dust on the furniture and the maid had missed a dirty towel hanging on the back of the bathroom door. The breakfast was a problem too. Our included AAA breakfast should have been the breakfast buffet in the Swan Court restaurant, but the line to get in was so long every morning that we passed and went to the smaller breakfast buffet in the pool side cafe. The food there was good, but not what I would have expected in the Swan Court. The staff was friendly, but seemed to be struggling a little with the capacity crowd. Bottom line: We got a good price at the Hyatt, but I wish I had spent the extra money to stay at the Ritz Carlton.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northville, MI", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous!\u201d", "Author": "LMitchell1228", "ReviewID": "UR57899898", "Content": "Wow, this hotel is gorgeous!

Our first stay was at the Wailea Marriott which was nice, and we had a great time. Our next stay brought us to the Kaanapali beach area where we have stayed at the Sheraton resort twice. Its a nice resort but it needs to be updated and the rooms are a little small. This year we gave the Hyatt resort on Kaanapali beach a try. WOW . We reserved a room with a partial ocean view on the club level thur AAA. When we arrived at 10:30 am to check in we expected to hear that no rooms would be ready till regular check in, but what we heard was our room was ready for us. I then thought it must be that room no one wants, so I ask about an up grade to a ocean view an was told with this room you get a veiw from the ocean to the moutains and I would not be unhappy. The young lady at the check in desk as if we would like a short tour of the resort or to head straight to the room, we opted to head to the room and change. By the time we reached the room the bellman had our bags laid out and gave us a map to the resort an another quick run down of everything available to do. Every thing was great so far then I opened the drapes and steped out onto the lani (belcony) WOW what a veiw she was right we would see the sun come up and the sun setting over the ocean. The room was large and up to date. After changing we headed to walk the resort, again WOW from the state of the art gym to the spa. The pool loook like it was of a post card with water falls, caves, hidden hot tubs and a seperate kids pool with sides and bridges. We only ate at the restaurants for breakfast and late night snacks but the food was great . Now the club level at the Hyatt is really nice in the morning you have a lite breakfast available, during the day you have fruit, cookies, sodas and water during the day and in the evening you have drinks and ordurves with a late night dessert all inc. with the price of your room.

The \"deluxe oceanfront\" room in which we stayed had dirty carpeting; scuffed wooden and dirty upholstered furnishings; an outdated bathroom with a white enameled tub, white plastic shower curtain, and single-sink vanity. Basic amenities, such as cotton buds and shower caps, were initially absent, and we had to ask for them as well as for sufficient bath soap for two adults spending 8 nights in the room. Only one single bar of bath soap and one bar of hand soap had been provided. Further, the cleanliness of the bathroom floor was anything but spotless. Meal and beverage prices, and especially the cost of special events sponsored by, or sold through the hotel's tour/concierge desk, such as a luau and a Molokai ferry-rental car package, were nothing short of outrageous. As a result, aside from daily breakfast and the luau, we had all meals outside the hotel, and we explored the island in our rental car. We had no difficulty finding excellent, reasonably-priced restaurants on the island, and needed no overpriced, escorted land or air tours to explore almost everything on Maui that was worth exploring (other than areas that are inaccessible by car). We were especially disappointed by the cavalier, unhelpful attitude of the front desk staff. In spite of the fact that I am a Hyatt Gold Passport holder, the front desk staff refused to arrange for a box breakfast, even a continental one, to replace the included buffet breakfast we had to miss on the day of out trip to Molokai (booked through the hotel)!

We booked a Golf/Mountian view and loved the room, it overlooked the Drums of the Pacific Luau, which we thought was going to be a bit of a pain, but we ended up enjoying. We just sat on out balcony and watched the show from our room while enjoying some champagne and appetizers . The luau ends around 8 p.m. so we would go to dinner right after. For the room, we had a bit of an ocean view and could still hear the waves at night (Room 472). Also there is a separate fridge from the mini bar one, so you can go to the store and stock up on some cold beverages and snacks. The room was very spacious and even had a walk in closet that was perfect for two suitcases. In front of the hotel there is a wonderful boardwalk that extends the entire stretch of Kaanapali beach, perfect if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive somewhere for dinner. We walked down to Longboards which is a great restaurant just about a 5 minute walk down the beach, they have a great happy hour special for drinks and appetizers and live music. Another great restaurant to try is Mixed Plate, which is super cheap and has great true Hawaiian food, great drink specials too. It is located on Front Street in Lahaina, you do have to drive to this one. Originally we planned on staying in Wailea at the Marriott (which we also visited on our stay) but we thought that the Hyatt was much more beautiful, friendly and had more of a Hawaiian feel. The entire staff at the Hyatt was very welcoming and every staff member you passed greeted you with a warm smile and an Aloha. I would recommend this hotel to everyone planning a visit to Hawaii, we already want to go back!! P.S.

Let me start by saying this. The first thing I thought, after enjoying the Hyatt, is that some people complain just to complain. How ridiculous to complain about the size of a bathroom, espcially when you are in Maui. Here's the deal on the Hyatt. It's huge. It's well-maintained. There are bars and restaurants seemingly everywhere. There is a feel and smell that I will miss until I go back. The grounds are beautiful. My lanai was incredible and had views of the beach and the waterfalls at the resort. The food was solid. The drinks were solid. I can't wait to go back! There is some truth to the reviews posted. Maui isn't cheap. If you're broke, don't go to Maui. If you're looking for bargains, don't go to Maui. If you're looking for a $2 drink, don't go to Maui ($18 Grey Goose Dirty Martinis and $10 Bloody Marys). There is a tiny beach adjacent to the hotel. WHO CARES! The beaches on Maui are so beautiful...you really should see as many as you can. In your car... :) The bathroom was small. WHO CARES? I was in the bathroom for a blink of an eye each day. Boards shorts, Reefs, Gascans and a backpack with my camera and videocamera...that how you roll in Maui. Maui is incredible and I vow to go every year of my life. Stroll Ka'anapali Beach.

The gym is the the nicest I have ever seen at a hotel - with new equipment and tasty orange/lemon water. The tennis courts are beautiful and seldom used.

Granted, the Hyatt is much pricier than Outrigger, but it was so much better that we ended up staying an extra 6 nights at they Hyatt. Thought it might be most useful to add my two cents to the comments that have already been made on the Hyatt and add some new info. 1) Yes, the bathrooms are tiny, but the grounds/amenities/location make you not care at all; 2) Did like the kid's pool, but we were surprised it wasn't sand -- it's pea gravel and not as soft on the feet or as fun to play in; 3) In response to #2, if you want sand, just hop down off the grounds onto the beach. There is a lot written about there not being a beach at all. This may be true during some part of the day, but most of the day it's just a really narrow beach and if you just walk down the boardwalk there's all kinds of beach really close. There's the fun wave stuff closer to the Hyatt and 10-15 minutes walk you have the calm waters of the Sheraton. The Hyatt is ideally located in my opinion 4) Our toddler loved all the birds in the lobby/grounds; it was one of the highlights of the trip for her; 5) If you have a kid, the kids menu is cheap, plentiful and great -- the chicken nuggets are actually some of the best I've had and if you don't want room service fees, just order by phone and carry out 6) If you have a kid, pay a few extra bucks to get partial ocean or full ocean on the 1st floor of the Lanai tower. Just step out your patio door and you're right in the kid's pool area; no elevator hassle and it's a major time saver if you're going in and out. 6) The hotel will provide a crib and stroller free of charge.

The location of the resort is at the far sound end of the beach and as others have noted, the beach is much nicer the further north you go. The work out facility at the resort is top notch with good equipment. We had a Ocean Front room in the Atrium Towers with a very good view of the Ocean and resort grounds. If you like Zip Lining, I highly recommend Kapalua Adventures in Kapalua. However, it is not for someone who is afraid of heights. Also went to Warren and Annabelle's magic show in Lahaina. It was very entertaining and would recommend. If you like Sport Fishing, I recommend the boat \"Reel Lucky\" out of Lahaina Harbor. Even though we caught just a couple of fish, it was fun and worth the experience. Only drawbacks. During peak season, be prepared to to grab a lounge chair very early in the morning by the pool (no later than 7:00am) or risk not having one for the day. The rooms, while comfortable, were very out dated. One other recommendation - There is a Safeway supermarket in Lahaina. This is a good place to stock up on snacks, beverages, etc. for your room.

This year I was at the Hyatt Regency Ka'anapali. Last year I was at the Westin Ka'anapali. Thought it might be helpful if I compare the two resorts since they have essentially the same price point and location and clientele. Feel free to send me any questions that you may have about the Ka'anapali area as I kinda' know the area pretty well now. I've also stayed in Wailea and on Lana'i if you have questions. Aloha. Lobby: The Hyatts lobby is superior to the Westins. No doubt about that. They have Penguins, Fish, Birds, Flamingos and it's a grand atrium style with the walkways for some of the rooms looking down into it. The Hyatt also has a mini mall with a Macys, Convenience Store, Sunglass Hut etc. The Westin is more of a traditional lobby with a pond and birds and such. Don't get me wrong, the Westin is fine but the Hyatt is bigger and better. (PICK: HYATT) Pool: The Hyatts pool setup to me wasn't nearly as nice as the Westin. It was really two pool areas. The main adult pool with a swim thru grotto into the kids pool. The Westin is really a series of different smaller pools with two of them being connected. I never had a problem finding a chair at the Westin but the Hyatt definately had people coming down at 7am and getting a towel and putting it on a chair and leaving it. I would come down at 8am and couldn't get a chair. Never had this problem at the Westin (PICK WESTIN) Rooms: Both gave me an upgrade from the minimum that I purchased to what could be called Partial Ocean View. I did like the beds at the Westin better and yes the bathrooms are smaller at the Hyatt but I think its because of the layout. The mirror/sinks are not INSIDE the bathrooms at the Hyatt. They are outside so only the toilet and shower are inside the bathroom so its small. The Westin is nice because everything is inside the bathroom area and the toilet had a seperate door to boot. (PICK: WESTIN) Housekeeping: Both cleaned my room daily and replenished my lotions/soaps and such as needed. No bugs in either room (PICK: EVEN) Location: To me this one is a no-brainer. The Hyatt is located at one end of the Ka'anapali resort. The Sheraton is at the other. The Westin is in the middle \"closer to Sheraton actually\". The entire stretch is a mile in length and has a nice paved beachwalk to jog/walk etc. The area is fronted by the famous Ka'anapali beach. However, the beach area in front of the Hyatt has been washed away but years of errosion and therefore there is no sandy beach by the Hyatt. On the other hand, the beach area that fronts the Westin is absolutely fantastic. Now, you can walk from all the resorts and use any stretch of beach that you want as all beaches are public in hawaii. But for convenience, I prefered the Westin. Also, the Westin is right next to Whalers Village for all your shopping/drinking/dining needs. (PICK: WESTIN) Fees: Both have a MANDATORY daily resort fee which really bothers me. The Hyatt was $15 per day for essentially a copy of the Maui Times newspaper. Supposedly it covers free use of the gym (if I want to use the gym then charge me for it. Don't charge me for not using it which I didn't). Coffee in my room was undrinkable. I went to the lobby to the Starbucks and paid $4 for a medium black each day. My room had basic cable in it. I use an IPhone and it worked great anywhere on Maui so no idea about paying for high speed Inet. Bottom line is, they both charge you $15/day. (PICK: EVEN) Other: The Hyatt has an open lobby/atrium as I mentioned above. Therefore, if it rains or whatever, it comes inside the lobby area where there is foliage etc. Now, it didn't rain while I was there but the entire atrium and lobby smelled like oil/diesel for the entire two weeks that I was there. The moment that I left my room and was walking to the elevators, I would smell oil. I would walk to the lobby to get coffee and come back smelling like diesel. One day, there was dark black smoke billowing from the roof top. I turned to one of the employees in the lobby and pointed up thru the atrium and said, should we be worried? Is there a fire. He said, no its just the air conditioning unit or something. All I know is, the entire lobby smelt horrible during my stay. Like being on an oil platform for two weeks.

There are pengiuns on close to the lobby, very cute. Also have flamingos and swans. We received free breakfast everyday during our stay, it was included in our package. Breakfast buffet was at Swans Court which is amazing, the food was very good and you get fresh food and a huge selection to choose from! It is very expensive though, we would not have ate there if we would have had to pay. The two other restaurants are really good as well, pricey but romantic and convenient. Snorkel gear is cheaper at Boss Frogs at Cannary Mall, it's $2-$8 per day for everything. Otherwise it's $20 at Hyatt. The beach is nice, but rocky. We still swam and boogy boarded though. The luau at the resort is nice but not what we thought it would be, it was still fun though. We had the best time of our lives, glad we stayed at the Hyatt. When we come back, hopefully it will be sometime soon, we will definately stay at the Hyatt again! If anyone is looking at getting married in Maui and needs a suggestion on a company to go through, we went through Precious Maui Weddings and they did an excellent job. Deanne is amazing.

The location is at the very end of the beachwalk so you have a little more privacy of your property than the more central properties. The walk to Whaler's Village was a nice and beautiful walk - and if you were tired at the end of dinner/shopping they have a shuttle service to deliver you back to the resort free of charge. We did not eat at the resort so cannot comment on the food; but they looked very appealing with good atmosphere and views. My husband surprised me one afternoon with a massage at ocean side !!

We have been to the island many times but this was the first time we have stayed at these hotels. The Hyatt was quite nice. We had breakfast included and a partial ocean view room. The room was large with a very comfortable king size bed and a queen size pull out sofa. Flat screen TV, a refridgerator and a mini-bar fridge. The bathroom was clean and basic, with a tub/shower combo. The balcony is quite small and you really had to be standing to see the ocean, but the views of the grounds, etc was really nice. The pool is great for both kids and adults; however, the water was quite cold. We also found it difficult to find lounge chairs by the pool. We were out there by 10am and most of the chairs were taken. I thought this was interesting since the hotel was not even close to being full. The one thing to note about the Hyatt is that they really don't have a beach. There is very limited sand and they don't offer chairs or food/beverage service at the beach. This was ok for us because we bought beach chairs when we arrived, packed our own cooler, and found a small spot of sand to hang out on. Bringing your own food (sandwiches, etc) and alcoholic beverages will save you a lot of money. Here is a breakdown of some of the prices. We did not eat dinner on property. Buffet Breakfast - $30pp including tax and tip Mai Tai - $11 Beer - $6 Nachos - $13 The bartenders at the pool bar are really friendly and definitely enhanced our experience at the hotel. The best thing is that they have a happy hour now from 4pm to 6pm daily. Mai Tais for $5, Beers for $3, Nachos for $8. We took advantage of this each night. This is a new thing they are doing because of the economy. I have never seen a happy hour offered on other stays in Maui. We did not have any issues with the hotel and felt the staff were really friendly and helpful. They offer free self parking and the resort fee of $15/night includes the fitness center and daily newspaper.

We had a king sized bed, a small couch, a flat screen TV and a small lanai with a table and two chairs facing the ocean (deluxe oceanfront room). Breakfast was included, and very tasty. The food was fresh and variety was good. We ordered lunch a couple of times from Umalu which was also very tasty - we were always able to get serviced at the pool rather quickly. The food is a bit pricey, but not much more than you'd expect at any resort. We split quesadillas for $13...plenty to feed two. It's really the drinks by the pool that will rack up - $12 for a pina colada, etc. We went to Safeway (2 miles away), and bought snacks and alcohol and it was the smartest thing we could have done! They also have happy hour specials at Umalu...appetizers for half off, drink specials, etc. It was a really great trip - the locals were very friendly and helpful to us and the walk to Whalers Village was great! Definitely snorkel down by the Sheraton. And if you have to be laying on the beach, this is not the hotel for you. The beach in front of the Hyatt is about 5' deep - down by Whalers Village it is larger and folks have chairs out.

Take a walk to Whaler's Village and have breakfast there. The rooms were OK. The hotel is kept up as well as one could expect given its age and exposure to salty air. The workout room was very nice but it is irritating to have to pay a resort fee then another fee to access the spa...what is that? But the hotel seems in a bit of disprepair generally and I think this goes hand-in-hand with having to discount your rooms on priceline. Same goes for the Hyatt in Irvine, CA.

The staff were there to greet and meet our needs but never bothered us when we were relaxing. The interior is beautiful with it's naturscape design and the grounds are very well kept, including the pools. The only downside is the beach, beautiful but not great for sunbathing. HOWEVER, walk a few steps in either direction and you'll find wide stretches of sandy beach areas. If you enjoy jogging/walking, they have great concrete walkways that run the entire length of the beach area, which also will take you in front of the neighboring resorts. This is great for an early morning stroll. The food at the Hyatt is good. Nice breakfast buffet without the typical buffet crowds. Pricey but good. One tip, if laying poolside, order the firecracker chicken wrap (may want to share this. It's rather large). Anyways, it's very yummy! Regarding the ease of booking excursions: VERY EASY!! Again, loved the service and the friendly, yet non-pushy staff. We did serveral excusions but I highly recommend Captain Steve's snorkeling and the Volcano bike ride. Both were very well ran and offered small groups. I also recommend trying the Spa facilites. If you aren't in the mood for a full treatment, buy a day pass and enjoy the steam room, sauna or hot tub. It's great for the last day when you are waiting around for a late flight. It has a wonderful locker room so you can change right before you leave for the airport and soak up every last minute of relaxation! Overall, Hyatt Maui was exceptional.

The customer service is the best that we have experienced at any hotel in the world, being frequent travelers. Jennifer, the guest reception representative, was extra accomodating when she found out that we were there for our 25th anniversary and had a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered to our room. The rooms are decorated in a traditional Hawaiian theme and the beds are heavenly! The Deluxe Ocean Front room has a stunning view, and my favorite room by far. We have always had a clean room with plenty of towels and ammenities restocked daily and we ALWAYS tip our housekeepers for taking care of our needs. The property is exceptional and kept pristine. It is always fun to watch the groundskeepers climb and trim the palm trees! Since our first visit 10 years ago, we have witnessed the beach erosion but that is no fault of the Hyatt Resort's but nature itself. The Hyatt has plenty of pool area and beach front property to compensate and is a fabulous place to relax and watch the whales during whale season (which we have witnessed on 3 of our Spring Break trips to Maui.) Also the bigger beach area is only a short walk north. The Hyatt Resort has come up with a brilliant Towel Exchange Program which we love! In the past, guests would put their towels down to \"save\" lounge chairs while they swam or got refreshments; however, they never picked them up at the end of their poolside visit so one never knew whether the chairs were still occupied or not. Now each guest upon arrival at the resort receives Towel Exchange Cards in order to pick up beach towels. When your day at the pool or beach concludes, you must turn in your towels to get Towel Exchange Cards for the next day. Now if you see a towel on a chair, you know that a guest is occupying it for that time, because no one leaves without getting their Towel Exchange Cards back. Kudos to whoever solved that problem of inconsiderate people leaving the towels behind and causing confusion for other guests! The new Umalu restaurant and bar is a major improvement for those of us who enjoy the live entertainment in the evenings. (Only wish the entertainers would perform a little later in the evenings though. I think they end at 9:00 maybe.) The bartenders are fun and serve some great drinks! The breakfast buffet in Swan Court is still as exceptional as always, with a vast array of warm and cold buffet items along with an Omelet Chef. Self-parking gets quite crowded in peak season so plan accordingly. The valet desk is always helpful in calling for taxis and will have one arriving for you in a matter of a couple of minutes.

We knew not to expect the same standard of hotel and quality as the Halekulani and so we beared this in mind when we arrived. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a gorgeous lobby with parrots, penguins and tropical fish and were truly stunned. However at check in, they had us booked in for a room with two double beds - not really necessary since we were on our honeymoon. Once this was sorted out, we were offered an upgrade to an ocean view room and given our leis as well as a voucher for our celebratory champagne. The porter who took us to our room was very helpful and told us of things to do around Ka'anaplili as well as in the hotel. The room itself was a little disappointing - mainly due to the bathroom, which is tiny! And the hairs that we found in the bath tub were very disconcerting, but this was the only time this happened during our stay. The dressing area was nice and spacious and the walk in wardrobe and the complimentary safe was a nice touch, as was the fridge for us to store our drinks and light snacks. The bed was very comfortable and we had absolutley no problemsd with insects etc and the lounge area was also comfortable with a large flat screen TV. The view was the best part of this room, despite the disappointingly small lanai with its tiny chairs and table. We were able to look down at the lush greenery and flamingos whilst also watching sunset every evening from there. The hotel itself was nice, and the surroundings lovely, the penguins (especially the baby penguin) were always a joy to watch. At the poolside we were always able to get chairs and it was a bit tiresome having to wear the wristbands everyday, but I usually took mine off if I wasn't going down the slide that day. The poolside itslef is very fun with waterfalls and the slide was scary at first but much fun thereafter! Kids will definitley be entertained. We ate Sonz every morning as breakfast was included in our package and the food was nice, the omelttes were made to order and always very tasty. The selection overall was varied and there was always something for everyone. Yes there are numerous birds but my husband and I used to alternate going to the buffet so that the birds wouldnt land on our table and start eating at the remains. We ate there twice in the evening and it was nice to see a server from the UK whom we talked to for a while and she gave us great tips on what to do and where to go. Umalu was probably our favourite place to eat by far. The quesadillas were delicious and the cocktails were all well prepared and moresome. The bar at Umalu was also our preferred place to have drinks in the evening and the bar staff were always great to talk to. We even got a complimentary drink on our last drink. On our last night we went to see the Cirque Polynesia show and this was a brilliant show. My husband even got himself up on the stage playing the drums. The only issue I have with the hotel is the size of the bathroom, the tub was small and you were always squeezed in there. Yes the decor could do with updating but it wasn't a real problem as the room itself was a nice size. The only reason I would not return to this hotel is beacsue the resort itslef is very quiet. You can get a free shuttle to Whalers Village but it is just as easy to walk (as we always did) and there are frequent buses to Lahaina until 8.45pm, but we didn't go there much as we preferred the restaurants around the resort area.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGood family hotel.

The location was reminiscent of a strip of hotels on Myrtle Beach or Miami. The beach at the hotel is nice but you can't really walk in it bc of sharp rocks. There isn't much sand to sit on either. Pool is neat but there are children everywhere. Even in late September, we were inundated with families and small children. This hotel had only one hot tub and no \"adults only\" section. There were kids in the hot tub along with other honeymooners who looked so annoyed and most got out after a couple minutes of small kids with their clueless parents splashing about. Not very honeymoon-esque. The only place to have adults-only kind of romance and relaxation is the room, so why spend $500 per night?? The hotel reception area and lobby feel like a time warp. It's just a little strange and hard to describe, but I did enjoy the parrots, penguins and flamingos walking about on the grounds. Parking is a pain, too. The lot is close enough to the reception area so we opted to self-park and save ourselves $10/night, but the spaces are so narrow and there are so many cars taking up 2 spots so one night we had no choice but to valet. We had a pretty good room on the 19th floor overlooking the beach. On a nightly and sometimes daily basis, we had hte displeasure of having our room fill up wiht cigar smoke from a nearby room, so we had to close our 2 patio doors. Not cool. When we called the front desk to complain, they said they'd \"look into it\" since it's a non-smoking hotel, but the cigar smoke was there every day and night. Thanks to our rude neighbor for ruining our delightful Hawaiian air! The restaurant, Sonz at Swan Court was REALLY good. Delicious, quiet dinner and good service. They have the breakfast buffet in that same restaurant in the morning, and it's pretty good, but they need to offer more variety day-to-day for the folks who are there for more than a night or two.

The landscaping was beautiful - lush plants, birds, penguins, cranes all on the grounds. Then we tried to check in. Even though we arrived after the 3 PM check in time, our room wasn't ready. So we milled about while the others on our tour went to their rooms. When the room was finally ready, I was disappointed to see such a small room - a couch, desk, platform bead, dresser with TV on top. The bathroom set up was awkwardly small. I didn't get the sense that it was all that clean as well and while we didn't see cockroaches others in our tour group did!!! Our room was suppose to be \"ocean view\" you had to stand on the balcony and stretch your neck to see a glimpse of the ocean through the lush greenery. The pool was huge and we were able to get chairs without a problem and the set up seemed to keep small children away from the couples traveling without kids (nice!). The first night we had a dinner reservation at Cascades (on the premises). We arrived 5 minutes before our time and were told there'd be a 15 minute wait. We sat and watched as people without reservations were told the same thing! Then, they were seated before us. The food was unremarkable and the service was slow. The second night we went to the Luau on the grounds - an ok dinner show but the food was fair. We were packed in so tight at the tables, it was hard to get up & down. (There were approximately 350 - 400 people at this thing). Breakfast every day was at Swans Court. The buffet was large, but there wasn't one day (of 3) where there were waffles/pancakes available. They ran out every day! The other thing was the birds that flew in and out of the restaurant constantly. The staff tried to shoo them away, but they'd land on tables, chairs, plates(!) continuously. If they landed on your plate the staff took the plate away, and back to the buffet you'd go. No wonder they'd run out of food. We were suppose to receive a bottle of champagne for our anniversary on the first night. We got it (only after our tour guide inquired about it) on our last night. There is no beach to speak of - just a small strip of sand just beyond the pool.

The water is NOT calm nor is it a place where you can take a dip- pool only at this hotel. Our room was just okay..... It was our honeymoon so I would have liked something a little better. We also stayed in Kauai at the HYatt which was about 100% better than this hotel. I\"m not really all that picky when it comes to hotel rooms since we really don't spend all that much time in the room but I was very disappointed for the $. It definitely needs a renovation. The bathroom (toilet and shower) were literally on top of each other which was awkward trying to get out of the shower and getting out of the bathroom you had to squeeze to open the door past the toilet. There were ants in our room- a lot of them. We didn't complain so I'm not sure what they would have done about it. I jsut didn't really care all that much but if I saw them near the bed I woudl have. Not sure how you get aunts on the 11th floor? The bar next to the pool is really cool and they have live music playing during the week. We sat at the bar a lot. they make the best Lava Flows ever. Also, the location of this hotel was good. We rented a car which is greatly recommend to everyone and the town of Laheina (sp?) is only about a 3 min drive. It's adorable and so much to do including food, drinks, clothes, etc. For the money, the Sheraton which we walked past looked much nicer but I didn't see the rooms. They have a much nicer beach where they sell snorkeling gear at black rock. If we ever make it back we will go to the sheraton or stay in the town on Laheina. THe spa is VERY ncie here but it's on the other side of the resort.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely resort hotel\u201d", "Author": "jc11235", "ReviewID": "UR44685938", "Content": "We got a tremendous deal at the Hyatt.

The lobby was stunning with all the wildlife \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were always people stopped by the penguins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kids loved them! There were also some nice shops in the lobby. The grounds were spectacular with flamingos etc. Checkin was fine, and as a Gold Passport member our 2 rooms were upgraded to a 2 bedroom Ocean front suite. We had a tremendous view of Kaanapali beach, and at night were lulled to sleep by the sound of the waves on the beach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..awesome!! The suite was very comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had been a little nervous after reading some of the reviews. It was a decent size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our 2 bed suite was essentially a one bedroom suite and a communicating room, where you had a single \u00e2\u20ac\u0153front door\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Furnishings were nice and fresh. There was an empty refridgerator for our drinks. Large flat screen TVs. As others have said there is a tray of chocolates left out with a motion sensor. We moved something by mistake, and got charged for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they promptly refunded the charge. (I suggest you ask the staff to remove it if you are not intending using it). Bathrooms were fine but the plastic shower curtain somehow cheapened them! Large walk in closet. Lovely coco mango toiletries. The pool area was very crowded. Not the pool itself, but the chairs. They were packed VERY close together, and had towels draped on them by 8-9am. Many of those chairs were then not used all morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pool staff were to busy! When we arrived at the pool early afternoon, we were able to get a cabana for $25, as all the chairs were all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though quite often all the cabanas got booked. They are right at the water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge and have a glorious view. There are also 2 Ocean Hales which you can rent for $250 for the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c away from the crowds, and they provide a coolbox with fruit and water and loads of extra towels. We liked the restaurants there. Breakfast at Swan Court was tremendous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fantastic choice at the buffet. We ate at both Cascades and Sonz \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were really excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both food and service! We tried room service one evening which was very prompt and nicely presented, reasonable selection of food was served hot! We were less impressed with the casual dining options \u00e2\u20ac\u201c left waiting over 20 minutes at Cascades Grill and then served some inedible food by staff who were totally indifferent to what they were doing. We also used the Regency Club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice breakfast there, not as varied as at Swan Court but good nonetheless. Also snacks at other times, not really enough to replace a meal, but enough to keep you going. Front desk staff/concierges all very helpful and professional. We went for valet parking, and it was well worth it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was very efficient and we never had to wait more than 2-3 minutes for our car. We also did the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tour of the Skies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where you are taken to the roof of the hotel to look through three telescopes. I was disappointed with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153astronomer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who was not especially knowledgeable. He was also cranky, and impatient with the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s questions. The telescopes themselves were impressive, and the tour was still well worth doing given how clear the skies are in Hawaii. The hotel was crowded as it was peak season, but we still really enjoyed our time there. My only criticism is that a number of staff don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to realise they were working in a top hotel. DH and I were walking through the lobby one evening and a porter with an empty luggage cart was walking towards us - rather than go to one side he carried on straight at us and we both had to step out of his way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c minor details like this reminded us it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a 5 star hotel. A nice family hotel, the lack of beach isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem as it is not far to walk to one. Regency Club was nice, but not sure I would pay extra for it.

Lunch at the Hyatt was good too, try the Umalas grill, again cant fault it. Overall we loved the traditional style of the Hyatt, lots of solid wood, perfect lawns, plant life and an amazing art collection. By the way if you are like me and you have young children and the thought of high rise is too scary then request a ground floor room in the Terrace wing.

When we checked in (after a really long flight full of honeymooners) the hotel didn't have our room right as our travel agent had made a mistake in booking. The staff was not helpful with this one bit and couldn't care less that this was wrong. They treated us like we were trying to trick them out of a room. The lady finally said they would put us in the same view room but with 2 beds, not the king we booked, as they had to save those for the people who had actually booked them (oh, you mean like us????) When we checked into the room we were really disappointed in the accomodations. It was just you're generic hotel room with 2 crummy beds and an Ok view of the far away beach but mostly the gardens below. Our hearts sank as we wondered if the trip we'd been planning for over a year was being ruined from the start. We spent the first day calling the travel agent, and talking with the manager of the hotel who finally agreed to hold a room with a king sized bed for us the next day (as they had already checked in all those rooms). So we stayed packed and upset that first day and had to stay out the next morning until 3pm when they had our real room ready and WOW, what a difference that made. The room with the king sized bed had a much better feel, even though the room size was the same you just had way more room and a little sofa and table in there. The view was amazing from the opposite tower. You could see the entire ocean, hotel grounds and the mountains. We spent lots of time on the balacony enjoying it all. We had breakfast buffet included in our package and that's the only was I would actually use the buffet. It was really good, lots of variety and well stocked and maintained but really overpriced for $30 each. Maybe splurge one day but find somewhere else the rest. It did seem like most people had it included though as it was pretty busy. They did get you seated fairly quickly and the location was beautiful, right on the pond with swans swimming around and birds flying all over the place. The staff wasn't overly friendly here and service was lacking and we were always left wondering do you tip during a buffet? The beach was our next stop but the beach infront of the hotel we were told in \"non-swimmable\" though we did see some people in there. There is a reef that runs right along the front with keeps you out of it for the most part and at times there is not sandy beach area there and the waves were kind of rough in that area. We went knowing this so it wasn't a big surprise for us. So we walked down awhile until we found nice sandy area. The only problem is that you have no chairs to use then. I don't know if the other hotels would rent to you or not, we didn't try to find out. Sitting on the sand with just the towel was hard in some spots because the wind blows the sand right onto you, like being sandblasted. We walked down to black rock usually (near the sheraton) and the wind wasn't a problem there and the snorkeling was the best there. After that we tried the pool, but good luck finding a chair. Very little shade available and even fewer chairs. I think my Ymca has more chairs around their pool. When someone finally would get up we'd hover over them until they left. Pool service was lousy if you can even get the ONE server to come over to you. We waited one hour one day and she never came over to us. Once we did get her attention the food and drinks were good but overpriced but who cares when your sitting in the sun. They do have someone coming around with free ice pops and cold towels so that was really nice. The pool itself is realy nice and not very crowded (makes you wonder where all those people who have their towels on the chairs are) Deep in some places and shallow in others. The do have a bar in the pool but it's not a swim up bar, you have to walk around to it in the pool. The slide is super fast and a little scary because it's in the dark. The pool itself is open until 11pm but we never saw anyone in it after 7pm, always meant to go but just ran out of time. We did eat dinner one night at the hotel and it was pretty good though expensive. The staff was very friendly there. I found the men on staff at the hotel all to be very helpful and attentive but the women all seemed to have a chip on their shoulder for some reason. There were alot of honeymooners there and I felt like that's who they really cater too. At times I felt like just another number the staff had to deal with. The truth is anyone going to Hawaii is going for some special reason or another and should be treated that way. All in all, this was a pretty nice hotel, the room was nice and quiet and had a great view, the cleaning staff always seemed friendly and left us fresh towels, extra shampoo, body wash and lotion. There are also lots of shops on the main level with everything from childrens items to bathing suits, gifts, postcards anything you might need, though bring lot so suntan lotion as they charge twice what it cost everywhere else!

I wanted to check out upon arrival due to my disatisfaction and was told my money was non-refundable due to the fact that I booked with Orbitz - I would have to contact them - well - folks - if you have ever dealth with Orbitz - you know how that went!

We chose the Hyatt for the location and had gotten and excellent promotion through the Hyatt Gold Passport program. On our previous trip to Maui we stayed at the Rennaissance Wailea Beach, which has since been torn down. We couldn't have asked for a better stay at the Renaissance, but it was quite a drive to everywhere. This is what brought us to Kaanapali. The Hyatt sits at the southern most end of Kaanapali beach, which is nice as it is away from much of the hussle and bussle of the busy resort and shopping areas to the north. The resort is vast with gorgeous pools, gardens and facilities. Room: We had a partial oceanview room on one of the upper floors of the Atrium (center) town. The room was nicely furnished with a king bed, LCD TV, desk, ipod alarm clock, refrigerator, safe, sitting area and lanai. The outside lanai has a view of the Kaanapali South golf course to the left and the ocean/Lahaina harbor to the right. Straight ahead was the West Maui mountains and the Lahaina tower. You could tell that the hotel is older as I noticed some scuff marks and scratches on the wood on the furniture. However, the room was kept nice and clean. The bathrooms are on the small side and the tub/shower are very basic for a hotel. The sink had just a single basin, not two like many hotels. The walk in closet was nice with ample storage. The \"Hyatt Grand Bed\" is a platform style bed with no box spring. Allthough it was very comfortable, it was difficult to get used to as bed the only came up to my knees when standing next to it (I am 6' 3\"). Overall the room was nice and comfortable, but it definitely a \"hotel room\", and I expected something a little larger and more upscale for a resort of this caliber. Ammeneties/Facilities: This is what really makes this hotel shine. The large open air lobby is gorgeous, with parrots, tropical birds and other wildlife exhibits. The penguins were by far the most fun to watch. The pool facilities were awesome. The main pool is large with depths from 3'-9' and connects to the smaller pool and kids lagoon via swim through cave, complete with a pool bar and waterfalls on each end. The 150' lava tube waterslide was extrememly fun and very, very fast. We enjoyed sitting by the pool many days, however there is not much shade. We did browse through the onsite shops which includes a Macy's, and various other shops. There is a convenience type store on site which was nice as we needed to buy additional sunscreen. They also sell souveniers, beer, wine & liquour but is a bit pricey. We used the self-parking which is completentary (valet is $12 per day). Other reviews I read are critical of the parking. We did not have any issues. The spots are small, and many people did not park between the lines which made tjhe spots tighter. However, if you are a decent driver and know how to use your side mirrors, you shouldn't have a problem. We did not use the spa or fitness facilites. I did jog in the morning along the beach path which was very nice. Beach: The beach directy in front of the hotel is narrow and can be a little rocky. However, it is still very nice. A few steps to the south is a beach activities desk with onsite Parasailing and Jetski companies in addition to snorkel and boogie board rentals. A short 5-10 minute walk to the north and the beach opens up to a nice wide white sand beach. If you keep walking just past the Sheraton is Black Rock with has some real nice snorkeling. Restaurants/Food: Our package included a complementary breakfast buffet at Swan Court. The buffet was quite good with various sections including cold and hot items. At times there was quite long line to be seated. Also, they do change a few of the hot selections daily, but I would have prefered more variety. For example, many of the items stayed the same which I got sick of quite fast. Some corned beef hash or grits would have been a nice addition instead of the same roasted potatos every day. We ate most of our other meals off-site as the restaurants onsite are expensive. We did however eat lunch one day at Umalu which was quite good. Staff: For the most part the hotel staff was very friendly and attentive. We had an issue with one of our room keys one day after returning from the pool and became locked out of our room. The staff person was very attentive and quickly came up to let us in and provided us a new key. However, at times some of the staff's friendlyness seemed \"fake\". Also, they like if you spend money at the hotel. A couple of times, I sensed attitude from one of the pool waitresses when I didn't order anything or if I brought my own drink to the pool. Also, the (Japaneese) hostess staff at the Swan Court breakfast seemed to give seating preference to their fellow Japaneese. Many times the Japaneese couples and families would be seating up front next to the water, where the Americans would be seated in a corner or the back, regarless of when they arrived. The front desk staff was friendly, however it would have been nice if they informed me of the guest facilites which could be used after check-out (i.e. to freshen up after using the pool before an evening flight) prior to checking out as we had a 9pm flight. The staff at the pool and beach activities desk were great. Overall, it was a great stay. The few critizisms above are minor compared to how much we enjoyed our stay. I would definitely stay here again. I have listed some tips below for future Maui vacationers: 1. Stock up on snacks and beverages at the Safeway in the Lahaina Canery Mall to save money. It is about 2 miles down the road from the Hyatt. We purchased bottled water, Gatorage and beer. It was much cheaper ($17 for 12-pack of local lager vs. $7 for 1 draft at the pool bar, or $2 for a pepsi from the machine) and convienent to have it in your in room fridge. 2. Check out the area restaurants. The hotel restaurants are quite pricey, but there are many alternatives just a short drive to Lahaina, or walk up the beach path to Whaler's Village which are just as good if not better. 3. Back in to the Hyatt parking spots. It is much easier to fit (straight) into the small spots. 4. Golf: As an avid golfer, I considered playing a round at the Royal Kaanapali course, but decided against it because of the cost ($190 greens fee + $85 club rental). I am now glad that I choose not play. Allthough well maintained, the course is very flat, has little vegetation, and runs alongside 2 main roads and the Sugarcane Train tracks. Throughout my stay, I only saw a handfull of golfers on the course, so others must have felt the same as me. If you want to golf, the courses at Wailea are much much nicer (and less expensive), but it is a long drive to south Maui from Kaanapali. 5. Take a drive up the northern Maui coastline. It is quite beautiful and much less traveled than the Hana Highway. Check out snorkeling at Honolua Bay, the Nakaele Blowhole and the various senic lookouts and pull offs along this curvey road which is just a short drive from Kaanapali. 6. A nice place to visit on your last day if you have an evening flight is the Maui Ocean Center. It is in Maalea, which is on your way back to the airport. 7. If you plan to use the wireless internet access at the Hyatt, sign up for T-Mobile hotspot ahead of time. This is who the Hyatt's service is though. You can get plans or pre-paid cards which will save you money (Hyatt charges $24 per day). I got lucky and found a promo code online for a 30 day free trial.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, nice acommodations and facilities\u201d", "Author": "kimwipes", "ReviewID": "UR38823166", "Content": "We booked the Maui Hyatt Regency mountain view room throught priceline for what I considered a good deal at $140 a night. Upon check in we were offered a Regency Club Partial Ocean View for an extra $75 a night and took it. So we ended up on a 21st floor room with a great view [partial] of the ocean and Lahaina. The grounds were very well kept, the pool/slide area was fun for all the family and compares well to that of the other resorts in the Kaanapali area. Staff was very helpful accommodating our requests always. They extended our check out a bit but since our flight wasn't until 10pm we had to vacate the room. No problem then, you can hang out and relax by the pool, and use their very private locker rooms to securely stow your valuables and take a shower before hitting the road. The conduct various activities during the day, so if you happen to hang by the hotel you can sign up for things like a free lei-making class, which you get to keep. My daughters enjoyed this very much, and saved us this expense. Our room was nice, big and roomy. Showed some signs of age in little details. Hated the sliding doors without locks in the bathroom, kids kept opening them while you're doing your business. Room came equipped with safe and refrigerator, which was nice. We did not experience any noise level, our room in the 21st floor on the main tower was very quiet. Maybe the open-center design helps here. The only thing we could hear was lots of birds in the morning - I think it was the big parrots on the ground, but it wasn't a big deal. Regency Club: for a family of 4 (2 kids, 8 &9) I thought that the $75 regency club upgrade was an excellent value. Besides the partial ocean view upgrade on the two top floors (which might be worth the $75 to some, not me), it included continental breakfast, cocktails and appetizers 5pm-7pm and dessert/cordials at 7:30-9pm. Breakfast consisted of a variety of pastries, boiled eggs, smoked salmon, cereal, tropicana-like juices and fresh fruit and did not change at all. Appetizers were always the same (antipasto, cheese, bread) except for an additional item that changed daily (we had prosciutto, chicken lettuce wraps, etc). Desserts changed daily, an assortment of chocolate cakes, chocolate-covered strawberries, tiramisu, cheesecake. Additionally you can stop by anytime of the day (6:30am-9pm) for drinks (expresso, soda, water) and snacks (nuts, cookies) For the 4 of us, I think we got an excellent value. We stopped every day for breakfast before leaving the hotel and usually made back to the hotel by 6pm, so we got 4-6 alcoholic drinks every night, and we almost always skipped dinner thanks to the great appetizers and desserts (we are not big on dinner). In addition, they encouraged us to stock up on drinks for all of our day trips and received boxed snacks from them (literally boxes of macademia chocolates, caramel popcorn and even potato chips) - this just saved us trips to the shopping center and money! The regency club staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful (ie, the gave us one of those CD describing sights along the road to Hana when we mentioned we were going there). The only thing I really hate about this hotel (and others like it) is this trend to charge a $15 resort fee. While I did use their fitness center twice (and BTW, running along the beach here is a must-do if you like running), I felt they shouldn't have this sort of hidden fee, just roll it into the room rate.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, romantic getaway!\u201d", "Author": "travelgal325", "ReviewID": "UR38800240", "Content": "Upon arriving the hotel, we were greeted with leis and super friendly staff upon checkin.

We had a room on the bottom level close to the pool and really enjoyed the waterfalls and two slides. They have a cute little kiddie lagoon that is very shallow and coated with sand/small pebbles.

Inside the cave is the grotto bar for adults, but it is over to the side, and there is a pretty big area for swimming inside the cave. On the other side of the cave is a large additional pool, which is suited more for adults and older children. There is a small game room by the pool and they show a movie pool-side on Saturday nights, complete with popcorn. The hotel is beautiful and has some shopping, but there is a 15 minute beach walk behind the hotel that ends up at the Whalers Beach Front Mall. Whalers has quite a bit to choose from, including some great restaurants. If you don't want to walk there is a free trolley that will take you from the front of the hotel to Whalers. My daughter's favorite thing in the hotel were the animals-cranes, African penguins, and parrots. The food was resort-expensive, but the kid's menu was around $7.00 and filling for a 12 year old. Room service offered a substantial and yummy $19.00 pizza for adults. There is also a small convenience store in the hotel with chips, beer, and sodas.

The folks at the front were extremely helpful with travel plans, restaurant reservations, etc. There are also some wonderful activities you can book for your kids, every day. You must take in the Luau at the hotel. It was even better than the Old Luhaina one that is so highly rated. The food at the hotel's luau is better and so is the show. Breakfast can be had right at the hotel too. The Umalu Market has a continental breakfast for $10.00 for adult and $5.00 for children (cold breakfast and you can only go through once). For the hot breakfast it's $18.95 and I think $10.00 for kids (can go back as much as you want). Kimo's was amazing and even better than Mama's Fish House we thought. You must try the prime rib! Had we known just how good the food was there we would've eaten there every night! But parking is horrendous! But we got a hint that if you tip the valet parking guy at Longi's $5.00 he will park your car in their lot. There is also free parking in that lot from 3:00 pm - 5:00 pm. You must also go to the Luluani's Shaved Ice Shop just down the street. Best shaved ice ever! Hula Grill at Whaler's Village was great for lunch or dinner. Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina was great too and happy hour drinks good and cheap (Happy hour started at 2 pm). We never had a problem parking there. At the start of your stay book the shuttle from the hotel for your trip to the airport to go back home as it will cost you almost $90.00 for a cab. Great jewellery at Maui Gifts on Front Street.

Great shopping at Macy's too right in the hotel. For a unique gifts check out Maui Hands. Also the Cannery Mall in Lahaina has a little shop that has unique Maui made gifts at cheap prices.

Since it was our first time in Maui, it was good to be close to all the action, but next time around we'll definitely look for some place more low key in the Wailea area. We opted to self park for free which was sometimes a struggle. The smaller of the two lots (which was closest to our room) was often full, which meant we had to park in a far away lot and walk. Normally that wouldn't be a big deal, but after being out and about all day and coming back tired, it was kind of annoying. The Hyatt was close to Lahina Harbor were a lot of activities and restaurants are based, so that was nice. Also our package included the daily breakfast buffet. It really wasn't that good.

The place truly has not changed one bit, and it's just as romantic and magical as it ever was. It is Old Hawaii - and we love this place! We reserved an Ocean Suite (ironically we were on the same floor just a few doors down from our honeymoon room!) which was two bedrooms and a small living room area with 3 balconies. Spectacular views and very quiet at the end of the hallway! My A+ notes: 1-The staff is amazing! We had the pleasure of working with the 2 very BEST concierges EVER - Jeffre Naniola and Paul. After a colosal Hertz bait and switch nightmare, Jeffre went to work and took care of our rental car problem. He was poetry in motion!!! (Go with Alamo on Maui - they were wonderful!) 2-The restaurants are outstanding, and the food/drinks are superb. Breakfast buffet was included with our suite, and it is awesome! 3-The wildlife at the hotel - there are penguins, tropical birds, koi fish, swans, flamingos - you name it! 4-The pool is beautiful! The waterfalls and the swim up bar inside the cave are very cool. 5 - Location - perfect location - close enough to Lahaina, and far enough from anything else. 6 - Gardens and artwork are wonderful! Lush flowers and greenery everywhere. 7 - The luau and the tour of the stars on the hotel rooftop were very fun. Food was excellent at the luau (probably the best luau food I've had.) Downside - they line up people on the sidewalk in the sun for like 30 minutes before it opens and it appears most people are sweaty and not happy. (We had teenagers for that!) 8 - The workout facility is awesome! My daughter enjoyed the spa and thought it was great. The views onto the ocean are second to none in the fitness room! 9 - Comfy beds and a variety of pillows. 10 - Never waited for an elevator for more than 30 seconds. 11- Serene, open air lobby full of gorgeous statues. 12 - Nice flat screen TVs in the rooms, with small fridges in the rooms also. 13- Superb housekeeping - completed by noon everyday. Replenished towels frequently. Nightly turndown was great - they always left several extra chocolates for the kids. 14 - Nice sized balconies with furniture on them. 15 - Can't forget to mention bartenders Kiki, Andy and Richard at the Umalu. Not only did they fix awesome drinks, they are just cool guys who love to talk and visit over lunch. My D- Notes: 1-Bathrooms are small 2-The beach that was there 23 years ago on our honeymoon is no longer there. You can get out and walk on it, but there is not room for chairs behind the hotel on the beach. The pool area is where all the chairs are, and if you want shade, you must get your towels at 7:30am when the towel bar opens and lay out your towels. Otherwise by 8am the shade is taken, and it's slim pickings for empty chairs. 3 - My husband said the towels were rough, but that did not bother me. I don't like big fluffy towels so I was happy with the towels. 4 - This Hyatt is very beautiful and very romantic. However, it is also an older hotel. The furniture- in some places, not all - is probably due for a re-do. 5 - No lei greeting on arrival. 6 - I had booked several things before the trip via the online concierge - all were received and confirmed repeatedly. Not one single reservation was correct - every thing I took the time to plan was either in their system as the wrong date or time or something - despite my printed out emails in hand from Hyatt. Same with the breakfast included - everyday they had us down for 4, and we were 5. Everyday they said they would correct it, and everyday it was the same thing over and over. Those little details did bug me, but they weren't a big deal once corrected. Tip - if you plan to stay here, and I highly recommend you do, just call either Jeffre or Paul and book everything with them (including your rent car if you decide to do that - those guys are INCREDIBLE!)

Once again, wonderful service, great room, great everything! I can't understand why some nitpick this hotel. As for those who are dissatisfied with the partial ocean view rooms, you need to request the Napili tower if you want a good partial o/v. I too wouldn't want to overlook the cemetery, so stay away from the Lahaina tower. We always request either the atrium tower or the Napili. On our last stay we were on a Priceline deal, so we already had a pretty good deal going of $185 per night. While checking in, the front desk informed us that we were in a golf/mountain room [they upgraded us automatically again, for the 5th time] so we inquired about upgrading to a deluxe ocean room in the atrium tower, so we paid an additional $80 per night to upgrade to this fantastic room. Ordinarily we don't pay for upgrades, but because we got such a great deal to begin with, the overall price of $265 per night for a deluxe ocean room was an excellent deal, especially since that room would have cost us $450 had we booked directly with Hyatt or $400 per night via any other package deal. For us, that made the trip special. We were on the 19th floor and the bathroom was even a little nicer, with extra storage and drawers. Housekeeping was prompt every day. The new pool bar/restaurant Umalu was a disappointment, but only because they increased their prices exhorbitantly. We loved the old pool snack bar/restaurant much more. Due to the price gouging, we went off-campus every day to CJ's Comfort Zone and brought our food back to the hotel, or we went next door to the Marriott and brought back food from their snack bar.

This time I decided to try another part of the island, and decided on the Hyatt...and it is now my new #1 favorite place to stay. The pool is large (but not huge) and there is a separate pool for kids as well. There were still kids in the non-kiddie pool, but I found them to be amazingly well behaved with not a lot of screaming, thrashing about, etc. Mostly the pool was full of people relaxing under the waterfalls, reading a book along the edge, or floating on a mat. I also thought the pool service was fantastic. They offer free water, otter pops, and frozen towels, and you never have to wait too long to be asked if you want a refill on your cocktail. If you do go to the Hyatt, note that there is a different drink on special every day, and it pays to ask what it is. Drinks are normally $11-$12, but the \"specials\" were only $8 a piece. I used the gym on a daily basis and was very pleased. There was a good number of treadmills, bikes, and elliptical machines, in addition to a fitness studio and lots of weight machines. I also took a few of the fitness courses at a cost of $10/each and really enjoyed them. I also indulged in a 90 minute hot stone massage with Helena my first morning there...fantastic spa experience. The ladies locker room is on the small side, but extremely nice with wet and dry saunas, a jacuzzi, and showers. The relaxation room post-massage was located oceanfront and I could have easily stayed in there for half the day. Parking (self parking) was free but the parking spots were ridiculously small. I loved that I could walk to Whalers Village in about 13 minutes. There is also a free trolley that runs between Whalers Village and the Hyatt - you can pick up a schedule at the concierge desk. The grounds of the Hyatt were really lovely - just a gorgeous property. The rooms themselves did not have the same \"wow factor\" that the grounds had. I had an ocean view with a great view (in the atrium tower), and I was impressed by all of the storage space (drawers, small walk in closet, etc) as well as the extra empty minifridge so I could stock with my own stuff. The carpet did probably need replacing and the quality of the furnishings was just slightly above average, but it was extremely clean and well equipped/laid out..

Pros: - beautiful grounds and pool - most employees we encountered were great (front desk just fair) - Kids Club has great service and really friendly employees -great breakfast buffet (but get it as part of a package) Cons weren't huge, but numerous enough to leave me feeling nickeled and dimed enough to have an overall negative impact. - the response to our disappointment about the pool slide closure was indifference. - the policy on the snack tray was ridiculous that if you even MOVE an item on the tray then you are automatically charged. They did come and remove the snacks after I called, but this is just a ridiculous practice. - 'partial' ocean views are just that, and you see a cemetery, the busy road and the parking lot as well as the ocean view once you're on your balcony and leaning out. In other hotels, I was upgraded automatically, but the front desk clerk didn't seem particularly interested in going out of her way to make sure we had a good time. -Partial ocean views will hear the nightly luau - rooms and bathrooms need updating -I never figured out what I was getting for a daily $15 resort fee on top of my bill - dial up?? Are they kidding me? All in all, most of our issues could have been resolved with better customer service from the front desk in particular.

They will eat from your plate and hop around your feet. They land on the clean dishes and silverware and then the staff will serve you that same dish! I've seen it done! The water they served smelled like a bird took a crap in the glass. I'm telling you, don't eat at their restaurants. The Rooms need updating. For what they are charging you, you could get TONS more for your money at a TRUMP location. Their TV's are crappy, their sheets and bedding aren't what you are paying for. The place is very loud when you try to sleep! The room doors are very heavy and there is nothing that slows the closing of them. When they are shutting, they SLAM!

The prices are way too expensive. That is a lesson I learned about staying at places such as the Hyatt. I will not do it again. $60 for a breakfast for 2. $40 for a Tuna sandwich.

The receptionist checking us in barely looked at me, and even had a flirtatious conversation with another staffer while I was waiting there. The first room we had was in what they called the garden, but it was almost a sub-level. The room reaked of mold, and it turned out to be the couch. We requested a change and they did move us to a higher level with no moldy couch. We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. One of the days were were gone, we returned to find the door to our room ajar. Thankfully nothing was missing, but we called security. They found out that the guy who checks the mini bar had left it open. There was not much of an apology. We did receive a small basket of food as an apology, some of which was expired. The pool was insanely busy and getting poolside food or drink service demanded a significant wait. The food here was outrageous, even by Hawaii's standards. One night we had dinner at the restaurant next to the pool. It took 45 min. to be seated (and there were open tables ) and then took 75 min. to get the food. Again, there was a half-hearted apology, no discount on the food and the food was not worth what we paid for it. The positives of this hotel were that it was pretty in the common areas, and the private beach. You could easily access the beach from the resort and it was very well kept. Also, I hear that during the whale migration you can see the whales (and some dolphins) go through the area right from the beach. We did like Ka'anapali.

The Hyatt made our stay great, they were so professional. The only downside to the Hyatt is their section of the beach. Kaanapali beach is the 2-mile long beach in front of the Hyatt. The Hyatt has a not-so-great section of the beach; there are rocks, and the sand starts to get incorporated into the water and makes it nasty. There are a few moments of where the water is calm and it is good fro snorkeling, but overall there is a better location for you to go for a beach. It is not that far away, about a 5-10 minute walk to the north of the Hyatt to Black Rock. Black Rock is the north end of Kaanapali beach. It has crystal-clear water, and AMAZING, and I mean AMAZING snorkeling. It just seems that you visited a whole different beach, but you are still on the same beach. You can try the Hyatt's beach, but it is skinny and not that great; however, Black Rock is wide beach with amazing snorkeling and you can see many types of colorful fish. AND THAT'S JUST THE BEACH!

Beautiful, lush, tropical. We were greeted and treated like old friends from the moment we stepped on the property. Check in was a breeze and we were soon off to our room where our luggage was delivered just after we arrived there. The next morning was such a treat. Still not used to the time change, I was awake by 5 and greeted by the sounds of tropical birds chirping and waves gently pounding. Ah, that's the way to wake up in the morning. Had coffee out on the lanai and enjoyed sunrise while looking at the gorgeous ocean and palm trees. Breakfast was always great at Swan Court...especially liked the eggs benedict. Lunch was usually at Umalu...huge portions there! A small fries is enough for 2 to share. Enourmous salads, yummy burgers, sandwiches, wraps, fish tacos. We had dinner at both Cascades Sushi Bar and Grill and Son'z at Swan Court. The sushi is very good at Cascades. Son'z had impeccable service. They made me a special drink...the best drink I had on my whole trip...some yummy strawberry, fresh coconut, mango concoction. The food was amazing. The banana french toast dessert was so delicious. By far one of our favourite dinners...liked it better than the Lahaina Grill which everyone raves about. For my husband's birthday I surprised him with the oceanfront dinner...it was set up in a private tent by the beach with romantic music, candlelight, leis; unbelievable. The food was simply amazing; by far the best dinner of the trip...worth every penny! So many courses...my eggplant appetizer was dinner portion and to die for. It was in the most delicate pastry. Unbelievably good. Every course was outstanding. Loved the coconut creme brulee served in a coconut shell as well. YUM! We booked a whalewatching cruise with the concierge on the Hula Girl. Fabulous brand new catamaran. Great food, friendly crew, saw lots of humpback whales and had a great time. The catamaran leaves from Kaanapali beach so that made it convenient as well. Highly recommended! The concierge also arranged a private helicopter to come pick us up for a 1 hr tour from the roof of the Hyatt. WOW! That was an experience of a lifetime. So worth it. Thumbs up to the concierge at the Hyatt! Loved lounging at the pool...yes the pool is cold when you first get in but SO refreshing on a hot day. There were always plenty of loungers for everyone so none of the madness in reserving chairs at dawn. We did rent a beach hale on our last day and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a cooler full of bottled water and a fruit plate when we arrived. It is a very peaceful spot and a great place to really unwind and relax as you watch the waves crash on the beach. The kids area looked like a lot of fun too. I know my kids would love it! The grounds of the Hyatt are amazing. Waterfalls, streams, a pond; there are parrots, penguins, flamingos, swans, etc...it's a tropical paradise. The shops were great too...went elsewhere to get souvenirs but ended up returning to buy them at the Hyatt. We stayed in a deluxe oceanfront room and were happy with the accomodations. Can't beat that view! Room service did an amazing job cleaning rooms. The dressing area was particularily nice. Also, I am horribly allergic to mosquitos and get bitten everywhere I go.

The atrium lobby is pretty elegant, and our child was entranced with the penguins, huge koi, crowned crane, parrots, etc. The pool was also elegant with the tall waterfall and grotto. The kids' area served the littler kids very well, and the long slide was fun for the big kids and adults. One complaint: the only hot tub was large and not very hot, so in reality it was a heated pool stuffed with children. Not very relaxing. And there is no adults only pool. Live music at the pool was nice, when you wanted music, but there was no where (by a pool) to get away from the music and kid noise when you wanted peace and quiet. Our room was spacious. We liked having an empty (not mini-bar) refrigerator and fold out bed (in a king room). The \"terrace view\" room did overlook a parking lot, but we still enjoyed a great partial ocean view for the killer sunsets. There were some odd things for a resort aiming for this star rating. For example, the king sized bed had a reading lamp on only one side. Also, the hotel offered some nice freebies, like a hula demonstration. The problem is that the fliers that announced the time and place never mentioned that the demonstration would only take place if someone pre-registered for it. We were disappointed to wait around only to find out no one was coming. And, I was not pleased to walk to the spa for a steam only to find a sign that it was closing early for a private event. Given the price we paid, we were really pleased with our stay overall.

We have fairly high standards, and they were exceeded at the Hyatt, from the setting, through the beautiful grounds, the fun pool, to the quality of the food and service. We walked up the Ka'anapali beach past the Marriott, the Westin, the Sheraton, and were happy we chose the Hyatt over these alternatives. Some recommendations: 1. Make Luau reservations upon your arrival. Apparently the two best luaus are in Lahiana, and we missed our chance for those. 2. Stock up on water and drinks from the nearby Safeway in Lahaina, to avoid a massive drink charge. Mixed drinks are about $12 at the resort. 3. We found the nearby town, Lahaina, to be a pretty tacky. We enjoyed a stroll through the town window shopping, but after 2 hours we tried to avoid Lahiana. 4. If you want to go whale watching (incredible) just walk up the beach to the Westin - they have a chartered service which picks you up directly on the beach. 5. This is a family resort. If you are expecting a jacuzzi not filled with kids, try someplace else (maybe the Ritz up the coast?). On the other hand, the children were all very well behaved, and our son said this was \"the best vacation ever\". 6. Hammocks! 7. Road to Hana. A bit of a let down, it took far too much time for too little return, but there were some nice sights. We live in a part of the country with incredible waterfalls (better than those on the road to Hana). If you make the trip, get an early start. Stop at the state park near Hana (beautiful rocky coast) and the cascading pools which are after Hana. The road is very, very rugged. 8. Try the fish tacos in the Umalu restaurant.

For instance there is a \"smokers bench\" and ash tray about 20 feet outside of the front door on the sidewalk to the self-park area. Perhaps another incentive to get valet parking! More to the point, when our neighbor on a non smoking floor decided to start smoking on his balcony the staff's response to us was that we should just tell him when we are going to have our door open so that he could stop smoking then. Only after three complaints and only after I went directly to the manager on duty, did they, at our suggestion move us to another room, a request they had earlier rejected because, as they put it, \"you aren't the ones violating our policies.\" However, after it became clear that they were not about to ask the violator of the policy to move to their smoking floor (yes, apparently, they have a smoking floor!) they relented and moved us to the Regency Club floor and provided a night's free lodging as a courtesy. At that point I considered that matter resolved to my satisfaction but probably still worth a caution to others who are as annoyed by smoking as my wife and I are. Now the good points. I doubt whether there is a bad view in the hotel. In fact, after they moved us to the Regency Club floor we decided a lesser view room on the Regency Club floor would have been a greater value than the premium view we had reserved on a regular floor. The Regency Club offers wonderful amenities and a very attentive staff. It really is a B&B atmosphere within the hotel. The whale watching both from the beach and from the balcony of our room was astounding. The breakfast buffet was certainly adequate. And a variety of restaurants on site can be supplemented easily within the area. This was our first visit to Maui so it would be hard for us to rate how value for the dollar compares with similar resorts on the island.

The hotel is amazing as well as the staff. Everyone is very friendly. We had the breakfast buffet included in our package, and I would highly recommend this for anyone who is considering this option. The reason being is that if you're staying in Kannapali, there isn't much option for breakfast unless you want to take a walk to Whaler's Village. There is a small food court as well as a few restaurants @ Whalers Village. Or you could get in the car and drive to Lahaina which isnt' too far away either. There is not much beach to this hotel. If you want to be at a beach, stay at the Sheraton instead. The pool is the cool part of the hotel. Very nice grounds with tropical animals all over. The rooms are decent, although it probably could use another renovation. No complaints though. In terms of activities, I do recommend visiting the little activity shop right by the buffet. One person can help you coordinate all activities for your stay. Definitely do the sunrise at Haleakala and if you're adventurous, you must do the bike down. It's amazing and definitely scary at first, but you get the hang of it after you pass a couple of curves. The view of the sunrise is unbelievable...you have to dress warmly though!! The view from the bike down is a definite can't miss either. We also drove to Hana as well and also took the boat ride for the snorkeling adventure at Molokai. We also visited the Spa at the Hyatt and I do have to admit that it was extremely pricey for the service we received. I think it was over $400 for the both of us to get a one hour couples massage. I'm not sure if there are any other hotels that would offer something a bit cheaper? We didn't do much research on this. We're total foodies so the places that we loved to eat was Mama's Fish House. Yes, expensive, but the food is wonderful. If you're a sushi person, go to Sansei. Old Lahaina Luau is definitely an experience you don't want to miss, but the food is average. I've heard some folks say that if you go to Aloha Mixed Plate, the food the serve there is leftover from the Luau! Aloha Mixed Plate is SUPER cheap, plus you get a nice view of the beach. Don't expect fine dining though. One place I would totally avoid is Lelani's in Whaler's VIllage. We were advised to go there from the person that coordinated all of our activities at the hotel. This was the only suggestion that we were completely disappointed with. I think we would have rather eaten at McDonald's. The bill was over $100 and the food sucked so bad. I had a side of brocoli with my fish, and I swear they just reheated frozen brocoli!!! I will never forget that. If I'm paying $30+ for a dinner entree, I would at least expect fresh vegetables!! All in all, Maui was such a wonderful place to go for a honeymoon. The only thing we didn't get to do was head down to Wailea. I hear the Fairmont there is superb.

Well, in March, 2009, I could not have needed this type of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vacation Therapy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd more so I contacted my Travel Agent (Fran at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protravel International\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and told her what I was seeking. Without hesitation she recommended the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, I went for a one (1) week stay in mid-March, 2009 and I can honestly say that it was as spectacular, relaxing and memorable as any brochure claims it is. I had a partial Ocean-View room and it was totally worth the few extra dollars because sitting on the balcony watching the Sunset while reading was as cool as you fantasize it to be. The grounds were immaculate and completely focused on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chilling out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with an active pool but also a walkway along the beach to a quieter area if that is what you desired. The Hyatt is at one end of the stretch of luxury hotels in Maui and the walkway along the beach gives you a very nice view of each Hotel as well as the gorgeous background of the Ocean. I guess it is what you make of it but how can it ever be bad when the starting point and ingredients are pool, beach, Ocean and gorgeous Sunsets? I did different things each day but they were all somehow related to the Hyatt. For example, shortly after my arrival I introduced myself to the Tennis Pro (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and I explained that I was just looking for someone to hit with a few times during my one week stay so that I could exercise a bit. Frank immediately made me feel comfortable and he worked out a schedule for me and I think that in addition to enjoying hitting with each other we started to hang out a bit and it was fun. He offered me tips \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I can certainly use them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he seemed to know exactly when to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tennis pro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and when to simply be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hitting companion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The setting where the tennis courts are situated is SO beautiful and relaxing. There is nothing like getting up early to hit tennis balls at 8 AM in Maui and feel yourself slowly come alive to the sound of a solidly hit tennis ball mixed in with birds chirping and other wildlife wake-up in the background. I brought my own tennis racket but you needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring yours as Frank seemed to have a wide variety of rackets. I also quizzed Frank about some daytrips I should take and he gave me excellent advice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with a Map pointing out the joints I must check out. All in all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the tennis part was a major highlight of my week. I also went on a snorkeling half day trip on the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hula Girl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boat and that was pure perfection. The boat is almost brand new, the lunch was great and the crew was extremely professional and safety conscious but also very laid back and cool. If I had to diagram how I would want such a snorkeling trip to go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they stole the playbook! Breakfast at the Hyatt was a totally adequate Buffet in an amazingly beautiful setting which was half inside and half outside with birds flying in and out. I believe my breakfast was included in the travel package I had and I made it there about half of the days because on the other days I slept-in. Hey, I was on vacation so \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I had dinner my last night at the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful ocean-view restaurant and it also was perfect. The food was great, the setting was fantastic and the service was excellent. There were always two (2) Concierge-like people at the front of the Hyatt offering advice on things to do and answering any questions about the Hyatt or about Maui. I found these folks to be extremely knowledge and detail-oriented. They even set me up with a Golf Trip to the island of Lana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i which included taking a ferry and renting clubs and they facilitated everything without any problems. I did have a situation or two where there was a slight mistake by the hotel staff such as a missed wake-up call but the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to my compliant was so cool that it wound up being more of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bonding experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I left the Hyatt with even more confidence in trusting them with my valuable vacation time. (In the missed Wake-Up call circumstance the Hotel Operator felt so bad that she sent me a tasty basket of chocolate and in another situation one of the Assistant Hotel Mangers gave me free access to the Spa.) In terms of the Spa, I did not get around to checking it out until my last day and that was a mistake because it is AMAZING. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relaxation room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is picturesque as it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enclosed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but also open in the front where lying on a lounge chair would have you facing out into the Ocean with the fresh ocean air blowing in to refresh you. I did not get a Spa Treatment but I was told they have approximately 15 treatment rooms so I got the feeling that there would not be a long wait. However, I did very much enjoy just hanging out and relaxing in that room. I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. The only negative comment I have is that the interior of my Guest Room seemed a bit dated and while I had a spacious room the interior room inside the bathroom which contained the toilet and Shower was VERY small. It was so small that there was barely room in-between the toilet and the shower and that seemed very much out of place for such a luxurious Hotel.

A friendly young reception staffer, Thomas, overheard that we were on our honeymoon and upgraded us from our basic, terrace-view (read: parking lot view) room to an ocean-view room on the 3rd floor. Then he gave us a keepsake bamboo photo album, an invitation to a honeymooners-only cooking class at the resort restaurant for the following night, and a coupon for a free bottle of champagne at any of the resort's restaurants while we were there. It made us feel very welcomed from the very beginning of our stay. Our room itself was nicely laid out, with wonderful-smelling toiletries, comfortable bed, lovely furniture and a nice lanai with view of the gorgeous landscaping and the beach. A lot of time has been spent thinking about how to decorate the calming, comfortable rooms. The beach at the resort is one of the smaller and most sloping of those on Kaanapali Beach, and because it was lined with pieces of coral that had broken off the reef, as well as coral hidden just under the sand on the coast, it was kind of unpleasant to swim on the beach (plus we had crappy weather when we were there, so we didn't much want to). But the other beaches north of the Hyatt, walkable on the lovely paved ocean path, are much better--wider, with more room for towels and sand castles and swimming. The pool is really fun, with a slide and a cave-grotto, and lots of other fun places to explore. It was very cold, though, so we didn't spend much time in the pool because it wasn't especially warm when we were there. The location is great--just 10 minutes-drive north of Lahaina, where there are lots of restaurants and a nice town to explore, and right on Kaanapali beach, where you can walk to probably 20 restaurants and a hundred stores. Great people-watching from the pool chairs facing the ocean and the ocean walk. It's also a beautiful drive to take the road north of Kaanapali Beach that curves around the northernmost part of West Maui before going back to Kahului--much more scenic (and terrifying, in parts) than the overrated and overtraveled road to Hana, plus you actually GET somewhere instead of having to turn around at the end of the road.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cwe would go back\u201d", "Author": "goodtimes1chicago", "ReviewID": "UR26026088", "Content": "The service was great in all areas of the hotel.

Another waitperson saw us sitting there forever and eventually grabbed our food for us, which was, by then, ice cold. We decided to return for dinner to give the restaurant a second chance. It was a Thanksgiving buffet and the turkey consisted of a pan of dark meat remnants. It was the most unappetizing Thanksgiving display I have ever seen--and costly.

The open air lobby has parrots, penguins, and cranes which was a surprise. We received an upgraded ocean view with a bottle of champagne because it was our honeymoon which was an added benefit. The pool was amazing, although, you have to get out there early to claim a chair close to the pool and the attendants will take your towels if you leave them there more than an hour. The kids pool was fun even for adults with their waterslide. The rooms are updated and very \"Hawaiian\" and the bed was especially comfortable. The restaurants there are slightly over-rated but convienent. The breakfast buffet at the Swan Court is expensive but you have a great view (especially romantic at night) and there are a lot of choices. One downside is that there are a ton of birds flying around for scraps because it's also open air. The food for dinner is limited but I would suggest any fish dish on their menu. If you come for your honeymoon, this is the location for the \"honeymooners reception.\" My husband and I were told that this is where we enjoy free cocktails and hor deurves. The truth is that they hand you one glass of wine or champagne and then you are seated with other honeymooners to enjoy 3 pieces of items featured on their menu. It's not open bar and it's not enough to equate to an appetizer--so skip it. The best part of the hotel is it's location. There's a sidewalk that will take you past all the other resorts and to the area's shopping center. The hotel was worth what we paid, $1500 for the week but when we go back to Maui, we are going to stay in Wailea. It's a lot less touristy but a lot more expensive. Tips: Buy a A3h gold card for $30. I got the tip from frommer's--the 1st of every month, they sell excursion tickets for 50% off! We both snorkeled for $90, we both biked for half $45, so it cost $30 but saved us $150.

Our bathroom smelled like a sewer - it was so awful we had to keep the door closed at all times. The tub/toilet area was very cramped, which made it very difficult to bathe the kids. And the sink area was very dark. The carpet was gross (I hated to let my baby crawl around on it) and the pull-out couch was disgusting. The rooms were old and felt dirty and tired. The grounds were okay; it was fun to have wildlife there (penguins, flamingoes, and cranes). But the beach there is basically non-existant. It is difficult to access (esp. with kids) b/c the property is elevated above the beach and so you have to jump down/off a small cliff. And once down on the very small beach, the water is murky and full of seaweed and lava rocks. No fun. We had to walk down several hotels in order to get in the water. The pools were fun - the adult water slide is very fun and the kids' pool is designed in such a way that the kids can play independently. That was good. But overall, I find Kaanapali to be way inferior to the Wailea area. It is so much more commercial and crowded. I was surprised with all the noise - from the airtraffic to the boat traffic to all the tourists walking the beach path (who, by the way, fail to move aside for joggers, etc...).

It is rated a four-star hotel, but I don't know that I could say that in good faith after my stay. Upon arrival we received leis and upon learning it was our honeymoon were given a free photo album. They also sent a bottle of champagne up to the room which was much appreciated. Unfortunately our room was directly (and I cannot emphasize enough how directly) above the luau stage, and so we were \"treated\" to the very very very loud luau from 5-8 pm for seven consecutive nights. Luckily we were usually out to dinner during that time so we could escape. We also found some crushed up Dorito's and a spider web on the floor, which reminded me of some other reviews here, but I didn't even care to ask for a new room since I had already unpacked. I was also a bit upset because we valeted the car for $20 the first night after being told that there was \"very limited parking\", but once we discovered the virtually abandoned free self-parking lot, we never valeted the car again. You can tell that this hotel, like all of them right now in Maui, are being hit hard by this economy. Restaurants that normally require reservations sat virtually empty and allowed walk-ins. We arranged for a romantic dinner at the hotel's fine dining restaurant, Son'z, and I was disappointed to find that there were only 2 servers for about 15 tables. Service was devastatingly slow, and the food only so/so. We found much better restaurants off-site. I wanted to drink and enjoy my honeymoon but all three of the hotel's restaurants had such slow service that I was never even asked if I wanted a second drink until we were ready for the check. This was actually true of most the restaurants we visited...I think the pace in Maui is just much much slower than ours. The only other disappointment was that the pool had insufficient seating. All of the seats were taken by 8:30 am, so we only visited the pool once during our week-long stay. The pool policy was that you only leave a towel unattended for 60 minutes to reserve a seat, which I think was ridiculous because that's what happened to all of the seats...someone scouted before breakfast and then left the seat \"saved\", for much longer than an hour I might add. I didn't appreciate that at all. For what we paid, about $500/$600 for the cheapest room during peak season, I would have expected so much more.

My husband and I would compare it to a very bad Embassy Suites (in fact the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atrium has the same motif). We have stayed at several very nice hotels and this Hyatt was not even comparable to a $150 - $250 per night hotel room (and it cost much more)!! Firstly, the service was less than desirable. We tried not to complain since it was our Xmas holiday trip with our two children, but it was unbearable and we could not hold out much longer. Our room was not cleaned properly (no vacuuming, bath room not sanitized nor cleaned thoroughly) for several days. Only after we escalated the issue to the housekeeping management was the room prepared in a presentable fashion during the daily cleaning (and we are not the type of hotel patrons that trash a room since we keep our things very orderly and tidy). The restaurant, SonZ, inside the hotel is not a part of the Hyatt. I would strongly discourage anyone from eating dinner at this place! They brought us dinner rolls that were literally not cooked (you could pull the bread apart and see all of the gummy yeast!), and the focaccia bread served with the rolls was stale and very hard! We did not dine there once we experienced this mess, and promptly left the restaurant. The atrium grounds and the pool area (particularly the waterslide and kids pool area) are good for families since there are many exotic birds and pool toys that children can enjoy. Other than that, the hotel is a dump! If the service was better, it may have compensated for the less-than-good quality hotel cleanliness, but the service was awful and not what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a Hyatt. The Asian statues around the hotel lobby area were not even dusted since you could see the excessive dust build up on the statues and pedestal stands.

Our in-room hair dryer sparked and almost caught on fire when we tried to use it.....I haven't seen a hair dryer like that in 10 years...again...I thought I paid for the Hyatt ....the grounds, althpough lovely, were never lit up the entire week we were there. No Torches were lit except those directly near the open restaurants or lounges. But coming up the drive and along the walking paths thpoughout the property...the torches were never lit! So when you went for a walk around the proerty at night....some of the unlit paths led nowhere. Isn't that what we think of when we think of Hawaii?? moonlit walks along a torch lit boardwalk? We asked several times why they weren't lit but never got a straight answer. It wasn't too windy....quite the contrarty...besides....those torches can handle a lot of wind. Anyway...I won't stay there again. At least I know now....For Kaanapali....I'll stick with the Sheraton for the quality of their rooms and their service even if their grounds don't measure up to the Hyatt.. For Wailea....stick with the Fairmonth Kea Lani or Four Seasons. The service at Hyatt was immpeccable though.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cU'malu will definitely impress you!!!\u201d", "Author": "sapphire_36", "ReviewID": "UR22624971", "Content": "We visited the beaches of Ka'anapaali several times during our 2-week stay in Maui and dined at some of the restaurants lining the beachside path. The first time there we tried the Hula Grill. It was about 12:30pm and the atmosphere there was buzzing. We were welcomed by a friendly hostess who seated us right away. I have no allergies or conditions or anything but unfortunately I'm VERY particular about food!! The Hula Grill menu had a good selection of items that listed all the ingredients and sauces involved. That is a huge plus for me. i had the thai pizza without cheese and it was exactly what I was looking for. The service was good. The second time we only wanted a snack so we had bagels with jam and chai lattes from the cafe in the Whalers village. What a nice man behind the counter!!! Made conversation with us while our order was being prepared and was genuinely interested in us. Of course the coffees and bagels were perfect, hard to go wrong there. The third visit to Ka'anapaali we lunched at U'malu lounge at the Hyatt Regency. It was a nice walk down the path and we were curious to see what the hype was about the pool. What a sight. The pool is for hotel guests only and guests were branded by bright yellow bracelets so we didn't get to try the swim-up Grotto Bar for a drink but we found U'malu shortly after. It wasn't crowded at all for 1pm. We thought there might be a hungrier lunch crowd. But a break from the usual noise was nice and the energy was still there since U'malu is next to the pool. AWESOME FOOD!!! I was skeptical as I always am about places I've not read about but I took a chance and ordered the Firecracker Chicken Wrap without onions, tomatoes, or ranch. I didn't think it came with a side as it didn't mention on the menu that sides accompanied the lunch items. So i ordered a small basket of fries (at $6!! oops!) the waiter repeated our orders word for word and that really put me at ease. You don't know how many times I've had Mcdonalds mess up my wraps even though I say word for word \"no sauce, no cheese, just chicken-lettuce-and-tortilla\" and I'll get mayo on it and no lettuce. The wrap was perfect!! And it actually came with taro chips (I think they were house-made potato chips with taro fibres in them) which were delicious. I felt guilty ordering fries too, the basket is MASSIVE you'd need to share with at least 3 others!!! The waiter was attentive and made conversation with us when he came to check how that food was. I wish I'd ordered salad, my boyfriend had salad with his sandwich and it was the kind I like at home. Just mixed greens, no tomato or croutons or anything else on it. And not the crummy iceberg salads you sometimes get! Also his mai tai was practically a double so even though cocktails are $10 and up you're getting your dollar's worth. They come in pretty large cups. So if your guidebook mentions this place you should go because I'm very critical and this place impressed the pants off me. I also recommend Beach Bums lounge in Ma'alaea. Good selection of american food and kalua bbq meat dishes. $2 beers and $4 mai tais at happy hour!!

The Grand Hyatt in Maui did not disappoint. I actually liked the hotel in Maui a little better because there were more activities to do being close to other hotels and Lahaina. I'll start with the negatives, though these are relatively immaterial. Not crazy about the $15 per day resort fee which primarily covers use of the fitness center (which we used a lot). Had one instance where I could not find a parking place, but parked off to the side next to some hedges anyway. Check-in was a little slow (only 2 people at the check-in desk), especially after traveling 12 hours. Bathroom (tub and toilet area) a little cramped. That's about it. On the positives which overwhelm the negatives. Excellent service and staff. Friendly, helpful, and always greet you. Hotel upgraded us to a deluxe ocean view room on one of the upper floors. Bottle of champagne greeted us. The hotel and grounds are enormous but beautiful. Plants, gardens, streams, waterfalls all like a little garden of Eden. Balcony view of ocean, Lanai and pool are stunning. Though pricey as you might expect, the restaurants and food were great. I would recommend having the breakfast buffet included in the price of your trip if you can because it is very expensive separately ($30 per head). Loved the pool and poolside bar. Lot's of chairs but you have to arrive pretty early in the day to snag a couple. Normally have live music from 4-6 pm and 7-9 pm each day. Fitness center is top notch for a hotel. Spa is equally good. Both my wife and I had massages and utilized the spa. Great boardwalk next to beach for walking down to other hotels (Hyatt is the best) and checking out restaurants like Hula Grille and Leilani's and the Whaler's Village Shopping center. The hotel also has plenty of shopping such as Macy's. Lot of good discounts in there. Overall, you really can't go wrong with the Hyatt unless there is some construction going on which there wasn't.

The room was a standard partial ocean view room on the 5th floor. Decor and amenities were nice but we missed the HDTV. The room for the shower and WC was a tad small (but really, how much time does one need to spend there) though the separate area for the sink and mini-fridge was appreciated. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. What dropped the Hyatt a half point was housekeeping's lack of providing washcloths EVERY day they serviced the room. Each morning my wife or I would have to call housekeeping or chase down the housekeeper to get fresh washcloths. We never did figure out why housekeeping wouldn't provide clean washcloths (they did provide clean bath and hand towels). Perhaps the daily tip I left for housekeeping wasn't sufficient. The grounds were gorgeous. My boys loved the wildlife (penguins, \"Spike\" the African crane and his buddy, the swans in Swan Court, flamingos, koi, and the often very talkative parrots in the lobby. The art was very much appreciated. We also loved the very large pool at the Hyatt. We spent most of our time on the \"kids side\" of the pool (the one with the 150-foot covered waterslide). We found it very nice; it was uncrowded and offered shade or sun at one's discretion. The only time I spent on the \"adult side\" was during the scuba lesson. I also found that the Grotto lounge in between the two sides was a very nice place to have a beer and watch the baseball playoffs or college/pro football w/o having to exit the pool. My entire family enjoyed having the workout room on site. It was very well equiped (the loaner headphones are a nice touch) and never crowded. The on-site restaurants, though expensive, were very good to excellent. The food, service, and ambiance at Sonz for dinner was outstanding; for breakfast, it was very good. As others have noted, room service was quick, the meals were hot, and the food was good. (On two nights, we went next door to Longboards at the Marriot for dinner. The food was less expensive and it was very good. The service there was also very good and the singer was outstanding.) My personal favorite was the coffee and tea vendor who was there at 6:00 a.m. when I went looking for that first cup of coffee. Although breakfast (normally between 8 and 8:30) was usually crowded and we had a bit of a wait (never more than 10 minutes), we never had a wait or felt rushed for dinner. Service at check in, and by bell staff, restaurant/bar staff, room service staff, pool attendants, and parking valets was outstanding (see comment about housekeeping earlier). Having stores on-site was also helpful when shopping urges struck. My wife and I probably spent a tad more than we should have at Macy's. Also, having an Expedia shop on site made if very easy to arrange horse-back riding, snuba, submarine, and helicoptor trips. The little mini-market on the lobby level proved to be invaluable more than once by providing sunscreen, aloe, gift items, Diet Coke with lime flavoring, snacks, adult beverages, and such. Take advantage of the little red card the store gives you (one \"stamp\" for every $5 of purchases). If you're like us, you'll be surprised by how much you shop there and how quickly you can earn a bonus goodie or two. Unlike others who mentioned having problems with parking there, we never were unable to find a parking space (we had to find one big enough for the Jeep we rented...the spaces are kind of narrow and some people don't know how to park in a single space). That may have been due to our being back at the Hyatt by 8:30 p.m. each night and that, per one staff person, the hotel was only about 70 percent occupied while we were there (October 12 - 21).

My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon and liked it so much we came back 2 years later. Could not have made a better decision Grounds - awesome, as many others have mentioned. Unbelievably well maintained, beautiful gardens, just a relaxing environment from the minute you walk through the door. Only drawback (if I had to nitpick) is the sheer size of the place. It's huge, but they use the space very well. Shops are nice to have, as is the Expedia desk on-site Rooms - we were in a partial ocean view near the water side of the hotel on a high floor. Could see a lot of ocean from the balcony and the rest was golf course / mountains. For as little time as you spend in a hotel room in Maui, it was more than sufficient. Rooms are clean and pretty big, bed very comfortable, and it was nice to have both a couch (which I believe is a pullout bed) and an empty mini-fridge. Pool - as good as any hotel I've ever seen. Large, clean, plenty of chairs, right next to the ocean, and the waterslide is fun (even for adults). It's a definite plus to have the kids' pool on the other side of the grotto. Provides a great natural buffer from noise. The new uMalu restaurant is open and is a great improvement. Food is great, the place itself looks great, and prices aren't any more outrageous than any other pool-side service at a decent resort. Half price bloody mary's from 9-11 are a nice touch and they're very good Location - path along the Kaanapali hotels is nice and Whaler's Village is a pretty painless 20 minute walk. Lahaina is an easy drive, and if you're a golfer you are very close to the courses. Service - everyone was great to us. Did not walk by one Hyatt employee that didn't smile or give an \"aloha.\" I've traveled a lot and have never found hospitality like in Hawaii. They get it. Food - Cascades good but not as good as the last time we ate there. Still love the setting and sitting in the chairs near the bar for a drink. Sushi was very good, steak just OK. -Sonz was just not worth the price. Service was great, menu looks very enticing, but the pasta dishes were just OK and the value is not the best -uMalu (see above) - huge upgrade from old Pavilion restaurant and it's finally done. Fits in beautifully with the property. But $4 for a Diet Coke? Really? Parking - yes it can fill up due to the luau, but getting the valet for free is fair compensation, right? If this is your prime complaint you had a great vacation. Overall - heaven. Honestly, unless you are staying at the Four Seasons everywhere you travel I don't know what else you could want. The Hyatt gets it right in just about every respect. Should make a great stay for just about anyone Few suggestions - stop at Kmart or somewhere similar on your way in from the airport and pick up drinks, snacks, sunscreen, etc. Will save you a few bucks (do not buy this stuff in the hotel sundry shop. Prices are laughable) Check out Wailea for half a day - Shops at Wailea are very nice, Longhi's has great food, you can park at the Four Seasons and wander through it and the Grand Wailea next door to see how the upper class vacations (I'd still take the Hyatt).

So, my younger son ate for free and my older son just ordered off of the kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 menu. The rooms were updated, and well organized.

The gym is covered in the $15 resort fee. Since we were paying this fee, we figured we might as well work out, and come home looking hot! Haha. The hotel is located about a 10 minute beach walk to The Whaler (stores and shops), as well as a 15 minute beach walk to Black Rock (a famous snorkeling destination), so it is a convenient location! And you can check out all the other hotels along the way, as you walk. Here are my negatives about the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We thought the pool was extremely crowded. When we went (at end of August), it was packed! I felt the chairs were pushed side by side (touching) next to each other, as well as pushed right up against the pool, as well as all the way out to the walkway. I felt as though I was in a movie theatre trying to get through to my seat. I could be a little biased since we had just arrived from the Hyatt Kauai, which had a more spacious and relaxed pool area. The pool is still stunning after all these years... it just seemed much more crowded than back then.. The Hyatt Maui pool was cold! It was not heated enough (at least not in comparison to the wonderful Hyatt Kauai pool), and there was only one Jacuzzi and the temperature of the Jacuzzi was only warm (like bathwater). The Jacuzzi needs to be hotter! And the Jacuzzi is situated near the kids section, so there are a lot of kids in it. I can see how couples might not like it, but my kids sure did! I did not like the kids pool section because we had a bad experience on our first day there. There was an unsupervised unruly kid who kept throwing sand or splashing at my children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faces. Then there was another young kid who tried to submerge my little 5 year old son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heads underwater as my son was trying to swim and tread water. The parents were either on their cell phones, or just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Unfortunately, after that incident, and seeing how crazy crowded it was, we tried to avoid the pool during peak times, or swam on the other side instead.

No Worries - we really liked everything about the Hyatt! We had booked the least expensive room type - and the room we were given was just great. It overlooked the garden area and the pool, and we could even glimpse some of the ocean. With the balcony doors open, you could hear the sound of the waves. The room itself had one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in, plus a sofa & coffee table, chest and a desk - a fairly spacious room. The balcony was large enough for a table and 2 chairs and felt very private and secluded with all the surrounding greenery. There was a big walk-in closet with safe and a coffeemaker. Best of all, there was a refrigerator in addition to the minibar. There's a nearby Safeway on the way to Lahaina, and we kept the fridge stocked with cold drinks. It wasn't a fancy room, but it had everything we needed and we enjoyed it very much. When we vacation, we usually have a big breakfast and then skip lunch - so I purchased a package with daily breakfast buffet included. The buffet is terrific (though I wouldn't have wanted to pay for it a la carte!), with a big selection of cold and hot dishes and omelets made to order. We would walk early every morning and then go to breakfast, and there was never a wait. But by 8:30 am, the lines start to get long - so go early. We liked the Kaanipali location. There's a nice walk along the ocean that passes all the hotels and Whaler's Village (an area of restaurant/shops. There are 2 golf courses - nice but not great, and you get free rounds for touring the Marriott time share next door. If golf is important on your vacation, you probably already know you want to be at Kapalua or Wailea (assuming you're willing to pay the prices!). The pool at the Hyatt is huge and gorgeous, so if you're into tanning, it's a terrific place. The beach is not much, but all the beaches on Maui are public, so you can walk towards Whaler's Village where other hotels have broader beaches, or drive to a really nice beach (like Fleming in Kapalua). Parking is tight, but we always found a place in the public parking lots (valet parking the evening we arrived was complimentary - nice touch!). The hotel is centrally located, but you will really want a car to get around the island and out to different restaurants. As for restaurants, they're all expensive, but I'd skip the overpriced hotel restaurants and the overrated Lahaina Grill. We loved the Plantation House, IO Restaurant, and Mama's Fish House (which isn't nearly as far away as the concierge will tell you...) What didn't we like? I felt ripped-off by the recommendations of the concierge and the extremely expensive and boring sunset cruise he booked for us. Walk along the beach and pick up some brochures for activities before you book the expensive ones the concierge will recommend. All in all, we loved the Hyatt and would certainly stay there again if we went back to Maui (we probably won't because we much prefer the Big Island and Kauai).", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle, Wa", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful scenery, great kiddie pool\u201d", "Author": "emtoothfxr", "ReviewID": "UR20104174", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt 9/8-9/14.

What we ended up with was right in the center of the main building with an unobstructed view of the ocean and the main pool. It was gorgeous. The room was nothing special but the grounds are lush and well maintained. The kids loved the wildlife in and around the lobby area. In the mornings you can feed the fish in the pond. They are huge and take the food from your hand. We spent most of our time at the kiddie pool. Perfect temperature, shallow enough for toddlers, fun kiddie slide. There is also a dark tunnel waterslide for bigger kids and adults. It was a blast! A little scary the first time then loads of fun. Nice Pina Coladas and popsicles poolside. We also used the fitness center and the spa often. The gym faces the ocean view and has nice equipment with TV monitors so you can watch or listen and look at the view if you like. Nice ice cold towels to cool yourself down after your workout or you can go into the spa next door, small but pleasant. The food in the hotel is alright, nothing too memorable. We particularly liked the Cascade Grille. Nice seared Ahi entree, the sushi was just ok. Everywhere is kid-friendly though and they always had kiddie menus and crayons for our 2 and 3 yr. olds. We thought the staff was very friendly, especially the groundskeepers and housekeeping staff. ..always an \"Aloha\" in the hall. Peggy in the Activities office was super friendly and set us up for a helicopter tour. We used Air Maui and took a great 45 minute flight around West Maui.

First of all it was our first trip to HI and this hotel was everything and more that we invisioned of a Hawaiian hotel. Gracious valets and bellmen, BEAUTIFUL grounds and hotel interior, fabulous food, etc. The lobby is stunning. I was shocked and in awe of the open lobby with it's parrots on perches and the koi and penguins. Just fabulous! The staff are great people. The rooms were fabulous too. They are modern but with that hawaiin feel. Our room was a partial ocean view but it was wonderful. Now let's get to the real reason why I loved this place. My hubby and I went out sight seeing and while we were out we went to the \"Olivine Pools\". It was great until we got pounded by a 30 ft. rogue wave that sent me skidding down appx. 15ft of lava rock. I was terribly hurt. By the time we climbed back up the hill (1/4ml) to our car and drove the 30 mins. back to the hotel I was almost passed out. When we arrived at the hotel the valets took one look at me and immediately got help to take me down to the hotels INFIRMARY! Yes they have a doctor on premisses! He took me directly back to a room. Dressed my wounds as best he could, gave me some pain meds and called the ambulance. They were there in appx. 25 mins. The hospital is back near the airport. After all of that ordeal, spending the day in the emergency room, when we returned to the hotel the staff was just great. The helped me around the hotel, gave me crutches from the infirmary to use, gave us complimentary beverages. The waiter even prepared my breakfasts for me as I waited at the table. This place was absolutely wonderful! Now this year when we returned to Maui we stayed at the Westin ONLY because we saw on the Regency's site that during the time we would have been there, construction would have been going on. I can tell you though that the next visit and stay will be at the Regency. The Westin was very nice but nothing comapred to the Regency.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon", "Title": "\u201cHappy Family Holiday in Maui\u201d", "Author": "KAGDEVON", "ReviewID": "UR19783907", "Content": "Our excitement about visiting Maui was somewhat dented when we were stuck at the back of the plane from Honolulu where there were no windows, so we saw nothing of the island until we left the airport. However, when the hotel receptionist at the Hyatt Regency heard our story she upgraded our room to a partial ocean view to ensure that we saw the best of Maui whilst we were there. We were also given an orchid lei (flower garland) each, so that's what I call a good start! The hotel is located at Kaanapali beach about 40 minutes bus shuttle ride from the airport. The beach is fabulous to look at but there is a very strong wave action and rocks just under the surf zone outside the hotel, so we stuck to the pool area instead of swimming and snorkelling in the sea. We were there as a family of four (two kids, aged 13 and 10) and had just left a busy week in Waikiki, so we knew this was going to be more laid back and relaxing. The kids spent most of their time playing in the extensive pool (and fast water slide) but my eldest also had a go at scuba diving for the first time with my husband. They trained in the pool with a very friendly tutor and then within the hour they were diving off the reef outside the hotel for about 40 minutes, where they saw a turtle chomping on the coral amongst many coloured fish. She hasn't stopped grinning yet and it was the highlight of the whole holiday for her! The hotel IS expensive in terms of food and drink but you can buy drinks at the local ABC store (about 15 minutes walk along the beach at Whaler's Village) and then keep them in your own fridge if you like. There is also a cheap food court and other places to eat at the Village with a range of prices. The smoothies by the pool are lovely but are more like milkshakes, costing about $7. Everything in Hawaii seems to start early compared to the UK or Europe, so for the whole two weeks we were there we got up before 7.00am for breakfast (which wasn't a hardship to be honest). There were big queues at the Swan Court breakfast but mainly after 7.15am, so be warned if you don't fancy a wait. The breakfast buffet was $30 (half price for kids under 12) but it was amazing - pretty much everything you could think of including smoked salmon, banana bread, an omlette station, fried fish and fresh fruit. Yum! Loungers immediately around the pool were typically taken very early but then again, maybe these people like getting soaked by other people's kids! We sat facing the ocean on sun loungers slightly further away from the pool and were very happy with the location. During the day, an attendant would come around with free ice popsicles and cold flannels which were very welcome, as well as the usual attentive bar staff asking if you would like any drinks. The rooms were good but not excellent, they could do with a refurbish but we weren't disappointed and coped without having a flat-screen TV. We booked several tours via the Expedia desk in the hotel and these were excellent: Pam was the best ambassador a place could have and made sure we had a great time and even sorted out our return shuttle link. What a star! We went on the 'Four Winds' snorkel glass-bottomed boat trip to Molokini which was amazing - a really friendly crew, bagel breakfast and BBQ lunch and then you get to see your snorkel trip on the way back because they send a diver down to record it on DVD. Fabulous! We also hired a car and did 'The Road to Hana'. It took 6 hours to get there and fortunately no car sickness (it's VERY twisty)! Take your insect repellent if you plan on stopping anywhere - the whole point of going - as we forgot ours and suffered. Duh. On our last night we went to the hotel's luau 'the Drums of the Pacific' which was excellent with a big choice of buffet food (as much as you can eat) and a free bar.

Same food everyday and it got bored by the end, not worth it if you have to pay $30/per head. My daughter did a hair wrap by the pool, expensive $65 plus tax and tip, but she loved it. One night, we walked to Hula Grill in Whalers Village shopping center for dinner and really enjoyed the beach walk. Restaunts in Hyatt are very expensive.

We had a Deluxe Oceanfront room on the 20th floor which overlooked the pool, beach and construction site so we had a good view of what was happening. Our room bathroom area and lanai though not large were perfectly comfortable. We had a queen and a double bed in the room but requested a roll away bed to avoid any sleepless nights ( the Grand Hyatt had two queen beds) All the beds including the roll away were very comfortable. The pool is well designed with waterfalls, a cave with a bar in the middle and a children's area and water slide on the other side.We were never bothered by the construction, they have live music by the pool when the men are working and it seems that they have gone to a lot of trouble to minimise noise. My one complaint was the amount of pool chairs stacked side by side right up to the edge of the pool making it hard to get in and out of the water. Guests would \"reserve\" chairs first thing in the morning by putting their towel's out on a chair then leave. There were signs warning guests not to do this. We ended up sitting / lying on our towels on the grass behind the path as there never seemed to be any \"available\" chairs, we were happy to do this as we had some shade and some space. The gardens are lovely and the birds ( swans, flamingos, penguins and parrots ) a delight, especially Roger the parrot who waves goodbye with his claw. All the staff that we encountered were very pleasant and helpful. As many reviewers have mentioned a lift was out of order while we were there but we never found this to be a problem, a lift always came straight away.

Here are all the issues we had with the hotel: 1. Had to switch rooms 3 times. We booked an ocean view room and they put us into a partial ocean view room and lied to us saying this was ocean view. Especially annoying considering how much we had to pay to stay in this hotel. 2. The second room we got actually was ocean view and had two nice balconies. The problem with this room was that we saw a cocroach when we came back to the room at night as well as pieces of a twizzler and M&Ms by the dresser and curtains. 3. The rooms and hotel are run down and in desperate need of an upgrade. Drapes are stained, tvs are old and get terrible reception, carpet is stained, etc... Also, in the tower we stayed in which is the main one, one of the elevators is out and based on what I was told from the bell hop, it will be out for 3 months then they will be doing the same to the other elevators. In other words, for a long time 1 of 3 elevators will not be operating causing long waits just to go back and forth to your room. 4. They rip you off with a lot of hidden fees. $15 resort fee per day + $20 fee per day for valet parking. Self-parking is not really an option here since there are very few spots. 5. The pool is extremely crowded and unless you get a chair by 8AM you will have problems finding one. Also the chairs are very close together and hardly any have shade or some covering over them like other hotels. If you're on your honeymoon or just looking to relax by the pool, watch out. There are a ton of kids here that take over all parts of the pool. No section for just adults exists. 6. There is construction right next to the pool with noise you can hear being drowned out by loud music they have playing to cover up the noise. This area also takes up a decent portion of the area around the pool. 7. The beach is a joke. Hardly any sand and very rocky. We walked to the other side of Kannapali Beach where the Sheraton is (which by the way is a much nicer resort). Bottom line, we made a huge mistake spending our honeymoon here and paying the outrageous prices for this hotel and getting very little for our money other than a lot of stress. This hotel is the complete opposite of the Grand Hyatt Kauai which is what a resort should be like and what this place is not.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna,Virginia", "Title": "\u201cPositive stay\u201d", "Author": "skm2004", "ReviewID": "UR18839844", "Content": "Arrived and informed about valet/self parking.

Had lunch at only restaurant opened besides pool area, both had chicken salads that were ok, that was our only meal at the Hyatt.The construction everyone is talking about is at the pool, they are building another restaurant, it does not impact the hotel stay at all in my opinion. After walking the path towards Whalers Village, realized Hyatt has no beach, just a small area to the left of the resort, that is where the fitness center is( huge, modern), and also where to go for jet-skis.Hammocks on the grounds, cabanas for rent, both are great for watching the sunset. Only one day the pool police were in force. They first place a note on your chaise of the time and state that your belongings will be removed in one hour, it took about two hours for this to happen as the couple next to us came back just in time as they came around.

We did a ton of research on the different resorts on Kaanapali Beach, and went with the Hyatt despite the mixed reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We cannot imagine how anyone could dislike this place! From the moment we walked in, the staff treated us very kindly (even though they don't do room upgrades for honeymooners) and the grounds were beyond beautiful. Our partial ocean view room had a great view of half mountains, half ocean, which was fine for us. Here are some of the things we were impressed by: Pool: Oh my gosh! This was the best pool at any resort we've ever stayed at. It is HUGE, it's right next to the ocean, and it's surrounded by plants, palm trees and flowers. The temperature of the water was perfect. There were tons of chairs (brand new, too), although by 10:00 it did get pretty crowded (we put towels and magazines on 2 chairs each morning around 8:00 before going to breakfast, even though you're \"not supposed\" to do that). The construction at the poolside Pavillion restaurant hardly bothered us at all. There were plenty of other options for poolside drinks and food. Food: Breakfast at Swan Court (only option) is incredible. Luckily, in our package through Apple Vacations, we had ours included - if you don't, it's $30.00 a day. But the selection is amazing, and the location is awesome! It's all open air, and it's right by a pretty pond with waterfalls and swans. We ate at all the other restaurants at the hotel. Cascades was an awesome view and wonderful food. (We often went there for just a drink, too.) Spats Trattoria was very good, but the most expensive meal we had in Maui, and it's closing in September. The pooside \"snack shack\" that served burgers, sandwiches and salads by the pool was good too, although pretty pricey. Our favorite place to have a drink before/after dinner was the Weeping Banyon, which is a coffee bar by morning and bar bar by night. In all, we found all the food and drinks at the hotel to be excellent. Yes, it is expensive, but it wasn't beyond what we expected since it is Maui. The portions were huge which helped justify some of the cost :). Room: Our room was very nice, seemed updated, and was very clean. The king size bed was very comfortable, as were the linens. I liked that there was a seperate sink area outside of the bathroom so that I could get ready while my husband showered. The tile in the bathroom was very nice, and we liked the granite coutertops. We had no problems with our room at all. Staff: Everyone from the concierge to the people working by the pool to the activities help desk were extremely accomodating and friendly. They had plenty of advice and maps for us. Beach: It is true that there is not a huge beach in front of the Hyatt, but there is some. We enjoyed jumping waves in the ocean and sitting on the beach at night. All beaches in Hawaii are public (even in front of hotels) so if you're looking for a huge beach, you could go a little ways down. We did have oceanside massages in little cabanas, which was well worth it! The boardwalk down Kaanapali Beach starts at the Hyatt and goes all the way down past the Marriott, Kaanapali Alli, Westin and Sheraton, and is a beatiful walk to Whaler's Village where we ate a couple times. In all, we would HIGHLY recommend this resort to anyone planning to stay on Maui!

The Hyatt is large scale and corporate for me but I have to say that I enjoyed it as a corporate & sanitized cultural experience!

Having made that observation, it's a beautiful property, the rooms were terrific and the air conditioning works well. The outstanding staff are all extremely friendly, positive and professional. Room service, pool and the related beach/ocean activities are all well above average. The spa is excellent. It's close-by to Lahaina, but too far to walk. However, it's on the public bus route ($1.00) from Whalers Village. Surfed Lahaina harbor several times (a left; knee to chest-high). It's a mellow wave and sorta crowded inside due to the surf schools/students. Outside is good as well as just over to the other side of the the harbor. Respect the locals--wait your turn--don't drop-in--hoot for them and give a positive vibe. The local hassle will become non-existent and changes to friendly.

Before the trip we regularly read the Trip Advisor reviews and were very prepared for what to expect during our stay. The Hyatt met or exceded all of our expectations. First of all, the hotel grounds are beautiful. The landscaping in meticulous and we enjoyed all of the different wildlife (birds, swans, penguins, etc.). The pool area looked very nice but we really didn't spend any time in the pool area. Instead we chose to spend our time exploring Maui as this was my first trip to Hawaii. There really isn't a beach at the Hyatt but we spent time at many of the other beaches on the island, so that didn't bother us. The hotel room was clean and I did not think the bathroom area was too small as did some of the other reviewers. After all, it is a hotel! The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on! We had a beautiful view from our Deluxe Oceanview room. The TV may have been 15 years old as others have said, but we weren't there to watch TV so that didn't bother us. We had the breakfast package and found the buffet very nice. They have everything from fruit and pastries to hot dishes (including Mahi-Mahi!). I found the service to be very good at the breakfast buffet. Some mornings the lines seemed long, but moved very quickly. The one thing that we were not prepared for were the birds at the breakfast. They were everywhere and even took some food off our table one morning. They were cute to watch but also tended to be a little annoying as they were all over the restaurant. We didn't eat at the other hotel restaurants so I can't comment on their food or prices. As many other viewers have mentioned, the elevators and parking were our biggest issues with the hotel. If you read the reviews the elevators have been a problem for months and were still not working well during our stay. Even though there was only 1 elevator working in Tower 2 during most of our trip we really didn't find the waiting time to be too long. The parking lots are crowded with narrow spaces and valet parking is expensive. We were always able to find a parking space in the self-parking lots but sometimes had to circle around and wait until someone else left. Fortunately we were always able to find a spot and did not have to use the valet. All-in-all we had a wonderful stay.

The disappointment with the facility starts with the broken elevators, under maitenance the entire week with and apology framed on a table so I guess its lasted awile. It continued when we walked into our starkly decorated aged and beat up room which supposedly is the best of the house. Th bathroom was ridiculously tiny, the TV 15 years old, and all the places where wood can be dinged up were _ a good 20 years worth. For what they charge, this is illogical.

It's all very good, but the tennis center is what really stood out -- for the top quality instruction, the beauty of the hidden courts and, let's see, the tastiness of the off-court fruit \"smoothies\" (their own secret blend) and the fun playing with the other guests in pick-up games or structured events and group exercises. I was not expecting it (and did not bring a racket), but the tennis experience is what totally \"made\" my vacation. It matched my need for relaxation and fun with the physical activity that I also needed. Every morning they do this workshop on different aspects of playing tennis, and the guests can be at any level of experience. It was amazing to me how well the instructor \"got to the point\" by using a very few exercises, very simply-expressed, that really WORK!! I think it is because he has subtle ways of shifting the same exercise over to what each person really needs individually. (How does it go in The Matrix? \"He only told you what you needed to hear.\") To be more exact about it, the tennis pro at the Hyatt is this awesome force for tennis-improvement in the universe, and he sure elevated my game in short order. His name is Frank Salvadore (and his right-hand man is Pohoku), and if you stay at the Lahaina resorts then here is my advice -- just see Frank!

So when you compare your rates, Hyatt's rate really isn't what shows up in your search, ADD $15 A DAY!!. You would think over $500 a night is enough, but these greedy Hyatt people need to milk you for a little more of your cash. PARKING IS HORRIBLE. Either pay $20 a day for valet parking or find your own.Cha Ching. There are 2 lots and both have parking spaces that are so tiny, you'll be lucky to squeeze even a tiny car into the spots (if you find one). On the day of arrival you are kind of forced to pull up to the main entrance and use the valet parking. (It's free the first day unless you leave it in valet after 10PM). So you give the guys your keys, the bellman unloads your car while you check in. So now you're in the awkward position of tipping a bellman when he brings your luggage to your room and tipping the valet when you retrieve your car. Cha Ching. When I checked in, they tried to upgrade my room for ONLY $100 a night extra. Cha Ching. Room Service took 1 hour and they charge you a 20% gratuity automatically and when you sign the receipt, there's a place to add 'an additional gratuity'. Cha Ching. After having to wait an hour, I would have preferred a ZERO tip, but that isn't an option. All the ammenities that Hyatt touts in this hotel COST MONEY, A LOT OF MONEY! Don't assume they're included in your rate, they are not. It seemed to me everyone at the hotel walked around with their hands open expecting you to place money in them. Cha Ching. Construction was going on during our stay. I didn't read that warning anywhere, but the jack hammer in the morning kind of ruins your sleep in days. At least they didn't charge extra for the extra noise. The much touted Ka'anapali beach by the hotel is poor. It is the south part of the beach, which is the worse of the entire beach. There's a reef in the water which makes swimming dangerous if not impossible. If you go more that 4 feet from the beach, you're on BIG ROUGH ROCK and BOULDERS. (forget white sandy beaches - this isn't the place to find them). The Beach further north is MUCH better. If you plan to just swim in the pool, you'll be ok. But who goes to Hawaii to swim in a swimming pool instead of the ocean? I would NOT stay in this hotel again, it is way over priced for what it is. Much better are available on better parts of the beach. And with the hotel staff walking around with their hands out all the time, you'll run out of cash quickly.

We went from Four Seasons Manele Bay Lanai to the the Hapuna Beach Prince on the Big Island to the Hyatt Regency Maui and then to the Grand Hyatt Kauai. We spent 7 nights at the Hyatt Regency Maui. It was our 7th visit to Maui and Hawaii. This was our third stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui. We rented a convertible from Avis. Maui is a great place to have a convertible, since most of the driving is at speeds where you can have the top down and the weather is usually sunny. We reserved a Regency Club Deluxe Ocean View room. This gives you a room on the top two floors of the main building, with a full ocean view. In addition you are high enough that the noise from the pool doesn't bother you. The room is fairly large, but a fairly small bathroom and with a very king sized comfortable bed. Our room had a hide-a-bed also. It was ready to be replaced, as the the sofa sagged noticeably. The Regency Club has a nice continental breakfast, with wonderful fresh fruit, muffins, etc. It also has soft drinks, coffee and bottled water available throughout the day and hors d'oeurves and drinks in the early evening. We booked the AAA rate and got a 25% discount. We booked a few months ahead and I rechecked the rates every week or so and ended up getting the rate reduced a couple of times. As I kept watching the rates, they went back up and eventually were more than my original reservation. It pays to spend some time watching the rates. One thing we don't like about the room is the \"minibar\" stock of candy bars, etc. that sit on a chest in the bathroom area. It takes up a big share of the horizontal flat space in the bathroom area and they tell you to not even touch anything or you'll be charged for it. With the rates they charge for the rooms, I don't see why they need to try to get even a few more bucks from these items. The room has a nice balcony, which is a lovely place to sit and watch the ocean, watch for whales and get some sun. It gives you a great view of sunset. It's also a nice place to sit in the evening and enjoy the wonderful weather. Depending on which room you have, you may be able to slightly hear music from the lounge on the ground floor. The hotel has a very nice pool, with a children's area that is fairly well separated from the main pool area. There are a lot of chairs around the pool, but they are quite close together. They also have cabanas you can rent for the day, that give much better shade and a bit more privacy. They have added a number of new cabanas from our previous visits, on a grassy area near (but not on) the beach. That did reduce the number of chairs available however. The original cabanas are actually on the beach, but the beach area is so sloped that the chairs are hard to lay on without eventually sliding down the seat. The beach in front of the hotel is ok, but not great. I believe some may have washed away in recent years. But it is a short walk down the sidewalk to broader, nicer beach areas. The Hyatt has a great spa. Some of the treatment rooms have an ocean view, and they have a great open air relaxation room where you can unwind after a massage and look out at the ocean. If you have some type of spa treatment, you can use any of the spa facilities for the day. On our previous visit we had a late flight back to the mainland and booked a massage at about 4 pm. It gave us some place to go after we had to checkout and was a great way to relax before the long overnight flight home. We had brunch at the Swan Court a couple of mornings. It has a very nice selection and is a beautiful place, overlooking a large pool. We also had dinner in the same restaurant on Valentine's Day. It's called Sonz in the evening. It was a very nice dinner, with excellent food, and much better service than you might often get on a busy Valentine's Day. We've always enjoyed staying at Kaanapali Beach because of the sidewalk that runs near the beach from the Hyatt all the way to Black Rock. It's a great place to go for a walk, and gives you a nice choice of restaurants to choose from without having to get into your car. Since the Hyatt is at the south end of the beach, it has less traffic on the sidewalk. But it's also a longer walk to some of the restaurants. It's probably a 15 minute walk to Whaler's Village if you walk briskly. We don't mind, since we enjoy the exercise.

It had live talking parrots everywhere, some penguins, flamingos and African cranes, which was really cool to watch. The hotel for a honeymoon isn't the greatest place. The rooms are small and we didn't have a great view from our balcony. We asked to upgrade but the staff wasn't to accomodating, unlike the Hyatt in Oahu, whose staff was great. On the otherhand the pool is really nice and huge w/ a slide. In spite of all the reviews talking about how there were never any lounge chairs, we never had a problem finding chairs. In fact, we'd have breakfast at around 10 or 10:30 and we'd go to the pool right after and right away find a place to lounge. Food: The Sonz inside the hotel is really good for dinner. The breakfast buffet is just okay and it costs about $60 for 2 ppl- totally NOT worth it for an omelet and some orange juice. The location of the hotel is not bad however. It's in the city of Ka'anapali and there really isn't one central location in Maui, so anyplace you stay will have something for you. In Ka'anapali, we had Whalers Village for shopping which is right by the Hyatt, so that was convenient. Whalers is just an outdoor shopping mall- but kinda small and no big deal itself, but nice for walking. Now if you are looking for a great beach, the Hyatt is not your place. The beach by the Hyatt only good for walking along the shore but you can't really swim as the waves are pretty intense and the waters are rocky. For Maui in general, it's really boring, especially if you just come from Waikiki in Oahu. If you are into quietness, outdoor activities such as hiking, etc and being lazy by the beach all day, then you'll like Maui (remember it's very quiet here- we were in bed by 10/11pm everynight). All activities are far away from each other. If you want to drive to Wailea (for the 4 Seasons & upscale shopping) or Hana (for outdoor sightseeing) , it's b/w an hour or 3 hours drive no matter where u stay in Maui. If I ever come back to Maui, I would not stay at the Hyatt again.

We chose this hotel because we remembered it fondly from 14 years ago when we stayed for our honeymoon and knew they had a great pool area for our children that would not be too deep everywhere. There is a large enough section of the pool that we didn't have to worry constantly about our 6 year old not being able to touch the ground and have found this to be an issue at another major chain in Kaanapali. However, we had our reservations due to the pool restaurant construction as well as the recent reviews. After coming from the Four Seasons in Wailea, my expectations were quite high and I must say that the Hyatt really delivered. First of all the construction of the pool restaurant is not as bad as people have said - they do a good job of making it look presentable - it was not noisy and with 2 kids we spend most of our time on the other side of the pool (it was really a non- issue). There is so much to look at at this resort, that honestly, you won't even think about it. The slide is extremely fun- absolutely MUCH better than any other hotel's slide in Kaanapali - and we have stayed at other places. The hotel elevators were NEVER an issue so they must have corrected that! Every staff member was really courteous, friendly and helpful and they were always out maintaining the grounds. The grounds are still as beautiful as they were years ago and so well maintained - I must say that you really feel like you are in a Hawaiian rainforest (but with Art). The children loved the birds and penguins, the rickety rope bridge as well as the bridges through the gardens. The only thing I would say is that although the rooms are well decorated, the furnture and tiles do need to be refreshed as you can see some scuffs etc. The beauty of this place far outweighs that little negative (which I am sure they will correct ) Overall, if you are looking for a wonderful Hawaiian experience in Kaanapali, definately choose the Hyatt -there is no comparison. I am still floored at how well they kept it up over the last 14 years - it is still so beautiful and you will leave Hawaii with beautiful memories.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFamily Friendly Fun\u201d", "Author": "vlfair", "ReviewID": "UR16438544", "Content": "We just returned from 4 nights at the Maui Hyatt and it was excellent.

My husband enjoyed the big slide, which was conveniently located next to the kids pool. I agree with other reviewers that the beach itself isn't the best in Maui as the waves are a bit bigger, but it turns out my youngest is scared of the waves anyway so we didn't spend much time on the beach.

I had read several previously bad reviews, so I was skeptical about what to expect. People had mentioned that the hotel was old. I have stayed in other hotels like the Disneyland hotel and believe me that was old. I really did not notice the age much as the rooms were clean and in good condition. One of the many things we liked about the hotel was the bed, which is nice and soft without the scratchy sheets. The only problem we had with the room was the slow drain and the private Lanai is really not that private. The view out to the ocean was great except for the last two days when the volcanic fog moved in and limited the view. Parking as others had mentioned can be a problem. After the round a bout coming into the hotel grounds you can take a right for the first self park lot and then a slight left right at the hotel to get to the secondary lot. If these are full prepare for 20.00/night plus tips. We had no real problem except on the last day when some company showed up for meetings. I am a little confused as to parking distance. People complained about walking too far even on the grounds. If your complaining about this your definitely older or in a wheel chair, but why are you there if not to relax? Anyone with minimal physical capability can get around the hotel without too much trouble. Also someone mentioned a bridge without rails going over some water. There are some bridges, but nothing different than what you would see in some landscaped home or park. They are doing construction, so If this bothers you don't go. I really didn't hang out at the pool on a regular basis, but when I was there I did not notice a problem. You can hear it well however outside of your room on the Lanai if you are near the pool. Also if you decide to have breakfast at the hotel make sure it is included in your trip otherwise expect to pay $30.00 per person for a buffet style breakfast. It got old fast after a couple of days since the options change very little. We thought the hotel grounds were nice and they even have little showers right off the beach to rinse off your shoes, feet or yourself. Drink wise I would recommend stopping by Costco near the airport since there are no state run liquor stores you can stock up on some premixed drinks and bring them down to the pool with you. Make sure the containers are plastic. We did not have a problem with seats around the pool. I don't believe things were as busy as with other people. I always looked out onto the pool and there were spots available, but again I can see things being too busy and there were lots of spots with no people, but towels. Used the gym one time.

Lots of seaweed & rolling waves made snorkelling uninspiring and there was a $10 and up charge for lounge chairs & umbrellas in front ot the spa. We spent most afternoons further up Kaanapali beach nearer to the Sheraton at Black Rock snorkelling with turtles. Lounge chairs by the pool seemed to always be occupied by 9am. Windy days meant garbage of all types blowing by and into the pool (drink cups, plastic bottles, pineapple spears etc). We hoped there would be a hospitality suite (such as at the Fairmont Kea Lani in Wailea) to freshen up prior to our late departure but were instead directed to the cramped and unsanitary locker/showers adjacent to the pool where only 1 of the 2 showers were operable. The small ceiling fan did nothing to cool down the room and I left feeling hot & sweaty.

This is the kind of service we have had so far - Excellent! We are on our 30th anniversary so when we checked in with our ocean view rate, we were upgraded to a ocean front room (a Queen & a full size bed) on the 17th floor overlooking the adult pool, for the same price, and a bottle of champagne delivered to our room! What great service! The room is in very good condition, and the beds are excellent to sleep. Be sure and book the sunrise package that includes free breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet is absolutely wonderful, and the view looking out at the landscape with the birds, swans is fantasic. The Hyatt grounds, pools are just like their website pictures - beautiful. All of the staff has been great, smiling, willing to help in anyway. I wonder if they have had intensive customer service training, because everyone is so helpful, but, I have already said that. We are trying to do some fitness routines in the Moana Health club. The facilities have 1st class treadmills with built-in TV. No need to bring your head phones because they furnish sanitized ones daily. Modern weight machines, towels, premium water to drink, sanitized wipes for cleaning the machine handles. Okay, I am getting too wordy, but, this hotel is first class in everyway, and the construction is partitioned off so that is is not a distraction, no noise to worry about either. we walked along the walkway in front of the beach to view the other hotels, at least for the outside, and there is no comparison, Hyatt is the best looking.

Because much of my trip was paid for, and we were there with a group of over 400 winners and guests, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure my experiences were a little different then the average traveler, but I still think there are things I can share that may help others. First, we stayed at the Hyatt Resort on West Maui, a few minutes from Lahaina and within walking distance of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. I was a little apprehensive about what our experiences were going to be at the Hyatt, as I had read multiple negative reviews regarding the property over the past few months. Most of the negative reviews centered on noisy construction around the pool area of a new outdoor restaurant, as well as other comments about the rooms being run down and out dated, and the poor quality of the beach in front of the hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very happy to say, my experiences were quite the opposite! Yes, there is ongoing construction near the pool, of what looks to be an incredible new outdoor restaurant; however, it in no way detracted from my experiences at the hotel or poolside. I heard no extra noises, and they have the construction site nicely boarded up so it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a visual distraction either. Other then sharing the sidewalk at times with crews moving materials to and from the site, it was never an issue. We stayed in the Napili tower on the first floor. Although, at first I was disappointed about not being higher up to get a better view of the ocean, I quickly learned to appreciate the great advantage of being on the first floor. With a walk out patio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were able to walk directly from our room out into the pool/beach area, without having to meander through the hallways to get there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it saved us a lot of time! We also used the self park instead of valet, and the parking lot was just on the other side of the building from our room, so we could step out of the room and circle around the building without having to walk great distances! We never experienced a problem finding space to park. Of course, it meant leaving our sliding door unlocked while we were out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we put all our valuables in the safe and we never had a problem. The rooms themselves were very spacious and nicely decorated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the bed was extremely comfortable, with tons of pillows which is always a huge bonus for my wife! The grounds around the hotel were immaculate and beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with exotic birds (flamingos, cranes, penguins, parrots, etc) scattered throughout! The pool was very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite large and very nicely designed with a section primarily for families with children and another portion primarily populated with adults. Although the pool was normally crowded, we were always able to find chairs for both of us, and we were with two other couples and were often able to eventually get 6 chairs in the same proximity within probably 30 minutes of being at the pool. It was true - the beach directly in front of the hotel itself was fairly small and not real appealing; however, if your main desire is to sit by the beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less then a 50 yards from the hotel starts the gorgeous white sands of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach which stretches nearly a mile or so and is beautiful with ample space to spread out. The employees at the hotel were all extremely friendly and courteous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I did not experience one person that worked there that treated us rudely or acted as if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the restaurants at the hotel, as our group was provided buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner for the 4 days we were there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which overall was very good food!", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "castro valley", "Title": "\u201cMaui Relaxation\u201d", "Author": "cornishblue", "ReviewID": "UR15942592", "Content": "The Hyatt Regency offers a relaxing vacation in a beautiful setting.

We saw Sirius, Saturn and Mars. Absolutely a must do! Another great value is the $15 fee to go into the spa after you check out and your flight isn't until 9PM. The spa treatments are very pricey.

The car valet area is not organized, it takes about 15-20 minutes from the time you hand over your valet ticket to the time the car comes to the front (once the valet has manuveured around the double-parked cars in the cul-de-sac). Exiting the cul-de-sac is also an experience that requires lots of manuveuring as well to avoid hitting the cars on both sides of the road. Also this resort charges an extra $20/night car valet fee (which is not covered by the mandatory $15 resort fee and is not explicitly mentioned unless you ask about it--the $15 resort fee only covers self-parking, but more about that later); however, on the first night, if you take out your car before 11pm and re-park in the self-park area, you will not be charged the $20 fee. -Once you enter the resort, the atrium is nice and has lots of parrots/exotic birds in the vicinity (flamingoes, penguins, yes penguins), lots of tropical plants and flowers, nice view of the ocean and the neighboring island of Lana'i. The public area also has lots of stores and shops to browse in, but nothing worth buying (you can find the same items for less elsewhere and in nearby Whalers Village). But this is just about the only nice area throughout the resort, everything else is downhill from there. 2) PARKING (1 star) - Self-parking is available in 2 main lots, but their parking lots are small, and one of the lots has about half of the spaces reserved for beach goers only (no hotel guests allowed), and another 20% of it blocked off by construction debris. This lot unfortunately is also the one that we needed to park in as the other one was too far away to park in, but the catch is that you have to either come back by 3pm or come after 8pm in order to find space, as both self-parking lots are used by visitors coming into their nightly lu'aus, and so, there will not be any space for you if you come back to the hotel between those hours. Basically it forces you to valet at the hotel, which is very upsetting (it's very obvious that their valet lot is quite large compared to either of the self-park lots, despite what their resort map shows). I got so upset one day after not finding space at 4:45pm in the afternoon in either self-parking lots that we drove to nearby Whalers Village, bought some food/drink there ($15 minimum), stayed there for 3 hours, and had the car validated and drove back to the hotel at 7:45pm to find a parking space. 3) ROOMS (2 star) - The resort has 3 main towers, we stayed in the tower close to the lu'au and ballroom area. We requested the \"Terrace View\" room with king-size bed, and the first room they gave us was barely 5 feet away from the elevator area, and was very noisy. Room condition was not good, looked very dark and dirty, bathroom condition was a bit better, but the room was small, and their version of \"terrace view\" was a view of the rooftop of the ballroom and air-conditioner area! There was a small balcony where you can sit, but it was so dirty that we were sure no one really ever sat there since it looked very dusty and the a/c unit was just outside the room. Also, the sliding doors looked like they were about falling apart, and I noticed there was a cockroach on the window! After spending a few minutes opening the rotting sliding doors and shooing it out, we decided not to stay in this room and requested a room change. Front desk claimed that there were no other rooms with king-size beds available (?), and that these rooms were the \"largest\" of the rooms they have available, so my wife and I opted for a room with a 1-queen and 1-double bed on the same floor but further down the corridor. This room had the same awful view, but at least was not as close to the a/c unit and was less noisy. Sliding door was not as bad, but still horrible. The room was actually brighter and looked cleaner, and appeared bigger than the one with the king-size bed, so I think they were trying to discourage us from getting this room (since we were only 2 people). The downside is that there was less closet space, and the bathroom was designed for wheelchair-access, but it was clean and big. 4) ELEVATORS (1 star) Their elevator system needs a complete overhaul, their elevators are ridicously slow, and out of 3 possible elevators, it always seemed that the same one was working in our tower (even though there were no out-of-order signs on any of the other two elevators). Fortunately we stayed on the 3rd floor \"terrace\", so it was a short walk down to the lobby, but it was unacceptable for a resort of this size and rating. It seemed like our tower was not the only one that had elevator problems though, as on the day we left we started seeing some workers fixing elevators in other towers (but we wonder how long it took for them to get to those elevators). 5) DOCTORS OFFICE (0 stars, negative if possible) After hiking in Kaua'i, my wife had a couple of mosquito bites on both legs that had swollen to more than a quarter-size width, and looked like it was spreading and had gotten very red and tender to the touch, so we decided to call the in-house doctor's office from our room one night. It was 8:45pm, and the guest services book in the room stated that the doctor's office was available every day until 9:00pm in the evening. She called the office, and asked if there was a doctor available, and before she can tell them of her condition, she was immediately cut off saying that they were \"closing\". She tried asking one more time, saying that she wanted to get some information, and yet again, she got another \"we're closing\" response! Unbelievable. I mean, I understand that we are on \"Hawai'i\" time here, but I think it's rude and unacceptable for a doctor's office to refuse service to anyone that may need it, especially if they call within the advertised doctor's office hours. Otherwise, what is the purpose of having a on-site doctor's office? After that phone call, I rumaged through my toiletries and found some antibiotic ointment and cream and tried rubbing it on her bite marks, and fortunately, after several applications over the next few days, the marks reduced in size and eventually healed themselves. But it was definitely NO THANKS to the so-called doctor's office at this Hyatt!!! 6) POOL AREA (1.5 star) - This was very disappointing, as their pool area is a joke. For a 5-star resort (as they claim to be), the pool area felt crowded, pool chairs were crammed into every available space possible, with barely enough room to walk around. Plus they had sectioned off an area of the pool surroundings for construction of a new restaurant (hence lots of construction noise which they tried to cover up by hiring musicians singing cover songs during the daytime). Even with all the pool chairs there, all of them were claimed to be \"occupied\", meaning each and every one of them had a towel on them, even though 90% of them did not have anyone sitting on them. The pool did not look that full either. This was the case for EACH OF THE 6 DAYS we were there. On one day, my wife and I finally found a spot on the outer fringes of the resort (on a narrow and crowded strip of lawn between the walkway to/from Whalers Village and the hotel's stretch of K'aanapali beach--also another joke, more on that later). On another day, we settled on getting just one chair closer by (after we saw one person leaving that area). Lots of guests around us were complaining about \"chair-hogging\" as well, as it is listed as their policy of removing beach towels from chairs not occupied for more than an hour, but it was obvious that the staff was not enforcing it. 7) KA'ANAPALI BEACH (0.5 stars) - Hyatt must have drawn the short end of the stick when they selected this site on the beach, as they had the least amount of beachfront than the other resorts along the beach. The water laps just right up to the small 3ft cliff containing the lawn area, some spots have about 3 ft of beach sand, but no, this is not what I think of when I think of \"beach access\". Sure, there is a slightly larger strip of beach south of the main resort and pool area, but it's also considered a public area, so it's visited by the public as well. But as you walk up the walkway behind the resorts and walk towards Whalers Village, you see that the beach front immediately opens and other hotels/resort complexes have larger beach areas for wading, sitting, playing volleyball, etc. I'm giving it 0.5 stars as beaches are natural and the resort cannot control the look and shape of a beach, but the hotel should have compensated by providing a much larger pool area. Even the Marriott further up (which has a nice big beach) also seemed to have a larger and nicer pool area than ours (and I thought they were rated lower than this hotel). As we came to Hawai'i for our honeymoon, we were expecting a certain level of quality and service in a resort, and in Kauai, after staying in the Grand Hyatt, we were extremely pleased. My wife and I are not particularly picky about staying in nice hotels (our main concerns are cleanliness and safety), and we are well-travelled, and experienced hotels in every spectrum, but given how much $$ we are spending on our honeymoon, we expected a certain level of quality and service, as the per-night charge for Hyatt in Maui was the same price as the one in Kauai, but as we found out, Maui is an entirely different beast of an island altogether (more tourist-oriented, people are less friendly, items are more expensive, places are more crowded). If you are a potential honeymooner, then I would suggest avoiding Hyatt Regency Maui and instead go for one of the resorts in Wailea or Kihei, they appear to be less crowded but may be more $$ (but hey, you're spending it on your honeymoon, a once-in-a-lifetime event).", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "st. ignace, mi", "Title": "\u201cHyatt is Not Worth It.......\u201d", "Author": "imthei", "ReviewID": "UR14796083", "Content": "Grounds, Pool and Tennis Courts were great but overall this place is badly overpriced.

They are currently constructing/remodeling the poolside restaurant. At first, it was merely a minor eyesore and the sound of small tractors working during the day. We thought it strange they would undertake a major project like that during the busy Spring Break period, but we're pretty easy going and decided to just try to ignore it. It turns out that the majority of the week we had to endure the constant noise of jack hammers breaking up cement or volcanic rock- not sure what... but it was deafening when you were at the pool, and loud even in our 10th floor hotel room with the door closed. I complained to the manager and he gave a weak apology and offered us a paltry $200 credit toward our $5000 hotel bill. I've noticed Marriott clearly explains construction plans and possible noise on their websites so that guests can be informed in advance. Hyatt chooses not to do so, and then offers insulting compensation for a ruined week in paradise. Also, one out of the three main elevators was out of service the entire week we were there. We occasionally saw people working on it, but it never operated the whole time we were there. This sometimes made for a long wait for the elevator. We were traveling with my elderly mother who uses a mobility scooter. Technically the hotel is handicap accessible, but they could do much to make things easier. The pull up valet parking area is very busy and we often felt unsafe as we tried to load and unload mom and her equipment. The valets insist on backing all the cars up to the curb and the ramp areas were sometimes blocked by parked cars. Once on the grounds of the hotel, it was very difficult to figure out where ramps and walkways were located that would enable her to reach the different levels of the grounds. It would be very helpful if they would create some kind of map our guide to the hotel for handicapped visitors and guests. The grounds, view and setting of this hotel are beautiful.

And yes, the construction was loud and distracting. Believe it or not, the list actually goes on, but this review is already getting too long. To their credit, the hotel did provide a $500 credit for my stay there, as well as a bottle of champagne and strawberries (even though the $500 credit would have been eaten up by the $500 golf trip I never took, had I not paid careful attention to the bill). Contrast to my experience at the Westin the year before: Upon arrival, we were upgraded to their luxury oceanfront suite with three private balconies, a dining table, two LCD tvs, two bathrooms (one which was the size of the entire Hyatt suite)--this was all for half the price I paid for the \"suite\" at the Hyatt. Never ever had a problem with any stains on our linens, much less bloodstains. The service was absolutely impeccable, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left--we had a very late flight back to Chicago (9 p.m.), the hotel provided us with a free room to stay in until we left for the airport. The beach was perfect and rock free--the water is as clear as you can imagine. And Tropica--our FAVORITE restaurant in Maui (and yes, we did visit the famed Mama's Fish House). I brought two young cousins with my on my trip, one of whom was only 14 years old and had never been to Maui before. It was rather heartbreaking for me to have to keep glossing over the glaring deficiencies of the Hyatt in order to ensure that she had the \"dream\" vacation she was promised. In sum, despite spending enough money to rack up enough points for a free stay on my next visit to Maui, the staff at the Hyatt can rest assured that I will forego any free stay there and invest all of my future trips at the Westin (I intend to come back to Maui every year), where I was treated as though I was spending $1000 a night, even though I was spending half that amount.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SanDiego", "Title": "\u201cBuyer Beware- Service awful and Rooms need a Renovation\u201d", "Author": "mjax", "ReviewID": "UR14741994", "Content": "My wife and two kids travel to Maui every year during the spring break. We have stayed at the Hyatt the last two years. This year we stayed from March 20 through March 28 and encountered many problems. They are listed below. We booked our room and the hotel never disclosed that the pool area reatuarant was under construction. The sound of the jake hammers beginning at 9am was a real treat. The temporary bar set up is a joke. 1. At check in on March 20, the hotel apparently overbooked rooms with two beds and we were given a room with a king bed and sofa sleeper. Survice to say sleeping on sofa sleeper is not the experience you expect, nor was it very comfortable. It was also evident that many other guests were experiencing the same problem as you could hear many guests complaining in the lobby. The room was located in the Regency tower facing the 30 highway, much to noisy as we sleep with the slider open and do not use the a/c. Instead of hearing waves crash on the beach we heard the sounds of cars and mopeds buzzing up and down the 30. We paid $656.00 per night, We expected a quite ocean view room that we could call home for seven days. 2. March 21- The hotel agrees to move us to another room with two beds. We leave other belongings and make the trek to Hana. On our return we find our belongings in our new room with two beds. The only problem was that this room was facing the noisy 30 highway. \" Was nobody listening\" When we asked to be away from the noisy freeway? Anyway we spend another night in a room that did not meet our expecations. 3. March 22- My wife is so tired of switching rooms she talks with management who reluctantly switches us to the Napilli tower. The room is quite and has two beds. After spending two full days securing a room we notice that the elevators are not working throughout the property and we spend much of our time waiting for elevators and taking the stairs. 4. We try room service on Saturday night March March 22, nobody answers the phone so we call the operator who in turn calls room service for us. Moments later the operator calls us in our room and states that she can not get any one to answer as well. We go down to Spats and ask for a Pizza for take out and they state they do not do take out.

Service at this hotel has slipped, the attitude of the employees at the desk and at valet will confirm this, especially if you need a problem resolved. The rooms are in need of a renovation.

When we arrived in Maui airport we discovered that there was a Huge fire on the island, which meant that we couldn't get to our hotel for the first night! We had to stay in a shelter, which was not an ideal start to our romantic honeymoon. By the time we got to the Hyatt we just wanted luxury, and we wasn't disappointed. The staff were absolutely lovely. Welcoming us with flowers, chocolate strawberries and sparkling wine, it made up for the misfortune of our first night. The beaches there are stunning, and surprisingly quiet. The pool area is great, sometimes a bit busy but good on the whole. The lobby area of the hotel is a beautifully decorated garden. Location-wise, the hotel is a very scenic 20 minute walk from the whalers village, such a nice walk that we did it every day! On the negative side, we found the restaurants in the hotel to be average in quality and over-priced, and cocktails and other drinks can be extortionate. Having said that, the buffet breakfast is one of the best i've ever had, with a fantastic array of breakfast from all over the world. Again though, this is very expensive, we were lucky we had breakfast included in the price! Also, when we got back home, we discovered that the hotel had reimbursed us for the first night we missed without us asking, which we thought was great as it was not the hotels fault.

I had to cross a bridge that had no handrails and my legs gave out. I fell off the bridge and into the duck pond. My knees are stilled messed up a year later.

We traveled with a corporate group of 350 people. I have read other reviews of this resort prior to our trip on Trip Advisor as well. I have to agree with the comments and observations on the aging of the hotel rooms. They could use a makeover, however, the beds are extremely comfortable. The overall cleanliness of the room was okay. The popcorn ceiling had stains on it (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask policy on this one). The bathroom was clean but tired looking. The view from our 7th floor Lahaina tower room was spectacular. We saw so many whales off our balcony we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign up to go whale watching! We were not upset with the rooms because we were in MAUI! Who spends time in the rooms anyway? Honestly we saw the rooms in the early mornings, at dinner time to shower and at bed time. The staff were very, very friendly and helpful. The lobby area is incredible and beautiful. The overall impression of the hotel property is almost overwhelming. The Hyatt has the best property on the Island, with the exception of South Maui, Four Seasons or the Grand Wailea Resort perhaps. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel personal and upkeep of the grounds. The Restaurants were okay, not really worth the money. If you go to Lahaina town I have two strong recommendations. One is to book a show at Warren & Annabelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Magic show. This is a must!! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps the most entertaining, funny 4 hours my wife I have ever spent. The other is to eat at Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They have the best food, especially Prime Rib and FRESH fish. We also ate at many other restaurants in Lahaina as well, but we went back to Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Watch out for the Thousands of art galleries that line Front Street in Lahaina Town. Did you ever wondered where all of the used car salesmen go when they retire? We saw some beautiful art pieces, both paintings and sculptures. I wish we could buy all that we liked but that would be impossible. The negative aspect of gallery looking is the harassment of most, not all, of the sales persons. We looked at a bronze sculpture of an African women. I think the gallery was asking $8,600.00. Within the first 10 minutes of entering the store the salesman was closing the deal. The first offer is cheap wine followed by make me an offer and give me your credit card to show the gallery owner you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sincere. 10 minutes of entering the gallery! We had to leave the gallery. This was experienced at most of the galleries we entered. Do rent a car and do the drive to Hana. If you are not comfortable with windy small lane roads maybe don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the drive but take one of the many small bus tours. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it. The best way I can describe the experience is imagine turning your steering wheel back and forth all the way about 1200 times there and another 1200 times back. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crazy. We left on a Sunday morning around 7:00AM. We had the road to ourselves but coming back we saw the traffic heading our direction. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 60 one lane sections of the road and most go to one lane on the turns! Watch out for the locals that drive this road daily.

The plants and balinese and thai sculptures were incredible. Right ON the ocean. We only had to look out on the horizon and concentrate for a few moments to see whales spouting, breaching and tail slapping. I had heard horror stories about the prices in Hawaii and although they were very high, I found them no higher than the resorts I had stayed at in Naples, FL and Indian Wells, Ca. Resorts are expensive. If you want to save money, eat outside the hotel. The pool is separated into essentially a kids side and adult side by a grotto cave bar complete with waterfalls at both ends. The girls stayed on the kids side the entire time as it had sand, fountains and a suspended bridge with the coup de grace being the water slide. We had the buffet at Sonz twice, very spendy at 29.95 adult, 14.95 cchild but was an extensive and well done buffet. A gorgeous stroll down the boardwalk took you to the Whalers Village shopping and restaurants and Kaanapalli beach. The cabanas were 40.00 a day (I have stayed at Resorts that charge $150) and if you waited until 1:00pm they were $25.00, this comes with a bowl of pineapple and a pitcher of ice water (refilled frequently). The hotel has lots of shops and art galleries and even has a Macys. The restaurants in Lahaina I would recommend are: Moose Mcguillicudy's - huge breakfast and well priced dinners, aroun the corner is a kiosk with brochures, look for coupons there. Longhi's was great for breakfast, but although the view at sunset upstairs for dinner was incredible, the food was a bit disappointing all Ala Carte and pricey. A tiny little restaurant on 505 Front Street called Hecocks had a great cheap breakfast and friendly waitstaff. They gave us the big sneak tip, eat dinner there at 6:30 and you overlook the Feast At Lele lua for free. It was great. ABC stores were good for souvenirs and they are everywhere. Goofey foot had good Surf lesson rates and Island Spice was a good spot to buy some T-shirts and talk to the local healer. Pacific-O, very pricey but excellent food. Hula Grill on Kaanapalli had great food and a great staff. We were told to bring our snorkel gear but I regret hauling it around as I noted many surf shops rent for about 20.00 a week! On the beach at Kaanapalli it was 24.95 for a few hours!

I booked the room using points. At the time I booked, standard/garden view rooms were going for $388 with a AAA rate. I figured we would probably get something generic since we were not actually paying for the room. I was pleasantly surprised though at check-in. We received a very nice upgrade to a partial oceanview on the top floor of the Napili tower. The room was fantastic and the view was even better. We were really blown away here, as we really had a great view of the ocean. The grounds of the resort are very nicely manicured. The African cranes, penguins, and parrots were really cool too. My favorite was \"Roger\", who would say Hello as you walked by. If you walked by with luggage, he would say Goodbye and wave his foot. This was really something! The pool was very nice and the water was warm. It was somewhat crowded on one day we were there, but the hotel staff seemed to do a pretty good job of making sure people did not save seats for the entire day. Other than this one time, we never had a problem getting choice seats. We did play golf at the Ka'anapali Golf Resort. It is right across the street and there is a free shuttle from the Hyatt. Note that in the packet of brochures you receive at check-in, there is a golf brochure with a COUPON for either 20% off of Merchandise in the pro shop or a Free Club Rental. My fiancee brought her clubs and played here just once. I also spent about $100 in the pro shop. Of course, I didn't notice the coupon til after we got back to the room after our round, so I lost out. Don't make the same mistake I made!!! We went to the Drums of the Pacific Luau on the resort property. It was a great show and I highly recommend it, especially if you are staying at the resort! The food was average. I had heard the luau at Old Lahaina Luau was great, but this was more convenient for us, especially since we did not have a car. Definitely no regrets on this though. In terms of breakfast, we did not have the buffet package. We figured we would still try it out once though. For the two of us, it came to about $70 with tax and tip. It's not bad for free, but I have been to many buffets that have been much better. The views are great! It's worth at least one trip to check it out, especially if you are really hungry. That is about it though. For our other breakfast, we just ate at the Weeping Banyan Cafe. That was $18 for the two of us, and just as good, considering we really are not big on breakfast. Normally, I would expect a Hyatt brand resort or hotel to check in with 4 stars. If I am honest though, I have to admit that I really cannot find any reason not to give them 5 Stars! Pretty much everything was perfect. The only negative was that we had signed up for the Couples Tour of the Stars with the Champagne and Chocolate Covered Strawberries. On the night we were scheduled, it was very windy and cloudy, and the tour had to be cancelled. There is not much the hotel can do about weather though!

I always read trip advisor reviews before booking any trip and value the information so decided it was time to write one of my own. There were 8 adults and 1 two year old vacationing. We had 4 king rooms in the same tower but we were on two different floors. It would have been nicer if we could have all been on the same floor but at least two families were close together. We did finally get two rooms joining which helped with the toddler being able to have a little more roaming room. The only problem we incurred was we were to have all king rooms and upon arrival one of the roooms was double beds. They could not find another king room that day in the same tower so that family had to wait until the next day to be moved. I do have a concern that we booked this a year in advance with this request and they apparently do not take into consideration any of that when selecting rooms. I will agree with all the other reviews in that the furniture is very niched up. They were remodeling the lobby floor while we were there including painting and carpet. There were some workers during the day but it appeared much of work was done during the night. The grounds are beautiful and my daughter and I walked down the beach through many of the other hotel grounds and we felt we made the best hotel choice. There is a kids pool area and our grandson loved being there. Many days we could not get him off the water slide. The beach is small but room for our grandson to play in the sand. The wider part of the beach if at the other end by the Sheraton. We walked there one day but our family enjoys the pools. We never had any days where we could not find enough pool chairs for the entire family. We always liked to be by one of the trees for shade so the baby could nap out of the sun and we all could still enjoy the sun and pool. The breakfast at Swan Court is very good. Like any other buffet many of the choices are the same daily but they did try and have a few different times on it. Our rooms were booked with breakfast for two included (Sunshine special). The pool side restaurant had good choices and family visited frequently. Whaler Village is a nice walk down the beach and we visited the shops and restaurants there also. Great shopping so allow some time one day for this. Some of our group didn't realize all that was there and on the last day before flights were rushing to get some shopping in. We also went to Front Street on several nights and there is a nice selection of restaurants there also. Go early as they all have long wait times during the dinner hours. With a little one waiting didn't always work for us. As far as parking we always just went to the back of the hotel by the luau entrance and even with two cars we always found a parking spot and there are elevators in that lower lobby area which made taking a stroller up very easy. Our daughter had read about the natural pool in one of the booklets and four of us ventured off to it. We all had a blast. You have to climb down some rocks to get there and even grandma made it down and back up. Since this was a anniversary trip I wanted family photos and we did this with the photographer that was at the hotel and we had a great experience. You can get all the pictures on a CD and they even made four so each family could take one back.

The beach area is small in front but 30 yards to the right in front of the spa area is fine and big. We never had a problem getting a lounger at pool on the days when it wsnt raining and here in lies the problem. Once it is raining there is actually nothing to do but eat and drink. We were there during really bad weather when it was recommended we dont even leav the hotel for our own safety. Now i know the weather is beyond the hotels control but amenities are something they can fix. Fot example i knew in advance of the resort charge for tennis etc. but how can they charge for these if it is physically impossible to use them on their recommendation. For the money they charge they could easily fit in there huge grounds a covered pool and sports area. Roomwise the rooms were lovely just a little worn little scratches here and there.(no lcd tv for $600 a night???)

When we went to use our credit card in few shops it was declined as our bank thought it was being misused as a $300 charge twice appeared half way across the world. thankfully they remedied this by removed a lot of our in room charges. Whatever u do make sure u get the breakfast included in your package.(what a breakfast!!!) Every morning we started with cereal, then a buffet grill and an omlette then a pastry or muffin. you wont have to eat til dinner again. We only eat dinner once in the hotel on S'onz our final night and it was the best meal i ate on the entire holiday in all three locations. Overall with a little tlc and a slight reduction in price this place could be brilliant and headng towards 5 star but until then 4 out of five but it is still the best in the area.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGood...not great\u201d", "Author": "dannykiv", "ReviewID": "UR12849761", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt January 11-18th. We were on the third (and final) leg of our honeymoon and had just come from the Grand Hyatt in Kauai. While I tried not to compare the two hotels, it makes it easier to notice the subtle differences that would have made this hotel a 5. Pros: We stayed in the Napili tower (from the lobby you go to the right). (FYI -there are three tower - the Center one is the Atrium and it has the lobby, one to the left (if you are in the lobby looking at the ocean) is the Lahaina tower, and the one to the right is the Napili tower. We stayed in a Partial Ocean view - and in my opinion they could have sold it as an ocean view -- room 808. (we checked out some partial ocean views in the Atrium tower - not as nice a view). The wildlife is fantastic -- there are 5 penguins, 2 african cranes, and number of flamingos and swans! Hands down the best part! Service was always friendly and accommodating -- although not always competent. Food (has both pros and cons - so I gave it its own category) Meals were great. I especially likes Son'z. It isnt cheap, but the drinks were STRONG and the waiter was good. You can share any meal w/o a charge -- and its big enough for two. For example -- My wife and i split the mahi-mahi which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. we each got our own plate with a potatoes veggies and a pc of fish. We ate twice at Cascades and it is ok, although like everything, overpriced. The biggest con is the fruit flies -- especially at the buffet breakfast. While all the food tasted good. To me there is something disgusting about seeing flies over everything - including the plates. I did ask a waiter about this and she said it should get better in a couple of months. Had I directly paid for the breakfast I would have been irrate! (but i didn't -so i just grabbed boxes of cereal and was happy) Cons: Nothing that negative, but the person at the front desk was new -- so she had absolutely no authority. When i inquired about upgrading rooms, she had to keep going in the back to find out the answer. I just dont get why that person in the back wouldnt come out. The resort fee is ridiculous. There are 0 amenities actually included with it (unlike in Kauai where at least to valet parking is free). It's actually kind of insulting that they list a newspaper and in-room coffee as stuff you get for the free-- when its free for Gold (basic) Passport members! (valet parking is $12/night -- come on!) The So-So's: The pool was ok, but not that impressive. The water slide is a nice touch, but if you are in beautiful hawaii why make it a completely inclosed dark tunnel? The lounges by the pool are comfortable, but you will get to know your neighbor VERY well since they are so close to one another. The artwork throughout the lobby is mismatched and some what in disrepair. (I took the art and garden tour of the hotel --not worth the 20mins -- and the guide pointed it out). Valuable tip -- There are two convenience stores inside the hotel (Lamonts) and you can get a bottle of soda there for $2 while its 3.50 at the pool. You can also buy single bottles of beer there for 2.50 - instead of the $6-7 at the pool. Just pour it into a cup and you will be fine. Think about -- you can drink 3x as much for the same cost (plus no need to tip anyone). Overall If they clean up there act a bit -- this could easily be a primo resort.

I wrote a review to that one too if you are interested. The hotel is on Kaanapali beach. A 10 minute drive to Lahania and Front Street. Upon arrival we were escorted to the front desk. Since it also happed to be my birthday they gave us a Hawaiian style photo album. Really nice touch. The grounds are beautiful with tropical flowers and nice landscaping, birds, fish ponds, flamingoes, penguins. We got an ocean front room in the atrium tower (middle one). It was ocean front indeed. It felt like you could touch the ocean. The balconies are very small. Just enough room for 2 chairs and a small table. The beach is very narrow, in some places not even wide enough for a beach towel. I guess that's why they put a lot of money into the pool. The pool was huge. It had waterfalls, water slide, caves, pool side bar. Not actually a swim up. They had lots of chairs some with canopies so you didn't have to roast in the sun if you didn't want to. They were so close together and they were pretty full each day. They had women serve drinks and food to you chair. The breakfast which was included was similar to the breakfast at the Hyatt in Kauai. It had anything you could want. There was something there for everyone. We ate at the sushi and steak restaurant (i forget the name) for my birthday dinner. I really liked it because I like sushi and and husband won't touch it. he's a steak lover. The next night we had champagne and fruit delivered to the room. The fruit actually made me sick later in the night. I think it may have been the yogurt dip. We got a couples massage next to the beach. It was ok. I would have liked it if the huts were futher away from the people lounging by the pool. The spa in Kauai was way nicer. All in all we enjoyed out time at the Hyatt in Maui.

It's a bit of a drive to get to Lahaina and Front Street shopping area. The beach is almost non-existent in front of the hotel. If you walk along down a ways the beach will widen, but I was not impressed with Ka'anapali Beach at all, after having been in Oahu and seeing some of the gorgeous beaches there, this did not compare beauty-wise. The hotel was very crowded which is probably normal at this time of year. We stayed in Oahu from 12/22 to 12/28 and Maui from 12/28 to 1/2/08. But the service was not good for the amount of money I had to shell out to stay at this place! First of all, you CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT get a chair at their wonderful pool area unless you high tail it down there at 7 a.m. to get a towel and throw it on a chair. I never would do this because I thought it was not fair if I was not going to be at the pool to \"save\" chairs. But everyone else in the joint seemed to. We would arrive at the pool at 8:00 am only to find every pool chaise, chair, table covered with the Hyatt's blue/white stripe towels, but somehow the people would not be anywhere in site! On my last day, I had had enough and asked about this and asked if a cabana boy would find my family some chairs. They tried, but had no luck. They told me they would start \"tagging\" chairs every hour and when chairs were unattended, even if they had a towel, they would clear the chair and make it available for other customers use. I actually saw the first round of the \"tagging\" which consisted of a note left on select chaise lounge chairs. Notes that were blowing away with the trade winds because they were not secured in any way to the chairs. I saw one round of this and never saw any cabana boys or employees remove the towels and make them available to others. I cannot stress to you how many people were doing this. Securing chairs early in the morning and they may or may not even show up until later in the afternoon! It was madness! The Hyatt has probably the biggest and most popular pool in Maui, but it was such a shame to not be able to enjoy it because there is NO WHERE to go to sit when you want to lay out or get out of the pool and soak up the sun. This is my first complaint. Second...Don't eat at Cascades in the hotel. Service was awful. We had reservations and pretty much got right in at our assigned time. No problem. Getting waited on was a different matter. Our waiter never greeted us, never took a drink order (we had to only drink water that was given to us by the greeter). He delivered our food to the table and that was THE ONLY time we saw him. No, \"can I get you anything else? How's the food? How about dessert?\" NOTHING! We finally asked for our ticket after he never came back and complained to the manager who promptly credited our hotel account for the dinner. This is a $$$ restaurant (our meal was $127 with no drinks and for two people!) I was pleased that the management was so eager to remedy the situation, but I would never recommend the restaurant. We also had room service from Spats (also in the Hyatt Regency). Food was good, but very small portions and very pricey as well. Would not recommend eating there either. Try to get out of this hotel to eat. This is very hard considering Lahaina is several miles down the road and there is not much else in Ka'anapali except pricey hotels and their own restaurants. A note on the aloha experience....Since Waikiki was our first stop we found it to be a very friendly place. We stayed at the ResortQuest Waikiki Beach Hotel which I will review separately. The staff there were amazing! We commented each day on how friendly everyone was, even the people working in the ABC stores (which are on every block in Waikiki) and even the workers in the International Marketplace. There was a BIG difference in how friendly people were in Oahu vs. Maui. I had big expectations for Maui because I had always heard it was so beautiful! it is beautiful, but it did not live up to my expectations and in my opinion the beaches don't compare to Oahu. If you are looking for a resort community with not a lot to do then this is your place. My last comment will be with Pacific Whale Foundation's L'anai/molokini crater snorkeling tour. We booked two days in advance and it happened to be raining the day of our tour. No big deal right? WRONG. Don't go if it is raining. You will waste your money snorkeling because it mixes up the water and you will not have good visibility. The trip should have been cancelled, but Pacific Whale Foundation did not cancel it. They did not tell us until we were ON THE BOAT that we would not be able to go to Molokini Crater because of the weather. What a let down. Also, there is no \"seeing\" L'anai either because they don't dock at a beach. They took us to an alternate spot called Shark Fin Cove (which I later found in my Hawaii books listed as not a good snorkeling spot). It was not a good spot. Low visibility. Very bad weather. Okay, now the trip back to Maui took over 2 hours! Apparently the channel between Lanai and Maui was rough (so the captain said) and they told us it would be a little bit more bumpy coming back. A little bumpy does not describe this! It was MISERABLE. I have never gotten sea sick or motion sick in all of my life! and I was sick and so were about half the people there. People were holding trash bags and filling them up! It was very scary. 6-8 foot waves which meant we were crashing on the waves about 10-12 feet. I will never use them again. Like I said, they should have cancelled the trip!

We were disappointed with most things here. 1. We were in a room in the Napiili tower. The hallways, carpets and elevators seem quite old and not very well cleaned. The elevators were also having some maintenance done, slow to respond. 2. The room smelled like smoke even though it was supposed to be a king non-smoking. It was very large, no complaints there. But again old-ish carpeting and furniture. It suits a Days Inn or something, not an expensive Hyatt (we paid ~250 a night on priceline). I haven't seen a curved screen CRT TV in a looong time and was surprised to find one in the room! Not even a flat screen CRT, that is the norm in any decent hotel now, if not LCD/Plasma. 3. The resort fee is compulsory and an absolute waste. Everyone has cell phones now, who needs unlimited local dialing ? How many people play tennis on a vacation, especially if the court is at the other end of the hotel grounds. All the more frustrating because at our stay the previous two nights at Marriott Waikoloa, the resort fee included daily mai tai's for two, and half-day snorkeling rentals. The resort fee here is a complete sham. 4. No fee for parking, phew. At Marriott Waikoloa we paid $7 a day. 5. The location. It is on the Ka'anapali beach alright. But it is at one corner of the beach. And this corner is no good. There are small rocks, you can't really swim or snorkel near the shore. The sand isn't very soft and clean. This beach is only good for walks. 1 mile up near the Sheraton the beach becomes really nice. So if you're looking for a romantic beach to relax at, this ain't it. 6. Worst of all, crowds. This is a large hotel, Vegas-style. They have all kinds of creatures and birds and stuff, so family oriented. But it was pretty crowded this time of year. There is one large pool and that has loads of people in it. In the afternoon it takes quite a while to find chairs. It has only one whirlpool and that is just ridiculous for so many rooms. That whirlpool/jacuzzi/spa is always crowded and you don't really feel like relaxing there with 15 other people. The facilities are just not adequate and enough for the number of guests they have. All in all, we were very dissappointed especially considering our stay at Marriott Waikoloa was splendid. I would highly recommend the Big Island over Maui due to crowds. The Big Island was way more peaceful with lots of nice beaches. While you're in Maui though, make sure you go down to the beaches in the south. Makena's big beach was awesome fun with clear water and nice waves breaking 5 feet from the shore. Wailea also seemed a nice beach, calmer than Makena. The road trip to Hana was not at all worth it. Driving all the way on that frustrating highway to see a few pools was quite a waste. Also try making the Haleakala summit at sunrise.

Since they have not responded, I am publishing an honest review of our actual experience. My Partner and I vacationed in Maui from Nov. 10 through Nov. 16 at the Hyatt Resort on the Kanapali coast near Lahaina. First, when we checked in between 7 pm and 7:30 pm on our first night, they did not have our King bed available. The front desk told us they would put us on a waiting list for a King room and for checking in that night they would put us in a queen and full-bed room with an upgraded partial ocean view room. After eating, it was dark so we pulled the curtains and went to bed. To our utter amazement, the front desk neglected to tell us that our \"upgraded\" partial ocean front view was blocked by a construction crane that stood taller than the hotel and that roofing material would be hauled right past our balcony. There was no warning of construction and no warning that we would receive such a bad room. I called the front desk the morning that I saw and HEARD the crane and found out they were repairing the roof and asked very politely to be switched. I asked them to please transfer us to the king room. The front desk stated that they would call us as one became available, but none were. I called everyday for 3-days until more than halfway through our 5-night vacation, they transferred us. We spent sizeable sum of money at the Hyatt that week, using the Spa for multiple appointments, eating in all of the hotel restaurants, and when we checked out, saw our bill, and there was not even a courtesy credit for the rooms, my partner told me not to ruin our vacation and just write a complaint letter after we leave.

It has a great luau called Drums of the Pacific. It has a tour desk, and it's on a pretty nice stretch of Kaanapali Beach.

Grounds are beautiful, include open space, and not overly crowded like the resorts further down Kaanapali. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Shampoo/lotion smell great! The not so good: We booked two rooms, in April, and had to get two oceanviews in order to have the kids next door. When we got there they tried to put them on different floors. If we wanted to be separated, I could have booked them cheap garden view rooms! After 15 minutes of insisting that it couldn't be done, miraculously they were able to do it. Be persistent! The non optional \"resort fee\" was $15 per day/per room. We did not use the fitness center, or the tennis, and the inroom coffee was terrible, so we paid $150 over five days to receive daily Maui newspapers. They should make it optional or just charge more for the room! Beach is not good near the hotel. Rocky and tiny. Marriott beach was no better. Spa full of small children and not very warm.

I admit a bias toward high end resorts and new properties, and it is with this perspective that I feel this property has been neglected from a renovation standpoint. Example: We stayed at the Ritz last year, and while it was nicer than the Hyatt, it is closed this year for renovations. The rooms are OK, but just OK. The main pool area is crowded with lounge chairs, and low on staff and service. The kids pool is nice for the kids, and our daughter enjoyed it immensely. The luau had some really great performances, but it is poorly organized, with long waits in line for seating, and long waits for the buffet line.

This was a 3 year anniversary gift to ourselves. The following is a pro/con list of our experience: Pros - Very friendly service, we felt that each employee at the resort truly had our best interests in mind. - Great pool - Kaanapali beach \"boardwalk\" for walking up and down the Kaanapali coast, visiting other resorts, restaurants, and the Whaler's Village shops - Our room (terrace view) turned out to have quite a nice view of the ocean if you walk out on the porch... or maybe I should say the Lanai? ;-) - Kaanapali location is very close to many restaurants, shopping areas, and activities. Lahaina is only a 5 minute drive away and has loads of these amenities. Cons - Pool was VERY crowded, which makes it difficult to find 2 lounge chairs next to each other. We had the best luck by getting towels right before breakfast and using them to save 2 chairs by the pool and then coming back after eating. - We were awakened 3 separate nights during our stay by construction in the Macy's store in the lobby/atrium area. Our room was on the 14th floor which is actually the first floor up from the lobby. Workers in the store were nailing up drywall at 1:00AM on these nights! We woke up to the sound of pounding nails. I stepped outside the front door to try and determine the source of the ruckus. I was joined by a few of our neighbors. We all called the front desk and asked if they could shut down the construction. The front desk employees were very nice and knew of the noise and put an end to it within 10 or 15 minutes. But the question I kept asking myself is who approved hammering nails into drywall at 1am while guests are trying to sleep?? Notes - Since I was paying the travel agent rate for our room I'm not a good person to judge the value of the our room. It was a great value to us, but this does not apply to most people. In summary, we would definitely stay at the Hyatt again and recommend it to any of our friends! The beautiful grounds, pleasant staff, and great location more than outweighed the issues of the construction noise and crowded pool.", "Date": "November 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "ParadiseAwaits", "ReviewID": "UR10854402", "Content": "This resort is fabulous, we just returned (11/5-11/12) from a wonderful vacaion at the Hyatt. Make sure to upgrade to an ocean view room and have your breakfast included as the breakfast buffet at Swan Court would be $58 for a couple. Cheaper rooms have cheated views. Our room was nice and clean. The resort is huge and has plenty to see between the wildlife and all the shops on the property. Eating on the resort is a bad idea...$22 cheeseburgers at Casscades. Whaler's Village is walking distance, there are restaurants and shops there. Also Lahaina is 10 mins away. I have come to the conclusion that the people who've ragged on this resort are comparing it to hotel chains like the Ritz, Mandarin, and Four Seasons...it's not that sort of luxury. In fact there are none of these hotel chains on Kannapali Beach. So if this is what you're looking for go elsewhere. The Hyatt Regency is relaxed luxury and I would give it 4 stars. That said it's the niceset property on this beach. I have no idea how anyone could compare the Sheraton with the Hyatt...anywhere for that matter. The Sheraton has it's perks, like quietness and being on at black rock, but that's about it. The Hyatt is big, it's lively, and oftenly attracts large groups. However, we we never disturbed during our romantic stay by children or loudness. We found out that there was a club on the property, in the same tower as we were in and we didn't even know it until we came out at 2:30am for the Sunrise at Haleakala tour. It has the best pool for kids and adults. Always found a chair, but for the best spots get up an save your spots. The chairs are freakishly cloce together, but if you save your spots early you won't have to worry about that.

It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. I was very worried about the hotel after reading recent posts on this website before we left, but I have very few complaints. We originally booked the Hyatt through expedia but then found it MUCH cheaper through costco. Our package included a deluxe oceanview room with daily breakfast buffet passes. I had made a special request to be on the highest possible floor of the Lahaina tower. When we arrived at check-in there was a room available on the top floor of Lahaina tower but it had a queen and a full bed instead of a king. The only other room available in our category with a king bed was in Napili tower. We took the Lahaina room. If you are staying in a deluxe oceanview room, you definitely want to be in the Lahaina tower. They have finished the updating (new wallpaper, etc.) in this tower and are now working in Napili. The sunset views are also better from Lahaina tower. Our room was very clean with brand new wallpaper and a beautiful view. We never heard noise from the luau. We requested daily turn down service and had great maid service throughout our stay. There is a small fridge in the room (in addition to the mini-bar fridge). The shower/toilet area is pretty small but the water pressure is good and the shower is mildew-free. My husband and I didn't think the beds were as comfortable as some many of the other posters on this website describe them to be. I definitely prefer the westin heavenly beds. The back parking lot is very convenient to Lahaina tower so we always self-parked. The one time the lot was full they did not charge us for valet. The Hyatt is a longer walk to Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village than I had anticipated. It takes about 15-20 minutes from Lahaina tower to get there. Just keep that in mind when making dinner reservations. The beach is narrow and rocky (but we expected that). What we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to find were sharks! We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in the ocean for the first few days we were there because of shark sightings. Hotel security and the Maui police were encouraging you to stay out of the water. We rented a cabana on the beach our first day there ($40). The cabanas are old and worn down, but we wanted to spend our first day relaxing comfortably on the beach. They also keep a pitcher of ice water full for you all day. Our last day there we rented one of the two hales in front of Napili tower. It was definitely pricey ($125), but it came with a TV which is what we needed so that we could watch the OU/TX game but not miss out on spending our last day at the beach. They also give you bottled water, a plate of fruit, a cooler full of ice, and the waitress came by regularly. It was really nice. The pool at the Hyatt is awesome. Pool chairs were always available and there is a good mix between shade and sunny spots. The large \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pool is well separated from the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s area with the water slide. Drink service was okay, depending on the day. Alcoholic mixed drinks were about $10 and non-alcoholic were about $7. You can check out as many towels as you want and you can take them off hotel property. So there is no need to bring towels from home (one of our mistakes). The daily breakfast buffet was very good. The line was usually about 10-15 minutes long. We found the least crowded time to be from 6:30 to 7:30 or after 10:00. There is a good variety of food (cereal, bread/bagels/croissants that can be toasted, yogurt parfaits, scrambled eggs, omelette station, bacon, sausage, crepes, muffins, fresh fruit, cakes, waffles/pancakes/French toast (alternating), some Asian breakfast choices that I never tried, and a lot more. We had good service every morning that we were there and they even let us take our breakfast to go one morning when we were in a huge hurry. We tried to do the Hyatt tour of the stars but we had waited until our last night to do it and it was canceled because of clouds. If you want to do the couples show (friday at 11pm), make reservations early because we called on thursday morning and it was already full. The staff was very friendly. I always felt like they were really trying to meet our needs and make this a great vacation for us. However, they did deny us late check-out (they said no one was allowed late check-out on that particular day) and they failed to bring a bottle of champagne to our room that the front desk clerk mentioned at check-in. We had a great time at the Hyatt. The grounds were beautiful, the staff was friendly, our room was clean with a great view, and the food was good.

While the grounds are beautiful (after all, this is Hawaii!) their was construction going on that we were not informed of, and the walls in our hallway were patched, or needed to be patched, giving it the look of a construction zone. We returned to our room one day to see a hotel gardener attending to some plants that could only be reached from our balcony--We THINK he was legitimate, and nothing was missing. The pool/beach area is incredible and as a result we had a great time, but I feel obligated to report their ongoing mini-bar scam. There is a tray on a bureau facing you when you enter the room. On the tray are the usual mini-bar items--cookies, nuts, candy bars, all triple the price you would normally pay, and we never use these items, nor do we use them and then replace them the next day to avoid getting charged. BUT--Hyatt's new system, that even their customer service representative that we spoke to on our return was unaware of, is a tray with a sensor. Any time something is removed from the tray, the sensor is activitated and your room is charged for the price of the item in that location. Noticing Mini-bar charges mysteriously appearing when checking our bill on the TV screen, by Day 3 I had the mini-bar removed and asked to have the sensor de-activated. They took the food out but apparently did not de-activate it, so any time we placed something on the tray, or removed it, we got billed for a mini-bar item. When I tried to have the charges removed, Shane at the front desk told me he had no way of knowing whether we had the items removed so he could not remove the charges. I was told that room service does the mini-bar so he didn't know if in fact they had removed the food. Eventually, after many long discussions, they removed the one or two hundred dollars of charges. Check out took 45 minutes to remove new charges from the last day, and what put us over the edge was to see an extra charge on my credit card after we had checked out. I called the hotel and was told it was a mini-bar charge. I was promised it would be reversed, but that did not happen yet (I've been working on it for 4 weeks).

But the Hyatt in Maui is not nearly as nice as the one on Kauai. Our room in Maui was tired, the bathroom very small, and the beds all were uncomfortable. We upgraded to an ocean front room, only to find, after we had fully unpacked our family of 4, that we were directly above the nightly luau. This meant that we heard the noise -- lounge acts and pounding drums -- from 5:00 to 8:00 pm every night (not counting the noise of people entering at about 4:30 pm). They offered to move us -- but there is also a luau on the other side of the hotel 2 days a week, and the area by the pool is hardly quiet, so we chose to stay put rather than have a view of the parking lot and go through the hassle of moving. I just wish they had warned us about the noise before we upgraded our room and unpacked. As for the pool, when you can find a chair, you sit elbow to elbow next to everyone. Getting 4 chairs together is not easy, and can take all day to accomplish, and finding chairs with shade is like striking gold. As for snorkeling, there's none here, and the beach is noisey, filled with jet skiis. Black Rock at the Sheraton is the closest place to snorkel, but it's a 20 minute walk on the path. The pool at the Sheraton, by the way, looked better than the pool at the Hyatt -- and the Sheraton does have the beach. So in Kanapali the Sheraton may be the best way to go. Nevertheless we did end up adjusting to the hotel and having a good time. There's great snorkeling nearby in Honolua Bay, and we timed our day to be ready for dinner just as the luau started. The staff was basicially nice. I'm not sure whether the fact that they couldn't do anything about the smell of cigarette smoke reflected badly on them or the people the hotel attracts. (They told me it happens all the time in the non-smoking rooms -- people just smoke in them anyway and the smell leaks out.) Anyway, next year, back to the Kauai Hyatt -- which is a terrific hotel!

The Hyatt Regency is a beautiful tropical property and has such potential, unfortunately this hectic, slightly unkempt, and discourteous resort is showing its age. It was extremely disappointing. and astronomically expensive. The rooms are tired, noisy, and need a face lift. Our room was actually grimy with embedded dirt, soap scum and hairs in the bathroom area. Although I asked twice that it be cleaned more thoroughly, it never was. The staff was often rude and unaccommodating. We lost power 5x during our stay and when we called to have it restored, we were treated to annoyance and indifference. The hairdryer was broken and never replaced, we were charged unnecessary additional fees, our partial ocean front room overlooked a roof, and although part of the additional resort fee included coffee, tea, and lotions, we had to request them, calling twice, before they arrived. The clothes iron stained our clothing, the cleaning staff opened our door at 8:30 to 9 on two occasions but then did not clean our room until I tracked them down late in the afternoon. Calling the front desk was useless, they never followed through. Most of the staff, both at the front desk and pools were surly, unaccommodating, and often rude. . After waiting 30 years for our \"dream vacation\", I truly regret staying at this property. The pool area was not only crowded, but impossible to relax in between the \"pool Nazis\" patrolling, the insistence that we wear wristbands, and lounge chairs that abut each other. Breakfast in the Swan was adequate but birds flying freely throughout the atrium and eating off empty tables was a health risk. And finally, because we had a 10 pm red-eye back to the east coast, we requested a slightly later check out time. The request was immediately denied. This property is certainly not worth the thousands of dollars it cost to stay there. It describes itself as elegant and luxurious, but in actuality it is loud, worn, and discourteous.

My best advice: pack a collapsable cooler in your suitcase. We went and bought lunch and drinks and traveled with it every day. Also, at the dive shops, you can rent beach chairs for the week for those that like to lay in a chair rather than on the sand. We ate at the hotel restaurants and enjoyed them, but our favorite meals were off site at the Lahina shopping areas.

The hotels and islands are very different, but I will focus on the hotel properties. The Hyatt on Maui is located in the north and western part of Maui, near Lahaina, which has a lot to offer because of the historic and redeveloped aspects of the town. There are a lot of great excusions in this part of Maui as well. It is a busier area with lots to do, in contrast to the Wailea area of Maui which has nice resorts and a quieter feel. The beach at the Hyatt is at the south side of Kaanapali, and it is too thin just in front of the Hyatt. Contrast it with the Sheraton near Black Rock in Kannapali, which had a much wider beach area and great snorkeling. The part where the Hyatt is located has a more dense feel, with many resorts right beside each other. Some may find this appealing, we found it a little too hectic. The hotel was nice, but was a little tired looking. The room noise was too high. Each time a door closed on the floor it felt like it was your own. Contrast this with the Hyatt on Kauai, which we never heard anybody else on our floor (We did a review on that property just a few days ago). We were first in the center atrium building, which I would not recommend unless you are a very heavy sleeper. If the doors on the floor don't wake you up (3am departures for biking down Haleakala) the birds definitely will. I would recommend one of the outer two buildings. The hallways are carpeted, the hallways in the atrium are ceramic tile. But that doesn't solve the door banging problem. The rooms themselves are fine, and the beds were very comfortable. The pool area is nice and has a nice kids area, but the chairs around the pool are very crowded. We found it better to go on the grassy areas between the pools and the beach, and the beach area in front of the fitness center. I would describe the feel of the hotel as more of an active hotel and activity area, versus more of a spread out, relaxed resort feel. The Hyatt Kauai is much more relaxing and uses distinctly different levels of the pool area, lagoon, and beach to spread out the guests, the views, and the noise. If you want to stay in the Kaanapali area, I think you should consider the Hyatt, but would also consider other locations as well and weigh the overall price/value. We frequently visited the area north of Kapalua (the Ritz seemed very windy, and quite a distance from the hotel to the beach) for hiking, snorkeling, road biking, and terrific views to marvel out on day trips. Definitely rent a car if you think you want to do more than hang out at the hotel.

Booked rooms/car rental through Costco and got an okay deal. Maybe saved $100 vs. booking directly with hotel and rental company. A bit about my travel style - I like to stay at nice resorts, but never plan on staying in the room too much. I'm easy going and I try to be positive so it takes quite a bit for me to be unfavorable towards a place. We booked a Terrace View with a King bed (the lowest price) and at check-in got upgraded to Garden/Mountain View (second lowest price). The clerk was pleasant, but he did not ask if we were here for a special occasion and I was too shy to request anything. No problem - just would have really nice. Our room was on the first floor of the Atrium Tower. The view was of a roof that is undergoing construction and the lanai sliding door wouldn't open. We didn't mind about the sliding door because we wouldn't have used the lanai anyways because of the view. I thought the room itself was great for two people. We loved the COMFORTABLE bed and small empty fridge to put in our own drinks (we didn't touch the other fridge that held sodas/beer etc., - thanks for the advice everyone!). Other Pros: *Beautiful grounds - loved walking through the property *Activities Desk - nice customer service, very convenient too book snorkel cruise and offered at a 30% discount *Beach - I know that a lot of people hate this beach, but I didn't mind that there wasn't a place to lay out. It was a lot less crowded than the other northern spots. I enjoyed being able to hop back and forth the short distance between the ocean and my pool lounge chair. If you really feel like you must lie on sand, it's a short 5-10 minute walk. *Gym - fully stocked with great cardio machines and weights *Sonz restaurant - very good, although expensive Cons: *Upon check-out we discovered a $189 charge from one of the restaurants we never ate at. Clerk said she would find the ticket - left us waiting for 20 minutes. She couldn't find it and promptly removed the charge. I was just irritated that we had to wait so long and getting stressed while she was back there because we had a flight to catch. And then it made me question their security over charges made to rooms. Can anyone who overhears me give my room number and name make charges to my room? Answer - most likely yes, so be careful. *Maid service isn't regular *You're encouraged to wear a bracelet that identifies you as a guest when you're at the pool and it's required if you want to go down the water slide Overall, good experience.

It gives you your 6th night free, and we got a partial ocean view room and breakfast each morning. Our room was ready for us when we arrived in the morning, and we had a great sized corner room in the Lahaina tower. I noticed that our room was definitely not one that had been renovated and it was slightly musty smelling, but since it was a corner room I think it was larger than most, and we had 2 balconies - one facing the mountains, and the other with a great view of the mountains and ocean. As requested, there was a fridge in our room, however it didn't really keep our beverages cold. I would pass on the same advice that I read, and if you are staying in this area, definitely go to the Safeway supermarket down the road and get food and drinks, and get a fridge. Much cheaper and very convenient! Every morning of our stay, we had breakfast at the Swan Court, and it was awesome. We always had great seats right on their pond and views of the waterfall, and had good coffee and the most amazing buffet I've ever seen. We ate a ton every morning and most days we didn't need to eat lunch so we just spent money on dinner each night. Totally worth it. I think the only downside was the location on the beach. It's definitely at LEAST a 10 minute walk up the way to get to a part of the beach without rocks. You can walk up to the Kaanapali Ali'i condos and swim or surf in front of there. If you wanted to snorkel and go to Black Rock by the Sheraton, that's about a 20 minute walk. We did that twice and spent the rest of our time by the condos. The Hyatt does have a great pool though. We usually spent the morning/early afternoon at the beach, then we'd go to the pool a little later on (around 2 or 3) and by then we had no problems getting chairs by the pool. I thought I read online that the big part of the pool was \"adults only\", and that's definitely not true as there were a lot of kids playing everywhere. We really liked the Grotto Bar, and you can sit in the grotto and have some beverages and watch TV, or you can sit in there in the pool. The frozen drinks were very tasty and bartenders friendly.

We called the next morning and they had a room for us - upgraded to a deluxe ocean view and they also provided us a $250 credit to use at hotel for food/beverage. That was nice but the fact that we had to check out by noon at the Ritz so we basically lost a day due to having to change hotels. When we arrived at the room they left us a basket of treats/drinks for our trouble - nice touch - but it was 2 double beds where we requested a king. They quickly found us another ocean view room so we checked into that one and it was a nice room. Here's the rest of the scoop on the hotel: Pool: Really great pool with the waterfalls and the best kids (toddlers) area I've seen at a pool with the sand and wade it pool and the small slide. The adult slide was also really cool. The only downside is that with it being so crowded people show up before breakfast to put towels on chairs to reserve them so the hotel actually has people running around asking if other people have seen people using the chairs and if not they remove the towels and give them to other people. Not exactly a quiet and relaxing vacation spot with all the people around due to the All State Insurance conference Restaurants: We ate a Spats restauraunt and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The food wasn't very good and it was extremely over-priced. Our waitress didn't really know what she was doing and the service was extremely slow. So slow that when our food finally arrived our son started to fall asleep at the table so we had to take his to go. We also ate at the Rusty Harpoon at the Fisherman's Village and again the food was overpriced and wasn't very good. I really expected a lot better that what we get in Dallas but I was surprised that we get better seafood meals at high end restaurants in Dallas for the same price. Overall the hotel was ok but I personally wouldn't go back to Maui, I'd really recommend going to Kauai and skipping Maui all-together.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontefract", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous Hotel, Rubbish Service\u201d", "Author": "DJWatson", "ReviewID": "UR7960901", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for our Honeymoon, and like the other reviewer, were not given any special treatment at reception on checking in, and our champagne too was late .... by two days, but they did put it in the fridge so ours was chilled, when we eventually got it!

The fact this hotel shows up on some sites as a four or five star hotel is an injustice to other hotels with a similar rating. If you think this is a five star hotel you must usually stay at Motel 6s or Super 8s. Alright, you probably sense I didn't think much of the Hyatt Regency in Maui. There were a number of reasons, but let's start with pulling up to the front upon arrival. The entrance does not impress at all. If you've been to other Hawaiian resorts (Maui Four Seasons, Maui Grand Wailea, Kauai Grand Hyatt, etc.) there is no comparison. The lobby is just OK, but the dissapointment really starts with check-in. It's like they think they're doing you a favor to get you checked in, not welcoming or charming at all. It reminded me of checking in at LAX for our flight. At least it set an appropriate tone for the rest of the place. The rooms are poorly decorated, dark, and somewhat depressing. The bathroom was very small and there was no separation of the vanity/sink area to the rest of the room. The outside lounge area had chairs with cushions missing, not to mention the mess from the birds that looked like it accumulated for days because nobody had time to spray it down with a hose. The pool was alright, but too small for the number of people. The beach is terrible in front of this resort, narrow and rocky - unless maybe you like narrow and rocky? The service in the restaurants was fair at best, as was the food. This is supposed to be a top notch Hyatt resort? No way. I could go on and on, but why bother. Look through some of the reviews here and compare them to the Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, Fairmont, Grand Hyatt in Kauai, etc. If you're still willing to gamble with your vacation I wish you luck and maybe you'll enjoy this resort. By the way, we checked out after spending only two nights here and went to a hotel in Wailea. The reason we *had* to spend two nights was because of their 24 hr cancellation policy. Oh, I almost forgot, the breakfast buffet wasn't bad. So I guess I wasn't totally dissapointed. :-)", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cso-so\u201d", "Author": "moorheit", "ReviewID": "UR7853396", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt for a friend's wedding so got a great group rate. Had it not been for that fact, I would have been disappointed. The rooms are fine, and the common areas are beautiful. But there are more negatives than positives about this resort. As a previous poster noted, the maid service leaves much to be desired. I too think all they do is make the beds. There were empty cocktail glasses (complete with leftover garnish of orange and maraschino cherry speared on a plastic palm tree) that were not removed from our room for two days. Sometimes they brought toiletries; sometimes they did not. Service in general was lax. You rarely saw a Hyatt employee outside of the pool area and the Regency Club. The lanais are tiny. Barely enough room for a small table and two chairs, but we had a great view of the ocean and pool from ours. The pool area is nice enough, but too small for the resort apparently. The Hyatt has jammed in the maximum number of deck chairs possible to accommodate guests, but it makes for a crowded feel. Like a NYC subway crowded feel. Same with the pool itself. There were so many people oddly just standing around in the pool, trying to swim in it was like navigating a mine field. Food and drinks at the pool and at the various restaurants at the Hyatt were prohibitively expensive. Last complaint was the beach. There are tons of beautiful beaches on Maui. I think my husband and I saw all of them. The beach outside the Hyatt is likely the least attractive beach on Maui. Not much the Hyatt can do about it, but don't go here expecting a picture postcard perfect beach. Looks more like the beaches along the coasts of Florida. Water is ugly and cloudy and there is mysterious debris all over the beach - black nut shells or something. Anyway, walk down maybe 10 minutes north to the main part of Kaanapali beach and you'll get your picture perfect beach. Or do as we did and explore the island to find your own relatively secluded beach with crystal clear turquoise waters, gentle surf and great snorkeling. Unless I got the deep discount rate again, I would definitely not be back to the Hyatt again.

I had booked under a special rate through my work which I was guaranteed a room on lower floors with view of parking lot. Liked: When my family checked in we were greeted with flower leis and the concierge gave my 4 and 5 year old bubbles to occupy them. The clerk at the front desk upgraded us for free to a partial ocean view room on the 6th floor of Lahaina Tower. That was nice that we would not be looking at a dumpster. The grounds are beautiful and and my children enjoyed the waterslides and pool. The staff is very nice. We went to the Luau at the hotel which was great and we all enjoyed that alot. The animals and birds in the lobby created a very nice atmosphere. Did Not Like: What I did not like was housekeeping. They did a poor job of cleaning our room. For the price we paid for a room we expect them to vacuum and clean the bathrooms. At times the only thing we noticed done was them making our beds. They have a new policy about not changing the linen everyday only once on the 4th day of your stay unless you request otherwise. We didn't care that the linen was not changed daily but we still expected them to clean the room which they did a poor job. The rooms are also in need of renovation. They are dark and the furniture is worn. There are no affordable options for dining at the Hyatt. We spent most of our time eating at either Whalers or Lahaina in town. It would be nice if a family could actually enjoy the restaurants at a resort but unless you have alot of money to blow this is not an option for working class families. I ordered a few salads at the pool sandwich shop and paid $40 which is ridiculous. That was the only meal we ate at the Hyatt. Another thing that bothered me was there is no HBO. Only basic cable. This should be included for the price of these rooms. My recommendation is that you check your account daily on the menu of your tv. There were a ton of erroneous charges on our bill for the mini bar in the room which we never touched. Everything is operated on a laser so I am assuming if you accidentally run into the unit it may set the laser off. A can of pop was $3.25. Enough said. There was no entertainment on the Hyatt property at all at night during the week. This was baffling to me. Most of the hotels on the strip of Kaanapali had a singer nightly or a band. We ended up going to the Kaanapali Beach Hotel a couple of nights to see the free Luau show and Hawaiian music from 6-9pm at night. It would have been nice if the Hyatt offered something to do at night other than suck every last dime from you on their restaurants and bars. Overall: It is hard to find the caliber of resort without paying a huge pricetag with it. I think that at least resorts could make the kids meals affordable which none of them attempt to do. I think that is why families are buying timeshares. The Hyatt is a beautiful resort but offers little to the family demographic with the exception of the pools. I don't mind paying more for a hotel room if I am going to get some amenities but I did not feel that we got anymore than a 2 or 3 star hotel here.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erie", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "swizard01", "ReviewID": "UR7769653", "Content": "My husband received a bonus in the form of \"hyatt bucks\" so we stayed here for 3 nights of an 8 night trip.

The rooms are the exception though as they are quite large and look to be recently remodled with updated furniture, bedding, etc. The bathrooms are about as small as any hotel I've ever stayed in. The grounds are very nice- beautiful garden areas, great views throughout the property, huge pool, and very comfy poolside lounge chairs. The issue that keeps me from giving this resort a better review is the parking situation. There is a small lot in the front and a larger lot in the back. After our second day, the front lot became closed off due to what we were told was for some type of large corporate event. So, everyone was fighting for spots in the back, and available space was impossible to find at certain times of the day. The result- you have to use the $12/day valet parking. We were given no alternative so we discussed the matter with the front desk and they eventually wiped the charges from our bill. Another concern we had was that of smoking on the lanai. We were on a non-smoking floor (which means no smoking on the lanai as well) and our \"neighbors\" seemed to be smoking on their lanai whenever I walked outside and the smell of smoke filled our room.

We travel the world and stay in everything from Motels to 4 Seasons/5 star resorts so we are failry well traveled and aware of what should be expected out of accomodations. Pros: Kaanipali beach Sushi restaurant is great Decent Shopping in the hotel Cons: Mini bar Police! : (dont matter if you have a do not disturb sign on your door. every single day they started coming in to take inventory of that bar. Once walked in on us naked!! Completely unacceptable.) They have those systems where if you just touch a candybar in the basket, it charges your room. So of course not knowing that we were checking a few things out and wham $65 charged to our bill. We got it reveresed. Construction: (so much for our \"partial Ocean view\" we had to stare at 50 buckets of roof stopleak and listen to these guys sponging it on the roof the entire week. Drink Prices and quality: Lounging at the pool and having $9 rum and cokes is'nt fun. Especially when you cant taste the rum! Pool: Kids, kids and more kids. Nothing much else needs to be said here. If it was our honeymoon that would have bugged me more. No peaceful relaxation to be found at this Hotel. Trust me. Pool is decent size though, unfrotunately not heated. The pool is cracking around pretty much every side as well. Looks terrible. Spa: I will say we had the best Deep tissue massages EVER at this Spa, Norma is a HUGE reccomendation if you go. However plan to pay $160 for 50 mins. Thats robbery no matter how good the massage is. We ate it since we like massage and it is Hawaii. Locker room area fits 3 people comfortably, be aware of that in case you go at a busy time. You will have to wait to change. Relaxation room is a dream. However you can only get about 8 people in it comfortably and it is Co-ed. There was about 12 squeezed in when we got there. We had to STAND! eugh! Ok enough about this resort.

However, overall, we very much liked the Maui Hyatt. We were originally given a room that faced a construction site. We sucked it up for a few nights, but then decided that for what we were paying this was not going to cut it - after speaking to a manager on duty, we were immediately switched to an upgraded room, no questions asked (other than why didn't you say something sooner) The activities concierge desk was staffed with very knowledgable staff who gave us some good suggestions about where to go, what to see, etc. (though we spent most of the time at the pool anyway) The pool was impressive, but it was a battle to find chairs every day. They time stamp empty chairs so that when people leave behind a towel and try to reserve the chair, they come back to find that the hotel has taken their stuff and given the chair to somebody else. Even with this system, it was hard to find a place everyday and that caused unnecessary stress. For the most part, waiter service by the pool was prompt and friendly - though the house rum was awful and my husband hated the mai tais. The bed in the hotel was ridiculously comfortable and ,but for the amazing buffet breakfast waiting for us, we wouldn't have wanted to get out of bed in the morning. The breakfast was delicious and there's nothing like starting off your day staring at a beautiful waterfull and swan filled lake. The biggest con for this hotel was the number of people staying there. There were tons of families with lots of children and parking was a big headache. If you chose to do valet, you could wait fifteen minutes to get your car. If you parked yourself, you had to circle the lot multiple times before cramming yourself into one of the tiny spots available.

We'd go back in a heartbeat! We upgraded to the Regency Club level upon check-in - for us it was totally worth the extra money and truly made our honeymoon special. The bed...ahh the bed! It was so comfortable, I slept great after the stress of planning a wedding. The concierge for the hotel, in the main lobby, were not that helpful (at least for us), so having the personal concierge in the Regency Club room was a great. They were willing to go above & beyond helping us, they knew the ins & outs of what to do, where to go - they were wonderful. We skipped the big buffet breakfast practically every morning for the Regency Club's continental breakfast, it was very cozy & nice & convenient. Our room looked identical to the other rooms, but a bit nicer on the amenities. We had to check into a room on the 14th level for the last few hours and there were differences (couch not as comfy, view not as nice, bathroom amenities were fewer on the lower levels). The appetizers offered from 5-7pm with the open bar on the Regency Level was great! The pool had it's days of getting really crowded & some days they certainly enforced the 1 hour chair rule, but most days it was possible to find a chair to enjoy the sun. The poolside service was very nice, though pretty expensive. You get roped into valet parking your first time you pull up, even though there is a front parking lot that you can self park. The spots are tiny and it fills up fast, but there is additional parking around back. We only used the valet service that 1st night, we moved the next day & never used valet again, not worth the $12. Sonz restaurant was great, we had a wonderful dinner there. We tried Cascades restaurant too - sushi wasn't too great, but we didn't leave hungry. We didn't try the Italian restaurant since we have such great Italian restaurants by me in NY. The stores in the hotel were really nice, though we didn't buy anything, it was nice to know we had that option. :-) The beach was just fine for us since we aren't huge beach people. Yes, it's small, but a very short walk away you can have a larger beach to lay out all day. Overall, I'd recommend the Hyatt to anyone.

The beds and linens were comfortable but not luxury. The Club lounge offered standard breakfast contintental fare and a Happy 2 Hours with gratis beverages and pupus. Nice. The club staff was friendly and accomodating. The grounds were beautiful. The swimming pools and grotto bar were fun for both our children and ourselves. As mentioned in previous reviews, the beach is almost non-existent directly in front of the resort. However, to the left ( in front of the exercise/spa facilities), there is a very nice beach with activities for hire. The hotel lobby is somewhat impressive with exotic birds and Koa wood. Again, it is a bit dated, but is maintained well. Food at the restaurants was good to excellant. We liked the fact that we could walk to Whaler's Village for a change of venue. Having stayed at the Fairmont Kea Lani (2X), Westin, several luxury Maui condos, I would recommend the Hyatt for guests who like deluxe pool facilites, and would settle for basic amenities in their room.

I was checking the reviews and was wondering if I was staying at the same resort as some of the other reviewers. As a travel agent, we tend to be a bit more critical of properties than the average guest since I am looking at from my client's eyes---- ie: is it worth the money, will they be happy at the resort, how is the service, food, rooms, etc. I can say that since we stayed there, I have put other clients at this resort and will continue to do so. The Pros: 1. This resort is absolutely gorgeous. We did travel agent site inspections of about 8 other resorts in Maui during our stay, and this is probably the most beautiful on the island (Grand Wailea may have more of a wow factor). The open air lobby is a tropical rain forest complete with parrots, penguins and garden pathways. It truly has the WOW factor. 2. Check in and service- we arrived about 3pm. Yes, it is about a 50 minute drive from the airport but in Maui, none of the hotels are close to the airport. We were given a lei greeting and check in was a breeze. We were escorted to our room by a very friendly bell hop who showed us where all of the restaurants were on the way to our room in the atrium tower. 3. The room- deluxe oceanfront room on the 15th floor- simply stunning view overlooking the pool and the ocean. The lanai was a nice size with plants on either side for more privacy. The walk in closet was a very nice size as was the bathroom. The in room bathroom amenities were very nice and always replenished. Coffee and tea service in the room was nicely presented. 4. The BED- to die for. Never slept so well in my life. 5. Hotel service- let me explain that this is something that I would have also done for my clients but since it was for me, I really got to see how the hotel would handle this. The pillows and duvet in the rooms are down and I am highly allergic to feathers. I emailed my contact at the hotel and requested to have all down removed from the room with the room aired out prior to our arrival. Had this not be done, I would be in allergy hell so I would know right away. We got to the room, it was down free and extra (non down) blankets were placed out for us. No complaints there at all. 6. The pool is gorgeous with waterfalls, grotto bar and water slide. Pool towels were plentiful- all you needed to do was show your room key and they would give you as many towels as you wanted. Keep this in mind for when you are going to the beach in other parts of the island. Lounge chairs were always available (remember we went in lower season- although there were tons of conferences going on and the attendees brought their families) The chairs all had sun canopies which I appreciated. There were waitresses to bring drinks and food throughout the day. The only Cons: 1. No turn down service at night- was a bit surprised at that with a hotel of this caliber and we did receive it at the Waikiki Hyatt. 2. Beach is very small (there is only room for beach chairs on either side of resort). 3.The pool area might be a problem for people with hip or knee issues- this in not an infinity pool and does require using a ladder or deep steps to get in or out. Yes----food is expensive- you are in Hawaii for goodness sake. Yes---parking can be a bit tight but if you can't find a spot in either of the 2 lots, the valet will take care of parking your car for free. Do you really want them to build a parking garage to block your view? Yes---there is a $15 resort fee which covers parking, fitness center access, tennis and in room coffee and tea, etc. Of all the hotels that we visited while in Maui, the only one that didn't charge a resort fee was the Four Seasons. If you didn't know about it before arriving, shame on your travel agent for not telling you- or shame on your for booking on line and not researching it thoroughly. Yes---this is a resort that will have families because of the gorgeous pools and Camp Hyatt. All of the hotels in Maui will have children. If you don't want to see any children while you are on vacation, I can recommend some great adults only resorts in the Caribbean or Mexico. There are none in Maui. There are others that may not have as many kids but, that will also be based on the time of year that you are traveling. I have sent many honeymooners and families to this resort and will continue to do so. I have heard only 1 complaint from clients and, I would say that it was more due to the time of year that they traveled than the hotel's fault. They traveled during the spring break vacation and were not pleased about the amount of kids there. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have about the resort. I can be reached at mindy@myvacationlady.com. Sorry that I haven't had time to post our pictures on my website yet. It is in the plans to do shortly.

I picked the Hyatt because I was going to splurge on the expensive resort type hotel vs. the 3 star so-so hotel. First of all, if you like quiet, this is not the hotel for you. It is a bird sanctuary and the middle of the hotel is open which mean that birds fly all over and outside your bedroom door. They start squawking at around 4:30 am. Also they have the Hawaiian lounge singers at the lounge downstairs which is so loud that it sounds like they are singing right in your room. I am 38 years old so I am not an old fuddy duddy and it was really loud and obnoxious. The front desk was not friendly but after talking to a manager she reluctantly offered another room to me. It was the room right next to the elevator. Thanks anyway.... The linens smelled like vomit also. I think it was just that they didn't let them dry thoroughly so it was a moldy smell. They did move me to another room which smelled so much better and the linens were fresh smelling. Still noisy, but at least I didn't have smelly linens. Also the Marriott which is nearby is under construction which is very noisy, all day and they start up extremely early in the morning. Overall, it is just a very noisy hotel and for the price I expected so much better. On to room service. The food was so expensive and tasted like your cafeteria food at school. It was awful and for a tiny cup of soup and a side small salad the bill was about $30. I expected it to be expensive since I was staying at a 4 star hotel but this was a rip off. The Swan Court breakfast buffet was really expensive but that food was really good and the view at this restaurant is amazing. Just gorgeous. Worth the cost just to sit and look at the view. The pool was amazing, perfect temperature and so pretty. The waterfalls and pool grounds were spectacular. However do not order food at the pool. It was atrocious. I couldn't even eat it. I tried twice but both times, just gross. I have never seen more beautiful grounds at a hotel and I have stayed at many nice hotels. This tops the beauty category.

I am curious how they are going to give 806 rooms an hour of tennis everyday. Then if you would like to park your car they provide a parking lot with less then 50 parking spots.

Minor detail for a beachfront property, I guess To adapt the resort puts its chairs and cabanas on terraces set back from the beach!! Also note that much of the beach has rocks underneath the water with sharp edges. I have been to hundreds of beaches without issue and I sliced open my toe at this one! To the Hyatt's credit, their security team was efficient in patching me up, but was frustrating nonetheless. A few bright points, though. First, the room service was exceptional -- some of the best we have had, and I have stayed in hundreds of hotels worldwide. We ate breakfast of kings beautifully presented, looking out on the ocean and the food was full of flavor and very fresh. Second, the pools and facilities looked like they would be great for families/kids and the golf arrangements also looked great. Third, the concierge actually answered the phone promptly almost every time we called and had useful info. Apart from that, the property felt like a large Holiday Inn.

Russell (I am pretty sure that was his name) the Bell Man took us to our room. He was great. He gave us loads of tips on what to do, what happened when at the hotel, where things were. He gave my husband him some great golf course suggestions. He was very kind to our 9 year old daughter and made her feel especially welcomed-nice touch. You can have the valet take your car and as long as you move it later (like ten p.m. or something) they don't charge you the valet fee. We never had a problem finding self parking but were warned by Russell not to leave anything in our car-not even the trunk. He said that the crooks can pop the trunk of a rental car in 15 seconds We had booked a Partial Ocean View on the Regency Club level with a King bed and a double bed. We booked directly through the Hyatt website with the AAA rate. It was everything it was supposed to be. In the entry way, in front of the sleeping area was a little \"bar\" type area that had a mini fridge which was great (I'm fairly certain it was standard in that room but if you have a different category room you can request a mini fridge on the Hyatt website) we had a little coffee maker with supplies refreshed daily- and of course the mini bar. . it's bar coded so if you touch anything you buy it. The room was nice. . a basic Hyatt room-with Hawaiian touches, it was pretty and clean. It has a large walk in closet with built in drawers in it so we didn't have to muck up the room with suitcases and clothes piled everywhere. The vanity area was plenty large enough with 6 big drawers and nice toiletries from their \"Spa Moana\". The room also had a safe, two robes, a hairdryer and an iron. The view was partial ocean-the sliding glass door faced North up towards Whalers Village and you could see the ocean beyond. The lanai had a small table and three chairs which was nice but we didn't hang out in the room much. As reported, the beds and linens are very comfy. Housekeeping was everything it should be, we never saw them but they came everyday. I like that they don't change the linens and towels everyday unless you ask-they are trying to conserve water, energy, detergent. The Regency Club was nice-it was one floor up and offered a nice selection of breakfast items (oatmeal, cereal, bagels, muffins, croissants, juice, milk, hot chocolate, coffee, espresso, fresh fruit) in the morning. In the afternoon they had cookies and water/soda and in the evening appetizers and cocktails. They also have their own concierge there which we used to make dinner reservations one night. I am not really sure if the Regency Club was worth the extra money for us or not, as we are not big breakfast eaters. But it was very convenient, well staffed and everything looked very nice and fresh. We basically used it for the coffee and cocktails and our daughter had cereal and juice every morning. We probably would have been better off on our own-live and learn! Remember- if you stay at this level you need your key to get the elevator to go to the Regency Club floors. In the evening they came and turned down the beds and left a little piece of chocolate and a card with a little Hawaiian message that was another little nice touch. The hotel was quiet at night no slamming doors or loud music we slept like babies and the curtains are so thick-if you want to take a nap during the day-you'll never know it's light out. You can access the internet from the TV in your room. It's a flat charge for 24 hours. ten bucks or something. The remote keyboard wasn't that great though, but I just needed to check a couple emails-I wasn't doing real work. The gym was great. We used it everyday and it had everything your well equiped gym at home would have and it's open 24 hours a day! It was only crowded on Saturday but they had plenty of treadmills, elepticals, stationary bikes, weight machines, free weights, pilates balls and mats. They have towels and cold water for the guests. We used the Spa for outdoor massages and highly recommend the Spa Moana. Beautiful indoor facilities which you can use during the day of your treatment. The outdoor massage on the beach was great! Lovely setting and a really good massage. A must! We did not eat at any of the on site restaurants but had cocktails every day at the bar under the waterfall. Glenn the bartender is a really nice guy and the setting was nice and cool. A good excuse to get out of the sun! I heard one person complaining that she thought they advertise a \"swim up bar\" and she was bummed out that it wasn't really. It's in a little cave nitched out of the pool but it's not a swim up bar like you'd see in Mexico or the Bahamas with the bar stools in the water. It's still pretty neat. We had nice meals at The Lahaina Grill and Oyster Bar (sit up on the roof-great view) and the Hula Grill (nice to be able to walk up the beach to dinner!) We went back the the Lahaina Grill for lunch after surfing lessons and it was good again. . they have a happy hour that runs all day. We took surfing lessons at Goofy Foot in Lahaina (505 Front Street) it was recommended to us since we had a kid with us-that the Lahaina Breakwater is a better area (waves) for kids than Kaanapali Beach which can be windier. I don't know if that's true or what, but Goofy Foot was great and we all got up on our very first wave and got to surf for an hour and a half. There were two instructors and 5 students! Definately worth it if it's something you want to try. I highly recommend Goofy Foot. The pools at the Hyatt are awesome-all interconnected through a series of lagoons and waterfalls. The website doesn't do the pools justice at all. One side is more for kids with two water slides- one small for little kids and one large enclosed water slide for the older kids and adults. It was SO fun. Also on the kid side is a little area where water squirts up from the ground and there are big turtle statues that squirt water and a little beachy, pool area. Really great for the little ones or hesitant swimmers. This is the side where the rope brige is. The other side is more a big open pool area-it ranges from 3 feet to six feet deep with shallow ledges here and there to sit or hang on. You can rent those foam floaty rafts for ten dollars a day. The teach a beginning scuba class in the pool and also have water aerobics. Pool side food and beverage service begins around 11 and was very consistent. There is also a kind of food court area tucked in the back that has pre made salads and snacks and you can order from the poolside grill menu here too-and there is another bar back in there as well. (I seem to mentioning the bars and happy hours a lot!) Chairs were plentiful. I didn't see the chair hogging thing I've seen at other resorts (although the hotel was not full while we were there and there were not a lot of families so much as couples due to school being in session). Pool attendants did come around a remove towels from unused chairs from time to time. We also rented one of the cabanas one day-$40 bucks for the day and they bring you big jugs of ice water-we had #15 with a beautiful view of the ocean. Up a bit in front of the gym they have chairs and cabanas on the beach I've read the posts about the beach being small-it is, but go North or South a couple hundred yards and you'll have all the beach you want with warm water and little fun waves to play in. If you are really into the beach scene go up to Black Rock or down South to Kehei and Wailea-great beaches down there. The grounds of the hotel are very pretty and well maintained. The animals are a great touch. We enjoyed the penguins-they are so cute. They feed the Koi at 9:30 every morning and will give you some fish food and the fish will take it right out of your hand. They feed those cute little penguins right after (these are the kind of tips we got from Russell the Bellman)-if you want to see them swim-go to the feeding time, otherwise they kind of stay put on their little beach. The handler told us they were molting though, so they were a little grumpy. She also told us that one of the penguins is a wanderer and there are reports of him cruising the lobby at night! We didn't get to see that though. The parrots were funny too. In front of the Swan Court restaurant there is a pond that has flamingos and swans. We took a whale watching/sunset cruise on the Hyatts Catamaran the Kiele V-what a blast! We have been on many sunset cruises where you just motor out and back-not here. They put the sails up and you fly. You can sit on the nets or stand in the front and get SOAKED (do it-it's a great ride) or you can sit in the back and it's much more calm. The staff was great and they had a whale expert on board who was so informative. It was really a highlight of our vacation! It leaves right from the beach in front of the gym. I can't imagine the Hyatt doing anything to make our trip better-it was great-everything you'd want for your vacation in paradise. I know I have said so many great things that people will think I am a fake reviewer. I'm not I promise! To prove it, I will weigh in on one negative. Ready?

The first time stayed 10 days at the Fairmont Kea Lani. This time stayed 7 days at the Hyatt in Kannapali (Deluxe Ocean View) and then stayed 4 days at the Grand Wailea ( Delxue Ocean View) and then 4 days at the Four Seasons. ( Partial Ocean View). All 4 four hotels have there pros and cons. My favourite spot is still Wailea... more laid back, more high end shopping. Kaanapali is more resort town for me, more your every day shopping. Anyways, All room rates are approx the same $ 500- $600 US dollars I definately would rate the Four Seasons as the first choice, followed by a close second Kea Lani or the Grand Wailea( more for the families) and finally the Hyatt in Kaanapali. I will write about each hotel in the individual site. So check those out if you like. Service: Service was average. Got to the front desk. Bell man was helpful and friendly taking up bags and showing room features. Room: Not Clean, dusty Disappointing for the price you pay. we got the Deluxe ocean view room excellent ocean view. but room was poor especially bathroom. I was expecting his her sinks and separate tub and shower.... but It was tub/shower combo and on arrival there was mold on the shower curtain. Called front desk they came to change it right away but for the room rate you pay room cleanliness is poor,poor.poor So I guess you are paying for the view. hallways don't seem clean. Old decor in hallways. You can call for a mini fridge for N/C or at least when we stayed at the hotel so you can store your water/snacks you buy at the village or safeway. Good way to save $$$. Pool: Still feel the Grand Wailea has the best pool but Kids seem to love this pool there is an cave and kids play area. Not alot of privacy as around 4:00 alot of traffic as people are heading to the Luau so you get alot of stares as people walk to the Luau. Nice pool area. pool service was visible I can tell you now the type of crowd in Kaanapali is different than Wailea. There were people trying to bring there own liquor on the pool area and the waitress would prevent them if they caught them. Some nice spots along the grounds great views of sunset. It is on the quieter end of the kaanapali beach. Not much people seem to spend time on beach as you need to pay for the cabanas? ( why? since you don't as the four seasons for the same room rate? you go figure ?) Beach: Nice sandy beach, rocky beach bottom. We saw lots of action on this beach. parasailing, jet skis beach is more active than in Wailea but that is because the beach is shared by a whole chain of hotels. Nice walking distance to whalers village for shopping and snacks. Honest truth. The price you pay for this hotel. Service was averge but the rooms need to be upgraded. Hotel decor is outdated. Grounds are nice. If you like lots of people watching and entertainment and good food, you will like the resort feeling Kaanapali.

Upon entering the lobby with warm greetings from the staff, our first impression was of a tropical rain forest. The lobby is lush with greenery, bromeliads, lava rock planting beds and tropical birds. It is an attraction in itself, with markers detailing the native plants and trees. Our room was beautiful, spotless and well appointed for a partial ocean view. Our first visit, we had a two balcony room, one overlooking the West Maui Mts/golf course and one oceanside. Both were excellent, but the ocean view was warmer ,and not as easy to keep cool due to the bountiful sun. I would recommend not opening the mini bar or $$$ bottled water provided (the tap water makes the provided kona coffee taste bad) but head into Lahaina to the SafeWay and pick up some bottled water and soft drinks. The staff is wonderful, always pleasant and happy to help. Activities can be easily booked though the concierge at the hotel activities desk. Our first visit was during mid March, and it was a little more crowded, as it was the end of winter season on the mainland, and the whales were still visiting the harbor in Maui. We booked the whale watch tour on the Kiele from the hotel, and it did not fail to satisfy. On our most recent visit, we charted the Island Star sv (with several members of our group) which is a barefoot sail that is catered and provides snorkeling gear for a wonderful experience. Dining is an extravaganza of variety at the resort - with everything from sandwiches and fries by the beach, an oceanside sushi bar, a lushly tropical piano bar in the lobby to Spatts, an elegant Italian trattoria. If you're going to enjoy the resort, you should try every restaurant there! Our favorite is the breakfast buffet at Swan Court, the open air lagoon side restaurant. This alone is worth the trip. Then a stroll through the gardens is in order. For those who complain about the $$$ and the resort fees, please remember that it IS a resort. You can't expect to pay 3 star rates at a 5 star resort - however, you can avoid many of the fees by foregoing some of the luxury items, and 'diy'. Visit the grocery store in town - park your own car - enjoy the surrounding towns, and get your tan at home instead of renting beach cabanas.

Hotel Impressions: Check in wasn't bad, we got there at noon though and our room wasn't ready yet so they held our luggage while we lounged by the pool. My friend had something stolen from her bag though--just jewelry she had bought, so don't leave anything of value in an easy to reach bag compartment with the bellhop!!! it wasn't anything that important so we didn't make a big deal of it. Otherwise service was friendly and accomodating. Our room was nice, we had partial ocean view and it was very clean and roomy. The grounds at the hotel are pretty well maintained, and hardly any bugs! They also have live animals on the premises--ie penguins, flamingoes. The hotel overall is nice and clean but... Since it was the holiday season, the pool was definitely crowded. It was hard to find chairs but we did. We only went to the Hyatt to have one 'relaxing day' during our trip but we didn't even really get to enjoy it cuz there was so much other stuff we wanted to do before we left! But i did manage to spend a couple hrs lying on an inflatable float around the pool. They also have a big slide. The pool is huge so the pool wasnt crowded, it was the pool lounge area....and i hate that people would get up to leave for the day but leave their towels behind cuz then u dont really know if the chair is taken or not. The Drums of the pacific luau was fun. Partially cuz the hula boy dancers are hot ;) This is the only luau with a fire dancer and altho he messed up a couple times, he was hot so who cares. hehe. The food was pretty good. I guess it varies cuz one person at our table who's been there a few times said this time the food improved. HOWEVER my friend had a stomache problem afterwards but i was fine... it is a buffet though so thats bound to happen. But, if u want to skip the dinner and just see the show, u can if you are a guest. after dinner they open up the entrances and anyone can just drop in and see the performance for free. we had complementary breakfast (we booked thru expedia) and breakfast was great! u sit in a nice open area and its buffet style with fresh fruit and lots of other food stuff. didnt eat at the hotel otherwise though. all in all, we had a short stay here and it was nice. i would prob come back again but only for a short stay, since there are tons of things to do in maui. i checked out the Sheraton at black rock and i thought hyatt was nicer.", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed in Maui Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "jwatson2", "ReviewID": "UR6613543", "Content": "We recently spent 4 nights of our honeymoon at the Maui Hyatt and were extremely disappointed in the service recieved while staying there. I should preface this by saying we had spent the 4 previous nights at the Hyatt in Kauai and it was absolutely superb and highly recommended. Being on our honeymoon, I inquired about any possible upgrades and was informed we had booked too expensive of a room class to recieve anything free (first sign of poor customer service--can you believe they would actually tell us that??) but for $60 per night we could upgrade. I asked to see our booked room first. We were shown to our Regency Club partial ocean view room. Our room would more appropriately be called a highway view so I called down to see the other room--which was very nice (although we would later find that the toilet was not bolted down properly and had rocked and squeaked ever time we used it-not very romantic) but upon accepting the new room I was told it would cost $100 additional per night because there was nothing available on the Regency Club level. Instead this room was on a much lower floor--but the manager insisted that he could offer no other rate because he didn't want me to discuss how much I had paid poolside with other guests (next sign of really poor customer service). Beyond this we also experienced poor valet service when we had asked the valet to put the top down on our Jeep (and tipped him generously for) and he failed to properly put it down and we needed to pull over on the highway to redo it ourselves since it was flying up as we tried to reach Hana. Another example of really poor customer service was the flyer we recieved informing us that they would be repairing shower heads and would need access to the room Monday-Friday 9am --3pm. This type of repair should have been handled inbetween guest checkin and checkout--not during guest stays. One last sign of really poor service was the fact that they insisted on calling my new husband by my name even though we had clearly indicated his name on the hotel registry--perhaps a small item but since they handle honeymooners all the time I would expect this to be routine. The hotel itself was ok--perhaps a bit dated--with a nice pool area--but we would never stay here again.

The Hyatt came close to surpassing expectations but ultimately falls a bit short. First the positives: The lobby is beautiful and different than most hotels. It is full of exotic animals and has a nice tropical look. The kids (11 and 15) loved interacting with the animals and loved the fact that penguins were in the lobby. Service was above aveage. The hotel outsources its concierge and activity desk to Expedia and the Expedia employees who work on commission are eager to please. They know the island and follow up with you as if you are the only guest in the hotel. Service is consistently excellent throughout all departments. The pool is above average with more than enough swimming area, three waterfalls, a cave, volleyball nets and a fun but intense slide. We usually ate breakfast at the hotel and an occasional lunch. The breakfast buffet and ala carte menus are available in a restaurant by the pool or in a nicer restaurant with a view of the grounds. The later is pricier but offers a more elaborate buffet. We also had lunch at the pool restaurant and were pleased with the selection, taste and limited service (you self order and the waitress brings you your food in a pretty timely manner.) Vallet parking was smooth and the car was always waiting for me when I called ahead. Price was $12 per day and this avoided having to search for a spot after returning from an outing. Well worth it. Pleanty of shops in the hotel including a Macys. Hotel is located at the south end of the beach with a nice beach walkway to restaurants and shopping in what they call Whalers Village. Good excursions including a surfing lesson in Lahaina (next town south) two days of golf in Kapalua (over-rated and over-priced but still a must) a sail with Paragon (many good sailing/whale watching and snorkeling trips are available) wife spent two half days at spa and enjoyed and we took an all day trip to Hana by tour van which was nice but too long. We also were sold tickets to a show in Lahaina (Broadway style) depicting the history of Hawaii. This show (name escapes me) was one of the highlights of the trip. Ask the concierge and go. Also did the Hyatt's exclusive tour of the stars on its rooftop which was good but not great but a good way to bond w the kids for an hour. Took a day trip to the Aquarium on last day and liked it as well, explored the town of Paia and Waiela (Fairmont and Four Seasons and Big Beach) all worth the drives. OK now the negatives -remember we are tough to please and overall I would rate this hotel an 8 out of 10. We stayed during the Christmas week (12/23 to 1/1) and paid $550 per night for a pretty standard room which was classified as a partial Ocean view. It was on a low floor and was comfortable but nothing great. If your not going Ocean front I would go for the cheapest room. The partial Ocean view is nothing more than a glimpse of the ocean. With resort fee and tax it comes in over $600. Over-priced by any standard. The Hyatt is not a Four Seasons or Ritz. We also went to The Luau at the Hyatt on New Year's eve. Nothing special. Second time at a Luau. Fell asleep and paid $537 for myself, wife and two kids. Avoid this like the plague. Checking in on Saturday night was a bit of a problem as the cars go 20 deep and block the entrance to check in due to the hotel's very active night club Spatts. This was a Saturday night issue only. Two biggest problems with the property: A) The unimpressive Beach and the additional $40 they extort from you if you want the privilege of a \"Cabana\" which is really a set of two lounge chairs on the beach with a movable shade covering. These cabanas were difficult to rent during this busy period leaving many people with no ability to lay on the beach (Hyatt does not let you move a pool lounge chair to the beach - as they say Maui does not allow it.) You are allowed to buy a chair at Whaler's Village and bring it to the beach, but I did not see any guests doing so. This is way too expensive hotel not to have comfortable spots on the beach for its guests. In addition, the beach is very narow and nothing to write home about. If you are a beach lover (I am not) this hotel is not for you. A related problem was the game of musical chairs at the pool. The lounge chairs are gone by 9:00AM but the pool staff will find chairs for you if you ask them. They will generally bring them to a spot further away from the pool than most desire. The pool staff also tags chairs and attempts to enforce a no show for an hour lose the chair policy but the staff doesn't take the policy seriously. Simply put, they need another 100 chairs and should use the $600 a night to invest in them. B) Although I can afford this hotel and have stayed at RC and Four Seasons, I was offended by the nickel and diming at the Hyatt, including $12 to print boarding passes at the business center, absurdy mark-ups at shops in hotel for sundries, $10 to rent a tennis raquet despite $15 resort fee, $25 per person buffet breakfast with 12 being the oldest age for a kids price, $40 for beach chairs if you could get them and $537 for a Lual. In closing the hotel was very nice aand we had a good experience, but it was anaverage value, which is generally the price you pay forvacatioing in peak season.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Hotel!!

The place was knee deep in both. Since we would have preferred a bit more peace and quiet, this was a bit of a disappointment. However, a couple of comments to share: positive and negative...at the suggestion of other reviewers, we upgraded our room from a mountain view to a room on the Regency Club floor. It cost us an extra $145 PER NIGHT, although that also included an improved view (1/2 mountain and 1/2 ocean...very nice). What you also get for that is pass key access to the club lounge...continental breakfast in the AM, snackies and drinks during the day, and cocktails and nibbles in the evening. We probably saved a fortune in breakfast buffet costs and bar charges taking this deal! The lounge coffee maker was broken one morning, and the food was not particularly inspired, but the staff in this lounge were absolutely terrific....Friendly...willing to chat, make evening restaurant bookings and recommendations. Also with the Regency Club floor you get nice spa toiletries, towels get changed twice a day, and the A/C worked!!! We also liked that we were located in the main atrium...right at the center of things. Also nice was the lei and shell greeting by the bellman...and a great overview commentary and welcome. The staff here really are very nice. The only problem with the room was a leaky toilet, but since it didn't affect the worx, we weren't too bothered about it. A great power shower! The comments we read about the atrium lobby are true. It is a feast for the eyes and ears...birds, penguins, music, all out in the open...there is no roof on the atrium lobby, and the sun streams into the courtyard in the morning and you wake up to birds chirping and singing. Idyllic. There are also some nice shops in the hotel. A really nice Macy's. Travel agents. Jewellery shops. Gifts, sundries...fun to walk around and browse. There is a lovely beach walk between the hotel and the Whaler's Village and we walked this stretch of path quite a few times. The Westin and the Marriott (timeshare) are other hotels enroute. The beach at the Hyatt is virtually nonexistent and the pool area is always crowded...with LOTS OF KIDS...but we always managed to find lounge space on the grass overlooking the ocean. The food in the Hyatt Regency generally was not all that impressive. We ate in Spats twice, once in the Swan Court, and once in Cascades. It was pretty expensive. So were the cocktails around the pool, but the bar staff were also very friendly. The lunches we had in the Pavillion were pricey, but appetizing. Downtown Lahaina is close to the hotel. You can take a bus from the Whaler's Village for $1 each way, or grab a cab. There are lots of nice restaurants and shops to browse around in town. We highly recommend David Paul's. It was a feast for the culinary senses. We also ate at Lailanis in Whalers' (recommended). Avoid the Rusty Harpoon unless you like sports bars. Nice shops in the Whalers. Be prepared to drop some big bucks here. Hawaii ain't cheap, but the weather is what we went for, and we both came back brown and rested.

Things to do & things we didn't think were worth it: Mama's Fish House is one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had. The setting & the food were just wonderful! You need to go! It is expensive but worth it! Nick's Fishmarket's food was good, but the service was not. It seemed like the management lacked caring and experience. Pacifico was just wonderful too! If you plan to snorkel the crater, we had a blast with The Four Winds crew & Capt. John! They are so much fun & really seem to enjoy what they do! Snorkel Black Rock & go to the Sheraton for the torch lighting & dive. Kapalua Plantation course & restaurant were just awesome!

The grounds are beautiful. The main hotel area is basically one large open air atrium. It's lush, beautiful, well groomed and maticulously maintained. Is it five star? If 1 star is the lowest and 5 the highest, and the hotel is graded on a curve compared to other hotels on the island, it is 4 stars. The Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, and Kei Lani are just a cut above. If the Hyatt was on Oahu, it would be 5 stars. Nevertheless, even under this possibly unfair test, the resort grounds are great. The problem with this Hyatt is the service. To be fair, I notice service far more when I am travelling with my kids than I do travelling alone on business or with my wife on romantic holiday. As all of you travelling parents know, travelling with kids is stressful and difficult, so good service can make a vacation, and vice versa. To begin, the hotel did not deliver the room which was booked and confirmed prior to departure. We booked a room with a king bed and a sofa bed, and we received the resort's smallest room with 2 double beds. 4 people in a room is tough enough, but this room, with 2 side by side beds, left no room to move at all. We also paid the additional cost for a partial ocean view room, and we got a parking lot view. The bellman took over a half an hour to deliver our bags, which is unacceptable. If it was just my wife and I, we would have gone to the bar, had a mai tai, and enjoyed the surroundings, but we had 2 small kids in tow, and we had been travelling all day. A romantic walk around the gardens to kill time was not happening. To the hotel's credit, they moved us late the next day. While this was appreciated, we spent an entire day without unpacking, which is tough with kids. Another problem was with the maid service. I don't know if it was the location of our room or what, but they always came late in the afternoon. Again, this is unacceptable when travelling with kids as the late afternoon is when they either nap or clean up to go out to dinner. Getting a knock at the door at 4:00 from housekeeping when the kids are in bed is not appropriate. There are other issues as well. For one, while the family pool area is fantastic, there are no where near enough lounge chairs. If it were just a couple lounging in the sun, it doesn't matter as much, but with kids, you need a \"home base\" and it must be within eye shot of the play area. Also, the wait service in the family area is horrible. The servers admit that they are short staffed in that area, and that one of the reasons is that they sell much less alcohol in the family area so it does not get the attention that the adult area gets. The ladies were very polite, but they just couldn't cover the ground necessary to properly serve 100 families. At the breakfast buffet, there was little variety from day to day. There was no variety on the kids menu. They also were slow to clear plates to make room for new servings. Not a big thing, but a 5 star resort should do better. On the other hand, everyone was very polite. The valets were great. The family pool is terrific. Overall the place is nice. It's an upscale resort with all of the trimmings.

Upon arriving we were immediately greeted by the valet staff and our suitcases were unloaded very promptly from our rental car. My wife and I were given Lei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The ladies receive purple and white flowered lei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and mine was all white. My wife actually liked mine better and proceeded to wear it for several days. As we walked through the open-air lobby my wife mentioned to the bellman that we had never stayed in a place like this. She was overwhelmed by the appearance of the hotel and we had only entered its palm tree filled lobby. She was almost in tears as she was so happy. I immediately felt relief as I had picked this hotel after researching hotels for months on this very website. When we entered our room the bellman began to show us around. He was showing my wife this and that as I ran to the balcony to check out the view. I told my wife she had to see this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I guided her across the room to the most beautiful view I have ever seen out of a hotel balcony. Palm trees, the pool, and the Pacific Ocean is all we could see. It was an incredible view. We unpacked a few things in our room (#871) then headed downstairs. In the main part of the lower level of the hotel we passed store after store\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s included! My wife was speechless. The vases, the interior, everything was immaculate. I asked her\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.are you happy? She replied\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdyou did great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We were in Maui to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and this was a fantastic start to it. I had read about the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 24 hour exercise room so we decided to check it out. Upon entering it I saw for myself what a treadmill with a t.v. attached to it looks like and was very much impressed with the work out facility. It actually is not a room but a separate building. It has 8 treadmills, 6 elliptical machines, 6 stationary bikes, free weights, and countless weight machines. It was perfect. The chilled wash cloths were a refreshing idea. They actually chill them in ice. They also have ice cold water with lemons. The glass windows give you the opportunity to workout and actually see the waves hit the beach! What a workout facility! My wife worked out 5 days there and 3 for me. Yes she is more fit than me! Hint: In order to use the headphones on the treadmills you must unplug one of the cords and replace it with your headphone cord. It is easier to do this from behind the machine unless you are 6ft 5. We checked out the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luau on day 1. You can actually take a sneak peak at it without paying. We decided it looked fine so we bought tickets. One piece of advice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6You do not have to purchase luau tickets in advance prior to your arrival. You can purchase luau tickets on site through the concierge but at times they have cruise ships in port and they hold tickets for them. So some nights might be sold out. It is best to check on this on day # 1 of your stay. The food at the luau was fantastic. Steak, chicken, pulled pork, rice, salads, etc, etc. The show part of the luau lasted 1 hour and was excellent. The fire-knife dance was too good! The MC did a great job especially when he acknowledged the newlyweds and anniversary couples! We actually got to stand up and be acknowledged! I want to thank the singer who was entertaining the night of 10/17/06 at the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bar. I requested that he sing Time in a Bottle by Jim Croce as that song was played at our wedding. He did a great job! When we checked in we were told that breakfast would be included. Prior to our departure our Triple A rep told us that we must pay for breakfast so we were happy about that, as it runs $25 per person. The breakfast at Swan Court is more than incredible. They have everything you could imagine. Eggs, eggs benedict, omelets, pancakes, waffles, or French toast depending on the day, potatoes, toast, bagels, fresh pineapple slices, the list is indeed endless. For those of you that have not operated an industrial toaster you do not need to wait until all the pieces of bread have cleared the toaster to drop your piece of bread or bagel in. The breakfast area in Swan Court is open air. I was waiting to see a few birds show up as I had read that they sometimes like to do fly-bys in the breakfast area. Sure enough the little dive-bombers do show up. They never actually landed on our table in the 7 days we were there but I could see how some might think this is a little disgusting. The birds seem to congregate where dishes of food are being stored to go to the kitchen. The birds were only a minor distraction. Swan Court is awesome and its open-air atmosphere is ideal. To eat breakfast as swans both black and white swim by is too much. The waterfalls in the pond also make for a great background in pictures so try to get a table close to the front for all you digi people. The pool at the Hyatt is simply too much. Most people do not get in the water, they lay out and tan. The pool is very spacious, the most spacious pool we have ever seen at a hotel. I immediately swam to the falls part of the pool as I had been looking at a picture of that for months and wanted to be under it. It is incredible. You can then swim through caves to the pool bar. The nice thing about the Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool is they have a separate pool for kids! We did not eat at the hotel as we found their prices to be a little high. We did walk to Whalers Village. It is a must if you are staying in this area. Our brother-law told us of the village and we went there on night # 1. We ate at the Hula grill. There was about a 30-minute wait so we sat right at the bar and ordered food there. I saw the bartender making a drink that looked very interesting, so I inquired about it and was told it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lava Flow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was delicious. If you go to the Whalers Village you must have one of these drinks and from the Hula bar as I found they made the best Lava Flow on Maui! I recommend the Plantation Restaurant in Kapalua for a special dinner. Try to get there early so you can have one of their outdoor tables and see a magnificent sunset. Thanks to Juan for taking so many pictures of us. Whalers Village has many stores\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6For souvenirs go to the ABC Stores. They are everywhere on Maui. Hilo Hatties is the best though. It is located in Lahaina just off the strip. You must see the Banyan tree there also. It is located in Lahaina on Front Street approximately 1.5 miles from Cheeseburgers in Paradise. We only had minor gripes during our stay at the Hyatt. They are: No microwaves unless you pay $10 a day for them. I like to re-heat my coffee. No free internet. It costs .50cents a minute with a 10-minute minimum or $10 a day. This is ridiculous. Prices at the food court! $3.50 for a can of coke??? Why? Go to Safeway in Lahaina and stock up on Diet Dews! Our $15 resort fee (whatever that is) covers use of the tennis court for 1 hr daily. Racquets must be rented at $10 per racquet. Balls are $10 per bucket. My wife and I usually use only 3 balls when we play at home but sometimes I could use a bucket when playing with her! We were given a free bucket because we called ahead and were told the balls were free. Bring your own tennis balls from home and save the confusion. The courts are deluxe, by the way, equipped with water cup holders! P.S. I beat my wife 6-1. Only one call was disputed by her. When we play tennis we are serious so I thought I should mention this. Overall our stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui was outstanding and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. A special thanks to the housekeeping staff for the excellent job they did everyday. Final rating: 9.2 Nateroo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out of 10. Add a micro and free internet and all the stars I have will go to the Hyatt. Good Job. I recommend: Taking a drive to the blowhole at Nakalele Point. Bring the video camera and hike all the way down to the blowhole. Just be careful on those rocks! If you go to Hana plan on making it an all day adventure. Forget about going to the Garden of Eden \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at $10 per person it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rip-off. Do see the volcano. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it at sunrise but it is awesome at 11am also.

You could only see the ocean if you went out on the balcony and looked over. I called to ask about it and they said that is the best they had, would not upgrade us unless we paid. I would have never opted for a partial ocean view to look at that every day!!! That night, we heard the band clear as day in our room (DON'T stay in the Atrium tower either!!!)...we heard every foot step on the tile hallways and the people next to us opening and closing their doors.

The other main gripe I have besides all the noise is the resort fee...you pat $15 every day for access to the fitness area and basically nothing else....you have to pay extra for valet parking($12 per night) otherwise you have to self park your car...which we didn't mind and were glad to do, only to find out that you have to hunt for a parking space each time and all the spaces are cramped because they only give you two tiny lots to choose from for all those cars!!!...you also have to pay to get chairs on the beach...otherwise you can get a chair by the pool which was insanely crowded..it reminded me of the pools in Vegas...they cram you all around and there is NO space between chairs...also no fridge in the room....you have to call and ask and be put on a wait list for it...

The room was very spacious and cool, it is was beginning to look a bit worn but was very pleasant and the bed was extremely comfortable. Our main gripe was the food - it was incredibly expensive and not worth the money. We were not at all impressed with the breakfast, it was a case of quantity over quality and I found it difficult to eat anything bar cereal and fruit. We also ate in Pavillion, Son'z and Spats. We would only return to Son'z where the setting was incredibly romantic and the food was excellent, however the service was overfamiliar, loud and generally much too casual for the standard of restaurant and put a blemish on an otherwise wonderful night. The food in the other places was barely mediocre. We spent our days by the pool. The beach in front of the hotel is sandy and clean but narrow and there are only 10 cabanas which have to be rented for $40 per day. The pool is therefore incredibly crowded and noisy as they pack in as many loungers as possible. We would definately return to Maui although we would not stay at the Hyatt again.

It was overall great. There was a slight problem with our room (two doubles instead of a king), but that was taken care of the second day of our stay - and we were offered an ocean view for no charge. We were happy with the partial ocean view and mountain view room - with two balconies - so went with that and not the ocean view, but we appreciated the courtesy they showed. The room was excellent - and we saved money by getting a free refrigerator brought in - there's a Safeway food store nearby. The people at the front desk were great. Friendly, courteous, and very informative. The Hyatt is composed of several large hotel buildings connected seamlessly by long hallways with stores and stairs to the outside. The main lobby is open to the weather - with great plants and animals (exotic birds and penguins). The activities/concierge folks at the Hyatt were way too biased, obviously trying to sell their favored vendors and not doing much to share info about free activities. We picked up \"Maui Revealed\" and used it to guide what we did. We, for instance, went with the Old Lahaina Luau rather than the one at the Hyatt. It was more authentic and impressive all around. We loved the open bar - and for $1 took a bus from nearby Whalers Village (15 min. walk) to and from the luau in Lahaina, getting off at the Cannery Mall. Although too much like salespeople, when we did use the concierge/activities folks at the Hyatt, they were good - we used them for the bike ride down the volcano and parasailing. They put it right on the bill - and seemed to save us a few dollars. We loved the included breakfast at the Hyatt - at Swanz restaurant. The buffet was full of fresh food - dozens of options each morning. The restaurant is fancy - it's surrounded by a pond with several swans. The grounds at the Hyatt are absolutely exceptional - the best in an area of Maui that is very nice to begin with. The pool is huge with waterfalls, water slides, shady areas, and a bar. We brought our own beer and snacks from the convenience store on site and drank for a fraction of the price while watching the sunset. The beach in front of the Hyatt is lacking, but there are great beaches 5 minutes away. We went to Black Rock, which is near the Sheraton at the end of the beach walkway in Kaanapalli. We saw two large sea turtles while snorkeling!! The most absurd policy of the Hyatt is the requirement that beach lounges (two side-by-side) cost $40 per day to rent. The $15 per day resort charge, which is never directly mentioned, suggests that the Hyatt management could use a course in honesty in advertising. I forgave them on that because we got a good deal, and I likely would have made a lot of noise if I wasn't on my honeymoon. The price for rental of snorkeling equipment was likewise usurious and when I asked why it was so much, the worker lied to me about the Hyatt including more than other companies. We went to Snorkel Bob's in Lahaina and we got great beach chairs and guidance - and still saved money. Topping off our great experience with that company was advice related to the environment, including how to be an eco-friendly tourist. In addition to Black Rock, a sacred rock outcropping near the Hyatt, we went to Big Beach off Makena Alanui Road in South Maui, a 45 minute ride that was worthwhile. The Spa was not cheap, but compared to mainland charges, fair in its pricing ($140 for an hour massage). The spa facilities are first rate - including the ocean-front \"relaxation room.\" The facilities are available without the pricier massages, etc. for $15 per day. The exercise facilities (which are under the spa - also beachfront) are included, so you could have a good day of exercising then relaxing in the jacuzzi, steam room, etc., for just $15 extra. That's not cheap, but worth it if you're looking to really, really relax. There are several things about the Hyatt I would change, but it is the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. The few things I would change relate to their policies, not the facilities or the people who work there (other than the biased concierges).", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "fffaaazzz", "ReviewID": "UR5920755", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui for five nights in late September 2006.

Good restaurants and wonderful breakfast buffet. The only down side were the additional charges that I was made aware of upon check-in. You would think that the money they charge per night for the room was enough. There is a $15.00 a day resort fee, as well as a $12.00 valet parking fee. I would have parked the car myself but could never find the public lot. I was told it was quite a distance away from the property. So if you stay 7 days, you can count on close to another $200 on your charge when you check out. Plus all the other charges you put on your room just for convenience --- like spa, luau, dinner, drinks, etc. I traveled as a single for the first time.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unbelievable how everybody with the hotel staff is so friendly and helpful, from the front desk lady, to the Regency Club staff, the swimming pool staff or the cleaning lady. They are all ready and willing to walk the extra mile to support your needs. The swimming pool (state-of-the art, with 2 water slides), garden, lobby, and all the public areas are extremely well kept though the property isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brand new. Our room was on the 19th floor with a stunning view over the swimming pool area, the beach and the Pacific Ocean, of course. Believe me the only thing better then a sunset in Maui is the sunset you get the day after, and from our room we had a first row seat for the show. The room itself is well dimensioned with a reasonably sized bathroom and walk-in closet. The balcony is great to stare at the ocean during sunset or simply to take a relaxing break during a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spent on the beach. The fact is that nothing stands out in the room, except for the awesome view.

Regarding the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been pretty disappointed: food at Pavillion is really overpriced, for a quick and casual lunch, make yourself a favor and walk to the Marriott, food there is better and reasonably priced. Swan Court is good for breakfast or dinner. Dinner at Spats Trattoria is good but pricey and by the way, being in beautiful Maui, who on Earth want to dine underground, windowless? I suggest dining at the Whalers Village or at Lahaina (10 minutes from the hotel by car). This hotel itself offers some good shopping too: I had a great time shopping at Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and you can walk yourself through a kind of galleria with more than 20 shops.

The hotel was clean, but not spotless. The rooms were somewhat dated and I would have liked the room to be larger especially since our teenagers were with us. The bathroom was especially crowded. The bathroom amenities and towels were first-rate as was the bedding. We had an in-room coffee machine. We opted for the Regency Club floor, partial ocean view and were entirely happy. The Club breakfast room offers fruit and juices, an nice espresso machine, hot cooked oatmeal, cereals/milk, bagels, toast and bottled water. We would take several waters for our trips away from the resort. At around noon they provided beverages and snacks and in the evening they have appetizers, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, veggies trays, and cheese/fruit trays with crackers. We aren't big eaters and found the fare entirely adequate. We ate at Cascades once and found the food to be average. The Swan Court was expensive and often had a line to get seated. The pool area was very nice. There is very little \"crowd control\" and I suspected that many of the lounge chairs were being occupied by guests from other resorts or locals. The chairs became scarce at about noon. You can rent a cabana on the beach and even have a massage in one of the beach spa cabanas. The waiters/waitresses were great...friendly, prompt, and engaging. There is a food area and bar where you can purchase sandwiches, burgers, et al and very expensive. There is a narrow beach in front of the hotel, not safe for swimming and not large enough to sunbathe. Immediately north about a 15 minute walk away is the very nice Kaanapali beach, great for swimming, boarding and sunning. Whaler's Village, a shopping and dining area is about a 20 minute walk. The best part of the resort was the Fitness Center, nice machines, free weights and treadmills...open 24/7 for those of us from east of Hawaii who are still waking up to our time zone. The resort sports a Catamaran, the Kiele V. We took an evening cruise and snorkel trip with the crew and were duly impressed. Michael and Amy were especially admirable crew members!

We had one episode where I guess a circuit breaker tripped in the night, but in calling the front desk, it was restarted in less than five minutes. It is very kid-friendly and my three year old daughter had a marvelous time. Getting poolside space can be challenging especially if you show up later in the morning. I would say that by 11am during the weekends or on a forecasted relatively cloudless day, almost all poolside chair / loungers were taken. Not much problem for us since our daughter was up at 9am each day eager to swim, but I can see how this can be somewhat troublesome for couples who want to get up later in the day. We also took advantage of the on-property spa and exercise facilities. The spa was beautiful and had excellent staff for our treatments. Pricey for the services - my wife and I had both massages and facials and cost was about 3-4x more than comparable treatments elsewhere - but we both thought it was worth it because of its location and the experience of the being pampered in Maui.

There was a serious problem getting chairs at the pool. People would come down to the pool and \"reserve\" them with a towel, then leave for several hours to get breakfast. It is not fair to those who are at the pool and want a seat. The chairs were old with plastic backing and the towels were old and crunchy. Room service for a bowl of ice cream for my young daughters was estimated at 1 hour. when we finished the ice cream, the tray was placed outside our room.

The size of the pool was impressive. The Hyatt has over 800 rooms which were sold out during our stay but the pool never felt or looked overcrowded. They never ran out of fresh towels poolside like other places we've stayed. Our older kids enjoyed the waterslide and the deeper parts of the pool (9 feet). There was a separate pool for younger children complete with a sandy beach, small waterslide and water spouts. Our 1 year old was intrigued by the water spouts coming out of the ground. The staff was very courteous, friendly and accommodating. Service was excellent. Poolside servers were attentive and food orders were filled quickly which is important when children are involved.

However, I wanted my kids to have the large resort hotel experience with the nice pools and waterslide, so we decided to spend two nights here before checking into our condo. We had booked a Regency Club Partial Ocean view, and upon arrival were upgraded to a full ocean view. Very pleasant front desk and bell staff. Our bellman was very informative. Our room was one floor below the Regency Club level, but both floors require a room key to operate the elevator to those floors. (A little bit of a hassle if you forget your key like my kids did and were planning to just knock on the door.) Our room was #2127 and it was gorgeous - a corner room with two balconies, one with a full view of the mountains and the other a direct (but southernly view) of the ocean. We could see the ocean without having to step out on our lanai. The room decor is very attractive, and furnished like you would see on the hotel website, with a king bed and a sofa which opens up into a sofabed. A little tight for four people but we were expecting this. The king bed was very comfortable, and the rest of the furnishings very attractive. We had a cot and a mini fridge sent up, and they arrived very quickly. The cot was huge and took up a lot of room. The bathroom was very attractive, however the tub and toilet are in the same room together and it is a little tight in there. However the sink and make up area are very spacious and have a marble top. A hair dryer is provided. Two bathrobes were provided as well. There is a mirrored closet door which made it easier for me to put my makeup on than doing it at the sink. The shampoo, conditioner, soaps, and lotions are all from the spa, and are to die for - really good quality products that smell incredible. The room also has an optional HP Printer that you can use to print your digital camera photos - the paper and ink cartridge are provided for a cost of $29.00. You just insert the camera card in it. We did not use it but thought it was a nice option if you want to print your photos. The TV has internet service and a keyboard which we did not use either. The Regency Club is well worth the extra money in my opinion - all four of us got free breakfast both days, and the evening snacks and cocktails were well worth it. They had huge sandwiches and plenty of food to make dinner out of it for at least one night. Plus you can go up there all day and get drinks and sodas. the Regency room is very pleasant with it's own concierge, who booked some tours for us while we were there having breakfast. We found the tours a little cheaper going through the concierge, than in the regular tour brochures. There is a little booklet the Hyatt Regency puts out with their own tour list, and it does pay to go through them. We booked a catamaran sunset cruise on the hotel sailboat, and saved $10 a person going through the concierge. Anyway, we felt the Regency club was well worth the extra cost, as meals are very expensive in Hawaii, and we got breakfast for four two days in a row, free sodas and drinks all day long, and even made dinner out of it one night. I feel it was a real convenience and saved us quite a bit of money. We were very impressed with the Hyatt's pool area, and my children, 12 and 14, just loved the waterslide. We also swam in the ocean several times, and the fact that the hotel does not have much beach is not a big deal, there are so few people on it anyway. The water was warm and clear, but the bottom quickly gives way to rock and coral, so I would advise bringing a pair of cheap water shoes (we bought some at KMart when we came in from the airport.) The pool area is just beautiful, and we never had a problem getting a chair, as they seemed to be plentiful. My husband and I got the couples massage under the cabana by the ocean, and it was very relaxing and a wonderful experience. If you get a massage, you also get free use of the spa for the day, so my husband took advantage of that. My 12 year old son decided to get his hair cut there, and we got a wonderful \"surfers\" haircut from Ingrid at the spa. The stores located adjacent to the Hyatt kept my 14 year old busy in the evening, and seemed to offer a nice array of shops. She particularly liked the Macy's bathing suit store. The kids also enjoyed the penguins in the lobby, as well as the parrot and koi fish ponds. They were just so bowled over by all the wildlife on the property. My husband and daughter ate at Spatts one night, and really enjoyed their meal there.

The best deals for clothing was at the Maui Mall near the airport. Same shirts as in Lahaina, but 1/2 the price. We went to Iao Valley and the windsurfing beach and Road to Hana. All were worth the time...so beautiful and captivating. We had been to Maui in 1975 and were surprised to see all the changes.

We spent 2 days prior at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and prices were extremely high there with no beach atmosphere!!!!We ate at the Hyatt 5 nights and found dinner to be most enjoyable. The sunsets at 7:15 p.m. were spectaular. We went on the Sunrise tour and the 36 mile bike ride down to be life changing---it felt like the world was just beginning. It was beauitiful. We also took a tour with 2 other people to Hana and the seven pools. I would suggest taking a tour for this they take you the back roads and it only takes 2 hours rather than 4. The hike through the bamboo trees and up to the rain forest was also great. We spent one afternoon in Lahina. It reminded us of Key Weest. Cheesburgers in Paradise was our spot for lunch that my 18yr. old loved. The beaches were beautiful----come on you are in Hawaii. My son went boogie boarding everyday. The only 2 areas that I would complain about if any was the Hyatt's Luai was a very expensive tourist trap. If you have traveled to Mexico or any Carribean Island you will see the same show. The food was average and you were packed in like cattle. Skip the Luai. I always wanted to see one and felt like we were on a Cruise ship. The only other area is all meals are very expensive. We have travelled to Europe almost every summer and have been to most of the Carribean, and Mexico and these meal prices were very high.

We also found the bed to be VERY VERY comfortable!! Upon our arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a ocean deluxe room. We looked over the ocean and the pool.

Had something different every morning and for lunch ventured to Lahaina or down the path to Whaler's Village (VERY VERY CONVENIENT AND FUN SPOT) to grab something. No big deal at all.

I must say I am surprised by all the raves, I believe the Hyatt Kauai is the Best Hyatt in the entire Hawaiian Islands. As you can tell I was disappointed when I arrived at the Hyatt Regency on Maui. Drive from Kahului to Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali: I think the State of Hawaii and the County of Maui should spend some money on the development of better ways to get to West Maui. When you rent a car and look at the timeline it will take you to drive to Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali or Kapalua, it says it will take you 45 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 60 minutes driving time. However, it does not include the traffic jams you encounter in Lahaina. It took me 2 hours to get to the Hyatt. Only 1 road in and out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 How whacked is that? Hyatt: I think overall, most of the disappointment was due to the fact I felt the hotel was really showing its age. I stayed at the Regency Level on the 22nd floor overlooking the Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali South Golf Course. The Regency Club and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff was great and added to stay. However, if you are on the 22nd floor the elevators are slow and will take forever to get to. Speaking about the Elevators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dark and Humid, you will need your Regency Club Card to get to the 22nd floor. The reason I mention this, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dark and you need to have it in hand to slide into the slot. Restaurants: Overpriced and the food is just OK. Checkout some of the restaurants in Lahaina, I think you will be very surprised without the $$$. Luau Show: Met some friends at the Drums of the Pacific, since we could not get into the Old Lahaina Luau. We had experienced other luau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Kauai and Oahu, so we wanted to try the VIP treatment. We were given a table near the stage under this tree that kept dropping things on our table. When we went to the Luau Buffet, we found the food to be exceptional, however the numerous flies kept us from enjoying our meal. Our waiter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd told us it only happens during the summer???? That did not make sense. Pools: The pools were PACKED full of old lounge chairs that were inches apart. The beach was rocky and murky. Golf: The only Course Open was the South Course, since the North is being redone. Slow Play and over used greens. I played at several courses at Kapalua (Bay & Plantation) and Wailea (Gold & Emerald), which was out of this world. Other Activities: Para Sail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c You need to book this a day or two in advance. Overall the Kaanapali area did not feel very \"Hawaii\". If you are looking to stay on this Island here are a few tips. For some of you looking for the sun without all the traffic, I would suggest the Wailea area and all it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful Hotels. If you are looking for cooler climate with some clouds, but beautiful views, try Kapalua and the Ritz.

I think overall, most of the disappointment was due to the fact that the grounds and the hotel were not nearly as manicured as Kauai. I felt the hotel was really showing its age. Sure, I have seen worse, but coming from somewhere 20 times better made it hard to remember that. It would have helped if we felt the staff was accomodating, but in fact we found them rude and curt. Furthermore, we were only offered rooms by the elevator shafts which were noisy. The cleaning staff also had some sort of work room by the elevators and all we heard all day were carts and doors banging around.

We hadn't been to Maui in years and previously always stayed at the Westin. Then, a very thoughtful reviewer mentioned how the Westin was now overrun with kids due to the timeshare boom there - and how the Hyatt seems to \"isolate the kids to their own pool area and absorb them with their large grounds\" making them a non issue. I got a laugh out of that but it is a very apt description. We walked down to the Westin a few times on the way to Whaler's village (really fun shopping there) and it looked like Disneyland~ I am not exaggerating when I say that I must have seen about 25 kids for every adult running around there. The arrival was great at the Hyatt, the staff is so friendly and we loved the lei greeting and the grand lobby. Be sure to use valet when you arrive or you will miss the lei greeting. And the first night of valet is free, and then soars to something like $25 per night. After that, park yourself, it's a breeze and then you don't have to wait in line for your car each time you want to leave as well. We were offered a deluxe ocean view upgrade for $75 and said yes, and it was so worth it. Absolutely made a world of difference to my husband and I but neither set of our parents would do it, and stared out at the parking lot instead. We had the free buffet breakfast - used the AAA discount when we booked online, and the best room rate I saw available as well ($325 nightly). I never found the Swan Court Breakfast deal anywhere else and believe me, I looked. It meant the world to our discount-oriented parents, possibly their favorite part of this high end vacation. It is scrumptious and elegant and a great way to start the day. If you have to pay yourself, it is $25 per person. If the line is long when you get there, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, it moves really fast. I saw the line up the stairs on Sunday and was seated and eating within 15 minutes. Anyway, as I mentioned, the Whaler's village is great, and if the walk back to the hotel in the heat seems daunting, there are free busses back to the hotels that run out front of the center. We happened on to that by mistake and were so pleased - it was really, really hot the week we were there. They said about 85 - 87 degrees but we were actually uncomfortable everyday between about 10 am and 4 pm, but because of our parents, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do the pool or beach. We snuck off a few times and the beach outside the Hyatt may not be the best, but walk just a little bit down and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine, the ocean was wonderful and we went in every chance we got. We loved Warren and Annabelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s went there mainly for our parents but we really loved it. Check out the review in Maui Revealed, it is right on. And the place is adorable, and each person gets their own plate of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcappetizers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, huge and more than enough, followed by gigantic desserts. We asked for fresh fruit instead and they were accommodating. You spend about an hour in this beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsalon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, watching a piano show and eating, and then the awesome show is in an intimate 78 person theatre. We had a party of six and they saved us 6 seats together, and made sure we had a lovely table together. It was fancier and better than I have seen reviewed on this site. We went on a dinner cruise, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t love it, could be because we frequently go on San Francisco Bay and the Maui ones don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare. Cheeseburger in Paradise was about $100 for 6 with only 2 drinks, it's just ok, and if you sit upstairs in the bar, it will be loud because of the band. A trip to Grand Wailea was nice they have some great art in their lovely lobby, and we had a superb lunch at Longhi's there - at the mall. I hear that it has gone down in quality (used to be a favorite of ours) but lunch is fractions of the price and we loved the lobster cannelloni. Also had dinner at the Cascades at the hotel and it was perfect but try to get a table outside if you can, as a larger party we were stuck inside and wished we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

Without a doubt, this was the right place.

Very relaxing experience. All the restaurants were good, particularly Cascade's for dinner (where we sat outdoors) and breakfast at Sonz. The snorkel tour was fun and the sunset cruise was as well. We got pretty wet on the sunset cruise, though, so dress casually if you go. The luau was terrific; we opted for the VIP seating and it was definitely worth it. Didn't have to wait in line standing in the hot sun, the waiters brought us drinks at our table, and we got to eat first. Good food, too. The concierge/activity desk was very helpful as we set up our outings for the week. Johanna was wonderful. In fact, every employee at the Hyatt was helpful, friendly and courteous. We used valet parking (for the convertible; worth the extra for this, too) when we first arrived but self-parked later because the lot was close.

We never had any problems with parking, noise, or crowds. The pools, waterfalls, and water slide are fabulous! Perfect temp, too! There were no problems finding chairs at the pool, and there was a nice mix of families (we brought our two kids ages 10 & 13), honeymooners, and anniversary folks. The Hyatt's location at the end of resort strip is perfect. Not too busy!! We loved the beach in front of the Hyatt and swam there often. No problems with smells or other oddities others have mentioned about the water. We did not find the beach too small. The daily breakfast buffet was incredible; we ate their every morning. My husband and I's buffet were included in our package, and our son's buffet was free every day because of his age (10). The buffet included made-to-order omlettes, three kinds of sausages, scrambled eggs, toast, muffins, breads, pancakes, french toast, waffles, apple crepes, cheese blitzes (with strawberry sauce), eggs benedict, bacon, fruit...I could go on and on. Who could ever get tired of that selection?? We loved our room in the Napili tower third floor overlooking foliage and the ocean (Room 318). Note, however, that the smoking floor is the fourth floor and we could occasionally smell cigar and cigarette smoke. Next time we'll ask for a room on a higher floor. Also note that the beds sit on large wooden platforms with big corners. I rammed my ankle into it a few times and came home with a bruised, and slightly swollen ankle. I used towels to cover the corners but later learned that the Hyatt has pads available to cover the corners. Ask for the pads! After looking walking by other properties, we were glad we changed to the Hyatt from the Westin before departing. As others have mentioned, the Westin seemed busy (partly due to location, layout, and size of the property) and appeared dated. In our opinion, the Hyatt is a notch above the Westin but is still comfortable to stay at (not stuffy). We did not feel nickeled-and-dimed at all. Our refrigerator and roll-away came up with our luggage (no extra charge). Prices for other things were what we would expect to pay at a resort island.

We did extensive research on where to stay in Kanaapali- and upon checking out other properties nearby, were extremely happy with our choice. The Hyatt is upscale yet tropical- they take great pride in the uptake of the hotel, especially the beautiful gardens. While this is a large resort, there is never a shortage of chairs by the pool- or on the lawn nearby over looking the ocean. We walked the entire beach walk and definitely thought that the ambiance and beauty of the property far exceeded the others- the Westin was a distant second, but seemed much more hectic and not as lush and tropical. The Sheraton did not look that nice, even thought had a great location on Black Sand beach- you can easily walk there from the Hyatt- so we were actually happy to be away from the crowds that snorkel there during the day. The rooms were very nice, with the exception of the check-in experience. We arrived late from the West Coast and were met by a rude front desk who informed us that there were no more Partial Ocean view rooms left with king beds. This was quite annoying to argue about at midnight after a long trip- particularly after I confirmed our view and bed type numerous times via phone and received email confimations from the hotel the week before arrival. She was quite unapologetic- to the point of rude- definitely no \"aloha spirit\" there. Upon complaining the next day- we were informed that they do not guarantee bedding type only view (this seems ridiculous...). However, this front desk associate was much friendlier and offered to upgrade us to a deluxe ocean with a king for no extra cost- but we would have to wait until the following day. It was worth the wait, since our room on the 18th floor of the Napili Tower was fabulous- with a gorgeous view and breeze, even being set above the pool- we could hear the waves crashing at night. The rooms are very well kept and incoroprate some local flavor while still being high end. The beds and linens were great and housekeeping was very prompt and did a great job. We ate breakfast in the room every morning on our lanai - storing some light yogurt, juice and fruit in our mini fridge that we requested. Otherwise the service was good- not excellent, but given that this a larger resort there is no hand holding here like the Four Seasons. However, there is an activity booking center on-site and Jeffrey at the concierge desk was wonderful- giving us some honest local advice. This resort offers a multitude of restaurants, but there are so many other great ones nearby in Whalers Village and otherwise (Sansei, Hula Grill, Mama's, etc- that there is no need to stay at the hotel every night). We had the breakfast buffet at Swan Court a couple days, which was pricey but good. The pool food is good and we thought rooms service (definitely worth a sunset dinner on the lanai if you have an ocean view) was very tasty and worth the cost. The gym at the Hyatt is excellent- providing cold cloths, chilled lemon water and some great views from the machines. The pools and waterslide were fun (even for us with no kids!) -- the only thing is that pool chairs could have been upgraded, since quite a bit of them are broken and did not have any cushions. Definitely utilize the beach walk for some excercize or a stroll to dinner. Also, we never utilized the valet and never had any problems using the self park.

The second day we were there, they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and gave us a photo album for pictures. The grounds were absolutely beautiful and well kept. The pools were nice, but very crowded with all ages. My husband enjoyed the pools and slides. We lounged by the hotel near the beach one afternoon, and a waitress was available to serve food and drinks. The beach, however is just a narrow strip of sand, but just a few minute walk will take you to a wider beach, and there's great snorkling near black rock in front of the Sheraton(but it was also very crowded). The breakfast buffet at Swan Court was very good, especially the pancakes, fruits, and eggs benedict. The atmosphere there was beautiful. The fitness center was nice. Cardio equipment with TV's for each, weights, cold water, towels, and enough space to work out in. The only disappointment at the Hyatt, was the Luau, which was overpriced, and crowded, and although it says all-you-can-eat buffet, when we got up to get seconds, the food had already been taken away. The food was very good, however. They only served drinks before we ate and after that, the waiter didn't come by. I've been to much better Luau's at different hotels.

This was the first major vacation for my whole family. We split our time in Maui between this hotel, and the Grand Wailea. We chose these two hotels because of their water features which are important for those of us with kids! This hotel is wonderful! My wife was born and raised in Hawaii so we've stayed in the islands quite a bit. This is one of the best hotels in Maui, IMHO, due to its prime location in Ka'anapali, and some very nice amenities. Given my exposure to the Hawaiian culture (I even drum now for a Hula troop run by my wife's sister), I can honestly say this hotel has a lot of the Hawaiian flavor. Being there felt like I was distinctively in Hawaii. It's not the newest of hotels, but they do a great job at keeping it up quite nicely. It was very clean and decently maintained. The rooms were not elaborate nor luxerious compared to other hotels in which we've stayed, but were very comfortable for my wife and me and our two boys (ages 3 and 1 at the time). The pool and grounds were fantastic! The grounds were very lush and very Hawaiian! (As opposed to other hotels which have Hawaiian themes, but are still very \"European\". Walking on the \"rope bridge\" through the gardens reminded me of my drive years ago along the winding road to Hana (in Maui). They also had live birds and a wonderful coi pond which captured my boys' attentions and imaginations. I can't stop raving about this hotel, and I've stayed at some of the best in Maui (The Ritz in Kapalua and the Grand in Wailea). While the rooms and infrastructure really aren't even on the same page as the Ritz or the Grand, all of the other intangibles move it right up there with this five star hotels. Great job!

The room was great and the beds are unbelievably comfortable. We never had a problem finding chairs at the pool. The main pool connects to the kiddie pool by way of waterfalls and a grotto bar. It was fabulous. It never seemed terribly crowded and there were not tons of kids. The service at the hotel was excellent. Eveyone who works there is friendly and are happy to help with anything you need. They also have several shops including Macy's, a sandal shop and a photo shop. I cannot think of one thing that we did not like about this hotel. We'd definitely stay there again. The Swan Court breakfast buffet at the hotel is nice and there was a big variety. We ate at the pool restaurant for lunch twice. We ususally went to Lahaina to eat. Lahaina Coolers was our favorite breakfast spot (best french toast ever). Bubba Gumps and Cheeseburger in Paradise are great for lunch or dinner. A definite must for dinner is Mama's Fish House. It is about an hour away from the Hyatt but well worth the drive. Everything they serve that night is caught earlier that day. Not only was the food great, but the atmosphere of the restaurant is unbelievable. Make your reservations before you get to Maui and ask for a table by the window. Also, try to get there early to take pictures on the beach before your reservation. The view is wonderful. The town that you drive through (Paia) is quaint. I wish we could have stopped. Also , nearby there's an Ocenarium and a park with bumper boats and a miniature golf course, which our daughter loved. We also went to the Old Lahaina Luau. Make sure to make your reservations for this luau as soon as you book your Maui trip. It's extremely hard to get a reservation.

Other than breakfast, we did not eat there, but they have a few options. Their gym is amazing, a little bit of a hike down the Kaanapali path, but so worth it with all of their great equipment. They offer chilled towels and water with oranges for/after your workout, which I loved. Headphones are also available to plug into the Cardio theater type equipment.

If you are looking for a very large resort experience, this is a beautiful place to stay. As the other reviews have stated, the lobby, pools and grounds are very beautifully landscaped and well-kept, and I have to say that the entire hotel was spotlessly clean. We didn't spend much time at the pools, but they are large and expansive, and every day I noticed that there were ample pool chairs available as well as chairs that sit on the lawn overlooking the ocean. The staff of the hotel were all very pleasant and really made us feel welcome. This resort is located at the end of Kaanapali Beach, so it is a bit of a walk to get down to Whalers Village and snorkeling at Black Rock. We loved the walk down the beach path, especially at night when the moon was full, but just some info for anyone who may not enjoy walking. Also, you have to walk about five to ten minutes to get to the wider, larger area of swimming beach, as the beach in front of the Hyatt is rocky. I saw several people snorkeling in front of the Hyatt, but we walked down to Black Rock to snorkel. Easy entry and a lot of fish! Also, about the children thing that I saw in many reviews: yes, there are kids here, but I think you will find that with any resort that is not adults only. We like kids and enjoyed watching them play, but the hotel certainly wasn't overrun with them and we did not find that they disrupted our \"honeymoon\" time at all! There are two reasons that this resort lost a circle for us: One is that the hotel decor is a little dated...it seems to have not been renovated in a long time. But as I said, it is impeccably clean and well-maintained. The second reason was just a glitch we had with our room assignment...if you do stay here, ask to be put in one of the two towers that have been renovated. There is one tower, to the far left as you are facing the hotel, in which the carpets have not been changed out and are very stained (we checked two rooms with the same problem before being moved to a different tower). The staff was most accomodating in helping us rectify this problem and even gave us entry to the Regency Club for the rest of our stay to compensate us. We are not the complaining type, but the state of the carpets in that tower was pretty disappointing, especially when we were paying for a full oceanfront room. They said they are scheduled to renovate that tower as well, I just don't know when. Our new room was much better with a beautiful view of the ocean. We didn't eat at the hotel much, but did enjoy the breakfast buffet that was included in the price. I wouldn't pay $50 a day for it if it wasn't worked into the price, however. We mostly ate down in Lahaina, which is only a five-minute drive away. Check out Aloha Mixed Plate right next door to the Old Lahaina Luau on Front Street if you want amazing local food! If you go there during the Luau hours, you can hear the Luau going on, as it is right next door. The prices there were incredibly low for wonderful food. We skipped many other high-end restuarants we were planning on visiting to eat there several times! Hula Grill in Whaler's Village was also delicious and a fun atmosphere. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt very much! Personally, I preferred the condo experience we had in Kauai before coming to Maui, but that's just my preference. We spent most of our time out seeing the islands and don't really like to hang around the hotel much.

DH and I spent our honeymoon in Maui. We stayed at the Hyatt for a week in June/July 05. I cant say anything but positive things about the hotel. We received a lei upon our arrival and spent a little time walking around the beautiful grounds. We were in a regency club ocean view room. We had two balconies and a gorgeous view of the ocean and moutains. The waves lulling us to sleep at night is something I'll never forget. Our room was always clean. No complaints. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. We ate at two restaurants, Cascades and Swan Court. And also at the poolside grill. All the food was good. Cascades was actually our favorite dinner in Maui. Sunset, right next to the beach, amazing steak and lobster. Swan Court was also very good and very romantic, aside from the toddler running around our table while his parents looked on. We used the Regency Club for breakfast and snacks and drinks on most days. Glad we had that option! We only used the pool one evening. I will say that it did look like most chairs were taken during the day. But we werent interested in the pool. We're more beach people. I thought the location of the Hyatt was great. Close enough to walk to Whalers Village and nicer parts of the beach.

We would definitely go back there. (On our last day we drove to South Maui and viewed the Wailea Grand and it was quite incredible!)

My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt for the second half our honeymoon after 4 days in Oahu. I agonized over where to stay for quite some time (Wailea or Kaanapali) and once we chose Kaanapali we decided on the Hyatt and I am so glad we did. For starters the hotel is beautiful. After being in Oahu I finally felt like I was IN Hawaii. There are birds and fish and peguins throughout the lobby and the open air feeling was very tropical. The concierge and bell hop are VERY nice and patient. We had run into a problem with Aloha Airlines (FYI: Stay away from them!) losing part of our luggage on the inter-island flight (long story). They had promised the bags by 6pm and at 10pm when we returned from dinner they still were not there. The front desks were as helpful as they could be in trying to get it and it was up at our room as soon as they received it at midnight. They even sent up a basket of goodies for our troubles, which I thought was nice of them esp. since they had done nothing wrong. I was however, hoping we would get an upgrade, since it seems like they do that alot but didn't. We had the daily buffet breakfastin our package and I would rate it ok. I know many people like it, but I was not a big fan. I am not much of a breakfast person anyway, but what I really didnt care for was the fact that the glasses and silverware were always so spotty. That may sound like pickyness but I never encountered that elsewhere so it did bother me a little. We also ate at Spats one night and it was soooooo good. Our waiter was just about the nicest person I have ever met and the food was delicious. Def. try the ravoili stuffed with lobster and crabmeat..Yum! The rooms were nice and private and maid service was good. We asked for a fridge and they brought it up within minutes. The pool is incredible. Def. the nicest on the strip. We were there in mid-April and often would not get to the pool until close to noon and never had a problem finding seats. There is not much of a beach but just walk about 5 minutes and you can have all the beach you want. For anyone wanting to compare Kaanapali and Wailea. It guess it depends on what you want. From what I hear the resorts in Wailea are supposed to be more lavish (we only saw Kea Lani, but liked the Hyatt grounds better) and the weather is supposed to be warmer, which I will agree to. The night we went it did feel warmer there. If I ever went back, I might consider trying one of them out to see if there really is a difference, but we were very happy at the Hyatt. It was so close to all the restaurants and shopping and we did not want a \"stuffy\" (for lack of a better word) hotel.

It was our first trip to Maui, and after surveying the other resorts along Ka'anapali beach, we think we made the best choice. The lobby is outdoors, as are most of the restaurants. Here are the positives and negatives: The Room: We had a partial ocean view. Ocean to the right, mountain to the left, and lush green courtyard below. The room was VERY clean, and nicely decorated. The bed was huge, and we both agreed, the most comfortable hotel bed we've EVER slept in. Lots of soft feather pillows, cool cotton sheets...it was a joy to sleep in! Our little balcony was cute, lots of privacy (you cannot see your neighbors) and a sliding screen door, so you can hear the ocean & the warm trade winds blow in the evenings. Restaurants: EXPENSIVE, but so are most places on Maui. However, if you're willing and able to splurge, the food is worth it. We had the breakfast buffet at SWAN COURT. A breathtaking view of waterfalls and real swans (open to the fresh air). The food was fresh and delicious. Fruit, omelette bar, a wide assortment of pastries, etc. We had dinner at SPATS. Though we didn't prefer to be downstairs (no open air and daylight as we were used to by then!) the service was excellent and the food was fantastic. The Pool: Clean, large and a great layout that features 2 waterfalls, a grotto bar (in a 'cave') and a 'kiddie pool' on the other side. Grounds: Well kept, large exotic birds were a nice feature and seem well cared for. Koi pond by the Weeping Banyan lounge was interesting. We loved that you are inside and outside at the same time. Carpet and a roof, with no walls, or the lobby, floor with no ceiling. That wouldn't work in other places, but in Maui where the breezes are warm and comfortable, it's perfect. Our ONLY minor complaints: Because it's so natural and lush, it's a little hard to find things sometimes, like the Concierge desk was not labeled as such, but they do have a map and we figured it out by day 2. Also, if you do NOT want a buffet, and want a snack, light breakfast, etc, after about 8am you can't really find anything. The Weeping Banyan ran out of muffins/pastries quickly and early.

Main thing for me was the reviews I read regarding the number of kids that usually are found at these resort hotels. I am really anti-kid people when it comes to spending thousands of dollars on a getaway vacation (although we love our beautiful 15 year old girl) this for me was a mom and pop vacation. Nevertheless, although there were a lot of kids here during our stay, the hotel seemed to \"absorb\" them because of its massive structure and large grounds and we really did not notice them other than at the pool. Bottom line points to remember: (1)Hotel staff was excellent, (2)hotel itself is AMAZING (caveat: on-site restaurants/bars are expensive), (3)would recommend combining hotel rate with free breakfast package(buffet breakfast at \"Swan Court\" is the best)and (4) plan to experience things outside the hotel which requires a rental car. We saw so many interesting things. Recommend trying the drive up past Kapalua on the northwest coast. Road gets really interesting for the adventurist and to Wailea on the south for the ritzty outlook on things in Maui.

Stayed March 30-April 6th. Absolutely loved this hotel. I was really second guessing our choice prior to our stay. I had booked our flights a year ago and could not make a final decsion on a hotel. We started out with reservations at the Kea Lani, Ritz and Sheraton and changed to the Hyatt based on a great rate with Hotwire. We've stayed in a lot of great resorts including the Hyatt Regency and Princeville on Kauai and based on some negative reviews I was afraid this property would be a disapointtment. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a \"partial ocean\" from a \"terrace view\" room. I was really surprised because we booked through Hotwire. Our room was on the fifth floor in the Napili Tower and had fantastic views of both the ocean and mountains. I was really happy with the room. I travel a lot and thought it was really big by hotel standards. The furniture seemed new and the room at a great Hawaiian feel. Storage was great. We brought a LOT of bags and were able to put everything away. I especially liked that the room had a wall between the bath and bedding area. We requuested a mini-refrigerator which was placed in this area and out of the way. Also, I had heard a lot about the \"older\" looking wooden doors and that the rooms in general seemed old but with a new coat of paint..I didn't get this feeling at all. It's a little thing but I actually liked the doors, and hallways. The dark wood matched the theming of the hotel, kind of reminded me of the look of Disney's Polynesian. (but this is the real thing) The balcony wasn't huge. Just big enough for a small table and two chairs, but still nice. We also liked the screen so that we could leave the patio door open 24/7. Spa, Expensive but nice. If I remember corretly an nail \"fill-in\" was $75. My husband had a massage and thought it was money well-spent. In terms of dining, we had the inside breakfast buffet two mornings and thought it was great and a good value for the price. The setting is absolutely beautiful. We really enjoyed starting our day with miso soup, mini-smoothies and smoked salmon. Also liked liked both the Cascades Restaurant and Bar. Pool service was outstanding. (I think this is where a lot of resorts fall short) We never had to wait long to order a drink. The drinks were priced at the typical $10 resort drink price but the food wasn't all that bad. I mention this in comparison to the Sheraton. The Hyatt poolside menu has a giant cobb salad which I think is the most expensive item on the menu for $13.00 We were snorkeling black rock one day and thought we would eat at the Sheraton pool and noticed their poolside menu was at least 30% higher. Their menu has a greek salad with chicken for $17.50. The pool is fantastic. We looked at all the resorts on Ka'anapali Beach and everyone agreed the Hyatt Pool is heads and shoulders above the other properties. I was also very pleastantly surprised that we never had a problem getting chairs. Considering the property was sold out and it was Spring Break and 80+ degrees and Sunny almost everyday, the pool wasn't overly crowded. My favorite part of the pool was on the grassy area next to the beach path and overlooking the ocean. One of our concerns about the Hyatt was the \"lack of beach\". However, it wasn't an issue at all. I noticed a lot of kids playing in the sand but not really swimming in front of the Hyatt. However, you can walk 2-3 minutes past the property in front of the Westin and the beach is huge. I really thought the cave bar, rope bridge, awesome kids area, slides etc. more than compensated for a short walk down the beach. One other nice surprise was that they offered a fair amount of pool chairs with Canopies. I haven't seen those before. The hot tub was nice. My kids said the slide was great..and also liked the game room. Another nice touch is they offer fresh pineapple when you pick-up your beach towels. Shopping..several stores inlcuding a Macy's (which really was 90% bathing suits) but still a very large selection. Prices were reasonable. In fact, I think my husband said you could buy a cold beer in the sundries shop for $2.75 versus $6.00 at the pool. (Nice tip) Service..for the most part was great. Wasn't overly impressed with one server we had in The Cascades Bar but otherwise it seemed everyone went out of their way to be helpful. At the beginning of our trip we requested turn-down service and fresh towels every night. They fufilled this request all but one night. Lobby..very nice. My kids really liked all the birds. Parking. We did the self-parking after the first night and never had a problem finding a space. It was actually very convenient to the beach. Location. I can't say if I liked the location or not. I think it was great for a first visit to Maui because it is central. One note, this really seemed like a family resort. I'm not sure if I would have been happy there on a honeymoon. I think the Ritz or Four Seasons are much more couples oriented. Comparisons, I know I'm always looking for these. We walked all through the Sheraton. I thought the lobby was nicer than it looks in pictures. The balconies look very nice (much nicer than the Westin and Hyatt). However, the pool and grounds really can't compare to the Hyatt. The pool is much smaller and doesn't have the tropical feel of the Hyatt. It is nice having the snorkeling right out front, but it is really only a 10-15 minute walk from the Hyatt. Altough the Sheraton is nice, I was happy to have changed our reservation to The Hyatt. Westin, actually looked very nice. The lobby is very pretty. In my oppinion their section of beach is even better than the Sheraton's. Ritz, Very pretty. However, we were up in that area twice and it was overcast and raining both times. It is stunningly beautiful. Also I don't think the location is bad. It didn't seem like a far drive fron Ka'anapali at all..but still very private feeling. Truthfully, I think the location is better than Whaler's Village for restaurants. Roy's, Plantation House, Sansei, Vino, The Gazebo are all close by. We also drove down to South Maui to look at the Wialea Resorts. I thought the Four Seasons was stunning. If I were traveling on my Honeymoon it would be a no brainer. However, I really didn't think it looked suited to kids. The Grand Wailea was amazing. I would go back to Maui just to stay in this resort. Based on the lobby and first impressions, this was my favorite. We decided that next time we go to Maui we will visit in the Summer and try to stay their at a decent rate.(I really always like to try new place for each trip) We couldn't find a rate less than $575/night during Spring Break and got The Hyatt for $330. Kea Lani looked amazing. Altough, I thought the Hyatt's pool was actually nicer. I was kind of on the fence about visiting this resort because initially this was my first choice of where to stay in Maui and I thought I might have second guessed not spending an extra $180/night to stay here. I'd defintely stay here in a heartbeat but I was still happy with the Hyatt for my first trip to Maui. Hyatt Kauai. Is absolutely an overall better property than the Hyatt Maui. The grounds are much bigger the lobby is amazing. However, I liked our room at the Maui resort much better. The beaches are a toss-up. I'd actually might say the beach at the Maui resort is better. I really thought I'd be disapointed at the Maui Hyatt after staying the Hyatt Kauai but I wasn't at all. Hotel Hana, stayed there the last night of our trip. I've really never stayed in a hotel with less friendly service. Across the board, valet, spa, restaurant, check-in, everyone we encoutered was unfriendly and almost rude. It is a beautiful resort the rooms are amazing..but I wouldn't go back. Overall I'd give my experience with the Hyatt five-stars. Everything was wonderful. I'll be honest and say I really wanted to stay at The Four Seasons or Kea Lani but really couldn't justify the rate difference. I really went into this vacation prepared to be disappointed with the Hyatt and was so pleasantly surprised. Every aspect of the resort was wonderful. Great pool, rooms, restaurants, convenient location, grounds and efficient and friendly service across the board.", "Date": "April 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cHyatt Regency Hotel - Amazing Hotel with Great Service\u201d", "Author": "MichiganTravelor00", "ReviewID": "UR4941808", "Content": "We stayed at Hyatt 18 years ago on our honeymoon and this was the best Hotel stay in the Maui Kaanapali Resort area.

We didn't get a chance to use the spa, but the fitness center was the best hotel center I have ever seen. We were walking distance from Whalers Village, speaking of whales, they were everywhere! We just sat and watched them from our cabana, I couldn't believe how many we saw. The only downside to this hotel would be they could use a bigger bathroom, with maybe a jetted tub. The bedding was gorgeous, the room was SPOTLESS, there was fully stocked minibar with lots of goodies. I can not wait to go back and we will definately stay at the Hyatt.

I stayed at the Westin on my Honeymoon 15 years ago when it was fairly new and while I enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it was spectacular either. It was done on the same grand scale as the Hyatt but in much smaller quarters (i.e. less land). For my 10th anniversary we returned with our son but stayed at the Hyatt this time and totaly loved it. That was in 2000. In 2003 we returned to Maui with our son but decided to go back and try the Westin again. After one night we all woke up in the morning missing the Hyatt. I called the Hyatt and they got me into the hotel and we moved that morning. The beach in front of the Westin had suffered tremendous errosion that year and was virtually non-existant. While the Westin did have all the nice features like the pools and slides, everything was crammed into a smaller space and you just felt like you couldn't breath without someone right there. Granted, the Hyatt can be very crowded as well around the pool but the grounds are big enough that you can escape if you need too. The Westin used to have a beautiful restaurant comparable to Swan Court in the Hyatt but now it's been replaced by Tropica and it's more of a beachfront casual place than upscale. All in all, the Westin is a nice place but the Hyatt sets the standard.

The first time my husband and I traveled to Maui, we stayed at the Westin (a few hotels north of the Hyatt on Ka'anapali beach).

While the Hyatt has a great location and a lot of beach front property, the amenities and the rooms left much to be desired. At over $400 a night, one expects to have a nicer bathroom than one finds at a Comfort Inn in upstate New York as well as some Charmin type toilet paper (the stuff we used was about 1/2 ply). Also, it would be nice to have bath towels that are a little (just a little, that is all I ask) on the plush side; I thought they were going to disintegrate during each pat dry). The pool was a good size, but there were too many chairs (which, by the way were the cheap plastic variety; shouldn't they have upgraded to nice chairs with cushions on them by now (the Westin has had them for over 4 years, at least) on top of eachother. Also, the cabanas on the beach were dirty and there was no bar service (what is the point then?). I may sound too critical or nitpicky, but, it is the little things that matter -- especially for the price you pay at the Hyatt. I guess they figure they can charge these rates for their location without needing to provide stellar service, etc. Wrong. Oh, and did I mention, no turn down service at night.

This was, without a doubt, the greatest trip we've ever taken. The negative reviews we saw before going did not even bother us. Think about it. You're on vacation. You have no worries, just take things as they are! Some people didn't like it because there were echos in the lobby area. What? Stay out of the lobby then and enjoy everywhere else! Anyway, on to my review. We arrived and were immediately upgraded to a two-balcony, corner oceanview room! Our room was awesome - comfortable bed, spacious area, and breath-taking views from the balcony. The grounds are unbelievable! We had so much fun just hanging out at the pool, having food and drinks served to us, riding the water slide, swimming under the waterfalls, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery around. Yes, the beach area is small, but that didn't bother us one bit. I will also agree with previous reviewers that things at the Hyatt are very expensive, but my gosh, so is everything in Hawaii! You just have to accept it and deal with it. We aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t by any means loaded with money, but if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your honeymoon, just splurge. This is your best chance to really live it up! If you have the chance to request it, try and get the free breakfast buffet with your room package. It is incredibly worth it! We ate at the Swan Court (where the buffet is) every morning and absolutely loved it. If you don't get there before 9:00, you will wait in a line at the hostess stand, but don't let the long line fool you - it actually does not take very long if you're patient. My wife and I don't make a big deal about breakfast and lunch typically, so we usually ate lunch by the pool, but dinners we usually do make a big deal out of. Not that we're big spenders, but when we're on vacation, we like to do some things that are away from the resort, so we made sure and ate dinner off the grounds. If you are like us, make sure and go to either Wahler's Village, which is about a 10-15 minute walk along the beach from the hotel, or drive down to the village of Lahaina to eat and shop. Lahaina is about a 5 mile drive, just South of Ka'anappali. As you go South on the main road from Ka'anappali, veer right onto Front Street, which will take you into the village on the water. We were very very very fortunate to find this on our first night, and we went there four out of the seven nights that we were there. Plenty of restaurants and shops. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to David Paul's and I'o for dinner. Also right there is the Old Lahaina Luau \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go to that one instead of the Hyatt luau. If you are on your honeymoon at the Hyatt, make sure you go to the Honeymooner's Reception on Monday evenings! Free drinks and finger foods for an hour or so - make sure and ask the front desk about it! We have absolutely no complaints about the Hyatt! It was amazing!!!

From the time you arrive to the time you leave, it is the most laid back place one can imagine. The place has penguins, flamingos, parrots, the best pool, & the nicest grounds out of all of the other hotels in the area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even close. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view, which put us on the bottom floor looking through the garden to the ocean. The patio was little but there was a table and 2 chairs where 2 people can comfortably sit and watch the sun set or catch a glimpse of whales playing in the ocean. The rooms are nice. Not great or spectacular, but nice. You can tell that they were once very dated so they added some paint, some new furniture (awesome beds and bedding), and a few fixtures to spruce them up a little during a major remodel last year. We also asked for a free refrigerator to keep our drinks in for the week. So the room more than served its purpose. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in your room very often anyway. The pool is 2nd rate to none of the other hotels. The Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was a distant 2nd place as far as pool and hotel grounds rankings. We were able to get a decent spot around the pool every morning. Sure, there are the people that everybody loves to hate that drop off their towels before the sun comes up in the prime locations and then show up around noon only to leave at 12:30 but there are so many places to lay around that we always had a chair in a good area. Plenty of food and drink service if that is your thing too. One day we chose to rent a cabana (there are only 2). These are $100 each but give you solitude, bottled water, and fruit as well as radio and television hookups. To me, this was worth it as we also had 2 chairs outside the cabanas to lay in the sun. unfortunately, the cabanas are covered. The hotel is located on the Southern part of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali, which is about a mile long beach that stretches North to the Sheridan. By the way, Black Rock by the Sheridan is the best place to snorkel on the Western portion of the Island if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in paying for a trip to Molokini. The Hyatt is only \u00c2\u00bd mile from Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village, where the majority of the dining and shopping is. The only night life on the Island is here. Lahaina has a couple of places (Moose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and another club we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in to) where you can have drinks later in the night but it seemed like only locals went here. Plan on eating right after the sun sets, going to bed early since there really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything going on after dark, & getting up whenever to enjoy total relaxation. There is a nice little paved walkway that runs along the beach to get you there. Walking by the other hotels makes you realize how good you have it at your hotel as you notice the other hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pools and amenities. It seems like we tried almost every restaurant in both Lahaina and Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali for either lunch or dinner. The food wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as expensive as we thought it would be. Sure the food is a little pricey at places like Pacific\u00e2\u20ac\u2122o in Lahaina or Swan Lake at the Hyatt, but the food quality is so far above the majority of the other restaurants that you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind spending an extra $5-$10. Other favorites include Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (seafood) and Hula Grill (seafood) in Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village & Spat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Italian) at the Hyatt. Other places in Lahaina and Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village offered the typical beach fare of good sandwiches and salads. These were Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Cheeseburger in Paradise, Bubba Gump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, & Old Lahaina Fish Co in Lahaina and Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the Beach in Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village. The best breakfast we had was at the Kapalua Bay Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brunch. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too bad that they are tearing it down in April. The grounds and views are amazing. We also ordered pizza on a lazy day from Vinnie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. not bad and they deliver to almost any hotel in the area. You can avoid Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Lahaina. It just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that good and seemed very overpriced. We went to the Old Lahaina Luau. It was worth every penny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if you can drink your weight in top shelf alcohol. The entertainment was never boring and the food, even though served buffet style, was very good. Even though we could snorkel along many of the beaches for free, we decided to book a catamaran through Pacific Whale Foundation. The catamaran was perfect as only 50 people are allowed on board at a time. many of the other snorkel boats hold over 200 people, which ruins all of the water activities because of overcrowding and people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to pick up their feet while in the water making the water murky. We left at 6:30am from Lahaina and traveled over to Lanai. The trip over was a little over an hour. We were given muffins and juice and saw quite a few whales. As we were making our way to the Eastern side of the Island, the captain mentioned that we might see some dolphins. We entered a little cove properly named Dolphin Cove and all of a sudden dolphins were everywhere. They were playing in our wake and jumping all over the place. this kept going on for about 15-20 minutes and then unfortunately we had to go snorkeling. The snorkeling was very cool too but everybody agreed that we could have hung out in Dolphin Cove for the entire day watching the dolphins. Coming back, we were served chicken sandwiches and all of the beer and rum drinks we could handle. Maui Revealed gives this company a bad name for being selfish with their food and drinks. Based on our experience, this was definitely not the case. We will definitely book through this company again as the service is top notch and the cost is much lower than the competition. The other excursion was watching the sun rise on Haleakala and biking down 38 miles. we booked through Mountain Riders and our guide was Pops. The van picks you up at the hotel at 2:30am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes 2:30am just to watch the sun rise on top of a volcano. Maybe I am a little bitter about the whole thing because when we got to the top, it was freezing and so cloudy that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a thing. There were a few breaks where we saw some pinks and blues but we never really go to appreciate the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sunrise at Haleakala\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thing. The bike ride down started on the wrong foot but got a lot better. It rained on us a little and since you only go as fast as the slowest member of your group, it felt like eternity until we reached a warm enough area to strip some clothing. After about 15 miles, we were under the clouds and were able to see all over the Western part of Maui. The views were great and the trip started to be enjoyable. A decent breakfast was served at a restaurant (Pollie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) towards the bottom and we wound up having a good time while learning quite a bit from our guide about the Island. It may have been a little pricey at $125/person but I think that on a clear day, the views from the top would be nothing short of spectacular. Overall, we both had a wonderful time and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand it when I read negative comments on how the rooms are not worth the money and how the pace of everything is so slow. Yes, you are on vacation in Hawaii.

We had screaming children next door to us, surrounding us at the pool, at the restaurants, at the SPA!!! - it was impossible to get away from them at this resort.

We booked our trip through a local travel agent and she did try to get us into the Regency Club from the time we booked the trip (September) right up until the time we left. I honestly don't think that not being able to get into the Regency Club has anything to do with who you book your trip through. At least I really hope not. I had also read reviews where the hotel seemed dated, that children were running all over the place and that the Hyatt wasn't worth the cost. I can only speak from our experience, but we absolutely loved it. We only used the valet parking once, the night that we arrived and we were not even out of the car before the staff was taking our luggage and grocery bags. Check in was painless, although there still was no Regency Club availability. We found our partial ocean room very nice, although I agree with one of the other reviews that the balcony was pretty narrow. The room was large with a lot of storage space, including a walk in closet. We had a frig put in the room so that we could stock up on milk, juice, lunchmeat, sodas etc. I didn't think the room was dated, but rather authentic. The staff was always very nice and helpful. Even though the hotel was at full capacity, we didn't feel overrun at all. Children for the most part were at the kiddie pool area. The ones at the large pool were very well behaved and we didn't even notice them there. In fact, the gentlemen sitting next to us by the pool was 1 of a party of 22, including his grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces and nephews. You would have never known it. The Hyatt also has its own catamaran on which you can schedule a snorkeling trip. I think the cost was about $80. This wasn't the best charter that you could book, but it was convenient and perfect for me. My husband had taken a bike trip and I wanted something to do with myself for those couple of hours. Food was expensive, but then, from what I've read, food is pretty much expensive everywhere. Breakfast at the Swan Terrace as a wonderful buffet, great atmosphere, but pricey. The cost was $22 per person. Sodas down by the pool costs $3.50 per 12 oz can. I will say, the the food that we had in Maui was the best food that we've every eaten and we travel extensively. Some people complained about the lack of parking, but we never ever had a problem. No matter what time we got back, we found parking in the front lot. I don't think a lot of people realize that there is more parking in the rear. The parking spots are very small though, but we found this to be the case everywhere we went in Maui. There are cabannas to rent for $40.00 per day but we didn't find this worth the cost. If you see the picture that I posted on here listed as \"What the Hyatt calls a cabanna\", you will see why. There are several regular lounge chairs that have adjustable covers over them that are actually nicer and don't cost anything. The Hyatt does have 2 \"Hales\". I also posted a picture of one of these. This is what we considered a cabbana. You can rent these for $100.00 per day. It comes with a few \"extras\" like bottled water and fruit. I believe the staff will also go get food for you from the pool bar although the cost of the food is extra. The location of the hales is beautiful. We would have splurged and rented one for a day, but by the time we got there and discovered them, they were booked for the rest of our stay. The beach area isn't that great, but the beach walk is awesome. The beach at the Sheraton could not be beat along the Kaanapali area.

We really enjoyed the trip to Maui and Hyatt. The staff was always pleasant, quick service and attentive. The grounds were beautiful and the view (ocean view from Napili Tower 3rd floor) was great. If you stay there you would want 3rd floor or much higher as top of palms would block your view. We overlooked gardens, ocean, pool, and waterfall. The room did appear somewhat dated in decor but well maintained. We really liked the small walkin closet and robes. The lanaii (balcony) is pretty small, but we felt if we wanted to be outside we would be sitting at pool or grassy area by beach or restaurant/bar. The pools are very nice. The kids pool had lots of things for them to do and slide. The adult pool was large. The chairs are fairly close together, but we usually sat out in grassy area overlooking beach/ocean. It was much quieter there and we did have good waitress service as well for the bar for drinks. Can't really say too much about the food since we were with a group and ate mostly buffet style. Transportation to airport was provided by group but costs if you have to do it yourself if you don't rent a car. If you haven't been to Maui before you really need a car to get around to the many things Maui offers. We enjoyed the location in Kaanapali as we could walk to restaurants up the beach. The Hula Grill was fantastic! we ate there twice. Food is very expensive no matter where you go. In Lahaina we ate at BJ's Pizza (best price lunch, salad and individual pizza for $7.50). Banquet for group was excellent at the Hyatt. Presentation was fabulous. Hubby golfed at the Plantation. He said it was difficult course, but loved it and views were awesome! I had a massage at the Hyatt spa. Very nice, large spa. Just be warned that men and women are mixed at different times in robes. Men and women give the massages, so if picky ask for what you want. If you would get a chance they do have beachside massage area. Fantastic views and surf sounds would make this a great way to get a massage. Went to Hyatt in Kaui last year, did like the actual grounds there better, but views on Maui are priceless. Went to Maui on family trip 6 years ago and if we did that again I probably would not be able to afford Hyatt. Would do the condo way again due to high food costs. There are many choices for condos.

Found the swimming pool to be way too crowded. The chaise lounges are jammed together so tightly that you can't even stand up beside the chaise, you have to crawl onto it from the end. Not acceptable for older people like ourselves. Also chairs placed too close to edge of pool making it impossible to walk around the pool to decide where to get in.

Our rooms were clean and nicely appointed. We had a lovely, comfortable king-sized bed and the other room had a queen bed and double bed. The hotel managed to put us in rooms right beside each other. Refrigerators were brought in as soon as we asked. Even though Maui was completely booked, the service at the hotel was polite and timely. We had gorgeous buffet breakfasts at Swan Court every morning. We picked up a few things from a grocery store in Lahaina for lunches and snacks so our only other meal expenses were from dinners in Lahaina. We didn't eat in the hotel or in Whaler's Village but did eat at Hard Rock Cafe, Compadres, Cilantros, and Cheeseburger in Paradise. All of these were fine - Cilantros is more of a diner and there is no alcohol license but the Mexican food was really good. All of the restaurants easily accomodated the various dietary needs of our group without fuss. I would avoid Bubba Gump's like the plague - the last time we were in Maui, we ate there and the whole place reeked of mildew and the food was barely palatable. Still, we saw people lined up in big long lines almost every night! I didn't have the book but I think looking at something like Maui Revealed might be helpful - something similar is how we found Compadres and Cilantros. I have to laugh at reviews that complain about the beach at the Hyatt - yes, it's kind of rocky but all you have to do is walk a short way down the beach to the Marriott beach and there's a very nice area for swimming, boogy boarding, and surfing. A little bit more of a walk and you are at Black Rock which is a great place for snorkeling - we saw all sorts of fish and a few big turtles! We went with Paragon for a catamaran sail to Molokini for snorkeling. It was kind of windy, making the snorkeling a bit choppy but it was still great - saw lots of fish and two small sharks - maybe reef sharks? We saw flying fish along the way and quite a few whales - complete breaches and even a whale tail or two. The way back was a gas - we got going about 21 knots. Again, I have to laugh - there were some families whose kids sat with MP3 players plugged into their ears the entire time. Many people didn't even get off the boat to snorkel. And then I heard one guy whining that he didn't think the snorkeling was very good - he had been in the water for maybe 5 minutes! I could just imagine the review he would write. Amyway, the trip was expensive but good. I would happily return to the Hyatt. I like it's location on Kaanaplai - it's at the end furthest away from Whaler's village so is nice and quiet.

I booked the trip through Hotwire leaving from Phoenix. For three travelers it cost us around $4000 for air, car and hotel. We are Hyatt gold (platinum) members. Let me start by saying I called Hyatt prior to leaving to see if I could use our points to upgrade to a suite and because we didn't book direct through Hyatt, no upgrades allowed. We called the hotel prior to arrival to see about paying for an upgrade and again no luck. Apparently the hotel was sold out during our stay of Dec. 20th through the 27th. Even so I heard conversations of others that did get upgraded. I believe if I hadn't booked through a discount company we may have gotten an upgrade. We were more than willing to pay an additional charge. Upon check-in the front desk attendant did leave the desk for quite some period of time to see if we could get a room with two beds as opposed to a room with one bed and a sleeper sofa. We didn't see that room, but what we ended up with was a room on the 8th floor (top floor of the tower) with a partial, pretty good ocean view (room 813) with a queen and a double for our 13 year old son. Nice enough room, but a little tired looking. I generally pick newer properties when we vacation in hopes of fresher, nicer rooms. For example, the Hyatt in Huntington Beach, CA is only 3 years old and we love that property! I'm guessing there might be larger rooms if you upgrade to the Regency Club or of course a suite. We were hoping we would at least be able to upgrade to the use of the Regency Club to take advantage of the free breakfast, but Hyatt didn't see it that way. This was our fourth trip to a Hyatt property in 2005. All that said, the property is beautiful for a hotel that's over 20 years old. It was very busy around the pool area, but again we realized the property was sold out. And yes, food is expensive. What are you going to do? It's Hawaii pricing. The breakfast buffet by the pool is around $19.00. And don't try to throw an extra bagel on the plate or they'll ask 'how many in party?' as if I'm feeding two off of that plate! The staff is friendly for the most part. The concierge desk staff also work the Expedia.fun activities desk it seems. (A little commission going on there?) If traveling with children that love to be on the beach I'd recommend a property a little further up the Kaanapali strip of hotels. The beach in front fo the Hyatt is very narrow and difficult to get to. If you enjoy walking this Kaanapali area is perfect as you can walk the beach for 20 to 30 minutes one way.

Needless to say our arrival did not go as well as our arrivals at other hotels. We got out of the taxi, took out our luggage and then, when the bellmen didnt even move an inch, we were forced to drag our bags into the lobby. Thanks for the help guys. Check-in was pretty painless, the guy behind the counter did go out fo his way to upgrade our room which was a VERY nice gesture, but then he sent us over to the bellstand where a woman waited for us to drag our stuff over. I gave her the ticket to have our bags taken up to our room. She glanced at it, then noticed it was out honeymoon. She then proceeded to this HUGE rack of leis and gave 2 of them to us. Wow, I feel so special. The room was an ok room- it was about what I was expecting. Good size, the bed was very comfortable, but the balcony was VERY shallow, only deep enough to fit 2 chairs. The view was fantastic though, looking out over the pool and then the ocean- the guy behind the desk did us a big favor, and we were grateful. We set out to walk around the hotel, starting with the lobby. The lobby is pretty impressive to look at- a jungle garden like scene that rises about 10 stories above your head. There are a couple of problems with this impressive design. First things, if it rains, youre getting wet. Also, with the side facing the ocean open, if you are there on a windy day (as I was), the wind will whip and howl through there like nobody's business. Another downside is that this lobby is like a large echo chamber. The sound just bounces all the way up- to the point where if a bartender drops a glass at the Weeping Banyan at night, you will hear it in your room. The entire hotel felt a little crowded. It was at capacity, but it wasnt set up to handle capacity. From the lobby to the pool, there is only one narrow staircase where you are constantly bumping into people. Not too pleasant. There are two pools, but they are so littered with chairs that you have to practically step on someone to get to the pool, and its the major pool and some childrens playground, nothing else. The beach is VERY small and after you get out about 15 feet, there is a lot of coral there, so be careful. If you want to head to Black Rock, figure about a 20-30 minute walk. Down there the beach is much more spacious. One sensation that I felt the entire time I was there was that they were trying to get my money everywhere I went, unless I wanted to spend it. There is also very little variety in terms of food. For breakfast you have a choice of two buffets. No light options are available. The prices are $20-$25 per person for breakfast, gone. Plus the line outside the only open breakfast place in the morning (Swan Court) makes you feel like cattle. The choices for lunch were even slimmer and we never even ate dinner at the hotel due to its lack of variety. I had just come from two hotels MUCH SMALLER than the Hyatt where they offer many many more possibilities. Hyatt needs to really open up the possibilities here. Also, DO NOT GO SHOPPING THERE!!! I cannot possibly say this enough. The stores gouge here like I have never seen before. *In one store where they sell daggers and axes with all sorts of flambouyant verbage for each item, I found an indonesian doorstop. Pretty cool looking, it was a frog and the price tag said $22. I flipped it over and saw some sticker reading \"Duck Pond 8-\". Curious, I asked the lady what it meant. Turns out it was the price tag from the store they got it from. $8 to $22!!! Whats more, they were caught red handed and wouldnt give it to me for $8. *In the quilting store I had heard stories about the quilting in Hawaii, and that the reasonably priced ones are Hawaiian designed, made in Phillipeans, while the real Hawaiian made ones are more expensive. So looking at the store, I thought I found an 'authentic' quilting. The guy said that they were made in the Philippines. But they cost $90!!! The ones made in the Phillipeans cost about $30. Basically he was charging Hawaiian made prices for foreign made stuff. ***DO NOT SHOP HERE*** Dont get me wrong, we did enjoy our stay at the Hyatt- just not nearly as much as the other places we were.

Bring a back pack so when you get out to explore you can take all your belongings with you. Eat at Pacific'o! Go get the book Maui Revealed. It make exploring the island really fun! Check out Paragon for a snorkel/saling tour. Smaller boats, like 24 people max (not the 40, 50, plus that other do), and they actually SAIL their boats. This was the highlight of our trip.

Yes the grounds are beautiful but after staying at the Mauna Lani Bay on the BI we were spoiled. The valet parkers were down right rude and threw our luggage unto the curb, we never used them again, we just self parked. At check-in the the hotel worker, Noah, was defintely lacking any aloha spirit. He kept trying to get us to upgrade our room to ocean view for $70 extra a night and told us those rooms go for $700/night; we later found out he lied to us, those rooms are much cheaper than that plus a friend of mine was staying there the same week and they only wanted $40 a night extra from them for an upgrade. Our room was horrible. The carpet was stained, the bathroom had an order, our partial ocean view was on partial if you leaned over the balcony, the wallpaper was dirty and peeling and our sheets were dirty. We called down to the front desk to have our sheets changed and they came right away but we felt the women were talking about us because they kept giving us looks the whole time. Don't even get me started on the pool area. We had to walk around fro 15 minutes until we found empty chairs at the kids section. We felt like we were at an amusement park, people are practically laying on top of each other at the pool. We did notice that each day there were less and less people at the pool and it was easier to get chairs and the last day the pool was practically empty. The hotel also nickel and dimes you to death. There is a $15/day resort fee that covers 1 hour of tennis, in-room coffee, a newspaper, and the gym. Valet parking is an extra $10 per night. No offense but i shouldn't have to pay $15/day for a paper I didn't want, coffee I didn't use, and tennis and the gym we didn't go to. If people want that than they could charge them extra but shouldn't charge everyone. Overall we just weren't happy at all. Also, the Swan Court was closed for most of our stay but they finally opened for breakfast the last two days. That was beautiful and having the breakfast included was well worth it. We met about 5 other couples on their honeymoons at the Hyatt and all of them hated it and were very disappointed.

From the front desk, to the bellmen, to the valet parking attendants, to the pool attendants, all were friendly, helpful and truly went above and beyond to make you feel like a valued customer. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful. There are koi ponds, penguins, macaws & beautiful flowers everywhere. The hotel itself is what I would call an \"open air\" hotel, meaning it is like an atrium. Once you step out of your room you look down on the ponds & flowers etc. or look up to the blue Maui sky. There are many colorful flowers growing on each floor of the hotel that are so beautiful to look up at if you are on a lower floor. The only problem we had happened to us our first afternoon there as my husband, son & I tried to take a nap. We were awaken by what sounded like a jackhammer in the room above us. And it kept going and going. I finally got up and found a note that had been slipped under our door informing us that they were renovating the penthouse suite which was directly above our room. And sorry for the inconvenience, but the work would contine from 9-5 for the next two weeks! I was quite irked that this was not disclosed to us upon check-in. In my opinion, they should not have checked people into any of the rooms immediately surrounding the \"construction zone.\" So I called the front desk to complain. Since we were staying on the 21st floor of the Regency Club (w/ a parital ocean view) and there were no other rooms available on the Regency Club floor with that view, we were upgraded to the 15th floor with a full ocean view. We still had access to the Regency Club, but just weren't on the higher floor. So we were happy with the way they rectified the situation. I found out that it is totally worth the money to have an ocean front room as opposed to a partial ocean view. So worth the extra money! I would also recommend doing the Regency Club, as many times the hors d'oeuvres sufficed for dinner and the continental breakfast was more than enough each morning. Plus all drinks are free, be it alcohol, soda, bottled water, coffee or tea. The staff at the R.C. is warm, friendly and accommodating. Since we only paid for our lunches & dinner one time during our 5 day stay we saved big time on food. And you know how expensive food is in Maui. R.C. is definitely worth it. Plus it was never crowded there. And since you're up on the top floor, you look out over the ocean and you can go outside on the lanai to eat if you like. It's a very nice & comfortable way to begin or end your day. I can't speak to any of the restaurants on property because we ate at the Regency Club. For lunch we walked the short distance to Whaler's Village. If you like fish tacos, Leilani's serves fantastic fish tacos. Even my husband who doesn't like fish devoured them. They come original or cajun & both are good. Leilani's (at Whaler's Village) is right on the beach. Makes a real fun place to people watch & enjoy the ocean view. So even with the misstep with our first room, I felt satisfied they made up for it by moving us to an ocean front room, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I can't wait to return to Maui.

We read reviews of so many hotels, and were a little nervous about the Hyatt, but were very happy we chose to stay there in the end. We walked through some of the other resorts, and it definitely seemed like the nicest place on Ka'anapali. From the moment we arrived, the service was excellent. We had booked a mountain/golf view room, but were \"upgraded\" to a partial oceanview. It overlooked a parking lot, but had a decent view of the ocean. (If the parking lot had been noisy, we would have asked to move, but we didn't have any problems.) The bellhop was extremely polite and friendly, as were the valets and the people at the front desk. The room was very pretty and a nice size, and the bed was very comfy. Our bellhop arranged to get us a minifridge without us even having to ask. The hotel is at the end of Ka'anapali, close to Lahaina, which was nice for two reasons. First, there was not as much pedestrian traffic in front of the hotel, because it is at the end of the beach and the beach walkway. Second, it was a breeze to get to Lahaina, maybe a five to ten minute drive. The beach in front of the hotel is not the greatest because of the rocks, but a five minute walk takes care of that problem. The grounds are beautiful, with lots of tropical flowers and birds. The pool is AWESOME. We never had a problem finding a chair at any time of day. There were a few kids, but they mainly stayed in the children's pool area. (It probably helped that we went in September after school had started.) We had fun with the water slide, and enjoyed sitting by the pool with a book and a drink, overlooking the ocean. We got a couples' massage at Spa Moana, which was great. The spa staff were OK (not super friendly), but our massage therapists were wonderful. We did aromatherapy, but next time, I think I would try lomi-lomi. We got a daily breakfast buffet with our package, which I would definitely recommend. Go with the jet lag and get there early, because a line forms if you go after 8:00. (It does move quickly, though). The restaurant, the Swan Court, overlooks a pond with a waterfall, and we were seated right next to the pond every day. The food is good, but we would not have paid for it for more than one day if it hadn't been included in our package. Our biggest dilemma was where on Maui to stay -- Kapalua, Wailea, or Ka'anapali. We finally chose Ka'anapali because it seemed to be close both to the beach and to nightlife and other activities. Plus, we saw several negative reviews about the Ritz, which the second main option we were considering. While I think Ka'anapali was a good choice for us (we are in our twenties and are not big golfers), I must say that the Kapalua area was breathtakingly beautiful. We drove by the Ritz on our first night there and almost had second thoughts. If we went back, we might split our time between Kapalua and Ka'anapali, especailly since Kapalua is only about ten minutes away. That said, I am glad we stayed at the Hyatt.

In fact, I think adults were outnumbered by children here. The families in rooms on either side of us were really loud, and screaming kids woke us up each morning before 8 am. It is definitely a perfect family resort. Children aside, we enjoyed the breakfast served at Swan Court each morning. The Cascades restaurant was ambient and the food was better then average for Maui/Lahaina area. The frozen drinks here are amazing, and are served poolside. Try the Lahaina Lemonade.

Plus, it didnt have a \"resort feel\" to it. Arriving at the Hyatt on our Honeymoon, we discovered how beautiful the grounds were immediately. The flowers, trees and animals were perfectly arranged. Unfortunately, we had to wait in line for the valet to accept my key for the car(valet people were hard at work but there was only a couple of them for all of the guests, also it costs 10bucs a day + tip each time which I felt a little obligated to do...it worked out to about 16-20bucs/day). Each time we used the car we called down in advance to have the car pulled around, it was never there...plus a 15-20minute wait due to staffing issues...I felt bad so I tipped them anyway. Also, we had to wait in line for 25 minutes to check-in(not very pleasant when you have just taken a 13hr flight). Seems like a consistent problem because everyday we walked by there always seemed to be a line. We received Leis when we finally reached the desk as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne when we get settled in..which was very nice! ROOMS: Very nice. They didn't have any king sized beds(even though our package was for honeymooners and requested a king) so they gave us a double and a queen which actually was ok with us, oh well! Othewise, the rooms were great. The minibar was nice to have in the room but I would prefer to have just an empty fridge so we could put things in(the mini bar was stuffed). The resort fee for 15bucs is RIDICULOUS. You get a free paper,1hr at the tennis courts, free local calling(so I can call all of my friends in Maui=0), coffee maker in the room, entrance fee to the gym...Didnt include internet access. They have an outsourced internet company if you need access with their computer...$5 to sign in + $1 per minute. A bit pricey for me but you can go to Lahaina at one of the internet shops and do it much cheaper. POOL: Very nice. The water falls were great and the slide was soo much fun. All adults in this line...yep that much fun! They make you wear a wristband for some reason as well...so dont forget! There was shallow as well as deep parts in the pool and a separate pool for the kids(very nice). There wasn't any problem getting chairs by the pool assuming you were there before 10am. Otherwise you would have a tough time. Other than that, it was so nice sitting by the pool having some expensive drinks($9-$11 for frozen drinks) POOL BAR: It was located between 2 waterfalls under a rock structure( sounds cool but not once you see it). 3-4 people there at one time the most, otherwise empty. And you had to get out of the pool to get a drink. They need to redesign that area of the resort. FOOD: BREAKFAST: Swan Court($23.95 buffet) was open only for breakfast at the time and you had a long wait if you got there any later than 700am. Otherwise there were between 35-40 people in line and a 30-45min wait...nice once you got in(landscape and food were very nice) but not worth the wait after just getting up. LUNCH: There is a place next to the pool where you can get sandwiches(PB&J $6.50, Tunasalad $8.50, and burgers($11)...etc. Otherwise, you can get served at your chair by the pool which was nice. DINNER: A couple of restaurants on the premise which were nice but not incredible. The italian restaurant SPATS was good and had much to offer. The waiter was very helpful with our bottle of wine and we enjoyed the atmosphere. There is a long walkway that extends behind a bunch of resorts that borders on the beach that has quite a few restaurants(Leilani's,Hula Grill, Rusty Harpoon(food and service very poor)and shops(Whalers Village). A wonderful evening stroll to and from dinner. I highly suggest going just before sunset...an amazing view! As for gathering places to meet other couples...it really doesnt have any. We had just come from the Marriot in Kaui and thought how nice it was to bump into other couples at the bar and talk...not so much at the Hyatt. There is a small bar next to the pool but it has only 5 chairs up against a wall with a TV overhead that you cant see. They need a central location for a swim up pool bar...resorts that have this makes afternoons soo much fun. BEACH: Narrow. You will have to walk either way for the beach to get wider which wasnt a big problem at all. WATER Warm and clear but you can only walk out into the water for about 10ft...then the rocks hurt your feet but you can go either way and the beach to avoid it. LOCATION: Great for traveling to Lahaina. About a $12 cab ride. Great bars, food and tons of shops. Also tons of activites there! The Hyatt is a beautiful place that you will enjoy to the fullest if you arent concerned about money in the least bit. Otherwise, it starts to wear on you after droping between $350-500/day(drinks +food). I hope this helps! If you have any questions, please shoot me an email and I wil help you as much as I can!

The bellman asked if we were smokers and took immediate action and contacted the front desk and took us to another room on another floor right away. I was disappointed with the rooms because they aren't cheap and it seemed that they were musty smelling and the bathroom floors were sticky. Another problem for me was the air-conditioning which were not working properly for my satisfaction. It was quite humid in Maui: the upper 80's to lower 90's and the room had the sun shining in on it in the morning. When I contacted the engineering dept. to come and look at it they said everything was fine, and offered to send an electrical fan. We spent 24 hours in this room then switched to another room next door and had the same problem with the air-conditioner then later that night the entire building's (Lahina Tower) air-conditioning system shut down due to a chiller problem. They got it up and running but it never got cooler than 75 degrees in the room. The bathroom didn't have a vent or venting system so when you took a shower all of the steam went into the room area which created some more heat... you get the picture. I did complain but they never offered to move us to another building because it looked like the hotel was sold out. The grounds are lovely with beautiful gardens, ponds, and waterfalls. It appears to be a kid friendly hotel many animals (penguins, flamingos, swans, parrots, koi fish ponds etc). They have a huge water slide and a whole area for children with a wading pool and small slide for younger children and sand area. They also have a kids camp as well.

It was fantastic. Check in was quick and easy, and within 10 minutes of arrival we were in our golf-view room. Requested a fridge, which was delivered within 20 min. The room was clean and well-maintained, and the bed was soooooo cozy! We arrived on a Monday, to be greeted by a free honeymooners cocktail hour. It was an outdoor bar where they played music, and had free drinks and cold appetizers. It was a great way to kick things off! We started every morning with breakfast at the Swan Court. This is a buffet breakfast that was incl in our price. Well worth it. Beautiful surroundings of swans and finches flying about. The food was fantastic (and so was the coffee). Nothing at the buffet ever ran out and the lines were not that long (went around 8 AM). Spent the mornings at the beach in front of whalers village, eat lunch in whalers village (cheap!), then head to the pool for the afternoon. Always found chairs available at the pool. The pool grotto bar was a little disappointing in the fact that you have to get out the pool to get to it, I assumed it was swim up and drink. We ate at some expensive restaurants, but our favorite meal was upstairs at Leilanis. Great food and service. Also loved lunch at Hula grill, also in Whalers village. Didn't eat much in the hotel except for some sushi at Cascades (pretty good) and Tidepools (god awful). WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT EAT AT TIDEPOOLS!! It was downright disgusting. Besides the fact that its expensive, I wouln't eat there if it was free. My wife got a pizza, which was cold in the center and the cheese tasted like it was spoiled ( and we eat tons of pizza!).

We admired the pool at the Hyatt 20 years ago when we stayed at the Sheraton, so we decided to stay at the Hyatt this time around. Amenities We asked for a refrigerator upon arrival and one was promptly delivered to our room. We stored soda in there and it was great to have it. As many people have mentioned, the daily $15 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a bit ridiculous. It covers a paper delivered to your room, the coffeemaker/coffee in your room, 2 passes to the fitness center on the grounds and local calls. Can I pass on this stuff and NOT pay the fee? Service The service was good and workers are very polite. Another guest checked us out of our room by accident one day and they solved the problem within an hour. We were greated with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153congratulations on your anniversary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and promised a bottle of champagne (which never materialized.) The only problem was when a worker walked into our room around 3:30pm without knocking and caught my husband with no clothes on after his shower. I was sitting on the couch in the room when it happened and she just backed out of the room without a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or anything. (She was probably embarrassed.) We asked the front desk about it (when we straightened out the accidental check out thing) but we never found out who she was. So, we were paranoid from then on if we heard a noise by the door! Rooms Our room was in a terrible location! Room 103 is right across the hall from the hotel doctor and the elevator. Patients were lined up in the hall to get into the doctor and kept stealing our paper in the morning. Our room view was of the parking lot. Where would they have put us if we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t celebrating a special occasion? The room itself is a good size, with a sofa to watch tv. But the bathrooms are tiny. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut the door without edging out of the way. Nice walk-in closet, though. Grounds & Pool The lovely grounds have wooden plank walkways that take you through lush foliage give you a breathtaking ocean view. The pool is divided into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area and an adult area by a giant 30ft lava rock formation. There is 30ft waterslide that comes out on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd side. You have to ask where it is because it is blends into the scenery so well that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hidden from view. Beyond the pool area are more tropical areas with exotic black swans, which are nice to stroll through. Beach The beach is narrow but you can walk down a bit in either direction and it widens. When the tide is low you can see a lot of coral and rock about 10 feet from where the beach breaks. Activities They advertise surfing lessons but no employee was able to successfully get us to them. Each person would point and say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right by those cabanas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right over there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and we would get there (well ahead of the appointed lesson time) and no one would show. Further inquiry yielded no results. Personally, I was curious to see where the lesson would be because the water directly in front of the hotel would be too dangerous due to the coral being less than a foot from the top of the water. No volleyball games or activities like we usually participate in. Kids The hotel has Camp Hyatt for kids. Plus, the kid pool is terrific to look at and swim in. There were more kids at this hotel than any other on Kaanapali. It was like Disneyworld in terms of quantity of kids. Lots of families brought their children and there were more of that crowd than couples without kids, which I found interesting considering the price of this hotel. The Hyatt on Maui is a great place to stay if you have kids, since the hotel really caters to them. Snorkeling Snorkeling in front of the Hyatt is dangerous in low tide. There is coral and fish but a wave could scrape you against the coral. We went to black rock by the Sheraton several times and it was as great as we remembered with lots of fish and giant sea turtles. We drove many miles in both directions and would pull over where we saw lots of cars parking. We snorkeled at some terrific sites and saw turtles at several of those sites. The water everywhere on Maui was crystal clear. Excursions The Hyatt has a travel facility at the hotel. We went on a trip taking us to both Molokini and Turtle Town for (gasp) $170 for two people. Molokini had a nice boat ride but tons of snorkeling boats there and very few fish. You see much more by the Sheraton or driving on your own (for free.) The turtle thing was a bust with only one turtle popping out of the water AFTER everyone got back on the boat to leave. (Almost like it was saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goodbye.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) A few people saw one turtle while snorkeling but most saw none. The boat ride is pleasant and the views of the islands are nice during the ride. Food and Drink Some drinks that I had at the Hyatt were really strong (Mai Tai) and some were medium (Hypnotic Martini) and some were really weak (Pina Colada, Lava something) but all were tasty and were priced around $9 or $9.50. We never ate at Swan court because their Italian restaurant Spats was serving dinner there while they refurbished its original location. We had a few lunches by the pool that were good, but very expensive ($30 to $40.) We ate three times at a restaurant two towns over called Roys which had unbelievable gourmet food. I found out that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Chicago, which I will visit soon.

In a word...fabulous. I would highly recommend this resort to couples and families alike. Our room was beautiful...we had a great view of both the ocean and the mountains. It was spacious and it was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff. The front desk, conceirge, activities desk, and room service were all friendly, prompt, and quick to serve our every request. I can say the same for the entire staff at the resort. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. Lush gardens, waterfalls, swans, flamingos, penguins, tropical birds, hammocks, and palm trees gave the perfect backdrop for a romantic paradise. The grounds staff was also very friendly, as we often crossed their paths during our early morning walks down to the beach. This resort is both family and couple friendly, so please keep that in mind. There are going to be children running around. For us, it wasn't a huge deal, even though we were on our honeymoon. We still found plenty of quiet spots to relax and there were plenty of romantic opportunities that we took advantage of. The hotel also offers different activities for honeymooners and couples, such as a Cocktail Hour on the first Monday you arrive and a Romance Under the Stars starwatching activity on the rooftop (complete with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries) on Friday and Saturday nights. We attended both, and enjoyed them equally. Just make it your own experience and you will enjoy every moment. If you do have children, there appeared to be plenty of activities for them as well. There are water sports, a hotel camp, snorkeling, and of course, the pool...just to name a few. We ate at all four restaurants and enjoyed every meal. Cascades has excellent seafood and is also perfect for any sushi lover. Spats has fantastic Italian food. And Swan Court had a magnificent breakfast buffet with everything from fresh fruit and muffins to personalized omlets and my personal favorite, apple crepes. The Pavillion is down by the pool and is convienent for a quick bite to eat while lounging by the pool. The pool is wonderful. It is very large with four different sections. The biggest section has both a shallow and deep end and is where you will find the most people. The chairs in this area do fill up the quickest, but we always found a chair without struggle, even if it was not directly on top of the pool. More children are obvioulsy near the shallow end, so if you aren't looking to be splashed or 'bothered' by children, use common sense and pick a different area to sit. The next area is the Grotto...a shallow area of the pool that goes through waterfalls and then into a cave. Great for children and adults, as there is plenty of room to explore and also a fantastic bar that serves a wide variety of mixed and frozen drinks, as well as non-alcoholic fruit smoothies, among others. The next section is more child-friendly, as there is a small wading area for young children and also a great waterslide (not just for kids!). Make sure you get a bracelet along with your pool towels if you plan to go down the slide! The last section is the jacuzzi...very relaxing! There are easy access paths down to the beach. I will admit that the beach area directly in front of the hotel isn't exactly ideal. It's small and there is a lot of coral in this part of the water. But if you take a short stroll down a bit further, the beach is wider and you don't have to deal with walking over coral to swim. It's still a great place to relax and catch some beautiful sites. We have some great shots of the sunset from here. We also took advantage of Spa Moana's Hot Stone Couples Massage. As a regular massage-goer, I have to say that this was the best experience I've had yet. When you book any spa service, you have full access to the spa ammenities...complete with jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna. Once your amazing massage is over and you are feeling a bit like jelly, they invite you into the relaxation room, which is open-aired and overlooking the ocean. You can also enjoy complimentary iced tea, juice, water, and fruit throughout the entire experience. It was well worth every penny! We did attend the Drums of the Pacific Luau and it was quite enjoyable. I don't think it was very authentic, but the food was excellent and we were very entertained the entire time. A nice show to catch if you get the chance. Yes, this entire resort experience was expensive. But you don't go to an exquisite Hawaiian resort expecting to pinch your pennies. We went prepared and didn't complain when things cost more than they do elsewhere. It's honestly equivalent to what you would spend in a city. NYC, Chicago, Boston, and LA all have similar prices in their restaurants and shopping districts. If you are looking to save money on your vacation and watch every dime, this isn't the place for you. But if you are looking for an unforgettable Hawaiian experience with breathtaking views, especially is this is your first visit to Maui, then I wouldn't hesitate to book with the Hyatt.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "edison nj", "Title": "\u201cromantic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3795583", "Content": "this hotel was beautiful! they take great care of the foliage and the animals all around the hotel is a nice touch. i loved that there was a macys right inside the hotel, super conveinent. my suite was well kept. the beach wraps around the resort but there is only 20 ft of beach from the sidewalk to the shore which made it farly crowded for a resport beach. the food was good, nothing incredible. staff was attentive. the pool is really neat, it has numerous section and even has a pretty good size slide for the kids (and adults). booking excursions was easy and we had a lot of fun scubadiving...

Our original room was only \"ok.\" It was very spacious with a little love seat that allowed us to relax a bit, in addition to the bed. There happened to be some type of bug issue in our room.

The resort itself is amazing. It has several restaurants with a little bit of something for everyone. The Swan Court (yes, real swans) restaurant is great, and has a wonderful view for a breakfast setting. The buffet style breakfast is perfect to start the day.

This poolside bar is very neat, as you can sit right in the water and have your drinks. There is a very fun slide in the pool that is certainly not just for children. We slid down it once and ended up doing it another few dozen times. Lots of fun and a definite way to get a smile and a laugh. If your trip is a special event for a loved one, I highly suggest you do the oceanfront candlelight dinner for two. You are set up dinner in a little thatched hut on the water, with tons of candles and a perfect setting for dinner. You have your own personal waiter who takes care of your order ahead of time, so you can enjoy the sunset and the food/wine. The food is 5-star, and the setting is just perfect. They certainly know how to make for a special night. The only setback we encountered, other than the room situation, was the beach. For three days, we were under the impression that there was basically no major beachfront sand. If you walk out from the resort, the water is in a cove of sorts, without waves. There is only a few feet of sand... What we didn't know is that if you walk around the corner 100 yards or so, the beach opens up. This, of course, is the beachfront for other hotels, which beckons the question on if it would be better to stay somewhere else. My suggestion is that you should definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui for all of the non-beach amenities such as the dining and the pool, and know that there is only a very small walk to spend time on a lucious beach.", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Place, tremendous beach access\u201d", "Author": "Islanddoc", "ReviewID": "UR3740954", "Content": "We loved this place and in May of 04 was the second time we stayed there.

The setup of the Hyatt and its restaurants are much better for enjoying the beautiful views of the expansive pacific than we found the Sheraton- although the snorkeling off Black rock near the Sheraton was much better than what was near the Hyatt. We require wheelchair accessibility and this was great at the Hyatt. Even the beach was just about 10 feet off the paved pathway- so that it was not difficult to get our wheelchair user across that limited space onto a beach recliner. Although the sushi at the Hyatt was expensive, we found the food there to be very good and better than many of the places one might try on Kaanapali. The spa at the Hyatt is small, but very nice, and has a wonderfully relaxing Lanai where one can fall asleep after a massage listening to the sound of the waves. Overall, we believe that the Hyatt is the best of the hotels on Kaanapali.

This was the first family vacation that we've had in quite a while. We booked a good flight/hotel package about 4 1/2 months in advance through an online travel service. The travelers included myself (female college student), my younger brother, and my mom. We didn't rent a car while at Maui, so we took a taxi from the airport to the Hyatt. After the 40-45 minute taxi drive (which takes you along a very scenic and pretty route), we arrived at the Hyatt and were greeted with leis upon check-in. We were upgraded from a Terrace View room to a Mountain/Golf View room (with a little view of the ocean) at no extra cost. Our room was located in the Atrium Tower. The two other rectangular towers that are on either side of the Atrium Tower are called the Napili Tower and the Lahaina Tower (some rooms in the Lahaina Tower look directly onto the Hyatt's Drums of the Pacific Luau, so I suppose those rooms get a free nightly show, but it's probably loud and may get tiring after the first couple of nights). Some of the activities we did during our stay: - attempted to snorkel at Black Rock (but it was a particularly windy day and we didn't leave early enough in the morning, so the water was choppy, plus we're beginners) - swam around in the Hyatt's pool (which has huge waterfalls and a swim-up bar in a cavelike area between the waterfalls, but you don't literally swim up to the seats and sit in the pool while having your drink, instead you have to wade over to some steps and get out of the water and then take your seat at the bar) - bodyboarding at the beach in front of the hotel (if you walk down to the Hyatt's Beach Activity Center, you can rent boogie boards and other equipment and the beach is a little wider there, while the beach directly in front of the Hyatt's pool is really narrow) - my brother went jet skiing (which he said was his favorite activity, but since he isn't 18 my mom had to go down with him to the Beach Activity Center to sign for him) - shopping and dining at Whalers' Village (you can take the free shuttle to get there which leaves about every half hour, or you can just walk there which takes about 15 minutes or so; we went to Leilani's On the Beach three times during our stay, which is a restaurant at Whalers' Village and it has a very casual downstairs and a less casual upstairs, definitely try one of their fish entrees) - my younger brother did an ocean rafting excursion and the raft took him out to Lanai where he snorkeled and swam with turtles and Spinner dolphins, and he said he saw what looked like hundreds of dolphins while they were rafting (the raft left off of Mala Wharf, which was a short drive away but we didn't have a car, so the Hyatt arranged for a taxi to take my brother to the wharf and then to pick him up and take him back to the hotel; again, since he isn't 18, my mom had to go down with him to Mala Wharf to sign for him) - my mom and I went to the Hyatt's Drums of the Pacific Luau (we paid extra for VIP seating, so we sat in the front and didn't have to wait in line, but since it isn't a huge venue it seems like every seat has a good view, so VIP seating isn't necessarily worth it; if you've already been to a luau before, you can skip this one..it's entertaining, but it's probably not worth all the money if you've already seen one) - my mom went to Spa Moana at the Hyatt to use the whirlpool, steam room, and sauna (they charge $15/person for all-day access, but they waive this fee if you are paying for a massage, facial, etc) - my family and I did the Tour of the Stars (the astronomer takes you up to the hotel's roof and shows you stars which are invisible to the naked eye but visible with their giant telescope, different constellations, etc; the astronomer only takes up 10 people at a time and she spends about an hour with the group, we even saw a shooting star [which she explains is not really a star]..I really liked this, but it's about $20/person) - my brother and I went parasailing (this was really fun since we had never gone parasailing before; we had to check in at the beach directly in front of Whalers' Village; the staff took pictures of us with their camera and my mom chose to buy the film for $20..I just developed the pictures, they are ok, but there's no pictures that show how high up we were which was about 800 ft, there are only close shots so it's just us in life jackets with a big parachute behind our heads..not necessarily worth $20 plus the cost of developing) - and my favorite thing that we did, a snorkel sail aboard the Hyatt's Kiele V which leaves right off the beach in front of the Hyatt (we sailed out for about an hour to Oneloa Bay [? I might be wrong about which bay] and then snorkeled for a little over an hour, had lunch aboard the boat, and then sailed back; snorkeling there was a lot of fun, this was the first time that I had absolutely no problems with my mask and snorkel, we saw tons of fish, and the staff even got my mom snorkeling [and she was completely set on not snorkeling since she doesn't know how to swim, plus she had injured her leg shortly before our trip]; there was also a photographer aboard the ship who took pictures of the passengers and the fish, and he led the more adventurous snorkelers to a spot where turtles swim; at the end of the sail my mom decided to purchase a CD of photos for $90 that the photographer had taken of our trip, I haven't seen the photos yet, but we did get the CD in the mail today..I don't know if it's worth the $90, but hopefully it is. We arranged all the activities (jet skiing, ocean rafting, luau, tour of the stars, parasailing, snorkel sail) through the Expedia!Fun Activities Desk, which is located on-site at the hotel. It wasn't cheap, but it was extremely convenient and trustworthy. You don't have to find outside companies on your own and make a whole bunch of calls to RSVP or to cancel. You just tell the staff at the Expedia Activities Desk what you want to do and on what days, and they'll do all the calling and research, and then they'll get back to you with your itinerary. This pretty much describes the Hyatt - anything that you want to do, they can pretty much arrange for you. You don't even have to leave the hotel grounds if you don't want to (there's shopping and dining right there). And if you did have to leave the hotel grounds, the hotel can arrange transportation for you. But all this convenience obviously does come at a price..which you should probably already be expecting, especially if you're traveling to a resort area in Maui. Some cons (or maybe I'm just being picky): the fridge we had in our room didn't work and we didn't know until about a day later, but after calling the front desk the staff did replace it; the bathroom lock and then the room lock didn't work, but again, after calling the front desk the staff fixed them Some tips/recommendations: - if you are not renting a car and don't mind spending an extra $10-15, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel instead of a shuttle (this meant that we didn't have to wait for other families to get their luggage off the carousel, especially since we only brought carry-on's and didn't need to go to the carousel at all; plus, we didn't know if we'd have to end up waiting for other families to get dropped off at their hotels first) - if you want an in-room refrigerator, request it beforehand (I think there is some kind of waiting list for fridges - I'm not sure if requesting beforehand will improve your chances, but I think it does) - if you can splurge on one activity at the Hyatt, choose the Hyatt's Kiele V snorkel sail (it's about $80/person, but it's worth it) - if you want a good seat at the pool (ie. a seat located at the main pool) go down by around 9:30 or 10AM, or I guess you can just lay your towel out in the morning and then go eat breakfast..but that gets so annoying for the other people looking for seats - if you're waiting until you get there to decide what activities you want to do, then make RSVP's for the activities you want as soon as you get there (activities like the snorkel sail or tour of the stars were booked for a few days, so if our stay had been shorter we wouldn't have been able to do those), but it's probably better to RSVP before your trip and if you need to cancel you usually have 48 hours before the activity to do so - you can stock up on water and snacks at one of the shops located in the Hyatt called Lamonte's (I know it's probably more expensive than driving over to a nearby Safeway in Lahaina, but if you don't have a car this is the next most convenient thing..whatever you do, just don't drink the bottled water in your hotel room by the mini-bar..unless you want to pay about $4) - if you are taking along any annoying little brothers make sure to set them up with a busy itinerary (I know it will end up being pricey..but trust me, the ocean rafting excursion kept my brother away from us for over 4 hours, plus he was exhausted when he got back..so that was nearly one whole day without his whining) - and finally, don't bring luggage..only bring carry-on's, bring one backpack filled with your stuff and an empty duffel bag in case you want to fill it up with gifts, so on the way back you will have 2 carry-on's (the maximum that our airline allowed us)..you will also spend less time packing and more time enjoying your stay there..and you really don't need all that stuff!", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pickerington, OH", "Title": "\u201cAwesome !!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3725541", "Content": "Just returned from a 7 night stay.

This was the pattern from the coffee shop to the staff that passed out towels. Food: Excellent but very expensive. What do you expect for the Hyatt at Maui. The Swan Court breakfast buffet is outstanding with great service but will run a family of 4 about $100. Try it once. Then go to the buffet at the poolside resaurant and get close to the same thing for $40 less. Food and drinks at the pool are great but pricey. Have a few meals at the hotel but venture to Lahaina for others at a better price. We stopped at the Safeway in Lahaina and stocked up on pop, chips, etc. A can of pop by the pool will cost you $2.60 and a burger is $9. Facilities: Incredible !! Beautiful pool. Huge with a waterfall that separates the big adult pool from the kids area. Even though the hotel was sold out it never seemed crowded. Get to the pool early for chairs but beware, they watch them closely and tag them for how long you are gone. They will pull towels after 1 hour if nobody shows up. This is nice really because many chairs went unclaimed. The water slide in the kids pool is great, even for adults. Hard pool to beat. The swim up bar is actually located in the waterfall tunnel between the pools and you are not really in the water but close enough. Nice place to sit and have a $9 drink. The hotel grounds are gorgeous with waterfalls, animals, etc.. Hard to beat We went to the Luau sponsored by the hotel and it was great. Excellent food and very entertaining show on a nice stage. We spent extra for VIP seating and food service. After a tired trip it was worth it. No long line to wait in, seated first, ate first and were in the front row for the show. If you go the standard route plan to line up at least 45 minutes before it starts and wait in line in the sun. Rooms were clean and plenty of space. Had a nice partial ocean view in the main tower. Nice balcony to sit on at night and late afternoon. Exercise room is incredible. Both of my kids are training for cross country and they had beautiful treadmills with TV's built in. The Nautilus equipment was incredible. If you work out this is the place to go. Better than most gyms I see in the states Beach: Not real good right at the Hyatt but you only need to walk about 20 minutes on a nice path to the Sheraton for a fantastic beach and great snorkeling. We did this several times. You can also walk to Whalers village for shopping and food. The path is concrete, lighted at night and travels along the shore past all the hotels. Real nice. We also drove up the road to the Public Beach park for one of the best beaches we have ever seen. Don't be afraid to stray of the property for some fun. You can't go wrong here. Incredible facility. Yes it is expensive but you are on Maui and everthint is. You get what you pay for here. I do suggest buying the gook Maui Revealed to get great tips on what to do, what to see, where to eat, etc..

For example, my wife had mistakenly left my garment bag at the airport. When we discovered it the next day, we asked the conceriege for the phone number to Aloha Airlines. She asked why and we told her. Within 10 minutes, she called me back and told me that she contacted Aloha and they found my bag. She was about to make arrangements for Aloha to deliver the bag! Talk about customer service! Also, we went during a very, very busy time. But the place did not feel crowded. We never had a problem finding a chair by the pool. The only complaints (and I use the term mildly) was that I thought Camp Hyatt was a little weak (more activities needed for the kids..seeemed like they spend too much time coloring and watching movies) and the cocktail service by the pool was a tad slow when we first arrived (but by the end of the week, the waitresses knew us and they were on it!). We stayed in the Regency Club level of the hotel. The continental breakfast and evening cocktails were a very, very nice touch. Yes I realize it comes at a premium but I felt it ws worth the price. Following our stay at the Hyatt, we drove over to the Grand Wailea for a 4 day stay . While the GW may have better pools (the Hyatt pool is no slouch though) and the beaches directly in front of the GW were better, IMO the Hyatt offered a much friendlier atmosphere and we did not feel squeezed together at the Hyatt like we did at GW.

We had two rooms as my mother-in-law was travelling with our family of four. Both rooms were fine and similar to the pictures on the website. The bedroom was average-sized and the bathroom area was somewhat generous. The porch/lenai was a little small, had a a partial ocean view and could seat two people.

Valet parking was $10/day and they practically forced you to use it by making the regular parking lot too small - it was about 20% the size of the valet lot.

Note the Sheraton pictures look very good on-line, but when you see how small the pool is you will not want to stay there. The Hyatt hotel had a massive pool with waterfalls and a separate smaller pool for children. It also has a very hot hot-tub which I enjoyed. Some of the pool lounge have a top cover that you can slide up if you want shade. None of the other hotels had these type of lounge chairs. Ice water stations were provided at the pool which was very convenient. Food and drinks are expensive, but like most people we walked down or took the free shuttle to Whaler's village to get a better deal on food. Overall interior of hotel was beautiful and definitely 5 star. This is the best hotel if you are going to spend most of your time at the pool like us. Also note the beach is very small at this hotel and gets bigger by the time you get to the Sheraton. However, most days a red flag was up due to under currents so not many people were at the beach or in the ocean for the 7 days we were there. If you want to have a hotel at the beach where you can go in the water then I would strongly reccomend Waikiki which has much cheaper hotels like the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach (see my review). Overall clientle was more upper crust which was in-line with the $385 we paid a nite. I probably won't stay in Maui again as Waikiki on Oahu is about 60% of the cost and there is a lot more in terms of nitelife, shopping and much greater selection of restaurants. However, for those who want more relaxation and to get away from the hustle and bustle and can afford it, I would strongly reccomend the Hyatt as it was the best hotel in the Kanapali area.

I was concerned about this hotel before we went there because of some of the reviews on this site. After our experience there I realized most of the negative reviews were just picking on little things. The only negatives 2 pina colada drinks at the pool was close to $20 and if you're looking for a beach this is not the place. When we arrived we had a deluxe ocean view room which they upgraded to a deluxe ocean front room which had a view of the pool and of course the ocean. We headed to the pool and found it not to be crowded, keep in mind we were there during off season. The pool is excellent and the water slide is great. It lasts for about 5 secs then dumps you into 9 ft of water. To save a spot at the pool, grab your towels at the pool activities desk and lay your towels out on a chair. Do this at about 830 then grab breakfast and be back at the pool in an hour. If you're not back they'll remove your towels and assume you've left. Breakfast at Swan court can get crowded so eat at the pavillion by the pool its the same food and less crowded. As for the beach, you can rent a cabana for $30 an hour. I don't recommend doing that too expensive. Just walk towards whaler's village where there is a nicer beach. Also don't rent snorkel gear through the hotel $15 a day. Go to West Maui Sports $2.50 a day located behind Safeway or Snorkel Bobs $9 for a week for your snorkel gear. Since the beach was not good at the Hyatt, My wife and I went to the beach at the Sheraton Maui to Snorkel (Black Rock) which is a 20 min walk from the Hyatt or a 5 min drive. If you can't find free parking the hotels will charge $20 a day to park. Just a little tip, park inside Whaler's village. They'll give you 3 free hrs of parking if you buy something $10 or more. So buy something you're going to take back to the mainland. Then hit the beach. When your 3 hrs is almost up return to your car, drive out, then back in. Go back to a store, buy something like a maui t-shirt, then get the ticket validated again for 3 hrs. There you go 6hrs of parking for the beach and some gifts to bring back with you all for $20 or pay $20 at one of the hotels and all you get is a walk through their parking lot. Snorkeling at Black Rock was good we later went north on route 30 to Napili bay to snorkel, very nice calm water. During our stay I got sick, what was great about the hotel is that there is a doctor on site (Doctors on call). The staff at the hotel was very nice, I have no complaints about the staff. The room we had was clean and comfortable. I recommend eating out because the hotel restaurants are pretty expensive. Try the Aloha Mix Plate Grill right behind the Lahaina Cannery Mall and the Hula Grill at Whalers village. I also recommend the Pacific Whale Foundation if you want to snorkel Molokini and Lanai Island, just be advised that the water you'll be snorkeling in will be deep between 45-20 ft. Kinda wierd if you've never snorkeled in that deep of water before but you do get use to it. Well we had a great vacation at the Hyatt.

Neither my husband or myself received one, although the couple checking in directly before and after us did. (Not a big deal, but just the icing on the cake to what happened next.) We were told by the front desk that we should take our bell ticket to the bell station and we would be assisted to our room with the baggage. We proceeded to the bell station and were told that no bellmen were available at the moment as they were all delivering bags, but that the next one available would bring our bags up momentarily. After travelling from the East coast of the US, we were tired from the travel and just wanted to take showers and change our clothes. After an hour had passed, my husband called the bell station because our bags had not arrived. My husband then walked down to the bell station and was told that \"even if they had the bags there, they couldn't release them to him.\" They had my husband checking storage to see if the bags were there. Because they weren't, he assumed they were on their way up and came back to the room. He asked me if the bags had arrived while he was downstairs and I said no. It got to the point that we had to speak with the manager before any real action was taken. Turns out they cannot read their own writing and the bags ended up at another room. Way to start out, Hyatt Regency Maui. I was not sure what to expect regarding the condition of the room, as I had read several different experiences here on TripAdvisor. Our room was VERY clean, including the tub which in most hotels seems to be the most neglected area by housekeeping. The bathroom, however was very small and confining. I couldn't even lay the bath mat towel down all the way. The bathroom sink was seperate from the commode and shower, which was nice. This allowed us to get ready in the morning without having the sink mirror steamed up from the shower. Housekeeping did a wonderful job in our room, however as we later found out, they have until 4pm to service your room. This can be a bit frustrating if you use up your towels in the morning and spend the afternoon at the pool. You either have to use wet towels or wait for new ones. A bit of advice-request a specific time for housekeeping for each day of your visit. Our 'Garden View' was more like a parking lot view. We weren't too disappointed since it was quiet at night and it seems most people weren't active after 8pm! The bed was extremely comfortable, probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. I couldn't believe this was a hotel mattress! I slept like a baby every night of our stay. The hotel grounds were immaculate and the staff that worked the grounds were very friendly. Several of the staff whose job it was to water and prune the plants/bushes were happy to talk to us about the plants and answer questions we had. The spa at the hotel was excellent. The staff was a pleasure to deal with and both my husband and myself agreed that it was the most relaxing massage we have had. The spa has a meditation room for post-massage relaxing, complete with fruit and plenty of icewater. It faces the beach and it would have been extremely relaxing if there was not reggae music blasting in from the beach. The spa also offered a sauna, steam room, jaccuzzi and shower facilities in the locker room, complete with toiletries such as mouthwash, hairspray, etc. The only thing I would not recommend with the spa, is getting the massage on the beach. This is done in cabanas with the side facing the ocean open. Not a problem there, but these cabanas are located right along the walking path by the pool. I wouldn't find that very relaxing. We were happy we chose to save the added expense by having the massages done in the Spa itself. I think we tried every restaurant at the hotel and were not disappointed at any time with the meals. The Swan Court breakfasts were wonderful and I recommend getting the breakfast buffet added in to your stay. Everything was good (except for the eggs-but then again I am very picky when it comes to eggs) and they offered a very nice variety of foods.", "Date": "May 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cParadise found!\u201d", "Author": "Mauionmymind", "ReviewID": "UR3500502", "Content": "Me, my wife and our 6 yr old twins stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Lahaina from May 5 thru May 10 '05. We originally had reservations at the Embassy Suites just up the beach a couple of miles but when we showed for check-in, were informed that they had over-booked. They tried to move us to the Aston Kaanapali Shores, which is immediately adjacent to the Embassy Suites, but an inferior property. (This will be the subject of another review) When we drove up to the Hyatt, we could immediately tell this this was going to be a spectacular resort from the lush grounds and the very attentive bell staff. The person who checked us in was very nice and gave us a room upgrade beyond what Embassy had offered to pay for so we got an Ocean View in the Napili wing which also happens to be near the kids pool area so it worked out great. The atrium area adjacent to the lobby is absolutely stunning and they have several different animals which the kids enjoyed, including penguins, koi fish, swans and flamingo's. The pool is very large with a separate adult and kids section separated by what I was told was a natural rock formation with two waterfalls and a swim up bar in the cave. The adult water slide which cuts through the rocks is a blast and needless to say, the kids loved their pool, so we spent the majority of the days at the pool. Now for the downside. All this luxury and beauty comes at a cost. The food in the restaurants, the drinks and everything is fairly expensive. I would say it is in-line with what you would expect to pay at a 5 star resort, but just be prepared to spend around $100 minimum for dinner and ~$50 for lunch. There are places off-site, such as at Whalers Village which is about a 10 - 15 minute walk north past some other fabulous properties including the Marriott Ocean Club and Westin.

Checking in was a breeze and the bell hop gave a tour as he walked us to our room. Our travel agent set up with a package deal that included a terrace room, the 6th night free and breakfast every morning in the Swan Court. The front desk clerk said that a terrace room was basically looking out at the parking lot and changed us to a view of the gardens, without my even asking. Incidentally our view was not only of the gardens, but we could see the ocean as well--it was incredible! The room was nicely decorated with Hawaiian quilts on the bed and dark wood furniture. We requested a refrigerator which was brought up promptly. We ate at the Swan Court, since we had the breakfast for free and it was more than I had expected. It was a full brunch buffet and the food was delicious. We also had dinner at Cascades, one of the onsite restaurants that specialized in steak and seafood. Our sushi appetizers were super! There is not much beach to be had at the Hyatt. My husband though is not one to go swimming off of the beach when there is a perfectly good pool right on the premises. Maybe because we went in May, there weren't a lot of kids around--so that wasn't an issue. The pool was refreshing and I even went down the water slide a few times. I would definitely stay at the Hyatt again. While in Maui, we biked down the Haleakala Volcano, snorkeled at Molokini, saw the show Ulalena, went to the Feast at Lele, saw the show at Warren and Annabelle's, and took a helicopter tour. We had so much fun doing all these activities and I booked everything on my own prior to the trip with the exception of the bike and helicopter tours and Ulalena.

No check-in line upon arrival and met with a lei greeting. Paid with Hyatt certificates, told we were getting a partial ocean view, but for $50/nite could get a full ocean view. The partial ocean was a parking lot view in the Napili tower (anything on the outside of the Napili tower is over the parking lot) The ocean view room was in a great location, but dirty. The couch and rug were very stained-would not pay $450 (we were there for 8 nights) for a dirty room so went back down to the desk and told them we didn't want either room-rather we'd like an \"inside\"(facing the pool, ocean) room that wasn't all the way at the ocean end because we didn't want to pay the extra and was clean. They didn't have anything non-smoking,king until 2 days away, so we looked at a queen/double and a smoking king. We chose the smoking king, because it has the couch and coffee table, which the queen/doubkle did not. You could smell smoke occassionally in the hallway but not at all in the room. The rooms were very nice/minimalistic, but nice, with a low bed and really thick mattress, single sink, walk in closet. Bath area dark, but nice. The room wasn't very clean, lot of dust on the mirror and the sliding glass doors to the lanai had handprints, but I guess that's what you get at such a busy hotel. The pool, grounds, lobby are gorgeous. The kids section of the pool was a little too big and the swim through cave and cave bar were a little yucky. No beach in front of the Hyatt anymore, but you can walk down aways to a wider beach- the beach at the other end of K'anapali in front of the Sheraton was very nice. Saw a whale breeching out of the ocean when we walked down there. Whaler's Village restaurants good, but always a wait. Breakfast at the Hyatt is wonderful, but expensive. The other negative besides cleanliness was noise. The Hyatt has a lot of functions/weddings and they set them up on the lawn by the ocean by the Napili tower and they go past 10 p.m. Nice at first when you're getting ready for dinner, but the loud music gets old after awhile. Would say the Lahaina tower, inside would be the quietest place to stay. Atrium tower has tile floors and is over the open-air lobby. Hallways are very dark. There was ample parking, but not near the Napili tower as functions park in that lot-many times we had to park in the back behind the Lahaina tower. This review sounds a little negative, but just trying to give you a realistive view of the property. Overall, the Hyatt is beautiful and the staff was very helpful-waitresses by the pool brought water, rec'd a fridge in the room right after requesting one, and once the maid didn't restock our coffee, called down and they sent some up right away.

We booked room for cheap price through costco -- we not expecting much, so no surprise when arrived in room. Very dated, musty, old fixtures, virtually no \"lania\". We asked to me moved on second night to room across the hall, which was on the ground floor, over looking gardens. The front desk clerk offered to do it for an upgrade, but I pointed out that the reason we wanted to move was because the noise from the events outside our window going on until late at night and the kids could not sleep. She moved us, the room was still old and musty, but the kids could walk out the sliding glass doors to play in the grass. So to us, the room was fabulous! We had the breakfast deal, so ate every morning at the swan court. They charged us $12 each for the kids. Food ok. Palm Court kind of gross with the birds flying around. The pools were a total miss. The sandy beach area was too babyish for my 5 year old, and the other side of the pool was 9 feet deep - so too deep for the 10 year old. So they had to play in the 3ft water - which was underneath the artificial \"cave\" structure. We spent 2 days sneaking into the Marriott pool, which in my opinion was much more family friendly. The kids enjoyed the beach down in front of Whalers Village as well. There really is no beach in front of the Hyatt, and what is there has rocks. We also walked down to Whalers Village for most of our other meals. There is a McDonalds there with limited menu. My kids liked \"Hula Grill\" and we ate there about every day. Then went to Haagen Daz for dessert. We attended the Luau at the Hyatt, and since my kids are used to Disney Cruise entertainment, they thought it incredibly boring. I thought it was ok, nothing great. We did purchase the pics they took. My husband and I both play tennis, so we went to the tennis clinic a few times. The pro was very nice, didn't really provide useful game improvement suggestions. Tennis Facilities very nice. There was no attempt to set up any matches though. The racquets available were very old and worn, so if you are a serious player, bring your own. I agree the workout room at the Hyatt was VERY nice. Too bad it did not carry over into the hotel rooms. Took the shuttle several times into Lahina, it was hit or miss whether it showed up. It stops outside all the hotels once per hour, and if you catch it, it's just $1 to get to Lahina. We did the Sugar Cane train. That was a waste. The only sugar cane was a 6 foot patch in the middle of the road. The kids didn't even like it.

Pretty nice area. Visibly a lot busier than Wailea. On a strip with other hotels, across from a golf course, and ten minute walk to Whalers Village. Hotel is 10-minutes from Kapalua and 5-minutes from Lahaina. Obvious when you drive up that this is a busy hotel. Line of cars waiting to get to the front whether to valet or drop of passengers. Valet is $10 a day. Received a lei greeting for each person in party. Very nice. I had on a white sirt which was stained by the flowers. No biggie, it's Hawaii. Only two associates available to check-in guests. We arrived around mid-day to a line of folks trying to check-in. Took about 30-minutes. Received a room on the 14th floor in the Atrium tower. That is the main tower of the hotel. Quite noisy. Lobby is open-air with plenty of greenery. Many of the restaurants and pools are in this building. Lots and lots of kids. Even for April. Not the hotel for a honeymoon couple. The hotel has a nice shopping area which includes a small Macys. Simply stated, the hotel is huge and caters to families. Pool has waterfalls and caves. Sure it is the main attraction for families. This hotel also has a conference center as many Hyatts do. The 14th floor happens to be the first floor of rooms in the Atrium building. Hotel resembles an Embassy Suites. Doors are facing atrium with lanai views varying. Our room had 1 full and 1 queen bed. They were pretty comfortable. Lanai is EXTREMELY small. Our view was the roof and ocean if you stand at an angle. We also had a mountain view. Bathroom is unique. Vanity area is very small. However, the area with the tub/shower and commode is large. There is a wood sliding door that separates the bath from vanity. Closet is extremely small. Refrigerator is fully stocked with items for sale. As a result, you would have to remove things if you have drinks, etc. Housekeeping was ok. Had to ask for extra towels everyday. Received a pretty good deal on the room. Paid 221.25 a night and had a $25 a day credit. Athletic facility is awesome. Great view of ocean while you work-out. Plenty and varied equipment. Utlized Penny at the concierge to help with dinner and activity arrangements. She is awesome. Breakfast at the Swan Court is $21.95 per person and worth every penny. We enjoyed the swans and food for almost 2 hours. Coffee was wonderful. I'm really not a coffee drinker and thought it was the best I ever had. Also, best portugues sausage I ever had.

The staff was very friendly, I will admit when we first got there we found ants in our bathroom but once we brought it to the attention of the front desk they quicklycleaned and gave us a $50 resort credit. Cascades has great drinks and the ribs are out of this world. We did go there for a complete dinner one night, it was rather costly but the food was good. We had breakfast at the Swan court every morning because it was included in our stay, the food varied on days but the view was very nice and again the staff was friendly. We went to the laua at the hotel and it was nice however we found that people who went on one of those time share presentations got there tixs for $51 where we paid $150. And if you do go to the laua don't pay the extra $ to have vip all the seats give good views just make sure you get on line for the laua about 20 mins before they tell you to and you'll get a good seat. The pool was very crowded but keep in mind we went for easter week so I think you get the idea. The chairs were pretty much always taken or reserved but what the beach staff does is they give you an hour time limit to reserve a chair and they even put a paper on your chair to stamp the time so if the person is not back within the hour they reassign the chair. or you can just ask them to help you find a chair and they are very helpful. The bathroom was dark and I expected a better shower, the toilet seemed to always fill to the top as if to overflow but then it always went down. The bed was so comfortable, the balcony was small, we stayed in the lahaina tower but it wasn't like we were on it too long so it didn't matter. The gym was cool remember to bring your door key with you. Also there is a heliport on top of the hotel so if you want to take any tours ask if the helicopter leaves from the hotel. Also if you go whale watching see if you can leave from lahaina instead of driving down to the harbor, it'll save you time.

I read all the reviews and was a little concerned about some of the negative comments I had read - but none of those affected our stay. We arrived in the late afternoon and, despite a small crowd waiting to check-in, all was handled promptly and we were in our room in minutes. Our Terrace room was very nice - clean, well appointed, spacious, walk-in closet and good sized bath/dressing area - and actually had a great view of the ocean from the balcony. We had a complementary mini-fridge delivered within minutes of our request. We had a package deal that included breakfast in the Swan Court every morning, too, which was a great selection of fruit, breads, eggs, meats, cakes, pastries and cooked-to-order omelettes; maybe not worth $23/person, but great if you can get it as part of the package. I agree with many of the reviews I've read and some of the negative comments - but it really depends on what you are expecting. The beach is very narrow - not really conducive to lying out on the beach or playing in the sand. As others have stated, it's a very short walk to areas of larger beach, too. If hanging out on the beach right at your hotel is a priority, this is probably not your best choice. The restaurants may well be overpriced. We only ate at the Swan, which was included, and around the pool, which was no worse than what I've paid at resorts in other places. A few minute walk to the Whaler's Village area or a few minute drive to Lahaina offers plenty of restaurant choices that were reasonable. If you plan to eat meals regularly at your resort hotel, I would expect it to seem pricey. The pool area is packed with chairs; at full capacity, I'm sure it seems overcrowded. We regularly went out for activities and siteseeing in the morning, then never had a problem getting chairs by the pool or in the lawn to spend the afternoon. The pool area is nice, and much larger than some of the other resort hotels along this strip. Cool water slide, cave bar and children's play area, too. Parking is difficult, but never a problem. They pack 'em in like sardines, but we were always able to self-park. Sometimes it was in the overflow lot at the far end of the hotel, but we never forced to valet (and the hotel was at full capacity).

Recommendation is to go early in the morning in order to scout out the best place to lay your beach towels. As for prices, you will be ripped off at any of the major hotel restaurants.

We were treated well on check-in and given a free upgrade for a deluxe oceanfront room.

There is a decent beach if you walk just a few minutes down the vast expanse of resort hotels in this area. Not very impressed by the restaurant choices at the resort and they are VERY overpriced (and I live in Boston) for what they are. Would HIGHLY recommend Sansei in Kapalua Bay for phenomenal sushi as well as Nick's Fishmarket at the Fairmont Kea Lani ($$$ but worth it) and Pacifico's right in town. If I had to do Maui over again for my honeymoon I would choose a quieter, more secluded place to stay such as around Kapalua Bay or the Fairmont Kea Lani (this place is pricey but awesome and uncrowded). Now the unpleasant details of our stay at the Hyatt. Our friends contacted the concierge about wanting to charter a fishing trip for us. They were told that the best bet would be a Hyatt gift certificate that could be used toward fishing and then be carried over to our stay at the Hyatt Kauai if there was a balance. We received a gift certificate for $1000 and before cashing it in verified with the front desk that we would receive credit or another gift certificate for the balance upon check-out. What a mistake! Upon check-out we were told that we would have to eat the balance (about $100) and it could NOT be forwarded to Hyatt Kauai (where we would have preferred to use it because it is a much more luxurious, classy place). There was NO manager in the entire hotel that we could speak with at that time and we were told that someone would contact us in Kauai. Of course we had to call them repeatedly before they finally agreed to credit my credit card I had left with them. Three months later and I realized that I was not credited and no one bothered to contact me. Now they refuse to credit me and claim it is their \"policy\" which we were not told about and was not in writing. They have therefore turned to profit the remainder of a very generous wedding gift from our friends without providing any goods or services.

She didn't come for 3 hours. Ugly building, it doesn't fit in with hawaii, and it looks like an old office building in china town from the 80's. This hotel tries to make up for its 80's look with the pool. The pool is fun tell one of the hundreds of kids I was swimming by starting giggling for no reason. When I asked her what was wrong she said she was going to the bathroom. Gross!! This freaked me out since there were kids everywhere all giggling. Also the rooms are Asian themed and fit in with the hotel, but not Hawaii.

Some of the extremely negative comments concerned me, so I may have lowered my expectations somewhat. Having returned last week from a week-long stay at the Hyatt, I must say the facilities and staff far exceeded my expectations. I was in Maui for the Maui Invitational basketball tournament and part of a package deal with a travel agency, so I don't know what they paid. Included was the $15 resort fee that many complain about. I had an oceanfront deluxe room in the main tower with an awesome view. The bathroom was standard and small, but I spent so little time in the room that it was not a big concern for me. So if you spend lots of time in the bathroom, look elsewhere. And yes, there's not much beach at the Hyatt. But from the looks of most folks on the beach--the ones who obviously ate their money's worth at the luau-- the short and and pleasant walk on the beach walk is a good way to lose some excess baggage. Certainly if you're too lazy to make it, look elsewhere. The pools and grounds of the Hyatt are impressive and the staff was very responsive to my requests. Dinner at Cascades was very good and what I expected to pay in Hawaii. If you're looking to save money, there's a McDonald's in Whaler's Village, but then you're missing out on some of the local specialties that also can be found in the Village. I didn't want the hassle of a rental car (gas on Maui is currently $2.67 a gallon, and parking is rarely free) so I got everywhere I wanted by shuttle or taxi. The bus from the Hyatt to Lahaina is just a buck (taxi is about $10) and I often found taxis pulling up minutes before the bus offering cheaper fares. But don't fall for the frequent cab driver ruse that the bus was full and skipping the Hyatt. I made a couple of visits to the Westin and found it attractive, although I much preferred the Hyatt's shopping venues to the Westin's self-promotion of other resorts and time-shares. The convenience of the shops in the Hyatt was nice, but I'd suggest you first hit the ABC Store (more than alcohol) in Whaler's Village or along Front Street in Lahaina or the Hilo Hattie in Lahaina for better values. Among my first things I'd recommend after checking in at the Hyatt is to visit Aloha Services between the buildings. Gael was most helpful in suggesting and planning my activities and arranging the necessary pick-ups using the universally-accepted voucher system. I did the Old Lahaina Luau and was very pleased with it, particularly after seeing some of the Hyatt's while strolling the beach walk. A number of my friend's tried to steer me away from a helicopter ride, but the views were well worth the money and I never worried about my safety. My biggest regrets? Not being able to spend another week on Maui. I got most of my major activities done (the exception being seeing the sun rise and then biking down Haleakala) but would have loved to spend more time on the beach and would have liked to check out the Hyatt fitness center as well.

There is a $15 per day service charge which is said to cover a short spread of what should be considered accommodations (included) The $10 valet contrary to other reviews, we received a tip from one of the hotel employees indicating that as long as we moved the car to the parking lot before 10:00 PM the first night, we would not be charged. This was a good tip because the lot is not far from the patio level, and the valet can back up heavily in the evening not to mention the savings. Overall the grounds were beautiful, the beach is a moderate stroll from the hotel as there is little beach front directly in front of the hotel which went from grass to water.

We were initially given a fairly small room. It immediately became apparent that noise was going to be an issue. The rooms are not soundproofed well and there was a large family spread across four other rooms on the floor; the kids were running up and down the halls, etc. I went to inquire with the front desk about the possibility of switching rooms. The front desk clerk apologized profusely, explaining that he had checked in that family and had a feeling he would be receiving complaints. He switched us to a slightly more spacious room on a lower floor. Both rooms were spotless and very comfortable, with nice furnishings. Noise was a problem throughout our stay, but not hugely so. It's just not a well soundproofed property. I'm a light sleeper, though, so take with a grain of salt. There was a wedding on the beach one night with music blasting from a DJ clearly audible in our room, but it wrapped up by 9PM. All of the staff we came into contact with were beyond helpful. They were friendly, conversational, and knowlegable. The morning we intended to set out for Haleakala we ordered a picnic basket from room service and the gentleman who delivered it suggested we instead go to Hana that day. He was right - Haleakala was totally clouded in. He further suggested driving all the way around the other side past Hana (a rental car no-no) and he was right on that account as well. All the staff was like this -- conversational and excited to help, offer suggestions, whatever. The beach directly in front of the Hyatt is not fantastic (rocky), but not as bad as the Marriott. It's better if you walk towards the Spa Moana end of the Hyatt property or go down by the Westin. The pool, on the other hand, is wonderful -- relaxing, laid back, and huge. People are not tripping (or floating, as the case may be) over one another. The poolside bars serve excellent drinks, the best we had in Hawaii. The restaurants are very good; we ate at Cascades and Spats. Both were delicious, with creative dishes. We used the services of the Spa and it was outstanding. Clean, beautiful, and relaxing. The day we were to leave, I called to request a late checkout and was told that we could stay until 4pm with a $75 charge. Wasn't thrilled about it but I agreed to it. When I went downstairs to check out, the $75 charge wasn't on my bill; the clerk looked at the bill and decided that because we had used so many services of the hotel (spa, restaurants, etc) that he would waive the fee, which was very nice of him.

We read all of these reviews, and they were exetremely helpful and truthful. Yes, the beach in front of the Hyatt is a little bit of a bummer because it's just a thin strip, but once you see the grounds of this resort, you will want nothing to do with the Beach! Or, maybe because we were hiking and exploring for 8 days in Oahu and Kauai, the poolside--no sand--relaxation was just what we needed. You can certainly find a chair by the pool - it's just not going to be lining the pool unless you get up early in the morning. The drinks are wonderful, and they are served with an orchid in them (Yes, Very expensive...expect to pay $20 for two drinks, which includes a $1.50 tip) and the food at the Swan Court is wonderful. We told them it was our Honeymoon and they upgraded our room (which was beautiful, and the beds are as wonderful as everyone says they are) invited us to a Honeymooner's Reception at the Weeping Banyan for FREE cocktails and a spread of cheeses, fruits, veg's.

In Kauai, they gave us nothing extra for being on our Honeymoon...but at the Hyatt they treated us like royalty.

This is why they overcompensate on the pool. If you envision yourself relaxing by the ocean all day, do not stay here. In fact, they charge $30 for the high-end chaise lounges and do not have many others to use on the beach. Another complaint is the pool gets crowded. Trust me. Have fun finding a place to sit. As for the cleanliness of the hotel, it could be improved. The decor of the room was nice, but everything seemed a bit dinged up and worn. We also had to notify staff of a dead bird that had flown into a window. They got rid of the bird, but failed to clean the smear on the window. Other hotels wouldn't miss that. Restaurants were pretty good but they didn't blow us away. Maybe we were jaded because we stayed on the Big Island first and enjoyed some fabulous restaurants, but they were missing something. Even Swan Court needs some remodeling, if you ask us. Not as romantic as we thought it would be. The staff were friendly, upgrading us to a Deluxe Oceanfront Room and sent a bottle of champagne. We also had a convertible and breakfast included in our room rate. Make sure you get the breakfast included, food is pricey. Save your money for lunch and drinks at the pool if you do decide to stay here. Plus plan on getting charged a $15/day resort fee PLUS $10 for valet parking. Hey it's Maui, so I won't complain about prices, but that seems a bit much. The spa and fitness center are awesome, and definitely top notch. We took a trip up to Kapalua and saw the Kapalua Bay Hotel. This is an amazing hotel, but the weather at the Hyatt is much better, trust what you read. Kapalua gets rain showers and mist in the afternoon. Overall, it's a big, fun hotel with lots to do and only minutes from Lahaina, but if you want lots of sand then be careful. The Sheraton has awesome beach frontage, but I noticed a lot of families there, so beware Honeymooners. The Makena and Wailea resorts have great beaches, so investigate those options before you book this hotel. I give it a 4 out of 5 because it does have a huge pool and a lot of dining and activity options, but lacks the quality beach frontage and could be cleaned up a bit. One more thing.

The Hyatt is on the Kaahanapali beach and has a sidewalk which goes along the beach behind all the other hotels so you can walk from the Hyatt down to the Sheraton if you wanted. The Sheraton is where Black Rock is and is a great place to snorkel expecially if it is your first time. I recommend renting your gear from Maui dive shop. There are shops in the Whaler's Village between the Hyatt and the Sheraton or in Lahaina Cannery Mall. Most week long rental will get you a free snorkel cruise. A must in Maui is a helicopter tour.

The Good - The resort is absolutely beautiful on the outside - the gardens, wildlife (swans, flamingos, penguins, koi fish, cranes and parrots), poolside and beach front. The Lacking Room & Service - they were nice enuf to upgrade us to a partial oceanview and looking out from the (really) tiny balcony we could see the pool, gardens and ocean to the right. however, i've stayed in rooms that were much more luxurious and paid less at an all-inclusive. there's no full length mirror, no iron or ironing board (u have to call for it) and their policy is to only change the sheets after 4 nights and u'll only get turndown service if u request it. i requested clean sheets nightly and turndown service and still didn't get it until i put in a second phone call. Nickel & Diming ya - the resort has a lot going on, but you've gotta pay. if u want to sit on the very narrow beach bring your towel and be prepared to station yourself in front of those lounging on wood loungers with the covered cabanas that one must rent. the star-gazing event at the resort is $20 per person. the yoga and all other classes had a fee. everything has a price tag. oh yes, and how can i forget the rip-off $15 per night resort fee! it's a total crock. it's not optional and is supposed to cover the cost of your daily newspaper, use of the in-room safe and coffee pot and little things like that. why not just include it in the room rate?! besides, other nicer hotels include these things for free or it's just part of the room rate. What We Liked - the gym was nice and apparently open at all times with good equipment. the breakfast buffet was delicious (the chocolate-banana cake divine!) and it was $21.95 pp+tax. (so it ain't cheap!) (we checked the dinner menu and most entrees were $36. we found good and reasonable dinner spots elsewhere). the free self-parking lot was an advantage, but it was usually packed and the spaces are tight. Tips - get your water from the Safeway in Lahaina. (the fiji bottles in the room were $4.50 each) and we bought our souvenir pineapples from there too (the produce guy was terrific and full of information!). and u can get cheap excursions or even free ones by attending a timeshare presentation (just stick to saying NO). the westin even gives u $100. Last Piece of Advice - save some money, get better service, better facilities and a better time in the Caribbean. St. Lucia's LeSport Body Holiday was heaven and the Dominican Republic's Secrets Resort is also a slice of perfection - both places are all inclusive with terrific food and LeSport even gives u daily spa treatments.

We consider ourselves to be fairly picky/discriminating when it comes to accomodations, food, and beaches. Impressions: We thought the Hyatt was great. It's located on a nice part of the island -- Ka'anapali beach is nice, and the beachwalk that runs about a mile form the Hyatt up to Black Rock past the restaurants is nice. The Hyatt is definitely one of these nicest looking hotels on that beach. The lanscaping is very nice, the pool is great, and the ocean views are great. We had a partial ocean view room, meaning that from inside the room, you saw the adjacent building and part of the moutain, but when you step out onto your (little) terrace, you can see the ocean. The room itself was nice with a TV, minibar, pull-out sofa, desk, etc. You can even get a mini fridge delivered to your room for no cost. I'm sure you can get a nicer room at one of the more expensive resorts, but who cares? We spent most of our time outside. The food is very good. We ate at Cascades Grill several times for the fish and sushi. We also ventured off the property several times to try out other restaurants, but Cascades was just so convenient. We also ate at the Swan one night, and it was also very good. The breakfast buffet there is incredible. Other positives include the gym, spa, water slide, good concierge service, and friendly staff. Negatives: As others have reported, the beach in front of the hotel is just ok. It's pretty narrow, and the water is not as clear as other places. Plus, there are some rocks that can be a little hazardous. However, you can walk 15 minutes up the beach past the Marriott towards Black Rock and there is a great beach. The water is clear and calm, and there are restaurants, bars, and chair/cabana rentals right there. There are also a couple of public parking lots on either side of Whaler's Village if you don't want to walk. In front of the Marriott, there is some decent surf where you can take surfing lessons...The beach in front of the Hyatt is fine for lounging with a book and a cold drink. Parking -- at certain times the two parking lots can become full, especially during the luas in the evenings. This is annoying, but we discovered that you can do valet parking and tell them that the lots are full, and they will not charge you...Well, they're not supposed to. If they do, just tell the front desk to take the charges off when you check out. Expensive -- yes, it is expensive, but all of Maui is expensive, esp. the resorts. You can save money by shopping at the Wal-Mart near the airport and avoiding things in the resorts. Other tips: We did the bike ride down the volcano at sunrise, and we highly recommend waiting and doing the mid-day ride. We had to leave the hotel at 2 am and it was cold, plus we couldn't see much of the volcano anyway. Sleep in, wait til it warms up and the sun is out, and do the mid-day ride. Pack some fleece, esp. if you do the morning ride. It was fun, and anyone can do it. We didn't do a luau, because they seem so cheesy. You can look over the fence, and check out the one at the hotel. Signing up for activities through the hotel concierge service is expensive. You can get much better rates on the bike ride, water activities, etc. by going into Lahaina or away from the resorts. In Lahaina, there is lots of competition to keep rates down. The activity companies along the Kaanapali beach are expensive. For instance, if you drive to the surfing beaches south of Lahaina, you can rent a surfboard all day for $25-$30. It'll cost you that much PER HOUR at the resorts. Lahaina is a cheesy tourist town with tons of souvenir shops, but there are some good restaurants there. Before you leave, drive East on 36 past the airport to Hookipa beach to check out the wind surfers and kite surfers. Mama's Fish House is there too -- it's very good, but very expensive too. One last thing: rent a convertible...and pack lots of suncreen...and apply it everywhere! (The back of my knees are burnt from surfing.)

I don't know if my husband and I just got lucky or were too honeymoon-brained to notice anything bad, but we LOVED the Hyatt! I will agree that the nickel-and-diming and down-right rip-offing is annoying ($10 for a frozen drink, $45 for a manicure, $10 for a yoga class, etc), but we kind of expected it. And as for the complaint about too many kids, maybe because we were there the second week in September, we didn't have that problem. Honestly, there weren't many kids at all and the ones that were there were wholly unannoying. We loved hanging out at the pool. And while the beach was a little disappointing - it really is difficult to go in the water there - we didn't really mind - it's so hot on the beach anyway, we actually preferred the pool. We thought the grounds and the room were beautiful and we stayed in the lowest rate (Terrace View) room. It was clean, spacious and very tastefully decorated. And everyone we dealt with at the Hyatt was so pleasant and helpful and friendly - no complaints on the service at all. We also loved the restaurants - breakfast at The Swan Court was a fantastic way to start the day. We also dined at The Cascades (steak & sushi) and thought it was delicious - of course the scenery is so fantastic, honestly the food probably wasn't the first thing on our minds. We also tried Spats (the Italian trattoria on premisis) - it wasn't outstanding, but it was definitely quite good. We enjoyed our meal there. I only have one negative thing to say about the Hyatt, aside from the ridiculous prices for everything - the luau (The Drums Of The Pacific)- I would not recommend it.

Valet parking is $10, self parking is free. The grounds of the hotel are very beautiful and relaxing. This is what you will remember most. They offer free water aerobics, yoga, etc. If you dont have kids, avoid this hotel during the summer time. We went when school was back in session and found very few screaming children running loose. The staff was very friendly. We recieved a lei from the bellman and all staff was accomadating throughout our stay. We stayed in a deluxe ocean view which had a nice balcony on the 6 floor of the napili tower. Restaurants are a dissapointment, dont bother with more than a burger/cocktails poolside. If you have read other reviews, you know by now that the beach is small, it is still beautiful and has plenty of room to lay on the sand.

We have returned to Maui every year since that and we still have to say that the Hyatt Regency did not even grant us a smile. The workers, at that time, were performing a job and did not even make eye contact with you most of the time. We had heard from others about their honeymoon surprises (even a simple lei greeting) upon arrival in Maui at their less expensive destinations. We were granted zero. We booked our own honeymoon 14 night stay with the hotel directly and my husband told him that it was our honeymoon and he wanted it special so that was why he booked directly with the hotel.

Your food, aside from swan court, will be horrid. The charming sounding 5 minute beach stroll you hear of is a 20-30 minute treck (if you are not a marathoner or want to wear high heels check out the afformentioned trolley.) The Ugly: formerly free to roam, exotic birds are now sadly caged and harrassed by afformentioned 8 year olds. The beach is unusable and for the sliver they do have the Hyatt chooses to charge it's guests $30 per day to have a chaise on it.

Internet access was a connection fee of $5 and $1 for each additional minute. We wound up going to an internet cafe in Lahaina where we got 20 minutes of connection time for $2. The self parking was an adventure as well. The spots were incredibly narrow and the number of spots was limited. Again, they are basically insuring that you use their valet service for an extra fee. I can see these extra charges if you were staying at some cut rate hotel but at $465 a night.....come on.

We were lucky enough to get and oceanview room and boy, what a sight to wake up to every morning! The beds were incredibly comfortable and the turndown service with chocolates was a nice touch. The bathroom area was spacious, but the actual bathroom/shower area was cramped for my taste. The staff at the hotel could not have been any more professional, knowledgable, and fun. I enjoyed a wonderful massage in the spa and would highly recommend Nicco. He's not only hot, but he gives a great massage as well!!! It was my first massage given by a male and I was nervous. He sensed that and talked to me the entire time which actually put me at ease. The only complaint I would have about the spa is the unisex waiting lounge. As I sat in my robe, it shocked me when a man in a robe came in and sat down next to me. No big deal I guess. After your massage, be sure to spend time in the oceanview lounge---it's beautiful! The food at the hotel was delicious. Lunch by the pool was convenient. Breakfast in the restaurant was a little lacking as far as variety, but it was edible. I was impressed with all of the shops within the hotel. Especially the Macy's near the front lobby. Everything I needed was within reach. Also, if you are going to spend time tanning be sure to get the Maui Baby tanning lotion in the gift shop. It works like a dream! I would recommend taking a few bottles home too because I cannot find it anywhere on the mainland. The pool area was the best part of this hotel. I even pushed some kids aside to try the waterslide in the kiddy pool area and had a blast. The kids didn't seem to mind, but I did get a funny look from the lifeguard at the top of the slide! I also thought the bar inside the cave of the pool was convenient and clever. I would absolutely stay at this resort again.

They said the hotel was booked and no other rooms were available. We were very angry. We sat in the lobby for an hour. The lobby is no resort like and relaxing.

I couldn't belief how vandalized the room was. This did not look like a $500 room. The pool is the worst area of all. It is more like Wild Rivers Water Park than a resort. There were bodies everywhere. We came out to the pool at 5:00 and there were no chairs people were sitting on the ground. The pool has no moving room because it is so crowded. Seems like the Hyatt overbooked. The slide was fun though. Restraunts were good. Oh yah, their is no beach at the Hyatt. The water comes right up to a walkway and there is three feet of sand. We steped in the water and there was coral right away. You have to walk 10 minutes to notrth Kaanapali beach at the Sheraton to acually swim.

It's a really attractive entrance! Check-in was swift and the staff were very polite. The rooms at the Hyatt are really exceptional. I really recommend paying the extra money for an oceanfront room. You are very close to the water and the view and sound of waves crashing is just amazing. The decor is the rooms is quite elegant: British Colonial with lots of dark wood and white linens. We just loved how comfortable and beautiful our room was. The Hyatt has a wonderful spa (Spa Moana). It's expensive, but the services are amazing. Try the Lomi Lomi massage, which is a Hawaiian style massage. Also, when your massage is finished, you may sit in an ocean-front room and relax. The hotel has several nice restaurants. We loved the tropical drinks at Cascades (try the Lava Flow and the Road to Hana). If you want a really fancy dinner, the Swan Court restaurant is very romantic. We also really enjoyed the room service food, especially the fresh strawberries and the banana pancakes. You're close enough at the Hyatt to walk to the restaurants and shops at Whaler's Village, so there are lots of dining options in the area. The one downside to the Hyatt is that the beach in front of the hotel has eroded a bit. However, if you walk just a few feet in either direction, you'll find large, lovely beaches. So, this wasn't really a problem for us at all. We didn't notice there being more children than usual here, so if you're looking for a romantic getaway spot, I'd say you'll find it at the Hyatt.

Hyatt's Spa Moana is one of the best hotel spas on Maui. I was a daily visitor to their wet steam room and showers (extra fee on top of resort fee). My only complaint was that the Hyatt charges you an extra $15 \"resort fee\" and $10 valet fee every time you have an attendant park you car. Maui is an expensivie place to vacation and you should expect high prices, but for my money I would stay at the Hyatt again.

I originally booked a garden view room but was upgraded to a partial ocean view because we were getting married/Honeymooning there. The staff were all very kind and hospitable. Anything you want or need they can help you with. The first thing that you are welcomed with at the hotel is the breathtaking lobby! It is an open atrium with a coi pond, live penguins, parrots and beautiful greenery. The breakfast buffet was a little over priced ($22 per person) but had good food and good service. Cascade grill was excellent. Reasonably priced for Sushi and steak. There are also shops at the hotel such as Macy's, a jewelry store, a glass art store, and quit a few more. I treated myself to a Pedicure at the Spa Moana. It was twice what I would pay at home but was a beautiful setting. The room I was in had a window covering one wall that overlooked the ocean.

Not impressed from beginning to end. The room we had looked like it had been two very small rooms that had had the wall between them knocked out. The lanai was split by a wall, creating two separate areas (kind of odd). Also, the lanai was apparently not included in maid service. The toilet/shower area was separated from the sink area by a door, which was fine, but a shoehorn was required to wedge one's self in to go to the bathroom. The TV made a loud high-pitched noise that would go away only after a couple of good solid whacks on it's side. They are very proud of their beds, but we found them excessively soft and unsupportive. The pool itself was okay, but the poolside chairs were on top of one another, and it was always a mob scene. Drinks ordered poolside took 30 minutes for delivery. And their website advertises a pool bar, but we discovered that that bar is only open from noon to 4:00, at its main purpose is as a service bar for waitresses. And I've seen a lot made about the art here. Yes, there is art all over the hotel, but not in the rooms. We had one small etching to brighten up the sea of 70's-era beige wallpaper. The beach is a mere sliver of sand that is barely big enough for two people to walk on side by side. In the water, there is a very quick drop off, so wading is next to impossible. It's much better up the beach by the Sheraton. Valet parking is almost mandatory on weekend nights due to limited self-parking. We used the service three nights. Of those three times, they lost our keys twice. The woman at the valet desk and the big goofy valet guy, Steve, both implied that it was somehow OUR FAULT. Our experience with room service was only marginally better than our experience with valet parking. We ordered a bottle of wine, but they brought the wrong one. Sent it back and thirty-plus minutes later a manager showed up with the correct one and a pretty contemptible attitude, implying that it was OUR FAULT that they had delivered the wrong thing in the first place. Excuse me, but zinfandel and white zinfandel are two completely different things. Oh, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the wine we got was marked up about 500% above retail. One note about the mandatory resort fee: I don't think the newspaper I got three out of five mornings was worth $15/day. All in all, this place was way too impersonal and the service was sub-par for such a place. Also, Kaanapali is too crowded.

The Hotel is beatiful, complete with lush gardens and well groomed grounds. The pool area is fantastic with waterfalls, slides and plenty of beach chairs.

Off to the left is great snorkeling complete with Turtles and exotic fish. At one point during Kayaking we were able to see 3 turtles coming up for air right off the hotel. However, directly in front of the hotel is a large reef which makes swiming impossible. When you first arrive you will notice most people only go about 10 feet into the water. Prestine beaches are available a quarter mile north towards the Sheraton, but it is almost annoying carrying everything down the beach. Overall the Hyatt was amazing and I would highly recommend staying there, especially if being near the beach but laying by the pool is more your style (resort types). If price is no object, I would definitely recoomend the Four Seasons, Grand or Kei Lani in Wailea.

I actually loved it. The staff were extremely friendly. My cousin sent me a flower arrangement and it was brought up with my luggage, which was brought up right as we got to the room. The bed was so comfortable and was changed daily. We had a partial ocean view but we didn't mind (we never asked for full ocean when booking the trip...I mean we knew we'd be at the beach all day so didn't need the view in the hotel too). The room was roomy too. We didn't get the complimentary champagne on the first night but then again we were so tired the first night from the flight that we wouldn't have drank it anyway. It came the 2nd night (the first full day there), and was waiting for us after we came back from dinner. We loved the buffet there. We had it as part of our vacation package, so we didn't have to pay. It was expensive ($20 each I found out) but the food was great. And there were pancakes, but not every day. It alternated between that and french toast. Omlet bar, where you ordered your own omlet. Tons of fruit and breads and other great food and cereals as well as OJ, pineapple and mango passionfruit juice, coffee and water. The pool was awesome - and we didn't feel it was that loud. Then again we didn't arrive when there were any school breaks so there weren't too many kids there. There were some but we weren't too bothered by them at all. I was surprised that that grotto bar wasn't a \"swim up\" bar - you did have to get out to get a drink but it didn't bother me either. I dind't use the slide but my husband thought it was great. It is a tunnel/slide though - which might be a bit scary for young kids to go on alone. There is staff at the top to make sure no one goes too fast after the one before them and that no one too small goes on it. I was surprised that there were no lifeguards at the beach! That bothered me a bit. But the surf wasn't rough. But there should have been lifeguards anyway. For the record there were no lifeguards at any of the beaches where there were hotels on the beach, at least in Kaanapali beach. They did have signs up saying they didn't have lifeguards and to swim at your own risk. The beach in front of the Hyatt was not very wide at all. As for the coral reef, yes there was more by the Hyatt than the other hotels near it but it's not like you can do much about that, other than watch your step. For good snorkeling, walk up the beach sidewalk to the Sheridan, where Black Rock is. It's about 3/4 mile up from the Hyatt along the beach. There are lounge chairs out by the pool, some with canopies on them. And waitresses walking around to get drinks or lunch for you. The poolside restaurant was very good - and Cascades - one of the restaurants - was excellent. I didn't think they were outrageously expensive, on par with NYC prices (where I'm from) so if you're not used to that then I guess it can be pricey. But the food there was worth it, I thought. As for surrounding areas, Old Lahaina town was cool - seaside village with tons of stores. They all sell the same stuff, mostly, hawaiian clothing. And tons of art galleries. The Old Lahaina Luau is great - very authentic. Roy's Restaurant which is about 5 miles north of Kaanapali Beach is not recommended - the portions are very small (so much for nouveau cuisine). I also got my haircut at the Hyatt Spa. I loved it! I forget the lady's name but she's Argentinian and she did a great job on it. Expensive - but I didn't care I wanted to splurge. You can do a 3 hour scuba diving course (it's not the PADI certification just an introductory course) which my husband loved. One caveat, the parking stinks. We didn't want to use the valet every night but ended up having to 3 of the 6 nights. And some idiots used up 2 spots for their precious car rentals which I complained about. But they were very helpful and had security go out and put some ticket/warning on those cars (hee hee). All in all we were very happy at the Hyatt and recommend it.", "Date": "May 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "orange county, ca", "Title": "\u201cThe best in Maui!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1892736", "Content": "hyatt is great! this was our first time and verything is just fabulous! buffet was delicious and staff were very friendly! it's a \"pricy\" hotel but very nice, especially the lobby------- it's to fie for! real hawaii! i would go back and stay again in a heart beat.", "Date": "May 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hyatt!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1806613", "Content": "I just got back from six days at the Hyatt Regency Maui. The hotel offers a friendly helpful staff, beautiful grounds, loads of amenities and a great pool. I was impressed with the service and cleanliness of the rooms, grounds and pool. The pool and hot tub are open 24 hours. The hotel even has a Hertz desk onsite. The great thing about this hotel is that it is in walking distance of an outdoor mall. I enjoyed my stay here the only drawback was the beach which ( as other reviewers pointed out) is not as nice as if you stayed further down the beach. In front of the Hyatt the beach is rocky and the water is brown but if you like to walk along the beach like I do you can find blue water and wider beach in front of the Westin. If you have never been to a Luau go to the one at the Hyatt but its not something I would do twice. The night I went to the Luau it was a beautiful warm night but the previous night it poured. As one reviewer pointed out the Hyatt will continue with the Luau even if it rains. From my room I could see people sitting in raincoats in the pouring rain (not a drizzle) the night before and I know they had to be miserable. I had read lots of reviews prior to picking the Hyatt and I was still torn between the Hyatt and the Grand Wailea so I paid for one night stay there as well. I can tell you there is no comparison to the Hyatt when it comes to staff and service. The Grand Wailea is grand and the rooms and bathrooms are nicer but the pool water was murky and the lounge chairs need cleaning and the food was more expensive than the Hyatt which was pretty expensive. I prefer the Hyatt. I would stay at the Hyatt again or try the Westin next time which looked very nice.", "Date": "April 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cNice resort but too many kids\u201d", "Author": "laurawaunt", "ReviewID": "UR1787567", "Content": "Overall the hotel is truly amazing. The grounds were exceptional from the exotic bird-filled atrium and pond to the free-form pool. The room was nice and comfortable. We upgraded to an ocean-view room for $50/night after one night, and it was worth it. It seems like they give you a better rate for these rooms once you are there versus booking it initially. Maid service was good and prompt to our needs. The restaurants looked nice, but we only ate at Swan Court for breakfast. It was good but it is hard to justify a $65 breakfast (2 buffets, one mimosa, one bloody mary). Room service was good. We had pizza and a burger which was a nice change from all the fancied up food found on Maui. The beach is definitely poor. We are big beach people so that was a disappointment. But all the beaches on Maui are public so you can walk down a hundred yards or two to find a much better beach. Our biggest complaint was the kids. We were on our honeymoon and never found the casual and romantic ambience we were looking for, not at the Hyatt or Maui in general. Kids were everywhere and they were so loud! Screams and cries filled the air. We are young and I am a pediatrician so I don't think we are really anti-kids, but it was just too much. We thought we were lucky one night when we found the neat hot tub empty but never fear...3 school-age kids and 2 pre-teens found us in no time. That was pretty typical of everywhere we went especially the Hyatt. I'm told it was because it was Spring Break, pre-Easter, but we won't risk it by staying there again. I wanted a resort with full amenities for the honeymoon, but next time we'll priobably look into a condo.

The situation was corrected the next day and we were given a much more suitable room. The breakfast at Swan Court was very good. The spa and fitness facility are well done. The resort fee makes little sense, fitness room access, newspaper and coffee are often standard in hotels that charge 400USD+ per night. Some nights were noisy due to outside events that went on until 10PM. All complaints were handled well. Tennis lessons were a pleasure, thank you to Frank Salvatore! Cascade Grill and Sushi was our favorite on site restaurant and there is easy access to other excellent places to eat. You will need a car if you stay here. The self parking was very convenient.

Continental breakfast was very good, cookies in the afternoon and good appetizers from 5-7pm along with soft drinks, beer and wine. The Spa was wonderful, the pool was great but skip the restaurants. Very average with high prices. Book the Kiely Catamaran for a good time, good munchies and nice crew. They leave right from the hotel. Watched whales from our balcony which was magnificent. Only complaint is that the Queen sized beds are full sized and the mattresses are extremely soft. Could present a problem for someone with back problems.

The resort area is very convenient. Whaler?s village with great shops and restaurants are within walking distance. The paved walkway all the way up to the Sheraton is fantastic. Great for morning or evening strolls, and very easy to get to a variety of restaurants. Lahaina is a quick 5 minute car ride, not accessible by foot. The resort pool is large, but very loud. There is no relax lounging. The waterfalls, kids and large groups of people are loud. The grotto bar, is not a swim up bar, but it's located \"in\" the pool under a bridge. It's chilly in there, and not a place to hang out. The resort grounds are very pretty. Lots of flowers and great fauna. There is good shopping right on site. The beach is pretty terrible. It's small, rocky and kind of smelly. The breakfast buffet is good, and on par with Hawaii prices. I have to admit however, I was surprised by no pancakes or waffles. Our first room was on ground level, and due to the recent rains we had an issue with little creepy crawlies. The Hyatt was quick to switch our room, all be it a terrible view, but away from the critters. The beds were comfy. Hotel staff certainly was not overly friendly, but also not rude. The common areas of the hotel were showing a little bit of wear, but the hotel was kept very very clean. Self parking in the evenings could sometimes be a pain with minimal spots and dark parking lots. Bellhops were quick and friendly. Overall, I found my stay to be pretty average.

We were there from March 1st thru March 8th. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very good for the most part. Check in was made very easy and the bellman are very quick on getting your luggage to your room. The best part of our stay was that we had booked a standard terrace room, but we were placed in a very nice partial ocean view room. The daily maid service is not very good. We were there for 8 days and not once were our sheets changed. The pool is great for both young and old, and I must say that the waterslide even scared me a little. The beach in front of the hotel is terrible. The coral reef runs right along the beach of the Hyatt which makes for very painful walking. The beach is much nicer further down towards the Westin and the Whaler. The restaurants are very overpriced so we ate mainly at the Whalers Village food court and in Lahaina. The Pizzaria and Mr Sub are very good and inexpensive at the Whalers Village. If you have a late night flight out of Maui(which most flights are) forget about late check out. When I asked for a late check out because our flight was not leaving until 10:30 p.m. they said that they do not allow late check out. They did however say we could store our luggage with the bellman and use the showers outside by the pool to shower and freshen up. I thought thanks but no thanks. The hotel looks great but there are plenty of other hotels that are just as nice and less expensive for what you get. Next time I would definitely stay somewhere else.

The Residence Inn accepts pets which means our pet can stay with us while our house is being repaired and not boarded at a kennel indefinitely. 2. The rooms are very clean, although the furniture is admittedly a bit worn. 3. The staff here are very friendly and accommodating. 4.

And the staff here did. Thank goodness for them! But sometimes that's not enough to save a property. This is, by far, the WORST Residence Inn in which I have ever stayed. As a matter of fact, the worst Marriott I've been in. First of all, I called two days early to make sure my reservation was correct and my Rewards number was on file, and to make sure I had a low floor room (I like to do yoga and Insanity in the mornings and try to be considerate). Upon arrival, neither had been added. As a matter of fact, they only had two rooms available for our group of three. Attempting to be chivalrous, I offered to run some errands while they prepared the final room. When I came back, they tried to offer me a room with no windows to the outside. With the lighting being so dim, that was not a good option for me so I was told the only other room had just been painted and I could go see if I could deal with the paint smell (opening windows was not an option, they have solid double paned glass). Upon checking it out, I didn't notice paint..it actually smelled more like they had recently freshened up the room. About an hour later I figured out why. There is dog urine EVERYWHERE!!! Unfortunately during that hour, I had unpacked all my things (we're staying here 18 nights so I have a lot of stuff) so I decided to just deal with it, buy some febreeze and get over it. I called the front desk and asked them to spray the carpets and told them to take their time, I wasn't staying in the room the first night anyway. So I came back the next morning and because of daylight savings time thought I'd call and see if just maybe the breakfast hours had been extended and only when I called was I informed that \"Oh yeah, we're gonna have to move you from that room.\" Huhhh....sigh....I'm annoyed at this point because I wish they told me that when I originally called about the urine. SURELY they knew that, if, indeed the room had been painted, it was because of animal issues. Instead of hiding the problem, they just made it my problem. So I get over it, pack up my things, get ready to jump in the shower, and to top it all off, there's no hot water. That's the major issue, there are the other things like none of the furniture matches, the kitchen hasn't been remodeled since probably the early 90s, the dresser drawer has two options, 2 inches open or falling on your feet, there's mold from water damage in the closet, there was an empty 6 pack container in the refrigerator when I got my room, you can hear EVERYTHING from the units above and beside me, oh and did I mention the train that runs by my window for at least 4 minutes at a time all day (and night). Overall, I'm sure I could have stopped a few paragraphs ago, but please for your sanity, money, and nose hairs...don't stay here. And just to finish on a positive note, the staff here is REALLY nice. They just are trying to make people happy, and it's unfortunate that this is all they have to work with.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cOne of my worst stays at a Residence Inn\u201d", "Author": "gabigoose", "ReviewID": "UR86449974", "Content": "I frequently stay 100+ nights a year at Marriott properties.

There are several seperate buildings and we were in the main building. The room needed a lot of TLC. The carpet was pulled from the wall on one side of the room leaving a one inch gap between the carpet and wall.

While there was a hook up in the bedroom there was no TV set. We noticed on the ceiling that part of the molding was missing. Equipment in the kitchen area was old and not all that clean. We opted not to use any of it. We arrived around 8:30AM for breakfast and the food left a lot to be desired. Not only that, the person in charge started turing lights out at 8:55AM (there was a 9AM closing time). Eggs were cold, burned and crispy. Sausage had not be cooked. There was one banana, no yogert, skimmpy pastries and in general this was not a very appealing place to eat. One young couple came in, looked around and decided to leave without eating. There was a mop bucket sitting at the end of the food area. Not very appealing. Coffee had a distinct \"metal taste\" to it. We decided to pass and go to Starbucks.

This place is really not as bad as some of the reviews say. If you're looking for the amenities of a Residence Inn, this place has them: free (good) breakfast, full kitchens in the rooms, exercise room, pool, business services, nightly dinners. I stayed in the \"penthouse\" suite with my husband and parents, and there was a main floor and a loft with second bedroom and bathroom. Downfalls: 1.) Kind of dirty and unkempt-looking. The windows weren't particularly clean, and it looked as if they were doing electrical work on the ceilings because some of the tiles were missing in the hallways. It looked as if someone with greasy hands had fixed things on the walls but hadn't cleaned up afterwards. The beds and bathrooms were clean, though. 2.) So-so staff. There didn't seem to be many of them around. 3.) Weird emergency exit. From the 2nd floor loft, there was a big door that said \"Emergency Exit, Do not open\" that locked from the inside, so, naturally, we opened it (it was not alarmed). It opened out on to part of the roof where all the electrical machinery and generators were. There was a weird plank walkway, and nothing was fenced/blocked off. If I had little kids that could open doors, I would be VERY nervous to have them up there unattended for fear that they would go out there and fall off the roof or god only knows what. It was just a little unsettling and odd. Conclusion, I would stay here again, if just passing through town (which we were), also if I got a good deal (we had used points to pay for the whole room, so it was essentially free).

BIG mistake. This is a bad hotel in a NOISY location. I actually checked out after the first night and spent the second night at the Staybridge Suites- which was just down the road (less than 1 mile away) and a thousand times nicer. The Residence Inn is literally 100 feet (at most) from a busy train track and not too far from a street where the trains cross and blow their whistles. Trains came on a regular basis all day and all night long with a hour at most between trains. It was EXTREMELY loud and I got more or less no sleep. I am a 20-something that lived in dorms/apartments not too long ago, and currently live in an urban area, close to a fire station--so am used to noise and am certainly not what would be considered a \"light sleeper\". I do not see how anyone can sleep through the freight trains going by this hotel!! My room was on the back of the hotel facing the train tracks - however, my coworker stayed in a room on the front of the hotel and he said he could hear the trains loud and clear from his room as well. My room was so close to the tracks it actually shook as the freight trains went roaring by all night long. My room (in the main building) was also dingy and run down. The coffee machine had not been cleaned and had mold growing inside. The closet door and towel bar were broken - closet door actually fell off when I tried to open. Room was missing an iron. The light in the bathroom had burned out. The room could have been cleaned better too (hair on bathroom floor, etc. etc.). On the positive side, the staff was very friendly, kind and most apologetic about the train situation. There is really no fault to be place on the staff for the awful location of this hotel and my bad experience staying here. Also, positively speaking, were the warm chocolate chip cookies served at check-in and the free breakfast (which I thought had a good selection). If you absolutely must stay at this hotel, I would suggest you be REALLY tired when you arrive, to the point where nothing would wake you - or bring a pair of earplugs.

I probably would have got better service and a cleaner room at Motel 6.", "Date": "January 30, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn Memphis East", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d98077-Reviews-Residence_Inn_Memphis_East-Memphis_Tennessee.html", "Price": "$115 - $170*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6141 Old Poplar Pike</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Memphis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">38119</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "98077", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/96/af/96af31646fe727e6b88b6650ca22f8de8large.jpg"}}

I was happy with the bed and bedding. The Library has a great breakfast and wonderful waitstaff. The doormen are friendly and helpful. Food at the bar was also great - the cheesy fries were awesome! My only true beef was with the exercise room - the hotel advertises jump ropes and hula hoops, but it would be dangerous to try either activity in the exercise room which is small, small, small. I wound up running the stairs when the weather was inclement. The location of the Hotel Alexis is wonderful. It is close to the water and also Pioneer Square.

I booked a queen/queen and asked for a larger room and was given a large suite with a separate tv room, which my girls loved. The staff were delightful and you get the sense that they really care. The little things matter and the staff here seem to get that hands down. After our first night I asked if we might move to a higher floor as I found the rumbling noise of traffic from the street was annoying and waking me up and was immediately offered a room on the highest floor. As it was a smaller room my daughters begged me not to move so we stayed put and I opted for earplugs instead. If you are a light sleeper you will be happier away from the road noise! Having said that it's the little things that matter, here are my suggestions for management that would elevate the guest experience to an even higher level and would have moved my overall rating to excellent 1. Long distance charges are way too high! Provide calls within North America free. 2. Please put a small bar of soap in the bathroom for hand washing. 3. Ditch the hard, scratchy dark robes for new plush and soft white or white background animal print (I envision white leopard print). No one really wants to wear a scratchy dark robe and it is better not to have them than go part of the way! I was very very happy with the customer service!!!

There were no main lights in the room and only lamps which did not have a central switch so had to stumble around in the dark for a few mins to find this out. The room was fairly clean. But if you wanted to be picky, there was a lot of dust behind the bathroom mirror which could easily have been cleaned. Bathroom was a good size with a big shower, but a bit more water pressure would have been good. It wasn't a trickle but isn't wasn't powerful either which was disappointing as they had large shower rain style shower heads. The \"fitness room\" was a tiny room with 1 treadmill, 1 x-trainer, 1 bike and a few light weights but with no weight bench, so had to improvise using an an crunch bench. Not the best. Location was OK, a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and a few more to Westlake Centre. 2 blocks from the transit tunnel, either up a steep hill or walk a block more to Pioneer Sq along the level.

My room in the north tower had a view of the water, making the time spent working before my meeting very enjoyable. As a Kimpton Insider, I enjoy free internet, something that many hotels fail to provide. There is also a $10 credit for the mini-bar; I always take a chocolate bar home for my daughter. Insiders also get an option to upgrade for a fraction of the room differential on an availability basis; on this trip I had reserved a queen room and got a king for an additional $11. I booked my 70-something parents at The Alexis when they spent a long weekend in Seattle last fall. My dad developed an ache in his neck on the long flight from Michigan; the hotel staff found a heating pad for him and remembered to ask if he was feeling better throughout their stay.

They recognized that it was our first time staying at the Alexis. Upon hearing that we usually stay at the Vintage Park, they teasingly responded with \"Oh we are definitely going to steal you away.\" To which, we were immediately upgraded to the \"Northwest Ballet Suite\"; I'd say that's a good start. This room was amazing!! Upon opening the door, you are greeted with this long entry way; far away from the hall. The entry way, as well as the entire room is adorned with beautiful pictures of the Northwest Ballet's incredible dancers. There was a separate bedroom with a huge picture window enveloped by an arched window frame with a rope light nestled inside, casting just the right amount of ambience down onto the sheer curtains and creating the perfect romantic atmosphere. There was another hallway connecting the entry way to the dining and living area surrounded by a wall of windows. The room was on the corner of the building and there was an awesome view of Elliot Bay from anywhere in the room. This room was bigger than some studio apartments. We were really impressed. We had dinner at the Elephant & Castle on 5th Avenue. They have the best Grilled Salmon with this cider glaze baked on. We pretty much eat there everytime we come to the city. Later that night we came back to the hotel and had drinks at the Library Bistro. I have to say that The Alexis is in a great location for shopping and dining.

I do have to give props to the room service woman who, hearing the dissapointment in my voice on the phone at having to settle for an IPA (I'm not an IPA guy, but it was the only legitimate craft beer they had) miraculously showed up with a black IPA she somehow scrounged up.

Excellent staff. Great morning coffee and papers. Super location and a really nice bistro/pub right by the lobby with a great happy hour. (We had appetizers and two drinks each for 40 dollars). Only drawback was the late night revellers downtown who staggered by very early in the morning. A word of caution, the parking is very costly ( I believe 36/night) - although we didn't have our car.

We needed to book a room for one night before leaving for Sea Tac Airport. While researching (on the train) I discovered the Alexis had a special room rate for people arriving on the train. I booked the hotel and upon arriving in Seattle found that the taxi ride was brief (and thus inexpensive) from the train station to the hotel. Before we had barely stepped out of the taxi, the doorman was there to offer his assistance. Upon checking in with a very friendly woman staffing the front desk, we admired all of the one of a kind art lining the halls to the elevator. We got to our room and I almost called down to the front desk to say that we had been given the wrong room. The lovely woman at the front desk had upgraded us to what had to have been one of the largest hotel rooms that I have ever stayed in. We walked down the entrance hall and the bathroom was on our right. It was a nice size and bright. The best part was that the toiletries were large scale so as to be more eco-friendly and not the smaller plastic bottles that are replaced with every guest. At the end of the hall was the main room and there was a very large round dining table with a large wall mirror behind it and a comfortable chair tucked into the corner. On the long sideboard was the most extensive array of snack food etc for purchase. Beyond this area was the four poster bed with throw pillows in abundance. The wall beyond the bed was floor to ceiling windows that looked out onto a red-brick office building so thus very quiet in the evening. The area at the foot of the bed was a sitting area. There was a large overstuffed chair, sofa, coffee table, flat screen t.v. and then a patio door. The patio was square and large with yet more seating. As we hadn't had dinner, we pried ourselves from the room and went back downstairs. The front desk woman took the time to make some great suggestions and we ended up around the corner at The Owl. The next day we walked up to Pike Place Market which was only about 3 or 4 blocks away with our loaned hotel umrella. Upon our checkout, the doorman called us a town car and made sure to update us as to its expected arrival. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff, the accommodations and convenience of the area with its delightful shops are all worth returning to.

To my surprise, Ali emailed me back, letting me know that the fries were still available (and delicious) and that she'd keep an eye out for my package. Then I asked if I could give the Kimpton code word (if you don't know about the code word, look for it on their Facebook and Twitter - it leads to many nice surprises), and she said I could and arranged for an upgrade! OMG, our room was fabulous! It was a big suite with an amazingly comfortable couch, a great bedroom and even a dining room table. And on that table was resting a bottle of wine, some absolutely delicious truffles and a card from Ali with a coupon for free blue cheese fries! YUM!!!! The room had a peek view of the bay (I took some photos of the Bainbridge ferry coming in) as well as a nice view of the city. It's in an old building that's been renovated, so the layout has some quirks, but that's part of its charm. The decor had a modern opulence to it; it was the sort of decor I could see myself actually living with. Someone elsewhere said that they don't have free WiFi. That is not entirely correct. So long as you're a member of their frequent stayer program, Kimpton InTouch (which is free), you get free WiFi. We had it and it was both strong and fast. The location of the Alexis is very central and convenient; it's a short walk to both the ferry terminal and the University Metro/Sound Transit bus station. One warning: on weekends every Starbucks, Peet's and other coffee shop within a six block radius is closed, except for the Cherry Bean. Fortunately, the Alexis offers free coffee in the lobby, so all is not lost! The front desk staff is super-knowledgeable about everything both locally and further out. We wound up chatting in the lobby with someone who was looking for wine tasting. We'd just come back from Woodinville, so we had a lot to rave about with regards to wine - but it turns out the gentleman at the front desk knew TONS about the Woodinville wine scene and had lots of insights! The only thing I will note - and I wish now that I had said something while I was there, because I know they would have fixed it - is that the bed in our room was unusually, startlingly firm. I've stayed at other rooms in the Alexis and never had that problem, so I imagine it is a quirk of that particular room.

I got a great deal on the Alexis and stayed there for 3 nights in December just before Xmas. It's a nice hotel, but there were a lot of little things that were off. First, I found the bed the least comfortable of any Kimpton hotel at which I stayed. I mentioned this to the person on check-out and she said they'd recently replaced their mattresses and gone with somewhat softer, less firm ones so if you need a firmer mattress for your back (as I do), I'd recommend you might want to think twice about this hotel. There were also several little things not quite right with the room (it was cooler than I'd like, I couldn't turn the heat up, there was no extra blanket in the closet, there was a small problem with the shower). Kudos to the staff, who addressed each and every one of these issues promptly and in a very friendly manner, but it's unusual in my experience to run into so many little things.

We were delighted to have the opportunity to return, now with our five children. Perhaps my sentimental expectations were too high, but we were profoundly disappointed. We had a an executive suite connecting to a double/double ($700 plus per night pre-tax) PLUS another double/double for our nanny (ANOTHER $320ish per night pre-tax) The service was terrible, with one little thing snowballing into the next and here they are: First, the hotel is on a busy downtown street with no pull-off area to unload a vehicle, I had to run inside to track down the valet during Seattle rush hour while my hubby and remaining family got honked at while idling in front of the hotel. Once in our rooms, the valet didn't bother to ask which bag went where -- just unloaded them all in the living room area. (i redirected). I asked abour our crib. He didn't know if there were cribs. He didn't know if the hotel had mini fridges available either . He said he would ask. He never did, so I tracked down the cribs. I was told by the front desk there were no mini fridges (i doubt this is true). We had two bath towels in each bathroom for a family of 7. I did get more 45 minutes after my request. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows. They are elegant and attractive. They are not practical. There is no closet or chest of drawers in the exec. suite bedroom (it's in the living area). The bed -- while comfortable -- takes up most of the room. There is only very limited counter space in the bathroom. It is an older tub shower. The worst was our second floor location directly above busy First Street. The first night (a Sat.) was unbearable. We couldn't sleep but the front desk said it would be better the second night (a Sun) as there had been a parade and festival downtown on Sat. The front desk manager said she'd look around for other available rooms, but never bothered to call back. Despite mostly great reviews on TA, the most frequent negative was the noise which most reviewers assigned to passing garbage trucks. I was told via email in advance of our trip that our room requirements left the hotel with no choice but 2nd floor (lowest floor) rooms for us. But I was also told the garbage trucks had been rescheduled and this was no longer a hotel problem. Nonetheless, at 3 or 4 a.m. both nights we heard something that sounded like a garbage truck! I did not get out of bed to verify. On day 2, I asked for fans which helped drown out the noise on night two. As we essentially had a 2-bedroom suite, there were three different TVs. All used different operating systems (lodgenet, etc.) so what was available on one was not necessarily available on the other. The maintenance man, originally summoned to fix the broken AC in one room, confirmed the other TVs weren't broken. He did not know why they were on different systems. On Sunday morning at 8:30, I went to the lobby for some of the highly-touted iced coffee. It is promoted everywhere as being offered until 10 a.m. on the weekends, including on a sign on the table where the coffee is served. The pitcher was empty. I asked at the front desk and was told there wasn't any more. I said you can't run out of iced coffee unless you've run out of coffee, which is impossible in Seattle. She insisted they were, so I asked to see the manager on duty. After a punitive 10-minute wait, the m.o.d. came out and said it meant they would have to brew more then ice it down (yes! this is the complex recipe for iced coffee). She said it could take several minutes. I told her we'd be in the hotel restaurant. About 20 minutes later, she did bring it to me. We also had 4 $20 restaurant vouchers for b'fast as part of our package. I asked if we could use them for room service instead to spare the other guests the agony of dining next to our boisterous clan of 8. We were told no, which is how we ended up in the restaurant served by a cheerless waitress who brought GLASSES of ice water to everyone , including our one year old and two year olds in high chairs. When we asked her to take them away so the kids didn't knock them over, she knocked one over herself, getting the table and two people wet. No apology, but at least she gave herself an 18 percent tip for our \"convenience.\" The hotel's listed amenities include turndown service at night and a newspaper in the morning. We received neither. When I mentioned this at check out, the woman behind the desk said \"you have to request those.\" How would one know to do this? The only \"break\" i caught was when I ran out of milk for our baby after 6 p.m. which is when Seattle rolls up the carpet for the night. The Bookstore Bar bartender had mercy on me and filled up my 4oz sippy cup gratis. BTW, it is a beautiful, cozy, warm and charming bar. If I were traveling with my spouse only, we definitely would have had a drink or two there. On the plus side, the hotel is convenient to Pike's Place. It does have a great bar. The beds are comfy. As I learned from other TA reviewers, you do get a $10 minibar credit and free wifi if you join kimpton in touch, which we did. You can check facebook for a password that will get you another perk. In July, it was \"flip flops\" which got us either two glasses of wine or a movie. No time for either but our tots enjoyed two half hour episodes of \"Dora the Explorer,\" which otherwise would have cost us $2.99 each (seriously).", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "TEXAS", "Title": "\u201cAnother perfect Kimpton hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "TINKTIPTON", "ReviewID": "UR116026811", "Content": "My cousin and I met in Seattle to escape from the heat of Texas (my state) and North Carolina (her's).

Having stayed at Kimpton hotels in the past, and being a current Kimpton InTouch member, I was aware of the amazing accommodations and customer service that I could expect to receive. However, the Alexis was somehow able to still exceed those expectations. I had booked our King Deluxe room online (with AAA discounted parking) and at the time noted that this would be a special occasion. Upon arrival to the hotel, which happens to be in a great, highly accessible part of downtown Seattle, we we're greeted by Travis, a super friendly and informative valet/bellman. Through the duration of our stay, Travis was there to recommend activities and restaurants, answer questions and talk to us about our trip we were currently enjoying. Travis truly helped make our stay in Seattle so much more enjoyable! But this was just the beginning. Once at the front desk, we were welcomed with a friendly birthday greeting for my wife and a super smooth check-in. We we're given our keys and headed to our room. Upon arrival, we we're floored to see that we had been given an amazing upgrade to a one bedroom suite! This corner suite was beautiful and just happened to be bigger than many of the apartments my wife and I lived in not so long ago when we we're just starting out. We really enjoyed spending time lounging in the living room during our rests between trips to the waterfront, Pike Market, the amazing public library (a must see if you love architecture or taking pictures, or both, like us) or our small side day trip to Snowqualmie Falls. There was all kinds of art throughout the suite and our separate bedroom and classy looking bathroom were just the right size and super beautiful as well! Yet one last amazing touch to mention took place upon returning to our room on our stay's first night. We returned to find a Birthday note, fresh fruit and sparking wine to celebrate my wife's birthday... how cool is that? Many thanks to Louisa, a concierge at the Alexis, for making my wife feel so special! I could go on and on and on, but need to wrap this thing up! SO... if you're looking for a great hotel in Seattle that has it ALL, location, amenities, beautiful rooms and an excellent and amazingly friendly staff, I guess the Alexis is your hotel.

Our suite was huge, way bigger than we expected. The bedding was very comfortable, although the pillows left something to be desired...they were the feather type that have almost no stuffing in them so you really need a few. My wife is pregnant so she had to call down to the front desk to get some foam pillows sent up, which they did very promptly. Street noise was a minor problem, at least until the traffic died down, but that occurred reasonably early and it never disturbed my sleep. WiFi Internet was free if you join their loyalty program, which was A-OK w/ me. I hate when fine hotels nickel and dime you on stuff like internet when cheapy hotels just give you that for free. The provided soaps, shampoos etc were nice. This hotel has chosen to move away from the mini-bottles in favor of a large bottle they refill every day. They claim it is to help eliminate the wastefulness of all those bottles going in a landfill. I think it does that and probably saves them a boatload of cash at the same time. Either way, this is an example of environmentalism that I can get behind. My stay was not affected by this in the slightest, so bravo to them for eliminating waste in ways that don't sacrifice the quality of their service. The front desk staff was pretty friendly but the bellmen/doormen didn't seem too interested in doing their job. We found that they try to steer people towards the town cars (presumably because they get a kick back on) even though taxis are much cheaper. In several cases when we were leaving they weren't available to help hail a cab or anything. In a hotel that charges what the Alexis does, this doesn't seem like the level of service I expect. The doorman needs to stop flirting with the girl at the front desk and help me flag down a taxi...seriously there's a tip in it for you. We only ordered room service twice during our stay, once just for a late night dessert and then again for breakfast the next morning. In both cases, the delivery time was amazingly short....so fast that I had to hide in the bathroom with a towel wrapped around me while my wife let them in. LOL. I wasn't expecting them so soon. :) Food quality was excellent and the fast delivery made sure it didn't taste like it had sat around for a long time.

My husband and I often travel to Seattle, primarily for business reasons, and this is our favorite hotel. Not only are the rooms exceptionally large (on average I would say our rooms have been in the 700 to 800 square feet range) but they are very clean and comfortable, as well. The staff is exceptional. In my experience, they have always been friendly and expeditious with any task asked of them. I've ordered room service on my last two visits and on each occasion, I was amazed at how quickly the food was brought to the room, even with an off menu item. I also asked for a larger room on my last visit after I felt the room I was assigned wasn't large enough (it wasn't small - maybe around 550 square feet but not what I was looking for while traveling with the kids) and within a half an hour I was upgraded to a suite at no additional cost. The Alexis is part of the Kimpton chain (and I do belong to the Kimpton loyalty program, which is free and well worth it) which is known for being very pet friendly and also for offering a complimentary wine/social hour in the evening. The staff is generous with the drinks and in addition to wine they have offered Jack Daniels on occasion. On our last visit, they were also handing out decadent truffles and hand-dipped s'mores. The location of the hotel is superb. It sits between Pioneer Square, the Waterfront and Pike Street Market. Westlake Center is also nearby. Additionally, if you come to Seattle for business downtown, it's just a quick walk to most of the major office buildings.

I have made about 80 transatlantic trips to the US in the past 10 years and stayed at many hotels in this price and class range, and never ever stayed in a room so small. It is also badly designed for the small space. The bed has a metal four poster frame which blocks the already-tight squeeze past, and the chair at the desk at the bottom of the bed hits the bed if moved back. There is nowhere to put a suitcase without creating a trip hazard, and the TV must be observed from the bed or sitting right under it at the desk. There is a chair in the corner of the room, but rather pointlessly so as there is nowhere useful to put it. The room sizes are stated as 300-500 sq feet on the website. Including the bathroom space, I can't see how this room is much more than 230 sq feet and too much of that is taken up by the bathroom. It is somewhat ironic that the hotel sells itself as \"pet-friendly\" because you couldn't swing a cat in this room. So I asked the front desk, and they told me they were full, sorry, nothing they can do. When I said that I was coming back to Seattle in a few weeks and would not pay $290 for that room again, the receptionist curtly advised I should book a higher room category. Not likely.

The staff were always friendly and helpful from the time I stepped out of the cab, to check in, to housekeeping. I had originally booked the Queen Queen room, but thought I'd let my two friends have it, while I took the king bed room. My room was immaculate...super clean with bathroom fixtures which looked like they were hand polished every day! Best of all was the super soft and comfortable bed and sheets! I slept like a baby. Then, when my friends arrived, checked in, and opened the door to their Queen Queen room in the next tower, my jaw dropped and my friends were screaming silly at just how huge and gorgeous the room was!!!....did I mention that it was huge?.....Huge with high celings!....and beautifully decorated too! I was jealous, but my room was really nice too and located at the 4 storey front tower. The only thing you don't get at this hotel are views as they all face right into the buildings on all sides. And the only other complaint from my friends were the guests staying above them stomping on the floors for 3-4 straight hours early in the morning which I'm told was really annoying. They have a small gym with a few nice pieces of equipment. I didn't get the chance to use the gym as I already got plenty of exercise walking around town for a few hours each day. The hotel is located at a very convenient location downtown. Close enough to the shopping area and Pike's Place Public Market just 3-4 short blocks away. Plenty of excellent restaurants nearby too. The hotel has a dining bistro called the Library Bistro which only serves breakfast and brunch. They have excellent breakfasts here! In this same bistro they held free wine tasting sessions during happy hour. I'm not sure if this is a temporary or regular do for their guests, but it was great! When you think of wine tasting you think perhaps you get a sip worth's of wine in a glass, but no, you get a whole glass!!! At the front of the hotel there's a nice cozy little bar where you can also order food from the bistro till about 10pm. Nice little place to gather with your friends for drinks.

I also have to commend the Alexis for the welcoming and friendly attitude its staff extends to guests -- from the front desk, where the young woman checking us in was able to find one thing (my handbag) to compliment among the bedraggled assortment of clothes I was wearing, to the room service waitperson (April) who brought and cleared away after both mornings' breakfast and later showed up serving in the hotel's Bookstore Bar. She, like every other Alexis employee we encountered, made a point of remembering our names the first and all subsequent times she met us. If I had to fault the Alexis for anything, it would be the quality of its pillows (way too soft) -- although I must point out that we didn't mention this to the staff.

King bed, big round dining table (just in case we wanted to invite 4 friends over for dinner!), sitting area with couch and chairs, shared balcony (didn't use it), free wifi (we signed up for the Kimpton InTouch program - it's free, so why not?!), Ipod docking station, and those snazzy leopard-print robes!

When I stepped out, I saw just one chair. Were we supposed to take turns out there? And all three potted shrubs were decidedly dead. The desk clerk removed internet charges because of our sleepless night. We appreciated the gesture but didn't think we should be paying those charges to begin with.

The only weird part was that they had a baby crib in the bedroom, but luckily the closet was huge and we could get that thing out of the way.

They have an amazing scotch collection, but make sure you see the pricing. We were a little shocked when we got a bill for $50 for two drinks. Alexis is really in one of the most central locations.

We have and eight month old baby girl and were looking for a weekend away the two of us. As a valued Kimpton InTouch member, I originally made our reservation for one of their regular king size rooms (extremely nice for a basic room in itself) but decided to email the hotel to see if there might be an upgrade available that we could get. Well, the hotel responded by giving us a fabulous suite that had it's own bedroom with master bath/spa and it's own living room a 1000 sq ft home away from home! The best part of our stay was coming back to the room after dinner and the manager, Jenne, had printed a picture of our little baby girl from my Facebook page and had it in a frame by the bed as part of the turn-down service; this brought me to tears. What a thoughtful touch! We always enjoy our stay at any of the Kimpton Hotels but like the Alexis particularily for it's location (central to get to Pike Place Market in one direction and Pioneer Square in the other). We also enjoy the Bookstore Bar there in the hotel for a nice relaxing cocktail. The wine reception from 5-6pm is an added touch that we always enjoy at Kimpton Hotels. Russell, the concierge and host of the wine reception during our stay was really knowledgable on his wines and of where to go in Seattle for food and entertainment. We ended our fabulous weekend with breakfast at the Library Bistro there on the Alexis property. Ron, our server, was excellent as was the Brioche French Toast that I had (super yummy and my mouth is watering now!!!) and my husband said his breakfast was the best ever! This hotel and the other Kimpton hotels are pet friendly and warmly accept your dogs at no charge. We let our shih tzu Snickers stay with Grammy and our baby girl this time :) Thank you to the Alexis Hotel staff for our wonderful weekend away.

But aside from that, unfortunately I cannot recommend this hotel, and I'm usually a fan of the small boutique Kimptons. Here's what went wrong for us: Called before we left to request \"as high a room as possible\" and as much square footage as the rate would reasonably afford, since we were travelling with a teen. No problem, we were told. After check-in though, we learned that our two friends -- who booked AFTER us and checked in at the same time, and neither of whom were travelling with kids -- got rooms easily twice as big as ours and on higher floors, which meant they could sleep through the night -- unlike us, on the 2d floor, who were awoken every night of our stay by the recycling trucks in the neighbourhood. Nothing the hotel can do about noise in the neighbourhood, but giving us earplugs at 4am rather than trying to source another room seemed pretty weak, especially since it was evidently not very busy while we were there. We were able to change rooms the next day ('upgraded' to a room of normal size, thank you), but it was on the same floor so the noise problem remained. We were also a little put out that the front desk did not tell us about the evening wine receptions, so we missed all of those. (We were able to grab a free drinks in the bar after persuading the bartender to serve us, but it's not the same.) We then missed a continental breakfast on the way out due to the server stopping to seat other diners (again, when it was not at all busy), despite being told we were in a rush to catch our plane. I hasten to add here that we were very polite the whole way through, and staff were unfailingly polite to us, too; however, the level of service was just not what one expects in a hotel of this promoted quality. Finally, they're much smaller quibbles but you might also note that the showers have no water pressure whatsoever, and there is a rather large hole in room service in that it is not provided between around 6pm-10pm in the evening.--They may be trying to encourage folks to use the tiny bar downstairs, but you can't go in there with a family and it was usually jammed anyway.

It's also near a fire station, ferry terminal and freeway. If you like fresh air, then don't stay here, because if you open the windows, it's just pretty loud. I can't imagine how loud it would be on the front of the hotel. But on the other hand, it's agreat location. 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market, 15 mins to downtown and about 10 mins to Pioneer Square, 5 mins to the water The hotel itself is very boutique - eclectic art, shee shee doggies prancing around. I think the art makes it 4 star and the service. My room had 3 different colors of paint, asian paintings, lamps all very stylish. It's a nice room, a bit small, but nice. My room had a bed, sofa, desk and an armchair all in the small room. Bathroom had a Vichy shower head. Nice amenities in the bathtub, Towels a bit small. The robe, not a big deal, was not at all soft like in great hotels. It was leopard skin print to be boutiquish I'm sure, but had no upscaleness to it like in fancy hotels. You wouldn't want to wear it long at all. The quality was not very good. I booked an appointment in the steam room and waited at the door, having not been told you need to call for someone to open it. No biggie, but it would have been nice, when booking it, if I was told how the process worked. Then I get in and have to figure out to turn on the steam. No instructions anywhere, and nothing was told to me when I booked it. The steam room itself was fine. The outer room had dirty glasses and towels as if had not been checked all day and my appt was late in the evening. I would suggest that housekeeping check the room every hour or 2 and tidy it up. One thing like that leaves a bad impression. Exercise room is tiny. I didn't go in, but was surprised hwo small it was. The evening wine tasting was a nice touch. The man working there knew a lot about each wine and offered to give me a glass to take to my room. Library Bistro Bar was very cozy and nice. And the restaurant also very nice.

I also liked that any type of room was dog friendly - they do have specific rooms in every category for those allergic to pets to stay in but for every category of room there are dog friendly rooms - a lot of hotels won't let dogs in the nicer spa suite rooms so that was great. There are no charges to bring your dog. Everyone was very friendly, quick to help out how they could and room service was excellent. Any time we called up for ice or any other service it arrived promptly. Location is super close to Pikes Market as well as lots of restaurants.

Although we usually stay in the Four Seasons hotels, we decided to try The Alexis as we enjoy the more intimate atmosphere of a boutique hotel. The bad and \"sort-of-off\" Not once did the valets open the car door for me. They charged around the driver's side of the car to let my husband out then disappeared somewhere. Never seen this before! Not a biggie since I actually have arms and legs, but still improper. I seem to have bad luck with valets as one at the Four Seasons Maui opened my door, then spotted a limo draw up and bolted over to help its occupants, leaving the car door to fall back on my shin. Cost to park: $36 a night plus tax. Almost $100 Canadian...yikes! Bathroom contained a pot of cotton balls and Q-tips, soap, one small \"body butter\" and no mending kit, shower cap or shoe shine. Instead, there is an invitation to call the front desk and these items will be brought up to your room (along with a person hoping for a tip...this is OK if you call once but I needed three things and later, matches for the fire log, which weren't in the room.) \"Fireplace Suite\" is a 750 sq. foot business-oriented siute with a long and unattractive wet-bar counter with cheap-looking cupboards underneath...it looks like a cafeteria. Not romantic at all and I felt that I should be conducting interviews. There is a door to the adjoining room, right next to the sitting area, and you can hear EVERYTHING (including yelling) from the room next door. As noted by another poster here, the \"city view\" is right into the window of the office building next door and the cleaning staff vacuuming. The TV in the bedroom kept turning on after we turned it off. We ended up pulling the plug. (We also heard several people complaining about TV service...) Whoever designed the bathroom sink/tap ensemble needs a course in design. Every time you put your hands under the tap or wash your face, the entire counter is soaked with splashing water. (The tap is way too high.) My gloves were damaged and various other things on the counter, like my eye makeup, was soaked. Ladies will understand this is an irritation. Men will likely not even notice although my husband designs bathrooms and thought it was very poor. Breakfast in the Library Bistro restaurant was truly mediocre. Hard poached eggs, and no \"fake sauces\" as the server haughtily advised me when I asked for HP/A1 sauce for my potatoes. I'm not usually into \"fake sauces\" as I'm a bit of a health addict but the potatoes were flavourless. Other selections may, of course, be better. Someone needs to learn how to cook eggs as I note another poster complained about the scrambled variety. No coffee/tea maker in room and no indication that you could get one sent up. The good (which far surpassed the bad): Great location! The panhandlers made it a home-from-home as we live in Vancouver. Right by Pike Street and central to everything. Very nice Bookseller Bar that's great for panhandler-watching. Very pleasant bathroom (insane tap notwithstanding) with Jacuzzi. By the way, ours had \"Gilchrist and Soames\" and not Aveda products. I feel ripped off! Lovely \"bedroom\" with good quality bed linens (Frette) and I slept like a log despite my husband rasping all night long. Gorgeous bath robes which you can buy for about $125....instead of regulation white, they were leopard print. Also, hanging in the closet was a pair of matching lady's jammies. (However, they were a size XL and I am 5' 9\" and 128 pounds.) You have to buy them but they are rather cute.) Back to the lack of \"stuff\" in the bathroom, there is a card that lists various items that can be sent up to your room free of charge if you have forgotten them (and another list of items that cost a mere $2.00). Free items included a hair straightener, curling iron, toothpaste and brush, steamer, feminine products, etc. and $2.00 items included nail polish remover, nail file and dental floss. I love the idea that I can get a straightener sent up if I leave mine at home... Tea and coffee, cider as well I think served in the Bistro, gratis, in the afternoons. Bottle of plonk, some truffles and a rather pleasant and personalized note to celebrate our anniversary. In the foyer is a flat wooden board shaped like a dog . The board says \"Welcome!\" and on it are writtten the names of all the visiting dogs! How CUTE is that? After I checked out, I reclined on one of the huge and comfortable foyer sofas to recover from the shock of the parking bill and to await my husband (who likes to pack for an entire month) and the bellhop. The foyer really is lovely. I want to finish up on a positive note as we truly enjoyed our visit. The staff were delightful and very helpful and we love that the hotel respects dogs.

Part of the Kimpton chain of boutique hotels, the Alexis Hotel is located at the corner of First Avenue and Madison Street, across the street from Hotel 1000 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taboo Video for Adults\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd store, and a block and a half south of the infamous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Lusty Lady\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adult theatre. Nevertheless, the Alexis Hotel is ideally located for walking to the major downtown sites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including: Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, Pioneer Square, Safeco Field for baseball and Qwest Field for football. Ferries dock just a couple blocks away from the hotel, and it is a short 5 minute taxi ride to the cruise ship terminals. Unlike many of the other downtown Seattle hotels, the Alexis Hotel has character. Front desk staff told us that the building was originally built in 1901 and most recently renovated two years ago, in October of 2007. The Alexis Hotel is a dog friendly hotel, so we saw several canines during our stay. The Alexis Hotel staff were all pleasant and helpful. Because the City of Seattle had shut off the water main to the hotel for 4 hours the day of our arrival on January 1, 2010 -- resulting in some yellowing of the water and sediment when my wife filled the large soaker tub on our first night -- the hotel did not charge us for parking our car with the hotel valet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a saving of $36 US (plus tax) per day. We stayed in room 347, a 900 square foot one bedroom suite priced at $244 US (plus tax) per night. Room 347 was spacious, clean, and typical Kimpton funky. The set up of room 347 was a little strange, but given that the building was built in 1901, the renovation was no doubt limited by the physical confines of the building structure. Room 347 has a very large master bedroom, including a lovely red brick feature wall. The stainless steel four post king size bed looked almost lonely, given the size of the bedroom. My wife found the mattress to be too firm for her, but I had two very restful sleeps and I found the mattress firmness to be just right. The 32 inch flat screen tv (no high definition channels offered) was so far away from the bed that it was actually too small for the bedroom. The bedroom had a very large bathroom, with a triangle shaped two-person jetted Kohler soaker tub, separate shower featuring a Grohe rain showerhead, large marble vanity and beautiful black marble flooring. The living room featured a sofa, a couple of sitting chairs, a desk and a 40 inch flat screen tv (again, no high definition channels offered). Given the size of the tv, the 20 odd channels offered came in fuzzy and high definition was sorely missed. Furthermore, for some strange reason, the tv was mounted above the desk, so that viewing the tv from the south side of the living room was partially blocked by the contoured centre column/wall. There was also a two piece washroom off the living room, a mini bar, small sink and counter area, and a large balcony going nowhere (it opened to the interior of the building -- a concrete courtyard of sorts -- with views of the outside of other hotel rooms and a small patch of sky). Pros: 1. Great location in downtown Seattle. 2. Funky decor and character building. 3. Dog friendly. 4. Attentive staff. 5. Clean, reasonably priced rooms (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonably priced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being a relative term for downtown Seattle). 6. High end \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aveda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hair and bath products (your wife will thank you!). 7. Small but well appointed bar located at the main entrance to the Alexis Hotel (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bookstore Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and a separate restaurant (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Library Bistro\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). 8. Part of the Kimpton hotel chain of boutique style hotels. 9. Free wireless internet for Kimpton InTouch members (the Kimpton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free guest loyalty program). Cons: 1. Given the age of the building, we could hear the people walking in the room above ours. Nevertheless, on both evenings the nights were quiet and sleep came easy. 2. Panhandlers throughout the neighbourhood (albeit none in front of the Alexis Hotel itself). I should point out that this is a problem regardless of where you stay in downtown Seattle. 3. Expensive valet parking at $36 US (plus tax) per day (see my comments above, wherein our parking was comped by the Alexis Hotel!). 4. Despite having a 40 inch LCD tv in the living room and a 32 inch LCD tv in the bedroom, there was no high definition tv offered. Conclusion: My wife and I would (and will) gladly stay at the Alexis Hotel again. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and 10 is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I rank the Alexis Hotel at 8. Accordingly, I give the Alexis Hotel two thumbs up!", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "raelarder1976", "ReviewID": "UR52208491", "Content": "Stayed in a King Deluxe Hotel for 2 nights at the end of Dec.

When I arrived I thought I'd ended up at one of these old fashioned worn hotels, but it had undergone a great revamp in recent years. The room was nicely appointed, really big, very comfortable bed, nice bathroom. My only comment was that it was a bit too dark. Most hotels tend to be around this area, and being so close to the port you are bound to hear some horns from large ships at night, but it's not really disturbing. This is yet another reason to get the Alex (a 4-floor building) rather than one of these higher priced options with \"room view\", as you will get a view of the docks, which is not very glorious. I didn't use the restaurant, but I'd like to mention that their bar in front of the hotel looked really inviting. And it was always full of \"real\" people, not the usual scene that you get in the trendier hotels. Service was always friendly and timely, and the rooms were really clean. I'd recommend Cafe Fonte, 2 or 3 blocks away at 1st Av, which has a fabulous coffee ( you need to be really good to stand out in Seatlle) and a smart selection of meals (breakfast through dinner) and wine.

Internet access was included with the room, which we quite appreciated. The one thing I liked least about my stay at the Alexis was the on-site restaurant. The \"Library Bistro\" was very disappointing mainly because it was closed at all times except for breakfast. There was a small pub-style facility also within the hotel that offered meals from the Bistro's kitchen, but it was always crowded in there and I generally don't like eating dinner in a noisy bar. It seemed odd that this spacious restaurant would be closed while the bar was overflowing with people seeking a meal (and not just a drink).

It's a short 10 minute walk to Pike Place (uphill, but then what isn't in Seattle?) with plenty of interest to see on the way and several good restaurants in the area and a nice bar just downstairs. Like much of the city, the clientele on this street is eclectic, you'll walk past a wide variety of establishments, but nothing where I didn't feel comfortable going out on my own. When I told them we were there for our anniversary, they bumped us to a king room with a sitting room at no charge. Additionally, we showed up early and they held our bags until check in, no questions asked (any good hotel *should* do this, but the response can be surprising) as well as holding the bags for the couple of hours between when we checked out and when the car picked us up. The room was lovely - comfortable, spacious and well appointed. The view wasn't awesome, we just saw the top of the next building over, but we had curtains drawn for privacy most of the time anyway. The bathroom was beautiful as well, marble everything and garden tub - the Aveda toiletries were a nice tie in to the salon downstairs. Usually I don't really care about hallway decor in a hotel, other than that it's tasteful, but the artwork on display at the Alexis is wonderful. We have a ballerina in the family and took several photos of the displays just to show her. The only drawbacks I identified were - that I could have done without walking past the Aveda salon coming in and out, after a day or two, the fumes got to be a bit wearing. - that the desk staff weren't terribly knowledgeable about the less tourist-y attractions in the area (we were doing more of an 'off the beaten path' focus) Overall, it was a refreshing change to stay somewhere with personality and charm, rather than the usual cookie cutter modern hotel - definitely worth the extra $20-30.

This hotel stretches across 3 old buildings. I was in the \"north tower\", where the plumbing and air conditioning worked well. While the decor was excellent, the bathroom was very small. The floor above me creaked when people walked around, and the street noise was fairly loud. There is no view, but typically none of the Kimpton hotels I have stayed in have a view to speak of. So I think that is not an emphasis of the chain. Another problem with Kimpton chains is that the fitness centers tend to be sub-par, and the Alexis is even below that. The fitness center is a small room with one recumbent bike, 2 ellipticals and 1 treadmill, and a small fan on the floor. But these complaints are really nit picks in a hotel that is a privilege to discover.

We stayed at the Alexis for 6 days in April 2009, partly for business (a conference for me) and leisure (wife and daughter catching up with sister-in-law). Since my conference hotel had no rooms big enough for us (my daughter is handicapped and wheelchair bound) I searched for a hotel with a large suite at a good value. While I looked at the Hotel Monaco, the Alexis caught my eye. We setttled on the Fireplace suite, an 850 sq. foot room with fireplace, expansive dining table for 6, sofabed, separate bedroom with King bed, and a nicely set up bathroom/bath. With the Kimpton promotion of 30% off for stays over 3 days, the cost was minimally more than I would have paid for a standard hotel room at the conference hotel. Also, I was only 4 blocks awar from the conference and closer still to the water and piers. Although we arrived late on day 1 after gathering all our gear and a minivan at SEA-TAC, the hotel had a valet to greet us and help us shuttle our stuff to the room on the second floor. The flowers I requested were there (great choice, very fragrant) + the rollaway for our daughter. Lots of space to work in as there was a long counter with sink, honor bar fridge which we emptied onto the opposite counter, and put my daughters medications and formulas into. My wife marvelled at the room's size, decor (great paintings on entry with nice accent lighting), and layout. (won some points with this choice). It did face the western alley looking directly back to another office building but it was relatively quiet and very comfortable. Beds were very comfortable, 37\" LCD TV's with remotes, bathroom was great except for small amount of counter space around sink. shower was great, nice and hot with good pressure at all hours of the day. Had a great recommendation from the front desk for a late take out snack from McCormick and Schmick's on the next corner. The front Desk check in was great, the valets were ALWAYS ready with our car when we called and helped us with our wheelchair stowage or packages, and were very friendly, calling us by name each day. Note that there are two drop off areas - in front facing east, and to the south side. The front is used during most of the day but there is no stopping during some parts of the rush hours so they take you in from the south if needed. However, the main entrance is the only one handicap accessible, the south side has stairs that lead to the Library Bistro. Not a problem for us once we learned the layout. My sister-in-law also enjoyed visiting with us and felt the room was a hit and a great value. The food at the Library and Bookstore (same kitchen) was excellent day and night. The art all around the hotel added a nice sophisticated touch. The concierge was quite helpful and even came out to our car to deliver a specific map we had requested. The hotel's housekeeping staff was very good, cleaning each day when we requested it and provided a turn down service too. They were respectful of all our stuff (we do spread out in a room!!) yet tidied up quickly and efficiently. They certainly earned their gratuity at the end of our stay. Both the wired and wireless internet worked quite well, nice to have two ways to hook up since we brought 2 laptops with us. The only glitch was one faulty network cable which was easily exchanged at the front desk. I travel reasonably often and stay at a lot of different chains and properties. This was one of my best stays and my wife, daughter, and sister-in-law enjoyed having the Alexis as our Seattle base - we looked forward to returning back to our \"second\" home each eveing and relaxing by the fire. We had no problems with internal noise, and only 1 day was there outside noise - a compressor or jackhammer run by either a city crew or one of the crew workinig on the hotel/building facade starting at 7am!!. The manager apologized profusely and their schedule was delayed to after 8am. When we visit Seattle again, we'll stay at the Alexis! I can't see any reason to look for anything else!

We came here on vacation for a special occasion, so we wanted to splurge a bit. Let me preface to say that my husband and I are globe-trotters and travel extensively. This would have made our 5th visit to Seattle. THE GOOD: Location: Cannot ask for a better location. Within walking distance to Pikes, shopping & restaurants. Close to all the action but not in the middle of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect! Would prefer to stay in this area from here on. Hotel Staff: Got prompt and courteous response from manager. Cleanliness: Lobby & public areas were great. Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..needs improvement. Library Bar: Great service, great drinks. Parking: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay for the valet, there is plenty of street parking at that area underneath the bridge. If you wait till after 4, you can pay for 2 hours of parking (time limit) and 6pm to 8am is free! THE BAD: Housekeeping: came & went at inconsistent hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either early in the morning or as late as 6:30pm. When we happened upon her at 6:30, she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even finished and just had her take off than finish. After 4 nights, they never cleared the foyer table of an ice bucket and soda cans/ wine bottles. A clearly visible watery mess for 4 days. If not for us, think about that lovely furniture getting water-logged! One day we found dirty linen lying in the middle of the hallway. Bellman: At arrival, our taxi dropped us off at the entrance near the Library bar. This is one floor below the rest of the hotel. Although the bellman was there to greet us, they did not carry our luggage up the steps and there was no elevator. Needless to say, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m one of those gals who bring baggage heavier than themselves, so this was not a good start. Concierge: MIA. Apparently out on vacation and not another one to fill in during his absence. So much for using this service for our pampering holiday. Mysteriously, we did get a note in our room upon our arrival from him congratulating us for our special occasion. Nice touch, but who really wrote it?!! Room Amenities: With all my travels, I never got an option of a 2-floored room so I specifically got the room with the 2nd floor. I was expecting a 2nd floor but it was instead like a sunken room sort of thing. The living room/bathroom was 3 steps up from the bedroom area. When upon 1st entering, you have a large entry foyer that brings you towards a hallway with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd living area & bathroom, and then continues forward to the bedroom area. After 4 nights at this hotel, I hate to admit that we never used the living area except for to eat a snack for a few minutes. Also, with all the space, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have a bigger bathroom, but it was a typical apartment size. Perhaps if that bathroom was as big as the entry foyer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the king bed as described in room style. Got a metal queen canopy. Looked great, but that metal skirt / bottom area was a shin splitter more than once. Although there was plenty of furniture, there was no drawer space in any of it. The room was beautifully decorated albeit not well thought-out as far as usablity. Was relegated to using the small file cabinet sized thing in the closet under the safe. Still had to live out of the suitcase in my 650+ sq foot room. TV placement in the bedroom was in the corner. Unfortunately, the canopy bed poster always got in the way, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to peek around if you want to watch TV in bed. Iron didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Had to call twice to get a replacement sent. Both TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work upon arrival. Had to get maintenance to fix it. After a few days of running around, it was nice to have that option to watch a movie on demand. Paid for and started to watch Valkarie but after a few minutes of it on, the picture was shaking. Went to the other TV and saw the same shaky picture. Apparently we got the room with the crappy TV connection. THE UGLY: I can deal with all of the above I had mentioned, but this one was really unforgivable. The hot water was intermittent. Either of the sinks had hot water unless the shower was turned on. However, once you got in the shower, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get the blast of cold unsuspectingly too. After telling the front desk of this issue on day 2, supposedly they had maintenance in there but still no resolution. Had cold water in cold Seattle in the early spring. Yippee. What did we get for our troubles? A $60 credit from the front desk at check-out (still spent more than $1000) and 40% off of our next stay. Whoohoo! Seriously?!! So as a Kimpton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s InTouch member, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to say that this room has been the worst Kimpton room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed at. The Monaco in Portland blew you completely away. Too bad because your location is perfect. 40% off my next stay to take a chance of not having hot water, non-working TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, no concierge, no luggage help, spotty housekeeping\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6would you do it?", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cLove this Pet Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dogvacationer", "ReviewID": "UR29556134", "Content": "Beautiful and a great location too! because we were traveling with a dog, we were a bit leary about how the hotel would actually respond to a pet.

My stay here represents a significant and out-of-the-ordinary monitary expenditure for me, and I hope it will be more than worth it, as I anticipate it will be. B.

The location of the hotel makes it very convenient to the waterfront, Pike Place Market, SAM and Pioneer Square without being right in the midst of all the noise and crowds (a big plus if you've ever been in Seattle during the busy tourist season). You'd think with their location right on First Avenue that noise would be a problem, but I think their windows must be triple-paned as we've never had difficulty with street noise (and I'm pretty picky about that!).

All the delivery fee/service fee on top of the meal prices you will easily drop well over 50 bucks for a small meal/snack. However the food was very good and fairly timely. One night we ordered cookies and milk for a small dessert. The hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any baked but said they were putting them in right away and would bring them as soon as they were done. We called about 15 minutes before it was time for room service to shut down for the night. About 45 minutes to an hour later they finally showed up with them. They were very apologetic and gave us a few extra cookies and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge us at all for them because they took so long. Not only did they not charge us, but they even stayed late to bake them and deliver them to us. To me that is great service. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait for us to complain about the long wait, they were proactive in the situation and made sure we were happy. We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have complained anyway because we are very laid back people but the fact that they went out of their way to do that for us was very personal and heartfelt. The other complaint is when we were leaving we called ahead for our car to be retrieved. We waited the 10 minutes like instructed and then lugged our suitcases to the lobby. No one had any idea who was supposed to have gotten our car. We waited another 10 to 15 minutes for someone the find out who should be getting our car. Like I said these are very small nitpicky thing that happened on an overall wonderful trip.

The bed was a dream to sleep on. Lovely cotton sheets and extremely comfortable mattress. Bathroom chock full of Aveda products, plentiful luxurious linens, phenomenal shower head with good flow. Love the robes that are available for purchase. Only 2 blocks to waterfront and 6 blocks to Pine Street (the Retail Core) and Pikes Market. The # 18 bus runs on First Avenue where the Alexis is located and is free in the downtown area. If you take the #56 bus just south of Madison and First you can get out to Alki Beach for just $3.50 round trip. McCormick and Schmicks Seafood Restaurant is the best for seafood and you can sign to your room at the Alexis. Restaurant is half block north of the hotel. Complimentary coffee in the lobby is excellent as is the complimentary evening wine tasting. Be sure to put an Early Housekeeping sign on your room door if you plan to return to your room midday otherwise you may wait for your room to be cleaned. Housekeeping Staff was flawless and paid attention to every detail. Stacks of New York Times, Seattle Times. and The Wall Street Journal are available for free in the lobby. I enjoyed jumping out of bed, grabbing a cup of coffee downstairs and bring the papers back to my room. A complimentary Seattle Times paper is delivered to your room daily. If you need quiet during the day and want to keep your windows opened, I would suggest asking for a room away from the front of First Avenue. That being said, I enjoyed my room facing First Avenue and the noise didn't bother me but I was not conducting business on this trip. Pet friendly, no hidden charges, makes this hotel the #1 pick in Seattle for me. I plan to frequent Kimpton when I can because of their strong committment to the environment and giving back to the community.

The staff accommodated our every need incl when we asked for a DVD player(there wasn't one in our room) they brought another TV with a DVD player. The hotel is down the street from the Market, next to the waterfront and across the street from a major Seattle museum. Everything a tourist would want or need is right there within walking distance or short taxi ride. We actually rented a car which was totally unnecessary and very expensive to park in downtown Seattle however the staff had it waiting for us by the time we got to the lobby.

Because we are a HUGE fan of modern hotels, and are in the design industry ourselves, we found the Alexis to be somewhat aesthetically pleasing. It was funny, we stayed directly across from Hotel 1000--where we stayed the year prior when visiting Seattle. The rooms were nice and warm and we had a great view from our windows of Downtown Seattle. The bathroom was cute, but offered minimal space for toiletries and the toilet was too weird and slow--not good. The beds were indeed, comfortable, the art on the walls were a plus, the warm and modern colors throughout the hotel added a nice touch to some art deco pieces. The fitness center was a disappointment, as they only have about 3 cardio machines and some dumbells. When we went to work out, a mother and daughter had set their ellipticals for an hour, so it gave us zero chance to work out there. But the great thing is because of this, we took a run in the city--absolutely wonderful. It was cold and sprinkling, but so, so romantic and exhilarating all at the same time! The staff, although nice (Especially our bell hops and doormen--thanks for all the help and last minute late restaurant and bar recommendations guys--they were fabulous places!) were not as warm as we expected them to be--which was a disappointment. I think it was just those within our age group (late 20s) that acted \"too cool\" for us with a hint of attitude--sighing as we ask an obvious common tourist question. However, some of the slightly older staff was very nice. Regardless of the attitude we got from a couple of people at different times, they weren't mean, just not very friendly, kind of hipster wannabes. Honestly, I rate mostly on service. When I'm spending several nights and hundreds of dollars at the bar, I expect at least a warm smile and greeting when I'm at the front desk asking a few touristy questions. We got attitude a lot of the times, with the exception from the doormen and bell hops, of course. They were the MOST helpful and very nice. I mean, you can't beat both men opening the doors for you immediately after your run. We didn't get a chance to try the library bistro (we were visiting family most of the time and trying other fine dining establishments that we had on our agenda--we're huge food lovers), but as I mentioned earlier, we did spend a pretty penny at the bookstore bar every night we stayed--the wine selection was Okay, but they do have a full bar for some decent cocktails. I don't know if I would stay at the Alexis again just because of the toilets in the bathroom, but since we are a huge fan of the Klimpton hotels, I will definitely try a few others. Boutique hotels often offer a unique experience, however, as mentioned before, the lack of warmth and friendliness by the front desk staff is what puts me on the fence about possibly staying here again the next time I'm in beautiful Seattle.

I can understand that there is work to be done behind the front desk, but no bell or any way to call someone out if needed.

The wallpaper in one of the front hallways was stained, as were some of the carpets, leading to a general feeling that the property was just not up to snuff. He didn't let us know about the renovation, which was apparent as soon as we set foot on the elevator - it was sheathed in ratty plywood with a not-so-cute label pasted on it that said \"Creating a new artwork for you\" or something similar. The room was stark, with no artwork on the walls, although it was clean. Bathroom was ok. Nice TV's. No turndown service. 2 bathrobes. Nice touch, but there were three of us.

When my wife and son went down for breakfast, they were told it was not complimentary, and so they passed on any breakfast or coffee.

We complained then and there, and they appologised, and asked us if we would like a comp room for another night, but we were only in Seattle for one night, and we wouldn't stay there again anyway.

It looked as if no one had ever used it. The hotel was very very close to Pike Place and other attractions. Walking to those places was easy. We both wished that we could have spent more time here. If we return to Seattle we will definately stay here.

This hotel is rated four stars and I will agree that it meets its four star rating in some aspects but falls shorts in other areas. Pros: (1) Staff members at the hotel were wonderful. (2) Complimentary happy hour everynight with all you can drink wine and champagne. They even had paint out so that the kids could paint postcards which the hotel will send out for you. (3) Great complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby every morning. (4) Location - walking distance to all + buses around Seattle are free and bus stops are located every two blocks or so. (5) Nice bedding, plenty of towels, Aveda products in the bathroom Cons: (1) Needs a remodel: The suites used to be a condo next door that they bought out and turned into part of the hotel. Bath tiles had mildew. The floor in the bathrooms were worn out linoleum. Kitchen was small and old. (2) Terrible View - our room looked out directly into the next building (3) Room had a musty feeling Overall - I liked this hotel but expected more and felt it was not worth the money we spent ($400 night + tax for the two bedroom suite). The hotel rooms (non-suites) may be better since they are located in the original hotel. It would definitely be cheaper and would be worth it if you can get it for a good price (under $150).", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & stay\u201d", "Author": "Bendites", "ReviewID": "UR4157506", "Content": "We spend 3 nights at the Alexis.

We arrived early in the morning, and to our surprise our room was ready. The room was exceptionally large! As you entered the room, there was a long entryway. It included a desk (where my husband was able to get a lot of work done as it was quiet and separate from the main part of the room) and then a long decorative entry table. As you enter the main part of the room, there were two queen beds separated by another desk, two chairs with an end table (with quite a few magazines on Seattle) between them, the armoire with the tv, video game, and mini bar inside, then breakfast table and chairs. Up a few steps was the bathroom and a dressing room. The dressing room was about 10'x10' and had a wall size framed mirror. Very nice when getting ready to go out. Since we had our two children with us, the hotel brought up a rollaway bed so the kids could sleep separately. The rollaway was not the fold in half style, but rather a real twin bed. That was put in the dressing room. There was still plenty of room for all of our luggage in there as well. The room was well appointed, and while we faced the main road, we did not have any problem with noise. We also never heard a peep of noise from other rooms. The hotel bar, The Bookstore, was cozy and very nice. They have 64 single malt scotches, and some excellent cocktails. We had a very good breakfast at the hotel restaurant, The Library. The hotel lobby has a beautiful Chihuly glass art piece in the center. In the evenings, the hotel hosts a wine reception in that area with postcard painting. There are blank postcards set out with watercolors for guests to use. It was fun to see so many adults participating and mingling. The valets were very efficient and always friendly. The hotel location was perfect for us. We were able to walk all over the city center without a problem. About a block away was an internet coffee shop and also a drug store. We needed a few extra things during this trip, and the hotel was wonderful at helping us out.

I got the room for a bid of $140/night on Priceline. With taxes and fees the cost came to $163/night, which I feel was reasonable for a place of this caliber. On checkout my bill showed the room rate at $139/night, which pleased me: that meant I had shaved my Priceline bid very close to the true bottom line. What I liked best about the Alexis were its great location, the quietness of the room, and the first class treatment I got from the staff. When the front desk found out I would be checking in on my birthday, they upgraded me to a view room on the top floor and sent up a bottle of champagne. That set a great tone for me. It seemed that every interaction I had with the staff from then on was positive. The staff appeared to be mostly in their 20s and 30s and they were cheerful, competent and confident. I was pleased the Alexis sits astride the intersection of four Seattle neighborhoods. Many good restaurants and attractions are a short walk away. Head down First Avenue a few blocks and you're in Pioneer Square. Go the other way and you're at Pike Place Market. Head east to Fourth and Fifth Avenues, and you're in the downtown shopping and business districts. Head two blocks west and you're in the heart of the tourist waterfront. The Alexis lacks a great in-house restaurant. I had a room service deliver a dinner and a breakfast and the food was perfectly fine but not inspired. However you can charge your meals to your room at several excellent dining establishments in the area. Close by the hotel is McCormick & Schmick's, which packs in the locals night after night with fine seafood prepared New American style.

The clock radio had come on apparently and I thought someone was in there :) ....BUT also the room was HUGE!! Actually, there was a long foyer when we walked through the door into a very expansive guest room. Two queen beds with plenty of room to spare....AND another, small room up a set of short stairs past the bathroom! There was no furniture in there, but a large closet, floor lamp and mirror. We also had a rollaway bed in the downstairs room. AND they had a personal note to my daughter wishig her a happy 13th birthday and a container of Jelly Bellies candy...AND a bottle of Martinelli's sparkling cider on ice! We were QUITE impressed. I live an hour and a half south of San Francisco and have had the pleasure of staying in a number of Kimpton Hotels in the city. I have never been disappointed. And, the Alexis Hotel was as nice as all of them! They're intimate and they make you feel at home. I wish we had been able to stay more than one night.

The Front Desk did send up a bottle of champagne, which was nice. I was surprised to read a recent review on here that someone had the Executive Suite for $200 which isn't much more than we paid, booking back in February. The room was comfortable and we faced the water. We were on the 5th floor and there were no noise issues at all. Since we were there for 5 days, we actually unpacked and found that the dresser drawers would barely open and close. I guess most people don't bother doing so. There was no in-room safe, which I like to have available. The Wine hour was nice and the delivery of French Press coffee each morning was welcome. The front desk did provide us with a vase to use for the beautiful flowers we got from Pike Market {a MUST see}. We had massages at the Aveeda Spa which were reasonably priced but the spa is small and sparce. It was an impulse, I would have looked online for other options otherwise. The lack of concierge was noticable, however the valet/bellmen were most helpful. The bathroom was large but lacking any luxury feel. However, they had THE softest towels I have ever used!

Contrary to some of the negative reviews posted here, we had a great stay in the heart of downtown Seattle. Our rooms were just the right size for a couple (I can see it being cramped if we had two kids). The appointments were very tasteful and proximity to downtown allowed us to put off renting a car for a couple of days. Being just 2 blocks from Pike's Market place, 2 blocks from the new Seattle Library, and within walking distance of all the restaurants and attractions along the shores of Elliot bay lets one thoroughly experience downtown Seattle. A note about Rental Cars: DO NOT rent a car if you want to spend a good deal of your time downtown - with the cabs and frequent busses, you would be wasting money and time trying to find parking. We had to rent a car to check out the San Juan islands and Snoqualmie falls. However, we were able avoid paying the hotel $26/day for valet by using off the street parking. The parking restrictions are only in effect from 8AM to 6PM. If you leave before 8AM you won't have to pay anything. If you return after 6PM (which is usually the case if you really spend some time at your destination), then there is plenty of parking right next to the Hotel (we got parking immediately in front of the door both nights) - and you don't pay anything. Its only $1.50/hr (2 hour limit) if you had to keep the car in the parking spot during the day.

Go out the hotel and turn left and a few blocks away is Pikes Place Market. Turn right and another few blocks is Pioneer Square. Go down the hill and another few blocks is the Waterfront.

Realizing that they'd reneged on their promise to me, they reduced the price of the room and gave us free parking which was a nice gesture. The biggest quirk of the hotel seems to be housekeeping. One day, our room wasn't made up at all until they came for turn down. When I called the front desk at about 3:00, they told me they were still doing checkouts! The concierge sent my husband and son on a wild goose chase looking for the German submarine attraction down on the wharf.

Location is perfect. Off the main strip but close to everything.. easy to get in and out of and easy to get to eveything without all the traffic. Front desk help very nice and helpful. Concergie in gift shop very helpful. Free breakfast was nice for a free breakfast.. lots to choose from. My kids loved making their own waffles each morning.. good coffee. The lady who kept the dining area was very friendly and nice.. always greeted us and the guests and even visited with everyone. This hotel does have alot of nice extras, coffee available 24 hours in Lobby, wifi in rooms, indoor pool, laundry facility and a game room, even a jacuzzi which was out of order during our stay. Rooms have easy access from parking lot by a side door. Beds are very comfortable! Hotel is quite. We never heard a noise at night which is unusual! We were on the main floor and even the parking lot outside of our room was noise free. The bad... I know this is being picky but at first sight I was not impressed. The decor in lobby is outdated and not what I am use to. I have never stayed at a 2.5 star hotel before. I booked it because of the last minute trip and another hotel I wanted was booked. Tripadviser had this hotel list as #1 so we went with it. Entered room and it had a bad smell to it which hit us as soon as we opened the door.. even my kids said something about it. It was not a foul smell but just an old dusty smell to it like it had been vacant for years. After the day.. we were use to it and it did not bother us anymore.. but I will say this, we considered leaving. Went to bathroom and noticed a toothpick and some small dark curled hair on floor next to bathroom. Did not complain instead cleaned up the hair but left the toothpick. Next day when we returned it was still there. Day 3, we did not get our room serviced. It was a long day and very dissapointed to come back to unmade beds, floors dirty and no clean towels. I do understand that the staff cannot inspect every room for proper cleaning and leaves their trust in employees to their jobs right. Sorry, but these are not huge rooms so spotless is not to much to ask for! Front desk stated that the room was marked as being \"cleaned!\" They did give us a credit for this. One day while room service was making the rounds, the man was cleaning the room across from ours and he was in their singing and when he saw me he winked at me and kept dancing and singing while cleaning. Sorry but I thought this was strange! Hotel is nestled between 2 motels on each side which I didnt care for, but thats just me being picky about my surroundings.. the people in Branson are there to see shows and enjoy other activities and I do understand that it is not cheap to visit Branson so some may need to save money by staying at cheaper hotels/motels.. I dont think you are going to get any rift rafters in Branson so I did not end up feeling unsafe with motels around me. Best Western to me was not at all expensive and was a higher end hotel with a cheap price tag. Dont forget to ask about discounts.. we got a discount for being Sams Club members and got a nice discount.

They did have a continental breakfast that consisted of EggBeaters, cold biscuits, watered down gravy, make your own waffles, and there was some donuts, dry cereals, and yogurts as well. I would recommend getting up early and having breakfast at some of the breakfast buffets in town.. read reviews to find a good one. The staff was helpful and nice. The hotel itself did have a funky smell, but it was okay for the two nights we were there I suppose. The last night we stayed at the Chateau on the Lake- if you can afford this for the entire length of stay and book early you can probably get a good deal- definately will be staying here or at another more upscale hotel on our next visit to branson.

The rooms are decent with comfortable beds and nice pillows. They have flat screen TV's (but not very many channels to choose from.... no Disney channel so my daughters were disappointing by that). The pool area was nice and had an indoor/outdoor pool. There is plenty of on-site parking, and the hotel is in a nice location for everything you need to do in Branson. The workers were friendly, and 3 of the 4 people we dealt with at the front desk were very polite and helpful.

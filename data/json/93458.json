{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Stay in a struggling neighbothood We stayed at the Comfort Suites to attend the 2009 Sugar Bowl game that Utah won over Alabama! The hotel was easy to find, right off I-10. The neighborhood was flooded during Katrina and there is still evidence of the damage. The hotel had been repaired and was clean and comfortable. For some reason, we had to spend our first night in the handicap access room even though we didn't require that. The next morning, I went to the front desk to see if another room was available and they immediately moved us to a room that better met our needs. The continental breakfast was good and it included some hot items which was nice. The hotel arranged for a shuttle service to take us downtown, about 10 minutes away, so that we wouldn't have to drive down there and find parking which was a nice touch. The hotel staff was great except for the front desk clerk on our check in. It was New Years day and it was pretty evident that she didn't want to be at work. She was not very helpful and ended up sending us to Slidell, 15 miles away to find a restaurant.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR155466686", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Golfnut222"}, {"Content": "A decent hotel in a crummy neighborhood This is a newly renovated hotel in a pretty tough area... rooms are classic Comfort Suites with good bedding but older TV's. Minimal restaurant choices in the area, there is a Chinese place within walking distance.. the other decent restaurant is closed on Monday, of course, I was here on a Monday.They intimate the hotel is close to downtown... wrong. It's quite a ways, 10- 20 minutes by car depending on traffic. Bottom line, you can stay in a better located hotel for the same money in the city. Many of the folks here appear to be workers doing reconstruction from the flood (still plenty of work to be done in that area around here).", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR915808104", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "sberhard"}, {"Content": "An unexpected surprise! What a lovely place This place was an unexpected find on the edge of the French Quarter. We got an incredible rate, free breakfast, brand new rooms with a giant bed, free cookies at the counter, even a pool and courtyard! Free books, friendly staff, a discounted happy hour..it just kept getting better. The whole place has just been completey renovated and it shows.

You can feel about your car as they have a security guard who makes rounds and the hotel is in a decent neighborhood. Did have a hot and sweaty night (not the good kind) as the Air Conditioner was marginal at best.The clerk at the hotel is always hiding behind a wall (night and day clerks) so you always have to go and just clear your throat or call out then they pop out from behind a wall and always seem a bit annoyed.Rooms are a good size and bathrooms are large, both very clean. No onsite workout room, no laundry facilities (no close laundramat either). Pool is strictly open 9AM-10PM...they padlock it so no late night or early swims with the kids. Continetal breakfast is ok unless you are diabetic or low carbing it but that is normal for these hotels. It is only about 10 minutes to the French Quarter if traffic is good and it is easy to find.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR897049778", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "john-bob"}, {"Content": "Excellent Value Have just returned from a memorable trip to New Orleans, taking in the French Quarter festival.Never having been there before, it was after much reading of reviews that we finally booked the Comfort Suites .It was an excellent choice!

My husband and I went to New Orleans to celebrate our b-days. We booked the Comfort Suites through Expedia. Although the description of the location was a bit deceiving because it was not minutes from downtown, it was a wonderful hotel. It was clean, the complimentary continental breakfast was great, the rooms were spacious and the staff was very helpful and friendly. But if you do select this hotel, word to the wise, make sure that you rent a car. The roundtrip shuttle to and from the airport would have cost $ 95 for 2.

Requested quiet room, which we received. Problem with key not opening door. Staff immediately switched us to an adjacent room, with apologies. Fortunately we were on the east side of building, as temps soared to 95+ during our stay and our room escaped the blazing afternoon sun. Severe storm on 2nd afternoon which knocked out power to hotel for about two hours. Discovered all surrounding business had power. Staff advised B/W is serviced by a different power company. Nice breakfast; nothing outstanding, but sufficient. Older, well used property. Nothing special about rooms, but A/C was VERY good. Carpet badly worn, but clean. Bath/shower controls very touchy to adjustment. A sink faucet that extends out over the bowl would be a great help! We had double beds, One slept fine, but my mattress \"sloped\" to nightstand side, enough to be annoying after one night. Hotel is handy to Starlite Theatre, which is what we were most interested in. Steakhouse also adjacent, with decent food. Would definitely stay here again for two reasons: (1) Convenience to what we are interested in, but (2) mostly because ALL hotel employees were exceptionally friendly and helpful, something you find less and less these days.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atchison, Kansas, United States", "Title": "\u201cWe stayed at Center Pointe for years\u201d", "Author": "Frances M", "ReviewID": "UR139430367", "Content": "The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly, the room includes breakfast with a complete choice of breakfast items.

On the negative side, it is a motel and you could hear a lot more noise at night between the cars outside and the people walking around.

However, being that I was one of those customers and felt a certain degree of \"second class citizenship\", as I checked in I asked Michael if he had any king beds available because I had a 5 year old that fell out of bed and brought only one bed rail with me. He said \"not for your whole stay\". Why didn't they offer the king size bed room for the time it WAS available and I would happily move once it became full? My room was at the very END of the elevators too--the very last one on the 3rd floor. As I walked away he was smirking and mumbling something under his breath to the other lady. I don't think he should be in customer service. We get to the room and as I said the rooms were very nice, (although there was no soap to put beside your sink--only the dispenser in the shower--odd) but the door was out of alignment with about 1/2 inch showing through the bottom and light coming through the whole door. I called the front desk and maintenance was there in less than 5 minutes. I asked them if that was normal (their names were Richard and Tommy, I think) . They said it was warped and all the weather stripping was off of it. They called the front desk, told them to NOT assign the room until they could fix it, switched my room and went to get the key for me. They were so nice and went out of their way. Another con was the maid service. I had the privacy thing in the door by mistake once , so that was my fault. The next day, we left the room at 9:30 am and returned to swim at 2:00 pm. The towels had been taken from the room before the actual cleaning, but it hadn't been cleaned yet. They didn't clean the room (I was watching from the indoor pool) until after 4 pm! It's a small thing, but they also didn't leave drinking cups when we ran out, but we used the coffee cups. I guess all said and done, I was happy to have a clean, cold room at a great price through _riceline.com, but if given a choice I would not choose to stay at this hotel again based on customer service (front desk except for Sue) and maid service.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201cNice location, decent value\u201d", "Author": "zajabor", "ReviewID": "UR115372400", "Content": "Pros: The hotel is at a nice location - on the strip close to everything and yet easy to get out.

Ideal for Families!\u201d", "Author": "MidwesternMomof5", "ReviewID": "UR102851520", "Content": "We just returned from an impromptu road trip to Branson for Spring Break. My husband and I traveled with our 5 children ages 2-12. We'd never visited the area before, so had no idea of where to stay. Although the reviews for this hotel were average, it was one of the few we contacted that could accommodate our family in one room without any \"extra\" charges. Plus, it was located smack dab in the middle of the strip. So...we took a gamble and booked our stay. We were happily surprised at every turn with this hotel. Our room had two Queen beds and a pull out couch and there was still plenty of room for our pack & play crib. There was a nice amount of space overall - we never felt like we were on top of one another which is rare for a family of our size. There was generous closet space and two large dressers which held all of our clothes for the week. There was a separate sink and make-up area outside of the bathroom which was nice when it came time to get ready in the morning. The bathroom was standard but clean and large enough. There is a soap and shampoo dispenser in the shower in lieu of travel sized bottles - so be advised if you are particular about your products. There was a roomy dorm-sized fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker as well which was great for us with the kids. Everything in the room was clean and well cared for. The decor was current and the beds/bedding were very comfortable. There's no pay per view, but a nice array of family friendly channels on the flat screen TV. It was nice to not have to worry that one of our kids would end up seeing something inappropriate as has happened at other hotels. The laundry facilities and gym were basic, but sufficient for our needs. The Best Western is not a 5 star resort, but I'd rank it far above the average chain hotel. A sweet touch was the bible on the desk open to Psalm 23 with a note from the hotel wishing us a nice stay. The staff was friendly and warm, right down to housekeeping. Our room was right across from the elevator, but we were not disturbed by a single noise - the hotel seems to be very soundproof ...another nice surprise. The pool and hot tub were clean, good-sized and warm! The daily free breakfast was always hot and well stocked with a solid variety of items to choose from. There were always at least 2 employees there making sure the breakfast area was immaculate and fresh. We never felt the need to go anywhere else for our morning meal and all 5 of our kids found things they liked. Only a couple of tips: Make sure to request a room in the main building, otherwise you will have to walk outside to get to the pool and breakfast area. I'd also suggest getting a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor so you have an interior door and not one facing the parking lot. We had to walk through the pool area to get to the breakfast room, which didn't bother us, but might be an issue for some. Location-wise, we were in the heart of the strip. The Titanic Museum (awesome!) is right next door. The adjacent restaurant, Montana Mike's provided a great meal at reasonable prices in a family atmosphere. There is a Walgreens almost across the street if you need anything during your stay. We traveled in a 38' RV and had no problems getting in and out of the hotel parking lot. We would definitely stay here again because we know we're guaranteed a great stay! I'd highly recommend this hotel to families.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay\u201d", "Author": "Cruise,J.D.", "ReviewID": "UR89518373", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel twice before.

My dad, step-mom and brother had been out to Branson the year before and had a great time, so we decided to go again. I had been to Branson 20 + years ago and I was amazed at the change. The hotel check in took, 5 minutes tops, our room was in the main building, but the distance between buildings wasn't that far, my car is a 03 Impala and you could put two of them end to end between the main building and the building right beside it, and the 3rd buidling is directly in front of the 2nd building separated by 4 employee rooms and the outdoor pool, hot tub and deck. The room (136) was clean and roomy, my only suggestion would be, they need new matresses, I've had 2 neck surgeries and they were a little too soft for me.

Air conditioning worked great, the bath room was clean, they have shampoo and body wash in the showers, it isn't too bad, but we always take our own. A trip to Branson Landing is a must and the Tangers Outlet mall down the road is also nice. The Hollywood Wax museum, House of Mirrors and the Castle of Chaos are great, the Belgium Waffle House across the street is a must for anyone who wants wonderful home cooked food.....it is absolutely wonderful. The Plantation resturant down 76 toward Table Rock Lake is a great buffet, Andy's frozen custard shop is a must......be prepared, the line is always very long.........if there is no line, they are out of custard, go back later.

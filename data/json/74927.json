We went to Phoenix to catch some Spring Training games and the location of this hotel was very central to all the games. The best part of the hotel would have to be the location and also the clean and refurbished rooms. The parts that were not so great were the pool - my kids were really wanting to go in but it didn't look that clean to me so I wasn't comfortable letting them go in. Also the breakfast not only wasn't good but the person in charge of breakfast was not helpful at all - even for free it's not worth it. They had a small selection of fruits - oranges and apples - would have loved to see some bananas in there. They had cereal but not the individual boxes I would have preferred and they had make your own waffles - but I wasn't successful in making the waffles they kept sticking to the machine and the person who was supposed to be helping actually implied that it was my fault the waffles were sticking but didn't offer to help me! The last thing I didn't care for was the other guests - some of them gave me the creeps - one of them actually yelled at my kids for being too noisy at the pool area which just made everyone feel uncomfortable and not welcome. As far as the rooms - they were fine and very clean. The hotel was perfect to sleep at but if you are planning on spending much time hanging around a hotel this probably isn't the place I would pick.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Carlos Sonora", "Title": "\u201cClean and just refurbished\u201d", "Author": "scmexico", "ReviewID": "UR123070983", "Content": "We stayed here after an overseas trip to South America.

Pros: large room, comfortable beds, clean, great location. Cons: breakfast was not impressive, not much of a selection at all!!!! Coffee tasted like warm brown water! Two of the 3 days-no paper was delivered to the room when other rooms received it. Not enough towels. Pool water was cold and hot tub, which did not work, was boiling hot! The main elevator, which was extremely slow, looked more like a service elevator. The business center, if you would call it that, consisted of one out dated computer and printer that was out of ink.

We traveled to Phoenix to visit my brother over a busy graduation weekend. We looked for a nice place nearby their home. The La Quinta Inn served that purpose very well. Beds - We stayed in the 2 queen room, but I do think the beds are \"full's\" and not actually queens. They were very comfortable beds, pillows & linens. (Note - only 4 of us stayed in the room each night as the boys rotated spending the night with their cousins). Storage - draw and closet space is limited. Bathroom - average size, nice shower. Condition - our entire room and the whole hotel for that matter was spotless! The daily maid service was excellent. Staff - efficient, not overly friendly, but not unfriendly either. Breakfast - too crowded, they should spread the food better to help reduce the lines/crowding. Food was fine. The hotel is pet friendly, but you could tell these only by the doggy/potty-bag station and the occasional pet we saw. There was not frig, so we just kept our cooler filled with ice from the ice machine.

The rooms are clean and spacious, and the common areas are clean as well. The staff is friendly, the breakfast is fresh, and the shower pressure is good in the shower. I like that this is a pet-friendly hotel, and it is conveniently located right off of I-10 in Chandler, one of the nicer parts of Phoenix. One thing that bothered me is that there was a used towel hanging on the towel hook in my bathroom; apparently, the maid missed it? Details like this bother me! but in this case, I'll be generous and say that this is still a great bargain for the price.

It was also the most expensive and the worst. We sensed problems ahead when we arrived to check-in at 3pm and the receptionist wasn't sure if our room was ready. Our room was OK, with a larger than average bathroom, however the beds were on the hard side. Our room overlooked the I17 which was a bit noisy but not enough to warrant changing to another. Best to request a room on the other side of the building. If you are not a pet lover, stay away. We saw almost as many pooches as human guests. We witnessed a disgruntled guest pacing the floor by the reception desk, moaning about the handwritten sign which said \"back in 5 minutes\". This is hardly good business practice. I got the overall impression that they were seriously understaffed. The worst thing about this place was the breakfast. By comparison the selection of food was very limited. Having opted for just a slice of toast, I could not believe there were no butter portions; only margarine. Cheapskates! The cold milk container was empty and the girl on duty didn't seem to care or bother.

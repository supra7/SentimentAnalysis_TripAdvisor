I have found a diamond in the rough. They will work within your budget and in this economy that matters. yes it's not a 5 star hotel but the rooms are clean well decorated. The beds are more comfortable than some of the pricey hotel I have stayed at. Also another big plus to this hotel is I had travelers flying in from two different airports and they have a shuttle that goes to both. That in itself is a rare find in Dallas.

The building has seen some wear and some things seemed a bit dated. A young man Oscar checked my wife and me in the hotel. He wasn't very friendly but we all have bad days. We got to our room and there were burns on the floor from an iron. It was hot and stuffy in the room and we turned on the air conditioner and it cooled off slowly for about an hour. I bet you can guess where this is going. About 12:45 in the morning I was sweating and tried to adjust the air conditioner to no avail. I called down to the office and no one would answer so I walked down to the front desk and spoke to Christopher. I explained the problem and with a bad attitude he set me up in a new room that was across the hall. I asked if it was ok to leave my stuff in the first room. Its 1 o'clock in the morning. I'm exhausted, he said we prefer you not do that. When I went back to the room with malfunctioning air conditioner my wife was too tired to get up. She can sleep in an 80 degree room. I moved to the new room and checked the air conditioner and when it cooled off I went to sleep. At 3 o'clock in the morning Christopher was at my door asking why I had not vacated the first room. I explained that my wife was asleep in that room. He gave me a dirty look and stated fine and walked off. At this point I was angry for the lack of professionalism and poor customer service. I woke my wife up and we packed our stuff and left the hotel. A very defensive Christopher at the from desk said you will probably want to talk to the manager as if he had been through that before. I called the manager a few hours later. I explained what happened and the front desk manager, who wouldn't tell me anything but his first name, Ricky. He was no help. No apology other than explaining that no hotel allows you to occupy two hotel rooms for the price of one. I wonder if they were planning to rent out the room at 3 o'clock in the morning.

As a result of the rivalry football game, the hotel was crowded and noisy (mostly from college kids traveling with their team and drinking a bit too much alcohol in the evenings). The hotel and the standard room we had were both average. They were clean, but a little dated. The bath products provided were from \"Bath and Body Works\" and were very nice. I enjoy taking a hot bath before bed each evening and typically don't have a problem with having enough hot water. The hot water at the MCM Elegante took a very long time to get hot, but it did eventually warm up (which is the most important part for me!). The bed was very comfortable and the hotel provided plenty of pillows, both soft and firm. The air conditioner unit was loud, but it did a good job keeping the room cool, which is an important thing in Dallas! Our room was directly across from the ice machine on our floor and it was amazing how much noise filtered through the walls into our room, both the noises of the ice machines and people talking. The location of the hotel is excellent for getting around in Dallas. There are lots of nice restaurants nearby (including Chili's, Pappadeaux, etc.) and there is a Starbucks across the street. Since the hotel is on the Northwest Highway, it was easy to visit all of the attractions that we wanted to see while in Dallas. There is also a DART station within a mile of the hotel, if you want to take public transportation. The breakfast provided by the hotel was one of the best that I have had. They provided hot items, like eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, biscuits, gravy and hash browns and they also provided cold items, like cereal and pastries. It was nice to have the variety and everything that I had was very good. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for an average trip to Dallas.

I have stayed at the MCM Elegante in Abilene many times and was expecting the same type of service and rooms, I was very disappointed. The place is very outdated. The rooms are not all suites like the MCM Elegante in Abilene, so that was a let down as well. When checking in the gentleman took my payment and handed me a key, not telling me where we should park or even how to get to my room. I let that one go, because everyone has a bad day. After I asked where to park, etc., we went up to our room. As soon as you walk in you will see how much updating this property needs. The elevators have a musky smell and it doesn't get any better once in the room. There was no vent in the bathroom so when you shower that steam has nowhere to go but in your room for an instant sauna! Also our toilet wouldn't flush, but it was late and I did not want to change rooms so I lived with it. They do offer Bath and Body Works products in the bathroom and Starbucks coffee but I find it odd to make my coffee in the bathroom...and a little disgusting. There was a small fridge in the room but no microwave. Everyone I came in contact with at the hotel was rude! We wanted to get some water and a soda and we were told the vending machine on the first floor was broke and to use the one on the second floor. After walking the entire second floor we could not find a soda machine so we went back down to the front desk and the guy argue with us that it was up there yesterday so he doesn't understand where it is now...ummmm, well it's not there. So he said try to fourth floor, so back on the elevator and up to the 4th floor, I put my money in the machine and nothing, it took the dollar and gave me nothing in return. I returned to the desk and had to complete a form for a refund and just asked if I could get a bottle of water. He said go in there and pointed the the restaurant area. I entered and couldn't find anyone so went back toward the kitchen area and there was a gentleman cleaning up. I asked for a bottle of water and he gave me a warm bottle without saying a word. I was so tired and upset by then, I took a sip and put it in the fridge for the morning. Ridiculous. The beds are firm but I can say they have nice quality bedding and soft comfy pillows. Another warning, the walls are extremely thin. I could hear the ladies next door discussing that one has a thyroid problem at 5:30 in the morning. There is a full hot breakfast in the morning. But it was pretty gross, so I ate cold cereal. Again, the staff in the restaurant were rude and the only word I heard from them the whole time was, \"where's your ticket.\" These people I guess assume that you have stayed there many times and know what to do. I had no clue where to give my ticket. The hotel in Abilene has someone that serves the breakfast for you, you dont open up the dishes and serve yourself, so that was different. This place needs a complete overhaul with the decor and staff! I will NOT stay there again!

Great prices as well, as they'll match online prices. For those who want more space, the rooms around the pool are small suites (they call them cabanas). I've seen them and they're very nice and not much more ($20 more a night ?). I think they sleep 4+. Tonight I checked in and noticed the microwave was missing. I called the front desk to let them know (didn't want them to think I'd stolen it !) and they had a new one up here in five minutes, and replaced the TV remote when I mentioned it was weak.

The bar was a crazy mess, completely disorganized and dysfunctional there was a 20 minute wait for drink, we did take into mind that it was a game weekend but still no excuse. Second, when we called the hotel several weeks prior to check-in, the hotel staff told us that they had a free shuttle to and from Texas Stadium (which is one of the reason why we booked). When we got to the hotel they alerted us that it would be $12 per person for the shuttle to and from the stadium (cheaper to take a cab). To top it off, there was construction going on at the hotel and we woke up in the morning to the sounds of hammering and drills. With no warning!! And most importantly, on the day that we left the hotel, we had the hotel bell desk hold our luggage so that we could get some breakfast before heading to the airport. When we got back to the hotel to get our luggage, the staff had sent our luggage with someone else to the airport. Talk about a shocker, I got so nervous thinking we would never see our suitcase with the contents again. However, they retuned the luggage after about 30 minutes.

We reserved a room with a sleep number king bed, which my wife tried and enjoyed, and ended up in a suite rather than a regular room which was a nice surprise. There were obvious signs of a remodel in progress; missing baseboards in the hallway and in our room, hallway temperatures on the sixth floor around 95 degrees due to a missing thru-the-wall a/c unit, minor problems w/one of the a/cunits in our room, and an under the-counter-fridge in our room which we defrosted ourselves to get it to work properly. Having been in the construction industry for over 30 years, my guess is that the work that has been done was done in-house rather than by a professional contractor. On the positive side, the front desk and staff were very polite and responsive to our requests for maintenance and very helpful to us in finding our way around town. Would we stay there again knowing what we know now? Sure. At $70 per night for a suite w/a king bed, the Radisson was acceptable though not impressive. We found nothing gross or disgusting but rather a well-trained staff trying to make up for the obvious inconvenience of a remodel in progress.

In fact, we were pretty disappointed. Being on Northwest Highway, this hotel has great potential. Prime location, close to lots of entertainment and dining options, virtually no competition with any hotels around. However, the Radisson has not yet taken advantage of its opportunities. When we arrived, we were told we would be staying in a pool side suite with a kitchenette and separate living space. Sounds Great, huh!!! Forget it. The room itself was nicely decorated, but the A/C did not work, the room smelt of stagnant cigarette smoke, and the outside looked like a run down trash motel. In fact, they have two areas for rooms. One is within the main building!!! ASK FOR THESE ROOMS. The others rooms are separated to the outdoors like an older motel. Only about 1/4 of these rooms were renovated, so tons of these rooms were trashed out. In fact, this specific area was accessable to anyone who wanted to walk through an unlocked, opened fence. We called the front desk to complain about the A/C. They said someone would be up to fix it. An hour later, and still 90 degrees in the room, we went to the front desk and requested a new room on the inside of the building. They were very polite and quickly found us a new room on the 4th floor. I have no complaints about the staff. They were fine. Upon arrival to the 4th floor, we realized that one of the rooms had apparently sprung a leak. There was standing water in the hallway! NICE!!! We went in our room. It was cold, newly remodeled, and had a comfy bed. Despite the water, we opted to stay. We both slept very well. No complaints there. Basically, this hotel is undergoing major renovation, however, they don't seem to understand that guests don't want to be a forward participant in the dirty side of renovation. In my opinion, if you are thinking about staying here to save $20, just spend the extra $20 on a better hotel. Sorry Radisson, you failed. We will most definately never stay here again!!!

The hotel is 12 min from downtown. The hotel has a free shuttle service from both DFW airport and Love Field which was really nice so we didnt have to rent a car. The price of the hotel was cheap $52 a night through hotels. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The rooms were decorated nicely. and clean. The hotel staff kept checking to make sure our stay was satisfactory and made themselves available if we needed them. The hotel is right by restaurant row and a movie theatre. The shuttle drivers take you to the restaurant of your choice (Joes crab shack, chilis, red lobster, humperdinks, pappa deux seafood etc...) That was nice. I would recommend tipping the drivers $1 -2 as a courtesy. The shuttle drivers will go out of their way to get you where you want to go, they are friendly and helpful with tourist type questions. I would recommend going to down town and going to the JFK museum at the book depository building in the west end market. It costs about $8 (with coupon from hotel) per person. It was very interesting to see such history, to be there. I am in my early thirties so I wasnt even around during this time, but I can only imagine and to see the footage from that day gave me goose bumps. It was interesting to learn the history behind it all. I some how thought the \"grassy knoll\" would have been bigger. Beware of scammers down by there trying to get you to buy a tour, dont do it. Take the day and walk around down town and the market, it was cool. My husband and I walked from the Book Depository building up two blocks to Ross st and then all the way down ross to Aknard (just past the Fairmont hotel) to the M LINE Trolley (which is free) and we rhode the Trolley to the Hard Rock Cafe (on mckinney st) this is the place to be there are nice shops. We also got back on the trolley going down mckinney to the Westend village (this is the place to do shopping it is a very nice area with nice exspensive shops and cute out of the way restaurants ) it is in the Turtle Creek area where a lot of wealthy people live. Very Quaint. We had a great time and the hotel although isnt in downtown, did everything a hotel should do, they took care of us.", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, OK", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed my stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2696395", "Content": "We had a great time!

The rates were good and this hotel was conveniently located. First impression was that the lobby was a little run down, then it got worse. The lamp shades on the bedside lamps were broken. The control for the hot/cold water on the tub was falling off and there was no hot water in the tub that evening. The next morning, still no hot water in the tub. Called maintenance. They worked on my bathroom for a while and then I had 1 minute of hot water. That evening I changed rooms. Also had broken lamp shades and no hot water. Changed rooms again. The third night the restaurant had no hot food because there was a gas leak in the kitchen. Also, no hot water. They had to jack-hammer the cement floor to repair the gas line and the entire hotel shook. At midnight I had had enough. I had to pack up and move to another hotel.", "Date": "January 16, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "MCM Elegante Hotel and Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109452-Reviews-MCM_Elegante_Hotel_and_Suites-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$69 - $147*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "109452", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f9/2e/f92edeb96da667a53fac614310ad905d1large.jpg"}}

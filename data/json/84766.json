Very nice on the outside, quite a smart motel on the main strip in Kissemee, there are eating places in walking distance. Check-in was very quick, credit card and photo id, only took 5 minutes to get my key-card. Room(262) was very nice, clean and plenty of space, with 2 beds, fridge and microwave.The air-con was already on, so the room was nice and cool, nice touch I thought, as I come from colder clines. Bathroom was clean and everything as you would expect. There were a couple of problems, the power outlet by the fridge/microwave/coffee maker had a dead socket, so you had to keep swapping power cords over if you had anything to keep cool and wanted to heat something in the microwave, which for some reason the turntable drive was missing, so no rotary action. The sink plug device wasn't there, so difficult to have a shave, the water went down the plughole rather slowly, think it may have been partially blocked. The wifi was dog-slow, it would have been quicker to use smoke-signals.I give up trying to use it my room and compiled this report next morning at a McDonalds. Niggles like these should be picked up by the room service people, no excuse for things like this happening, it spoils a nice motel.

There are lots of pluses: It was quiet (I had a poolside room in back that had view of pool and lake, front rooms may be louder, WIFI didn't pick up in back but did in front), clean (my room was updated with nice furniture and fridge, bathroom dated but clean), 2 hots tubs and HEATED pool that were well kept and a welcome relief after the parks, accommodating staff, safer due to U shaped building with parking in middle, I saw a couple of questionable characters but had no problems traveling by myself, it was mostly families doing the parks and enough of them coming and going so someone was usually coming in same time I was coming in at night. The convenience to the parks was priceless after experiencing the traffic on Int Dr and Buena Vista, generally 8 miles to any park but minimal traffic and 10-15 minute trip, this will become very important once you have experienced the traffic in other areas. Breakfast was typical continental, there is a grocery store, Subway sandwiches, Chinese plus other food across the street (a busy wide street but a traffic light is about 75 yards down then easy walk across). Wal Mart 1 mile. No resort or parking fees. I didn't use shuttle but saw the schedule, it seemed weird times to me, if you call they will probably give you the schedule, the public bus comes by there but you will waste precious time and it was mostly workers riding it from what i saw. I was going to stay my last night at a fancy place but after checking them out decided to remain at peaceful convenient HoJo instead. Warning, a half mile or so past HoJo toward Kissimmee gets very seedy/unsafe looking, the rooms are cheaper but it didn't look like tourists were staying in them, anywhere close to HoJo toward Disney looked safe.

Our party of 5 have stayed at this hotel for our last three holidays to Florida. In fact the last time (2 years ago) we visited two other hotels to see if they offered anything better, yet we returned to this one. We had two rooms side by side, which the staff were able to accommodate, yet again. The hotel is ideally located. It is literally a five minute drive from most locations - (Walmarts, Petrol Stations, Food Outlets, Target, Disney, Old Town). The hotel has an army of workers who can be seen cleaning the rooms, the pool area, tending the brilliant gardens, and maintaining the hotel complex. The reception staff were more than helpful. They happily organised a taxi cab a few days in advance, and allowed me to use the telephone to dial Universal Studios Lost and Found. The rooms are more than adequate. Ours overlooked the pool, and the fantastic view over the Lake. The rooms were clean and thankfully had a fairly new looking A/C. In fact the rooms were all receiving new carpets on the day we left. Unlike the rooms in the other hotels, there was no evidence of mould or insects. The internet WiFi was a god send, and I was able to receive the signal on the old boat jetty. I cannot understand others who have left negative comments regarding the lack of pool cleaning or substandard breakfasts. We found that the pool was cleaned daily and the breakfasts saved us a small fortune to feed the 5 of us. I do however have a few suggestions for the hotel. I would recommend that the trees are pruned back, especially at the rear of the hotel. Our view was partially blocked by mature Palm trees. I would also love to see the hotel invest in upgrading the BBQ building and the boat jetty, both of which are in danger of being blown over in the next hurricane.

My opinion of the hotel is going to be neutral. I stay here because I know what to expect. The first room I went to had a bad wet odor to it. They immediately gave me a room with microwave and refrigerator. It had the same smell but not nearly as bad. I figured the humidity had something to do with it or the fact that they actually cleaned the rugs with water. It was a very quiet stay. The pool area is great. I feel that the hotel is safe. Maintenance is very responsive. Breakfast is ok as well. Again the staff is great and friendly. The manager and some of the front desk people are still the same from the first time I went there years ago. That tells me a lot. Shopping is very close! In closing I'll say this. Although the hotel is old and starting to show some wear, it is by no means dilapidated like some people say on this site. I will stay there again next year in May or so.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Storvreta", "Title": "\u201cgood enough for me\u201d", "Author": "mlein", "ReviewID": "UR8266262", "Content": "I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel.

Irlo Bronson Hwy. (AKA: US-192). I have to say for $50 a night it wasn\u2019t bad. The carpet was clean the bathroom was clean and house keeping did a good job. The pictures on HOJO's web site are a little off. The color scheme of the building's exterior was in the process of being changed while we were there. We primarily needed a place to lay our head while visiting Epcot and MGM-Studios. We chose the Lakefront Park hotel because it said they had a continental breakfast and free shuttle to the parks. Well after reading a prior post about the shuttle service leaving the park early and being the last stop on the route we chose to drive the rental car to the parks and pay $9 for parking. All you have to do is take US-192 west and you end up right at Disney\u2019s front gate. It was well worth it to drive since we got the see Epcot's excellent nightly fireworks. The continental breakfast was really kind of a joke. All they had during the week was pre-packaged baked goods (i.e. crumb cakes, pound cake, ciniman rolls, think how twinkes are packaged and you've got the picture). On Saturday they did have doughnuts from a bakery, which was nice. Also available was coffee and orange juice from a cafeteria-style machine. On an up note there are plenty of places to catch a quick breakfast like McDonald's, Burger King, or IHOP on your way to the park. There are also quite a few restaurants like Applebee\u2019s right on US-192. The location was pretty good in general. From the HOJO, you can take US-535 (Vineland Rd.), which is the first stop light on US-192 west to the right, and make your way to Down Town Disney. At Down Town Disney there are plenty of things to see and places to eat. Some of the attractions include the house of blues and Cirque Du Soleil just to name a few and parking is free. Also off of US-535 you can take US-536 (World center drive) to the right and hit International drive that also has an array of things to see. If you like cars and racing I'd highly suggest Race Rock Cafe on International drive. You can also make your way to Universal/ Universal City Walk via International Drive by taking Universal Dr. Be waned though whether you're just going to see City Walk or Universal theme parks it still cost's $10 for parking either way. If you are looking at finding a different inexpensive place to stay you may want to research The Palms Suites Lakeside in Kissimmee it\u2019s just a little ways down from the Lake Front Park HOJO. At the Palms all units have an equipped kitchen, microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker that would be nice if you wanted to make your own breakfast. There is a Target Store right across the street and a Super Wal-mart right on US-535 for picking up breakfast foods and things that might have been left at home. All in all, if you're looking for a clean inexpensive place to sleep while visiting Disney then the Lake Front Park Howard Johnson in Kissimmee will do fine. BTW: if your are an NRA member you can get a discount to stay at all Howard Johnson's and other hotels @ ----", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Howard Johnson Express Inn & Suites Lake Front Park", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d84766-Reviews-Howard_Johnson_Express_Inn_Suites_Lake_Front_Park-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$37 - $63*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4836 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">SR535 and US Hwy 192</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34746</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "84766", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6b/24/6b244bd3f38798eda7eae53e6b511a064large.jpg"}}

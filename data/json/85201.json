I drove four hours from Orlando to Miami just to be able to spend a few hours with her. I tried getting a room at the same hotel, however, it was 100% full, but I decided to go up to her room and see her anyways.

I told the employee that No, I was not staying, he replied that I still had to pay the $12 dollars. I tried speaking to him in English and He didn't understand much...I spoke to him in Spanish and he said \"Little spanish\" and started laughing!! After so many minutes trying to talk to this employee I finally decided that enough was enough and that I just wanted to go see my friend. I took my car and parked it myself, because he said that I could do it, but with an attitude. funny, I paid for VALET parking, but I parked myself...OK..no problem.

We were a bit confused at the airport about where to catch the shuttle, but that's the airport's fault. Turns out there are several locations depending on where you come in, and you need to flag down the shuttle driver, which we had no problem doing. Five-star check-in. Gal was friendly and welcoming. Five-star cookies. I really am not big into sweets, but I confess I had a chunk torn off and was chewing in the elevator. I doubt seriously I'm the only one that can't wait to tear into that warm goodness! Room...fine. Perfectly ok. Clean. Sure it's an older hotel, but the bed was comfy, there were plenty of thick towels. Now, if you're like us and you show up with no car on a Sunday night, be aware there is nothing nearby. Even the shopping \"mart\" is closed. No big deal to us, as we were there for a restful night before our cruise. Fortunately, the hotel bar was open. Sadly, Happy Hour is not on the weekends. I wish every bar had happy hour every day! Bartender had a lot to do. He sure kept busy. We had some drinks and shared their sliders, which were good. You have your choice of 4: a chorizo one, turkey burger, crabcake & regular cheeseburger. We skipped the chorizo one and tried the other three. Turkey burger was my fave. Note to hotel: you might not want to leave a sign up by the register in the bar for everyone to see that says a VIP's name and what room they're staying in. That kind of guidance to staff should not be broadcast for all kinds of reasons, particularly security. We were tempted to say we were her staff and charge everything to her room :) (just kidding!) Anyway, later that night we came back down for dinner. I wanted something light, so I ordered the scallop salad for like eight bucks. Husband got the cheese quesadilla. I LOVED my perfectly seared scallops on perfectly dressed watercress. Not only was it beautiful (sorry, camera had run out of juice at this point, so sadly no pic), but it was absolutely perfect. Could not believe it was so inexpensive either! It was not a large salad, but it was light and delicious, and could not have been prepared any better! Husband, however, was not thrilled with his quesadilla as it was more vegetables and less cheese than he had in mind. (which means, I would've probably liked it). Back to the hotel itself...lobby-wise, there was a smell that really bothered me. My guess is it might've been largely due to the Shopping Mart that's attached to it. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the best I can describe is a cross between ivory soap and the way many import shops smell. They're obviously in the middle of renovations. Monday morning, there was a lot of window-cleaning and painting going on, which should lead to good things. Hotel shop gets my most unusual, tackiest hotel shop vote ever. If you've ever stopped at South of the Border in SC, you know what I mean. There was stuff in there I'm guessing have been there for decades that no one bought, no one ever will and they'll still be there. Like the \"lawyers journals\", sales pads, or the Tweety bubble bath? Then again, I might be wrong and they could be best sellers. TIP: If you're looking for the business center, it's an unmarked door. We asked two different people where it was, and they would say \"it's right to the left\", or \"it's right around the corner\", but no one ever said, it's a brown door with no sign on it.

I am pretty sure they hadn't vacuumed in at least two months. I was unable to sleep all night because I am a light sleeper and the sound of jets landing and taking off all hours of the night is impossible to sleep through. Our last straw with this place was the shuttle in the morning. We had returned our rental car thinking we could take the shuttle from the airport in the morning....nope!! We waited for 55 mins and the shuttle never arrived. It was supposed to come every 20-30 mins. We were afraid of being late and called a cab and got to the airport to find and huge line for our airline and narrowly made our flight. I would not stay here again unless I absolutely had to.

I was a little shocked not to receive a cookie at check in, but I really did not need it. They are usually quite good though.. My room on the 2nd floor was quite large. I had a king size bed and a balcony. Room was comfortable and quiet. Room was clean and everything seemed to be in working order. I decided to visit the lounge to unwind with a couple of beers and dinner. The lobby is under construction so the ambiance of the lounge is not great, but the finished parts of the hotel look pretty good. Upon arriving in the lounge, I noticed they were not very busy, so I chose a table and sat down. After being ignored for over ten minutes by the bar tender who frequented the table next to mine, I chose to sit at an open seat at the bar. I finally got their attention, but the service was mediocre at best. The real fun began the next morning when I decided to dine in the restaurant. After being shown to my table, I encountered one of the rudest waiters that I have seen in a Hilton branded hotel. While the plates were cleared, the issue that I had was his attitude about the bill. Rather than presenting me with a bill to sign to my room, he came to my table and proclaimed in a loud voice \"6.60\". I knew that my food vouchers had covered a portion of the bill and was prepared to sign the remainder to my room. He continued his \"6.60\" banter and I asked for the check to sign. This made him say in an even louder voice \"no you must pay NOW\" He claimed that I could not charge to my room due to not having a Credit Card on file. Had I paid cash, this would be true, but it was very wrong in this case. I had a credit card on file and had charge privilages. He went to the POS and printed me a check to sign. No apology, no explanation. I am not one to make a scene and basically sat there stunned at what had transpired. Of course my mind wandered as to how many people in the otherwise quiet restaurant thought that I was some low life trying to skip out on a breakfast buffet. I did not make a scene and chose to leave the restaurant without further comment. I did however make a trip to the front desk to report the incident. The supervisor apologized and was very professional. Upone leaving the hotel, I was still a bit upset and managed to leave my belt laying on the desk in my room. I called the hotel a number of times the next day to see if I could retrieve it. Twice I was called back with people saying that they would check to see if they could located it in housekeeping, but twice I never received a follow up. I have since given up as it is a waste of time. In summary, the hotel is going to have a fresh new look after the renovation. Things seem to be coming together.

I checked-in at the desk and was issued 2 keys for a room on a high floor. I went to the elevators, which required a room key to use. My key didn't seem to trip the elevator, but another person got on and up I went to the floor to which I was assigned. I should have known -- the keys I was issued did not work on the room. So, I went down to the front desk, waited in a short line, and explained to the clerk (the same one who checked me in) that the keys didn't work. She then gave me new keys; when I got to the elevator and swiped this key, I was swept to a different floor than the floor of my room. I couldn't even access the floor my room was supposed to be on. I went to the desk a THIRD time and upon seeing that the same clerk who had screwed up twice was still working, asked to speak with a manager. Turns out, my actual room was on YET ANOTHER FLOOR (in fact, my actual room was a different one altogether than the one listed on my registration packet). The manager gave me a correct set of keys. He called me a few minutes later and explained the root of the error was a front desk clerk who just did it wrong...twice. He apologized and reduced my room rate, which was decent service recovery, but it would have been a lot better if the front desk staff were trained to check people in accurately (which seems like a pretty baseline skill for someone who works at a registration desk). Set that aside, and the stay was OK. The hotel is attached to a massive convention hall, and the property seems to be in the midst of a HUGE renovation project. The hotel part seems done, and indeed the lobby and the room had nice decor, good furniture, nice bedding, etc. The hotel's pool is a major disappointment. This isn't by the beach or anything, so I wasn't necessarily expecting a glamorously landscaped pool...but it IS Miami, which is a pool-going town. Well, the pool might as well be at the Holiday Inn in Des Moines -- it's small, surrounded by ugly concrete, and totally uninviting. I was on a concierge floor because of my Hilton HHonors status. Fine if you get upgraded, but NOT worth paying for. The evening appetizers in the lounge were pathetic; basically, a tray of vegetables with some dip was put out. Breakfast wasn't anything special, either. It's an airport hotel, so you can't knock it for location very much...it's close to the airport, and that is about all. Don't stay here expecting lots of nearby restaurants, etc., unless you're really into fast food. Overall, blaaaaaaaah.

I will attribute it to either bad caulking or poor cleaning. * The pool: There was yellow crime scene tape over one portion of the pool and the whirlpool was not working while we were there. Also, the pool had no security, meaning any person that paid for parking could come into the pool area with no restrictions. There were also a lot of bugs in the pool. * The hallways: On our floor the hallways were always filthy. They were littered with crumbs, food and trash. It took 2 days after our arrival for the mess to be cleaned and they never stayed that way. * The view: HORRIBLE! Our view was of the 836 highway and air conditioning units that looked broken. * The parking: $7/day and there were several times we saw large pieces of animal feces in the parking lot. * The free wifi: It barely worked in our room.

I believe this hotel and the convention center have undergone a recent renovation. This was evident in some of the common areas and in the convention hall. In my opinion, the best features of the hotel are the icy-cold A/C and the refreshing shower (although the tub/shower certainly did not seem to be part of the renovation). Unfortunately, almost everything else about our stay was less than stellar. Like other reviewers, the pronounced lack of service, in all areas of the property, was baffling. Considering this property is billed as a convention hotel, one would think that customer service would be AT LEAST average. However, things like overflowing garbage containers, litter in the stagnant water of common area water features, garbage in the pool and jacuzzi, extremely limited food service, nearly non-existent housekeeping service and critically low-levels of linens are critically important to a property that is supposed to cater to large groups.

However, this hotel has a few customer service issues. First, they were overbooked and we were put up in another hotel for the first night. Fair enough except we had prepaid for the parking and we could not get a refund. Turns out that the parking lot is managed by another company. Second, the bathrooms needed more attention from housekeeping. The sinks had a heavy film of grime, the towels were gray, and the facial tissues were not replaced. Third, a frustrated room service employee informed me that I could not order from the menu my room had and he would send me a new one. He sent up a menu just like the one I had except he had ripped out all of the middle pages. The staples were opened up to prove it and the booklet was rumpled as though someone mishandled it. When I called back to place an order, another room service attendant informed me that all foods from the original menu were available and he was sorry that I was told otherwise. I told him I hoped the disgruntled guy wouldn't be cooking my food. Fourth, one of our rooms was canceled a day early. We managed to get it sorted out after a lengthy discussion and proof that we had prepaid. The hotel laid the blame on Priceline, although I am not sure how they could do that when we confirmed our dates at the time of check-in. Lastly, we couldn't leave without one last bit of drama. The hotel was very nice about letting us checkout 3 hours late at no additional cost. However, the parking attendants made us pay 70 percent of the full cost of another day.

Please beware there is very little in the way of commerce such as open later eateries or stores within walking distance other than in the hotel. Also, I don't find the soft pillow top mattresses particularly comfortable and did not sleep all that well.

After placing a bid on priceline.com and then reading the previous reviews of this hotel, I must say I was very worried and anxious of the stay. Upon arrival the hotel desk workers were very friendly. Upon receiving our room key and heading to the room, we were pleased to see that we had indeed received a non-smoking room with a King size bed (as I had requested via telephone call to the hotel directly). However, I soon noticed that our room was facing the landing area for the Miami Airport. So I decided to call down to the front desk to request a room change to something on the oppposite side of the airport. The request was quickly noted and I was advised that I could immediately obtain a key to the new room. (Very helpful in my mind- opposite of those opinions listed in previous reviews). We chose not to pay $12.00 a day valet fee but instead parked in the parking lot directly next to the hotel with \"in-and-out\" priviliges for $8.00 a day. The parking lot is neither dark nor extremely lit but does have a security guard on premises at all hours of the day/night. The bed and multitude of pillows were very comfortable. The TV was not the \"latest and greatest\" but on my vacation I did not plan on sitting infront of it all day anyway! The bathroom is a moderate size with a seperate area right outside (which was accomodating while 2 people were getting ready each day). The ONLY issue that we came across was the renovation of the elevators. There are 3 elevators total but only 2 are in use. Out of the 2 in use, there were times throughout the day that 1 would break down and would make coming to/from your room longer than needed. OVERALL: Our experience with the DoubleTree Miami Mart Hotel was a very pleasant surprise after reading all the negative reviews listed. If you are like me and would get worried prior to your stay, please do not take all of the negative comments to heart.

This hotel looks dated and older, and is located in a part of the city that appears to lack any nearby amenities. In other words, it if isn't directly at this hotel, you'll be driving to it. The hotel is attached to some sort of \"mini-mall\" or something, but when I checked in and walked over to see if there was anything there to buy to eat, it was closed up tight and kind of creepy. That left only the hotel restaurant and the bar, and after a long day of business, I didn't want to have to deal with that or the expense. So, walked outside (to find nothing) and wound up buying a meal bar at a nearby convenience shop in a gas station. This hotel appears old. The elevators appear to be ancient, and one was not working when I was there \"for upgrading\" (hopefully that means outright replacement). The room was decent, but not impressive. Clean though. You have to pay to park here - very annoying for a hotel guest, particularly one who is a Hilton Honors member. Then, you have to pay for internet service in the room ($9.95 for 24 hours), which has become a business travel \"pet peeve\" of mine - while many/most hotels now provide free internet service, why do some continue to charge like they're providing something special (particularly a large hotel chain)? This is hard for me to figure out in this day and age, and hotels should know they're losing customers for it. When you add in these \"hidden charges\", this hotel isn't the cheaper alternative that it appears when doing the research on the net (which was why I chose this place for business travel - the cost). Checked out the next morning, and checked in later that day at another chain hotel not too far away (a Holiday Inn Express), which provided exactly what I was looking for in business travel - a nice room (bigger, two room suite), FREE internet service (wow, what a novel concept!!), and FREE parking (even had a guard traveling around in the lot, so don't tell me the extra charge is required for security). And, for a slightly lower price than the Doubletree. Nothing really wrong with this hotel - I would rate it average at best. If you were staying near the airport, or had some function at this hotel, it would be fine.

Staff is extremely pleasant. However, I experienced some housekeeping miscues in the week that we attended a conference there. FYI - There can be highway road noise associated with some rooms, so request a quiet area. I had my own wireless internet connection, but I was told by our companions that the daily in-room internet charges were high, so be sure to ask. Lighting in the room was a problem for me. Even with replacement light bulbs sent up by housekeeping, the lighting was insufficient for me. Bathroom lighting was particularly poor for grooming / cosmetic application. The security latch on the balcony sliding glass door was dangling by the 1 remaining screw, completely inoperable. That lack of basic security is dangerous because anyone could hop over the low adjacent balcony walls and waltz into our room. The lack of privacy from people on the adjacent balconies was surprising. Our entire room, computers, business equipment, and other valuables were completely visible by from the adjacent balconies. We kept the drapes closed, and maintenance repaired the security latch immediately. The bathrooms have been nicely updated, but the job had not been finished. The lavatory water faucet handles were not secured to the counter, and could not be turned off completely. The water in the shower / tub could not be turned off completely, either. Maintenance took care of those issues immediately. Housekeeping was absent 2 consecutive days. Housekeeping's response to my request for towels, shampoo, and restocking of the coffee bar resulted in a nighttime drop off of a sack of coffee bar items, a week's worth of towel stacked on top of the toilet, 3 shampoos, and 6 bars of soap. (Interesting!) Oddly, the bedroom clock is tethered to a bedside table on the bathroom side of the bed. This forces ALL guests to sleep on exactly the same side of the bed, in the same spot. This hotel has not yet adapted the practice of using washable duvet covers instead of blankets and spreads. On my bed there was a spread and bare, lightweight comforter WITH NO COMFORTER (duvet) COVER . You have to wonder if that comforter is ever going to be washed........ Like many hotels in this economy, the Doubletree cut the staff in the bar and restaurants down to one server. Be prepared to wait. However, I must say that the staff was pleasant and the food was good. The salmon was delicious, as were the desserts. Four of us ordered their version of \"Conch Chowder\" which was a beef-broth vegetable soup, with no discoverable conch. I met several business colleagues after hours in the bar area, which is attractive and comfortable. Twice in 2 days, I had to send wine back because it was immediately apparent by touch that crud was coated on the outside of the dirty glasses. The convention set-ups were tired, dated, and the rooms lacked an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. The booth curtains, stage draping, and table skirting did not look fresh. The stage draping and table skirting was hastily attached and falling off in numerous places. Would I recommend this hotel for their convention services? No.... Not until they invest in more professional quality, updated conference / exposition ammenities. Would I stay at this hotel if I needed an inexpensive airport layover spot? Yes, if the price was competitive. Again, this hotel has very nice personnel working there from top to bottom.

The bathroom is spacious which I liked. The house keeper cleans your room everyday. The fitness gym is wonderful. It is in the basement. It is clean and well kept. I had an great workout. Also, it have tv for entertainment while you workout. The area of the hotel is quiet on Sundays. The hotel is close to the quincy market, downtown crossing, the aquarium, coffee shop, deli, 711, dunkin donuts, and pubs. It is literally walking distance. It is close to orange line and green line (public transportation). It was an enjoyable stay and I wish I could have stayed longer. P.S.- If you like soup, you have to try the soups from Boston Chowda at the Quincy Market! It is delicious! If you like to shop, you could walk to downtown crossing and they have Marshall's, TJ Maxx, CVS, and other stores. Chinatown is also close to that area too. Just have to walk further down. If you are planning to go to travel alot on public transportation, it is best to get the weekly pass which is 15 dollars. It is 2.00$ per a ride if you do not get the weekly pass.

We sincerly regret booking the hotel as it ruined out shortstay in Boston. We arrived late evening on day 1 of our stay and got assigned room 512..... First thing we noticed was how cold the room was.... We put the heating on high and went out for dinner. On retuning to the room we thought the room was still cold, but presumed the bed would be made up to match the -5 outside! How wrong we were, we both woke up freezing cold and as i type this i have the worst cold, not helped by our night in this room! Our first day of sightseeing in Boston was done in a tired daze down to a bad nights sleep! We requested the bed to made up with extra covers.... What we got was 2 blankets dumped at the foot of our bed! The second night was the worst of the 2 nights..... My partner luckily had earplugs, but i didnt and despite going to bed at 10pm i didnt sleep till at least 3am due to the noises from the pubs/clubs outside! Admittedly outside noise isnt the hotels fault, but they would of known how noosy our room was at the weekend, so why not warn us at check in or offer us an alternative room? As a HHonour Gold I got a free breakfast in the 'resturant' i have never been waited on in a Hilton by staff wearing jeans! The breakfast was pretty grim, nothing was labeled and a fly was crawling over the danish pastries.... Nice! The room was of a good size, but one of our 2 windows was blocked by sheeting down to the refurbishment outside! Again no warning was given! We only had 2 days in Boston and this hotel ruined our vacation! A hotel can offer a nice lobby, clean rooms with every amenity going but what it comes down to is sleep.... Something i didnt get much of at this property.

Recently renovated, the rooms are top of the line with d\u00c3\u00a9cor, bedding, robes, etc, but are not large like most other Hilton rooms.

Quincy Marketplace/ Faneuil Hall are about a three minute walk and North Boston (Italian restaurants-we went to Riccardos - amazing food) is about a 10 minute walk.

Finally! But that's really the good news. Now the negative: Hilton Financial District had a management change. They were bought by a new holding company and they've made some substantial changes with some services and staffing. 1. The wonderful hot breakfast buffet is no more. Good bye to smoked salmon and eggs Benedict. Apparently the breakfast coupons are now at two tiers. Continental, and for the higher paying room rates, a hot breakfast that's only cook to order. And the two breakfast coupon tiers are regardless of Hilton elite level. Sorry Diamond members. Weekends do get a couple of hot items like scrambled eggs and bacon but otherwise being waited on for a self serve danish, yogurt, or banana just isn't worth it compared to a $2.00 7-11 breakfast biscuit you can pick up instead. Sad news indeed. In a nut shell the restaurant is being divorced from the hotel. Apparently for cost savings benefits the hotel wants to cut ties from the restaurant and lease the operation instead. The executive chef was let go and many other positions in the hotel as well. 2. Lodgnet. Like your cable TV? Like many other chains, this Hilton has gone to a private network that runs their own repeating commercials to offset their TV service costs. If you stay a couple of nights you probably won't care. But if you are the longer stay business traveler and you like to leave the TV on you'll get the same repeated 5-10 commercials that over time get to be annoyingly repetitive. OK that's the good and the bad changes but there is still good news: For the most part from a guest's standpoint most the staff members that have made this hotel great are still around despite the management changes. The front desk manager Sandip Bojani, the breakfast waiter Dan, the name evening bartenders and valet attendants I have gotten to know over the years are still around.

My travel companions were on the 8th and 4th floor and all had similar rooms size wise, except for the 4th floor room which was smaller. The room was neat and well cleaned, plenty of amenities in the bathroom, and the empty fridge provided was convinient. No mini bar though, which didn't matter to us. The beds and pillows were very comfy. If I had to complain about something it would be that some more shelf space and hangers in the bathroom would have been nice (there is space enough). If you are a very light sleaper you might be disturbed by the street noices, but for me the view made up for that - I'm sure that had our room faced in a different direction there would have been less noice (not that it was that much at all!). The staff was all very friendly and accommodating. We sat down in the restaurant twice, for a light dinner and for drinks, and found it quite nice. One of my favourite restaurants in Boston, Umbria Prime, is just around the corner, as are plenty of other restaurants in the Quincy market area. At the end of the street, around the corner (towards Atlantic avenue) is a breakfast place which I can't remember the name of....Good coffee, smoothies, bagles and all sorts of pastries to take or eat in. Didn't try the hotel breakfast. The location is excellent for a stroll through Quincy Market, the harbor side (and Aquarium) and for the shops on Washington Street. I always describe Boston to those who haven't been that most places are within walking distance.

As long as the weather is fine and you are not in too much of a hurry I strontly recommend going on foot, and if not there is always a taxi close by (if you don't fancy the subway, which I have to admit is not as easily comprehendible as f.ex. the metro in Paris).

We had to wait each time we arrived at the hotel just to give the attendent our key, even though the second time we were the only ones there. Getting our car out was much easier, always there when they said it would be ready but still had to find the attendent so we could get key from him. When we first arrived at the hotel our room was not quite ready, even though it was after the standard 3pm check in time. We only had to wait about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad. We had reserved a bedroom suite for 2 adults and 4 children. Because of the wait, staff offered us free use of a rollaway bed, which was very helpful. Concierge was helpful, although when I asked if she could print some tickets for me, she said she could - she ordered them for me and printed them for the Duckboat tours. However, she neglected to tell me about the $12 service charge for ordering online (not her fault, the charge was from the Duckboat - but it was only a 4 minute walk; we could have saved the $12 just by walking to where the tour started and purchasing our tickets there. - Live and Learn, I guess.) Suite was adequate, plenty of space. Pretty clean. Minor inconveniences - never had bath towels for 6 people except for the first night because I requested them before we came but reallly, if you are reserving a room for 6 people, 6 towels should be a given. Also, ran out of toilet paper more than once. (This is always a problem with 6 people so believe it or not, we always pack some in our suitcase. Just didn't expect it to happen at a Hilton!) Also, was told we had a mini fridge so I brought along pop & juice boxes, string cheese, fruit for the kids. Actually, there is no fridge so, just any empty mini bar which keeps things cool, not cold and was extremely small. We had to use a cooler for the 5 days we were there. Our room was very close to the ice machine, but it was still an inconvenience to empty the water and refill with ice for 5 days. I don't want this to sound like we were completely unhappy. We weren't. The room was pricey, plus valet parking, + $50 in misc. taxes. Basically, our room cost us $400/night - with NO free breakfast, NO free internet, and no pool for the kids (which we did know in advance). There were only a handful of television channels, which is ok for adults, but very hard with children. The Hilton does offer the Nickelodeon channel, but in the evening it becomes Nick at Night. I do NOT let my children watch George Lopez, so they were stuck with Sports Center. Without children I would have given this Hilton a rating of 4 (5 if it was just based on location) but I was very disappointed in this hotel for familes. As other reviewers have stated, the beds are phenomenal. The tvs are old & the reception is fuzzy. The sleeper sofa has seen better days. Not comfortable to sleep on and cushions were fraying quite a bit. Front desk staff was pleasant, although a bit stuffy. Concierge was very friendly and helpful. Eddie the bellboy was fantastic. Valet parking staff, ok. Overall, I would stay here again if the price were right (with free internet) and without children. If I were to bring my family again, I would look into some of the other hotels in the Financial District. I HIGHLY recommend staying in the Financial District even though it is a bit pricier.

The Hotel is located just in the right place to explore Boston, 5 minutes walk from Long Wharf, Quincy market and the hub of activity around the harbour and just over 10 minutes from Boston Common in the other direction. It is also 5 to 10 mins to get to a T station depending upon which line you want. Downtown crossing saves you changing and takes about 10 mins, but the local station is just 5 mins away. You can walk to Prudential Centre and Copley and this is about 15 to 20 min stroll, manageable, depending on the weather! The hotel itself is in the financial district so at the weekend the local streets are like an empty morgue, which is great from a no noise perspective. The side of the hotel we stayed on had no bars or restaurants so it was really quiet. Other reviews have mentioned the area as noisy, but we heard absolutely nothing, whether this was due to which side you are on I am not sure, but there was no street or traffic noise and we were on one of the lowest floor (4th). Great lifts, lots of them and super fast, never had to wait for than a few seconds for a lift and 1st to 4th floor took a blink of an eye. Staff were friendly and welcoming and check in was swift. Checkout was also instant as the bill was spot on.

Maid service was a bit hit and miss, for 3 of the 5 days and on arrival it was brilliant, 2 days it came very late (4.30 to 5.30 in the afternoon) and after a day out you just want to relax not move around a cleaner and whether is was due to us being there it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a full job, no topping up of the tea and coffee, no face cloths left etc. We did ring down re the face cloths to get some, they apologised and said some would be sent up to the room, they never did arrive, so we gave up. Breakfast (continental) was included and was fairly good range of cereal, fruit, yogurt and bagels/ toast etc. Strangely on weekends (and 4th July) all guests also had access to hot food such a sausages, eggs and bacon for free, but on weekdays they moved the dishes to a different room and charged? All a bit odd, even Holiday Inn Express gives a hot breakfast for free now, seemed a bit penny pinching to charge $5 on weekdays and nothing at the weekend. On the note of strange things, the waiting staff in the restaurant were dressed really oddly. Everyone wore jeans, not smart neat ones but baggy, scruffy looking ones, just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look right. It must have been sanctioned / planned as everyday, all the waiters wore them. It made no difference to the service which was fine, it just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look right to see waiters in scruffy denim jeans in a 4 / 5 star hotel. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try room service, but menu looked reasonable, surcharges were excessive though, with service (18%) and tray charge ($5) added by default. Overall, a great location, not cheap but good value, big rooms, nice staff. On the negative, maid service a bit unpredictable, requests not always fulfilled and scruffy waiters (minor down points really on what is a good hotel).", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Housatonic, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cKeep coming back to this fine Hotel, can't get enough of it...\u201d", "Author": "bubba6240", "ReviewID": "UR115104567", "Content": "Make sure to stay the Weekend.

From the moment we arrived, they took such good care of us. We arrived Saturday night on the July 4th holiday weekend. Just as we pulled up to the valet, our car started to overheat. Immediately the valets offered to help us with the car and figure out the issue. As they helped us unload our luggage, they told us they would let the car sit before trying to move it (we decided it was too late to AAA and deal with the car that night). We headed to the front desk to check in and were in our room in less than five minutes. A little while later, we got a call from the valet who wanted us to take a look at the car before they moved it just to be sure wouldn't cause any additional damage. In the meantime we ordered room service. For $19.50 you get bread, a salad and steak and fries. We all agreed that the steak was some of the best we'd ever had! In the morning, the valets stayed with my mother as she waited for the AAA tow truck to show up. We had no issue extending our check out time to deal with the car. We ate breakfast in the restaurant downstairs and the staff was very friendly and prompt. The buffet was a bit pricey ($22/pp). After discovering that we needed to spend another night in town (not our original plan), we were given an even bigger room at the same rate as the previous, all without me even asking.

I was fortunate to have a corner room on the 9th floor which afforded more space and more natural light. I especially liked the bed headboard that had built-in overhead lights to make the room and bed bright and inviting. The bed was comfortable and had adequate lighting on the night stand. The room, due to its size, could have used another floor lamp but I was ok with the lighting as is. The desk area sufficient but made of a marble material so it was cold to the touch (wood would be better). There was sufficient lighting on the desk to do work. The TV was a nice flatscreen. There was also a coffee machine that worked well and made a decent cup of coffee. The bathroom was typical Hilton: adequate and functional, pleasant but not luxurious. The towels were thick and had an above-average quality feel. There were Crabtree & Evelyn amenities on the counter that I like, including shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, mouthwash, shower cap, and sewing kit.

You will notice that they have bottled water in your room that cost $5.50 apiece -- a rip-off, so, don't drink them, obviously. However, you will notice a week later that you've been charged $11 extra on your credit card for the waters, even if you never touched them. It would be one thing if this happened once; however, it has happened to me several times. They are clearly desperate for $$$ and are hoping that business travelers won't notice extra charges on their bills. Other things: charging people $15 for internet service is a rip-off in a full-service corporate hotel. There is no free internet downstairs, as there is in most corporate hotels on the east coast; if you ask, they will act like you are trying to steal something from them. The restaurant for dinner is terrible and overpriced. Breakfast is OK, but ridiculously overpriced. The rooms are dingy. I have stayed at this hotel several times a year for more than a decade. It has gone horribly downhill since they changed from Wyndham to Hilton, maybe five years ago. The problem is that the Hilton (corporation) has far too much debt; to pay the debt, they've got to cut back on services to customers, really to a laughable extent -- i.e., they've actually removed flat-screen TVs and brought back the old kind! You're better off at the Marriott or at some of the newer hotels in Boston, even if they don't have the best location.

The Internet access was hideously expensive, but I encountered that a lot on my trip, the only exception being an awful hotel in Queens that I wouldn't ever stay in again!

Positives: - Biggest plus is location, location, location. In some cities, you'd worry that a hotel in the \"financial district\" would be in a ghost town on evenings and wekeends, but quite the contrary here, there was a lot of life and people and things going on long after the nearby office towers emptied out. There are a number of restaurants and pubs nearby (literally a half dozen Irish places within 2 minutes of the front door). North/South/Quincy markets. Aquarium, \"Freedom Walk\", the Big Dig greenway, and other touristy stuff is just a few minutes' walk away. - \"T\" (Subway) station (Aquarium station) is a 3-minute walk . . . and is just a two-stop ride from Logan Airport staion. - Bedding and towels were crisp and white - Bed was extremely comfortable - Room was very clean - Ample bathroom amenities were provided - Room was fairly quiet by the standards of central city hotels. - Not a lot of kids stay here; it seems to be a hotel for grown-ups. Negatives: - The hotel is an older one, elevators seemed a bit clunky. - Television set came straight out of 1990; not much channel selection; channel labels were incorrect. - WIndows in the room did not open. Both Positive and Negative: - The fitness center is in a somewhat musty basement . . . but the equipment was very good. Frankly, if the weather is conducive to it, opt for a run outside along the waterfront instead . . but do it in the morning before the waterfront walkways get too crowded with tourists. Advice: - Avoid the outrageous $14.95/day Internet charge by walking about 75 yards to the nearby Panera Bread Company, whcih has free wireless (open 6 AM to 8 PM weekdays, 8 AM to 7 PM weekends). And while you are there for your morning email check, eat there too, thus avoiding outrageously-priced hotel breakfast food. - Don't even think about renting a car if you stay here. You can get to virtually all major Boston tourist attractions quickly, easily, and cheaply by subway, bus, ferry, and foot. And the \"T\" blue line is the best way to/from the airport ($2 subway vs. $20 taxi, your choice). - If you venture out for a walk, have a good map with you; it is easy to get lost in the maze of Boston's Financial District with its crooked, narrow seats that are not at all directionally-aligned.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "A Citizen of the Globe", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here.

Needless to say, my Hilton honor's status may have gotten me on a \"honors\" floor but the room was less than desirable with no view, especially for $300 a night.

They came with nothing and when we called we were told that \"most guests like the drinks black\". If that is the case, why describe the drink differently on the menu. They then sent up a pitcher of regular cream and a strawberry on a plate. This all would have been OK to ignore, however, on the second day we left our room at nine AM for some sightseeing. We made sure to take the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign off the door. When we returned to freshen up at 1 PM the room had not been cleaned. That was fine as the staff were cleaning an adjoining room.

Review is based on a five night stay in June\u00e2\u20ac\u212209 (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe) Location: Walking distance to subway & underground streetcar (Green Line), waterfront and Faneuil Hall, i.e. good location for doing almost anything. A number of restaurants & bars (especially Irish bars) just nearby. Room: As HHonors Diamond member I was upgraded to a corner suite in 11th floor. Suite upgrades are generally rare so was pleasantly surprised to get it. Welcome package included two bottles of water and a small selection of fruits. Frankly when stepping in the first time I thought I was in the 70s Show\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m no fan of \u00c3\u00bcber-modern minimalistic boutique hotel style but this one was pretty much on the other side of the scale, i.e. very traditional with shades of beige and brown, regular \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tube TV\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd etc. Nothing wrong as such but if you are looking for something modern then this is not your place. Though after spending five days there it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that bad anymore :-) Suite was certainly big enough, especially the sleeping room. Living room had a small kitchenette, couch and table with four chairs. Not much of a view from either side of the room (though in downtown hotel you cannot expect much). No safe in the room, unfortunately. Suite (as rest of the hotel) was very clean and well kept. Noise from the street was quite clearly heard even in 11th floor, so beware of garbage truck arriving at 5am! Service: One could expect a lot from AAA Four Diamond hotel. I have to say my expectations were not fulfilled, nothing to complain about but nothing exceptional either. Maybe as European I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the rules of tipping game well enough? Etc: Lobby is quite small, can be get crowed. Breakfast was OK but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen also better breakfasts in some other Hiltons. I.e. not too bad but nothing luxurious as such either. 7 day internet access for $50 worked very well, no problems whatsoever and connection was fast, too.

(Dragging hubby with me is sort of selfish - it makes the business trip go easier for me) :) What a gorgeous hotel! We stayed at the Hilton Boston Financial District, and being a Hilton Honors member, we received complimentary breakfast coupons for the two days we were there. That was a nice touch. Check-in was mostly hassle-free, though our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we had to wait about an hour and a half. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant CaliTerra to kill time, which ended up being a really nice treat. I had a personal pizza for lunch, while my husband had a grilled turkey panini that he enjoyed. Upon checking in, the room was immaculate. Gorgeous furnishings, impressively-made bed (I love the Hilton Heavenly beds), beautiful bathroom fixtures/decor; this hotel was beautiful all the way around. There was the bed, a nice sitting area with a TV/armoire, and a comfortable chair and desk. Housekeeping offered turn-down service. They freshened your room as well. That's a great touch, to be honest! To see the bed (which is inviting anyway) dressed for you to snuggle deep into the down comforter with the cold weather howling outside ... it's almost irresistible... Room service was actually the best I've had in a hotel anywhere. I had a fantastic spinach tortellini in a cheese sauce, while my husband had a frou-frou pizza, and we split a caesar salad. \"Frankie the Yankie\" delivered our food and was so funny to chat with. The kitchen was actually quick to deliver our meal, I was pleasantly surprised. The workout room was beautifully equipped, though the equipment needed a good cleaning. There were three Precor brand treadmills, two Precor brand elliptical runners, and two recumbent-style Precor brand bikes. Each had an entertainment system with headphones so you could either listen to music or watch TV while you worked out. There were also some free weights and a few pieces of universal-style gym equipment. Unfortunately, there was virtually no room to stretch on the floor or do yoga, though there was a yoga mat. There was also no water within the gym; you had to step out of the gym (take your room key with you) to drink from the water fountain outside the gym. The hotel was located a few blocks from the State Street T, so it was a short walk away, though dragging your suitcase through downtown Boston was tough, with the crappy ruddy narrow sidewalks. The State Street T can take you virtually anywhere you need to go so the location was great.

Easy walk to Fanuel Hall, the water front, the North End, the Freedom Trail and the subway. Check-in was convenient. Even though the front desk staff was proficient, it felt insincere. If I spoke Spanish they may have been more personable. They were efficient and polite just enough so you really couldn't complain but you didn't walk away feeling you were a welcome guest either. I am a Hilton Honors Silver member. I asked if that meant anything and it didn't because she didn't offer anything. I asked at the HIlton Boston Airport and got a free upgrade even though I didn't qualify. The hotel room was spacious, the beds very comfortable and the linens nice. If you left the hot water running too long in the shower, the mold on the grout would flake off. Hardly any of the ice machines worked, I had to travel several floors before finding one. The maid staff new there was no ice but obviously didn't report it to management. The A/C was practically non-existent. We called the front desk at 9:00PM to ask for an engineer but one never showed up. The front desk did call and inquire but that was the last of any front desk assistance. We saw the engineer on the elevator in the morning and asked him to check it. The only way we knew he had been there was the thermostat was lower than we left it. In order to use the elevators above floor 4, you need to slide your card. This was not explained at the desk. This hotel was popular with tour buses. Every night, I would find older couples trying to figure out how to get off on their floor. Luckily they were British and Irish and we could communicate. A good example of the lack of customer service. We left a flyer on the door for breakfast the next morning. My traveling companion didn't put the room number on it. The person collecting the cards obviously didn't check for that information. It was that lack of attention that makes this hotel just okay. Luckily we got a corporate rate of $209 a night. If I had paid more, I would have been very disappointed. Even though the hotel was in a great location, I won't return. The service was just mediocre and left me feeling like just another paying customer. If you didn't ask for a service it wasn't offered and if you didn't report a problem, it wasn't addressed.

We were in Boston to attend a family wedding and had a total of 8 rooms between 14 people which were conveniently all located on the same floor. Really liked the hotel, the room and bathroom were spacious, clean and well kept. As others have noted room size is really pot luck, we had a pretty decent double room, however my brother who was staying on his own had a room about twice as large as ours! In any case our room size was perfectly adequate for our needs. Beds were large and comfortable and there was a lovely selection of toiletries in the bathroom. Our room was kept clean and well tided and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Some of my family who were flying back to Ireland on 31 Dec asked for and were given a late checkout free of charge. Location is pretty quiet but there are still a number of restaurants closeby and you can either walk or take a short taxi journey to all sights. There were a couple of irritations during our stay. The water in the rooms cost a hefty $4.50 per bottle. Arriving off a long flight from Germany we didn't have much opportunity to go out and buy cheaper water, so ending up paying $9 for approx. 1 litre of water! In saying that the next evening when we got back to our room, we'd been given a couple of bottles of complimentary water, which was a nice gesture. My fiance was keen to check his emails whilst we were there. The hotel was advertising a rate of $9.99 for 24 hours in-room internet access via the TV (there was a keyboard attached). On signing up for this however it didn't work and when we rang the concierge they informed us that it was unavailable and that we should use the internet in the Business Center at a rate of $10 for 10 mins (which we didn't)!

My husband and I just came back from enjoying two days there relaxing over New Year's, and there were positives. Our room was clean and large by city standards, but I agree with earlier posts that size of room is completely luck of the draw based on what I saw on the floor diagram. The bed was very comfortable, and the location of the hotel was great for being out and about in the city for First Night -- close enough to get there fast but far enough away to avoid the worst of the noise. The staff was great -- helpful and courteous, though we were disappointed that our request for an upper-floor room was not duly noted until we pointed it out, and then we were only put on floor 9 (of a 15 floor hotel). Our room maid was wonderful, however. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fabulous -- a really good buffet though it was part of a package for us. Not cheap if you have to pay separately, but worth it. And that brings me to the negatives. The hotel nickels and dimes you with charges for things that in other hotels might be part of the high rate charged. Wireless internet is on a per-day charge, and if you instead decide that you'll just use the hotel's \"Business Center,\" be prepared to pay a minimum of a $10 charge then $1 per minute after 10 minutes. This seemed ludicrous to us who just wanted to check our e-mail. The bottles of water in the room were available for a mere $4.50 each (we bought some of our own nearby for a lot less), and a $80 charge for dinner in the hotel bar when we only had a few drinks and two light entrees seemed really high, even by hotel restaurant standards. In general, it seemed that the four-star rating was not really warranted given how many of the little extras one expects at four-star locales involved extra charges here. In addition, there were some aging issues -- the sheet that had a hole along the edge where it was folded over on our bed; the scratchy towels that were too old to still be soft and fluffy; the slightly worn wood on the furniture like the arm chair and entertainment center. The room was also quite noisy, in part due to the expected city sounds, but also due to how easily we could here our loud neighbors across the hall as they came and went. It was not a bad experience -- in fact, we were quite happy when all was said and done.

We once again called the front desk (they seemed clueless) and were told they'd have another set of keys brought to us which didn't make sense at all. We decided to go down to the front desk and take care of it. We found two staff that both were trying to work on our problem at the same time but the other didn't know it. They ended up getting into a discussion about it right in front of us. We overheard them say another staff member had booked someone else in our room for two nights.

I don't know how the housekeepers change the linens, which, by the way were very nice. The room appeared to be freshly painted, we had no problem with the carpet BUT the furniture looked like it came from a hotel surplus warehouse. On the third night, we rounded the little desk downstairs to find a note on the ONE elevator that it was out of service. It hadn't occurred to me when I booked the property to ask how many elevators the hotel had. We hiked up nine, well-lit flights of stairs, grateful that my 8-months-pregnant daughter was not with us! The next morning, the door to the stairwell started slamming open and closed very early giving us the clue the elevator had not been repaired. Two very courteous bellmen helped us down to the lobby that morning. The same gentleman who was manning the desk the night before was still there, and holding up well, actually. He'd already removed the third night's taxes and fees, about $40, from the bill, a fair adjustment. Would I stay at the Bullfinch in Boston again? No. It's on the fringe of a neighborhood that is being renovated, but it's not terribly desirable yet. I've never, in Europe or NYC or anywhere, stayed in a room that was as small as ours was.

Both rooms according to the floor map on the back of the door were the smallest available on both floors. The rooms were nicely furnished and the beds comfortable. And, the bolsters from the beds work well to block the light coming from under the door to the hallway... Room 1103 had a couple of plumbing problems: the sink's cold water spigot leaked when off (a towel kept that from being too irritating), and the shower drain did not stay in the open position unless you either used a foot to push it down while showering (very precarious), or used the weight of a wet washcloth to hold it down (worked best!). Since the room wasn't flooding, and I could handle staying one more night with the inconvenience, I reported it to the front desk. They offered to change my room, but were otherwise not too concerned. I have a feeling that it won't be attended to until a guest becomes irate.

We felt safe walking around the hotel at all hours of the day and night with lots of people around at all times, no sketchy types seen in the area at all. The hotel is an easy 5-10 minute walk to Quincy Market, many of the Freedom Trail sites,and the waterfront/aquarium. The North End was a pretty easy 15 minute walk, safe at night. The area seemed to have a pretty hoppin' nightlife. There was a cute pub, Mr. Dooley's right next door but we were always too tired to go in on our way home. It was busy every night. There are no restaurants in the area open for breakfast on weekends except the hotel restaurants. There was a Starbucks and a Dunkin' Donuts close by, though. The bar was open late. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant Sunday morning. The buffet was standard fare so we ate off the menu, also standard fare except I had a fantastic egg white and fresh vegie omelet. The coffee was fine. The service was quite good.

When we opened the door there were two people inside (!) The room's previous night's occupants had arranged to switch to a different room (not a good sign) and had asked that their luggage be moved from their old room--now our room--to their new room, but no one had done it (another not-so-good-sign). They were very apologetic, they left right away, and they hadn't touched anything in the room, as they had only come back to fetch their luggage. But, a smoky-smelling room with people inside was a big bummer, especially after an already disappointing start. PROS: It was a clean and very nice room, with lots of big windows, awesome beds & linens, lovely toiletries, and almost everything in the room was newly refurbished. The bathroom was nicely redone, but the sink stopper didn't work and at one point later in the day there was no hot water. Everything else about this hotel was excellent. Very good location if you want to be near Fanueil Hall, Aquarium, etc. Staff was courteous, professional, friendly and helpful. The little disappointments did not take much away from an overall great experience. Side note: As a frequent Priceline customer, every now and then I get a sneaky suspicion that I'm being treated like a 2nd class citizen (although our good experiences outweigh the not-so-good).

We booked the Hilton Financial District through Priceline for $100 a night. We got to the hotel around 1:30pm, after a 4 hour trip from New York, and was politely told by the front desk, that no room was available yet, because they were booked last night. So we had to come back at 3pm, which was to be expected, if it wasn't for the fact that when we did make it back to the hotel at around 3:15pm, there was a 30 min. wait in line to check in! And they had four staff working at the desk. I am not quite sure what kind of issues people were having because our check in literally took less than five minute. Once we got the key cards, and get into the room, we could not believe how tiny the room was! We arranged for a room with two double beds. There was barely enough room to leave the luggage on the floor. Nevermind that there was no desk, or a couch. We brought lunch back to the hotel, and had to eat at the wide sill, since that was the only solution without having to eat on the bathroom vanity. The same evening, we discovered that there was no hot water in the building, and when we called the front desk, we were told that they had no idea when it might come back on. Eventually later that night, the hot water came back on, but it was off again the next morning. Also if I had known better I wouldn't have bidded on the Downtown Boston area, because during the weekend, it's a ghost town, luckily it's walkable to Quincy Market.

I made the reservation directly through the Wyndham website and become a member of \"Wyndham by request\" which gave me certain perks such as a snack and drink on arrival, free internet, free local calls and long distance calls, plus 500 frequent flyer miles. I booked the room as a DELUXE two bed room, 460 square feet.......Well, when we arrived, if not for a very nice person from Boston to help us out, we wouldn't have found the hotel because it was now a HILTON. I was never notified in anyway of such a change. We were first given a room so tiny that you could barely squeeze past the 2 double beds. THIS WAS NOT A 460 square foot room! We had a family of 5!! This was all stated on my reservation confirmation print-out which luckily I had with us. The front desk argued with us in giving us a larger room and stated that there would be an extra $75 charge per night for the larger room. We argued right back and were willing to go to the room and measure it to see that it indeed was NOT 460 square feet---we estimated it at being approximately 250 square feet and that's being generous. We could never get a roll away bed in there for our third child. FINALLY, after the front desk person belittled me a bit by saying that 'most people--98%, who are not in the travel industry do not know how to book rooms properly over the internet and this was bascially my fault', we were given a suite which had plenty of room for our family at no additional charge. Also, we were NOT given the \"perks\" I mentioned earlier. This was not the greatest way to start out our visit to Boston and I personally will not stay at a Hilton ever again.

Location, location, location - the Wyndham is located in the financial district and just a couple of blocks from Quincy Market, The New England Aquarium & IMAX theater, Long Wharf Cruises, etc... We even walked to the North End, Chinatown and the Government Center - about a ten minute walk to each - Boston truly is a walking city and a cab was not necessary during our trip. We paid the Government rate of $165 a night for a King Deluxe Non Smoking Room and found that price to be an exceptional value for the quality of room and location to sights. If you are driving into the city and won't need your car, you can save some money on weekend nights by parking two blocks down in the Post Office Square Parking Garage, enter from either Congress or Pearl Streets. The cost to valet park at the hotel was $38 per night, we parked at the Post Office Square Garage for $50 for 3 nights ($32 on Friday and $9 Sat and Sunday) - a savings of $64 plus taxes and tips.

Poor signage, windy roads, tunnels, one-ways & pedestrians darting into the street made me a little on-edge. On to the hotel... Here's what I liked about the hotel: 1. Location is great.

The dinner and service from catering was also above average. A few things I didn't like about the hotel which I see others wrote about are: 1. Dark, dingy rooms. I stayed in 1034. I didn't mind the view was a brick wall but as a result it received very little natural light. I little difficult to get good lighting to see anything. 2. Housekeeping.

I went for lunch, visited with some friends and came back at 4:00pm to grab my walking map. The room had not been cleaned. I came back to change for dinner at 6:00pm to find my room 'cleaned'. He/She flipped the covers back over the bed and (OF COARSE) took the $10 tip and the pad with 'Thank You' written on it. I couldn't believe it! It made me wonder if the sheets had been changed before my arrival??? The ironing board was left out (I took it out to iron a shirt) and the towels in the bathroom were left on the floor. So much for tipping the housekeeping staff for good service. Perhaps the reason for a dark dingy room? I mentioned the problem to the front desk person on check out. He advised me that I needed to fill out a customer satisfaction card. I said I'm telling him for the hotel's benefit not so I can vent/complain. He again, politely, urged me to fill in the card.

As the other reviews on this website suggested, by joining Wyndham-by-Request, I got a fantastic last-minute rate (nearly a 60% discount to all comparable hotels). Being unfamiliar with the roads in Boston, it was difficult to locate the hotel (even my GPS was confused by all the road closures). The valet parking was expensive ($36 per night), and it took a LONG time to retrieve my car- apparently the garage is 4 blocks away. For seeing the city by foot/taxi, the location is wonderful, as it is a 3-min walk to Quincy Market and also to the waterfront (where the bus tours start from). Inside the hotel, it is clean and very quiet (this is not the place to be if you want bustling action). The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. Beware of the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant- it was arguably the worst I've ever had. The hotel room was extremely spacious and clean, but slightly barren with very little natural sunlight. The amenities were great (bathrobes, coffee, iron, bath products, Internet, cordless phone, Aeron, etc). I called to confirm a late checkout on the morning of my departure, but I was denied because it was apparently first-come-first-serve and I asked too late -- even though I specifically requested this when I made my booking.

The Financial District is a bit quiet on the weekends and all of the little deli's closed up on Friday afternoon so be aware of that if you just want a quick sandwich. Faneuil Hall is 2 blocks away though and there are quite a few bars and restaurants within a block or two. The Wyndham service was good but you do pay for them to book you a tour for instance - $2.50 a ticket for a service fee? They also did not tell you they were charging you for the service fee, so be aware if you are booking multiple trips. Go to Faneiul Hall to book these things - they don't charge a cent. No vending machines for soda in the hotel - you have to get room service, which of course is expensive. Martini's in the lobby bar were $13 - although it was very good. I signed up for the Wyndham by Request and did get a welcome snack and the other small things but they would not honor the free breakfast buffet without the internet coupon, which was disappointing because the buffet is $16.50 a person - we did not get the buffet but got breakfast at Caliterra and it was very good.

I called the front desk about it and they said to bring it to them. When we did, they put it in an envelope and wrote our room number on it. The next day, we arrived back at the hotel just as the maid was finishing up in our suite. Again, I noticed she didn't take the tip so I handed it to her.

We arrived before check-in time so they held our bags and wished us a wonderful day. The staff was quick to provide us with walking or driving instructions that were easy to understand and everyone was very pleasant. We had only two complaints. The weather had turned sharply colder that day and we returned to a freezing hotel room. They were having an AC problem and couldn't warm the building up so they sent up extra blankets that were toasty warm. My other complaint is that if you are a small eater or have children look elsewhere for breakfast as it is very expensive here. My daughters loved their waffles and stuffed french toast but the buffet was very small for the price. This was our most expensive meal of the trip and we ate at nice resturants all week. This hotel is a bit trickey to get too since it is in the middle of the massive road work going on but arriving on a Sunday helped with the traffic situation. But it's location is wonderful for sightseeing since it is 3 blocks from Fanuiel Hall and the Aquarium.

It was easy to walk to and from the T station and the neighborhood was safe and well lit. Everything went really smooth at this hotel. We prepaid and booked our rooms early. No hassles or mistakes at check in or check out. It couldn't have gone smoother. I joined the Wyndham By Request club prior to going and had extra towels and snacks in the room when we checked in. We also got the use the late checkout because we had joined their club (it was free to join). The elevators were quick and there were plenty of them. The room itself was huge. We had a standard room with 2 double beds. We were in a corner room so maybe it was bigger than most but we had so much room. You could have easily fit 2 additional double beds in our room and still had room to walk around. The bathroom was big and clean. Free newspaper every morning is left outside your door. The front desk people were very helpful - when I asked about buying a 3-day subway pass, they asked me if we were really going to use the subway that much. They explained the price and asked if we were going to be walking alot or really using the subway. Turned out, it was much cheaper for us to pay as we went and not buy the pass, because we did so much walking! Cons: No in-room safe, not enough drawers to store clothes. The room probably seemed so big because there was no storage in the room. Parking at the hotel is really expensive. There seemed to only be one valet and when we got there, we waited out front for about 5 minutes and no one was around. It was pretty fortunate because we ended up parking a few blocks away at a public lot for less than the hotel was going to charge us - and we had full access to our car anytime we wanted it. We didn't use the room service - with so many bars and pubs and the market nearby, we didn't want to eat at the hotel. Overall, this was a very nice hotel. I would stay there again if I could get the same deal I got this time (by pre-paying and booking in advance).

We booked this hotel because of the many good reviews, but unfortunatelly we were not so lucky. Maybe we should have signed up for the \"By Request programm\". We arrived around midnight, the Valet Parking person came to our car and told us in a very unfriendly way that the parking is $36 per day and that we have no other choice. We knew about the Post Office parking someone suggested here, but at that time of the day we just didn\u00c2\u00b4t want to go there. So we agreed to the valet parking. There was no staff helping with our luggage and we felt rushed by the valet parking guy to get our stuff out of the car, so that he can park the car. Front desk was OK, but again no help with our luggage on the way up to our room. The room ($ 178.00 plus taxes) was very small and dark, our bed was not comfortable at all, mattress was not firm and none of the 6 pillows was good. The view (11th floor) was not nice and we heard the noise of the aircondition vents all night. The bathroom was very small, too. The good thing about this tiny room was, that it was very well maintained and clean and after all, we only were in there at night, so we did not ask for another room. The hotel restaurant is OK. We had breakfast there every day since the places around the hotel are closed over the weekend. We ordered from the menu and food was great, buffet looked good, too, very friendly waiter. We had dinner there once. The food was good, but the waiter we had almost ruined our evening. He had an attitude and is in need of further training I believe. We noticed that other guests served by this waiter were not happy as well. Over all, this is a good hotel and the location is close to many sights. Maybe our expectations were a little bit high from all the nice reviews and it somewhat depends on the people who work there at the time of your stay.

The Hotel has an old Boston look and feel but rooms blend in modern amenities. Small front desk, check in went smooth. Bell hops and cabs waiting for you at the door. My first impression was the room was small. The comfortable king bed seemed to take up half the room. This hotel was built well before the age of mega suite hotels, and it wasn't bad at all. Everything is nicely renovated, I believe recently. Wyndham by Request had a bottle of beer on ice, snack, extra feather pillows, room on a high floor that I could smoke in, that was away from the elevators, and a local newspaper (even the $2.50 Sunday Globe)..all exactly as I selected on their web site, and all free. The work desk was decent and functional and the ergo chair is just like you have at most offices. Wireless phone and ethernet on desk. Free phone calls, high speed internet, bottled water and coffee, nice. Contrary to one review, the rooms do have drawers to put your clothes in! You can also open up a window if you like and hear the city (it's quiet on the weekends though). No in room safe, in the basic room at least. It's good that the elevator won't let you punch a floor without putting in your key first. The view was of historic buildings in front of a modern skyscraper, as well as the harbor where you could see boats and Logan airport. Room service has good food and is prompt. Make sure you're ready to open the door 5 minutes after you order breakfast! Maid service does a nice job, refreshes everything. I think you must hang the \"service room\" tag on the knob or they won't come in. Bathroom has nice marble tile and strong shower head, big clean tub. I went to the restaurant on site, Caliterra, and just had something at the bar since the restaurant is closed after breakfast till dinner. It was the best \"bar\" food around and a good indicator of what a dinner must be like. They give you a \"mystery\" discount envelope to the restaurant upon checkin that is good for anywhere from 10 to 100 percent off a meal. Concierge has a map and will hand draw you directions to get started. You can walk to many pubs and restuarants VERY easily and safely. Fanuel Hall marketplace nearby has nice restaurants that do seafood in a Boston way. Go to McCormick & Schmick's and order a 1.25 lb lobster and a bowl of clam chowder and you'll know what I mean. Tour boothes all over the marketplace for duck boat, big harbor boats, trolleys, etc. The aquarium is near, look for the rockhopper penquins, sea lions and a 60 year old sea turtle. The area is also great for young singles on Fri and Sat nights. The Freedom trail is kind of long. If you get tired just make it to the next location and a cab might be around to bail out. The hotel and Fanuel Hall are at its mid point. Bunker Hill at the end was very interesting and you can climb up the monument, which looks like the Washington monument in DC, but much smaller. Just a fairly important note about Beantown weather, good luck! I went when it was a classic Boston hazy, hot and opressively humid weekend. Even if you're from the deep South you will hate it. The hotel a/c isn't powerful. They do get cold fronts, so if your stay is long enough one will blow through and it will be beautiful after.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire, England", "Title": "\u201cThe Wyndham was great!\u201d", "Author": "MrsP", "ReviewID": "UR3528816", "Content": "We just got back from a three night stay in Boston.

We were able to check-in at 10:30am when we arrived and later in the afternoon received our complimentary snack and drink. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with any questions. The only thing we found that our room did not have were drawers to keep our clothes in, so we had to live out of our suitcases. Other than that, our room was very clean and quiet. Some suggestions for those going for a long weekend trip.... Book the Beantown Trolley Tour. It is the only 2-day tour you can get on and off the trolley at the different stops. Buy your tickets at the Wharf, not the concierge - they only have 1-day passes. We used this as our main transportation for the first two days and we saw basically everything without getting too overwhelmed. Walking the Freedom Trail also helped. If you go to Salem, take the Trolley Tour. This gives you the basic idea of the city and you can get on and off the trolley. You will have to take the train to get to Salem, too. This was very easy and the concierge gave us train times and directions. If you are looking for a few nice dinner restaurants, we loved Legal Seafood (at the Wharf) and Plaza III Kansas City Steakhouse (at Fanueil Hall/South Market). Both were very good. Plaza III is pricey, but well worth the money! Also, if you are going during baseball season, you will have to buy a Red Sox hat, T-shirt, etc. It is all over the city and you will defintely catch the fever! Go to a game, too.

Then my girlfriend wanted a rollaway bed, and they gave it to us for free in the end when the on demand movies went out on us, and we were all set to watch a movie. We wanted our popcorn and drinks too, and they kept saying they had it in their notes that we were only supposed to get the internet rate, and couldn't understand what was going on. I was having a headache explaining it over and over again to at least 5 people. I was getting half the stuff, and not everything. And then they kept saying that I got all these things for free, and I was saying that 'NO, I paid for them, it comes with the package I paid for.\" In the end, we got most of it, or the equivalent. But I do need to mention that the rooms were really nice, and clean, and although there was construction going on outside our window, I didn't hear a thing really, cuz we weren't in the room when they were banging away. And I thought it was pretty well insulated. It had started to snow the first day we were there - we went in mid-Nov. And it was so cool to be on the top floor and see nothing one day, and then see the rooftops filled with snow the next morning. We were SO close to the aquarium and Faneuil, it made it bearable when we were walking with toddlers in the ice. They were so cold, but the walk was only 2-3 blocks, so I can't complain. The food in the restaurant was phenomenal for dinner. I treated myself to a nice dinner, and it was really good. The breakfasts are more costly, so I'm glad it ended up being free. I had heard it was expensive to eat in Boston, but it wasn't any more than other places I've traveled to. OH - special mention! We tried a Legal Sea Foods, on my brother's recommendation, and it was really good too. I saw the line and heard there was a 45 minute wait, and wasn't sure what to do. We didn't know of anyplace close by, and figured on walking somewhere else, then turned back and went in anyhow. The host saw us with the two small kids, freezing and hungry, and I guess he took pity on us, and while he told us we would have to wait at least 45 minutes, he came over within 10 minutes and gave us a corner table in the far back of the restaurant. We gladly took it, it was perfect. It even had extra room in back of us for us to throw all our shopping bags and strollers so they were out of the way of everyone. They must save that table for families. I can't speak more highly of that host, and should have tipped him!! But this is the location right next to the aquarium, and I didn't expect any special courtesies, but they were sure family friendly. they also had great kids menus. Anyhow, sorry I digress.... The hotel was so close to the restaurant though, that if you stay there, and you have a family to feed, that's the place to go that won't break the bank, and had great food, and was convenient and friendly. Hotel staff was overall courteous, and the guys out in front are wonderful, and always got a taxi quickly, and helped us pack our car when we left. Man, they're awesome! They got a tonload of stuff, ice chest, luggage, stroller, all back into a small trunk. Previously, we had to put the stroller in the front, which was not comfortable. I don't know how the guy did it, but boy, we were sure happy when he got it all to fit. We didn't dare open it for any reason other than when my girlfriend dropped me and my daughter off at the airport. I'd definitely go back again. But this time I know not to try and combine packages. I'd just do either the package, or the internet rates. It's probably myfault for the mess, and I gotta admit I was stressing during some of the stay, but I think it was partially my fault. And they did try to make good on everything.

The T was only 2 blocks away (2-3 minute walk) and even without the T it is easy to walk to a host of attractions - we are English so enjoy fresh air and exercise anyway! Plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity. Would definitely recommend the Wyndham as a beautiful hotel, large well appointed guest rooms, friendly, helpful staff - particularly the Conceirge and Reception staff. We were first of all shown to a room which faced a construction site across the road. We were concerned about the construction noise so asked to be moved which was done immediately. Only minor criticism relates to breakfast - a well stocked buffet is available but I would recommend ordering off the menu for freshly cooked hot food. Or even better, go to Pete's Deli next door for a bagle or toasted sandwich and coffee (half the price and just as good especially if you don't feel like a large meal).

We purposely went to Boston to attend a Red Sox game on Sunday afternoon. Since we had been to Boston in May of this year, we wanted to stay somewhere different to get a varied experience. After many hours searching this site and a few others, I choose this hotel mostly based on the reviews, cost and location. After booking the hotel through their website, I did find it cheaper on Expedia only a few hours later. I filled out their request form and within 2 days heard back from them that they would honor the lower price on Expedia and I would get the first night for free. All of this worked out fine and we had no problems. We opted not to rent a car since it's impossible to drive around Boston when you're not familiar, especially with the \"Big Dig\" going on. We hopped in a taxi from the airport ($30.00) and arrived at the hotel before 2:00 p.m. I wasn't sure that our room would be ready, but it was. Not only was the room ready, but because I am a WyndamByRequest member, we were upgraded ever before I asked for an upgrade. Sure, the welcome snacks weren't in the room when we arrived simply because we were there early and the room was upgraded, but they arrived right on time at 3:00 p.m. We were given a one bedroom suite so our son was able to sleep on the sofa bed and we used the large bedroom. Everything was clean. The noise from the construction across the street is not the hotel's fault. We were on the top floor (15th) and it was loud. Early in the morning, too. The hotel gives you a note in the room apologizing for the noise that will start at 7:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m. From my experience, they started around 6:00 a.m. and ended around 5:00 p.m. Long day for those workers. Again, it's not the hotel's fault so I can't justify a complaint about it. Besides, we are early risers and weren't planning on staying in the hotel all day anyway. We did eat in the hotel restaurant one night. It was just OK. Not great. My husband didn't like his entree at all. My son and I had pizza. Not too bad. The waiter was wonderful and the place wasn't crowded at all. We wonder how they stay in business. It was a Saturday night and we were 3 of about 10 people in the entire restaurant. My major problem with this hotel is their location and no pool. Some people may think I'm being over-critical, but sometimes a pool is important. We were in town during the end of Hurricane Charlie and the weather wasn't good at all. A pool in the hotel would have killed a few hours for us between outings and, in this case, we really missed not having one. Also, the location wasn't great and maybe I'm being too critical again. We stayed directly across from Quincy Market during our last stay and that was great. Right in the middle of it all! This hotel is a few blocks from Quincy Market and a few blocks from the Aquarium and a few blocks from the \"T\", etc. It's really a few blocks from almost everything. I like being closer to the sites. All in all, this hotel was average in my opinion. We travel to many different cities in the U.S. and I'm always looking for larger hotels (name brand), amentities, location and price.

I have been a Wyndham by Request member for a fews years. I got not one thing I requested. First off no early check in and they were quite adamant that the room would not be ready until three o'clock period. Check in at three was very busy and the staff was not overly friendly. Proceeded to our suite which was not what we expected. There was a medium sized bedroom (king bed) and a small living space with table,four chairs, sofa (w/bed) and tv cabinet. There was a small kitchen area with a coffee maker, 2 tea bags, 1 decaf coffee, 1 reg coffee, 2 cremoras and one stirrer 2 coffee cups. Remind you there are three adults. We wondered why they even put a dining table in the room as there were no microwave, utensils, nothing. We had bought some treats from the wonderful \"Mike's Bakery\" in the North end and had to eat with our fingers. The ice machine was broken on our floor, however it was repaired in a few hours. We called downstairs for extra towels, cups, glasses and possible utensils, got the first three but no utensils. We then inquired about our complimentary beverage and snack and were told that we would receive it at 6pm. we left for the play @7:15 still nothing and nothing waiting for us on our return at 11pm. Readied ourselves for bed, holes in the pillow cases, dingy looking. Up at the crack of dawn when construction noise woke us . We were on the fifteenth floor and could still hear it. This of course is not the hotel's fault. Off to breakfast..very good buffet. Explained to hostess that our breakfast was included she nodded and we ate and upon leaving we were chased down by a waiter demanding payment. I had to go to the front desk for\"vouchers\" we never received. At the front desk was told we did not have breakfast included but free admission to the aquarium. After a while they said we did have free breakfast but for 2 adults 1 child.

The entire staff was very courteous and helpful. The concierge was invaluable. The three different people working at the concierge desk were all very knowledgeable and gave us several good recommendations for restaurants.

Would have loved to stay at XV Beacon or Nine Zero. Got a little scared, though, when I saw the prices at XV Beacon and how small people said the rooms were at Nine Zero. The Wyndham worked out just great though. I was able to narrow down a rate on Hotwire of $88.00 per night!! This was after finding the next lowest rate of $137 on Wyndham. I did join Wyndham by Request and asked to have the number applied to my Hotwire reservation. I received a lovely e-mail from the Wyhdham by Request manager telling me this would be no problem. And how much she looked forward to meeting us when we checked in. When we checked in, we didn't seem to have the \"personal touch\" that we expected of the front desk staff or food/drink in the room. There was a well stocked mini bar. And when we had a few items from there, the charges did not show up on the bill. So I guess I'm not sure how the program is supposed to work. I thought we'd have things specifically laid out for us. Or that we would have had a note or comment from the front desk. The bartender, Scott, is fabulous. Didn't have a chance to eat in the restaurant. The parking is expensive at $32.00 per night. But we just parked at check-in and walked the town. There is unlimited in and out of the garage, though, when you valet, if you do decide to use your car. Boston is a walking town, though. And the T service is great for getting around. All in all, a great place to stay. Would definitely stay again and recommend it. I want to amend my review posted on February 9. My rating of the Wyndham Boston has improved!! I sent an e-mail to Wyndham ByRequest in response to their survey about our stay. I mentioned that I was confused by what I felt to be inconsistency with the ByRequest program. It turns out that hotels booked on Hotwire do not qualify for ByRequest amentities. I did receive credit for the stay to my account. But the special price I got on Hotwire meant that the ByRequest benefits did not apply. Once again, I received a very nice e-mail from the ByRequest manager explaining this. I will definitely look to the Wyndham for my first choice of lodging on any future trips!!", "Date": "February 9, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Boston Downtown / Financial District", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d94326-Reviews-Hilton_Boston_Downtown_Financial_District-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$92 - $503*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">89 Broad Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02110</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "94326", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ce/6b/1d/lobby-1920s-art-deco.jpg"}}

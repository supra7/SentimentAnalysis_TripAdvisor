We loved the location of this hotel and found it was so convenient to both Pacific Beach as well as the lovely Bay area. We did not use the Spa, but enjoyed the outdoor patio restaraunt as well as the hot tub area. The grounds are lovely, with tropical fish, parrots, and beautiful plants and palms. We rented bikes for a reasonalble rate just down the street, but you can rent right from the hotel. We really enjoyed biking around the beach boardwalk both on the pacific side as well as around the bay. The hotel is kind of far from downtown, we took a cab for one day, but decided to spend most of our time closer to the hotel and enjoy the area there. Close to some good restaraunts along Pacific Beach where you can dine watching the sun set. Other than the dated older rooms this hotel is really nice.

I'd rather be in a 5 start, deluxe hotel but you choose the conference, not the hotel. The prices for a 3 star hotel should be right for the location and the season.

Perhaps the best feature is the location, with Mission Bay behind and Pacific Beach across the street. We opted for a pool-view room and enjoyed the convenience it offered. The atmosphere was so pleasant on the wide upper deck I preferred spending time there instead of the room. The rooms are a bit dated but comfortable and clean, nicely decorated and reasonably roomy. I love the Cat for it's authentic south-Pacific feel and everything that goes with it. The Friday luau is a great time, watercraft and bicycle rentals are conveniently close and the steamboat ride is fun (especially the fireworks tour). When I enter the lobby with it's lush waterfall I can feel the stress of everyday life wash away. It is now a familiar home away from home. One improvement I'd like would be a quick-food option for convenience and budget. However, the restaurant is a great upscale option if time and money are no concern. Parking is an exercise in patience at times but maybe inevitable given the location and popularity with visitors and conferees.

Even when we asked to order something off of a different, not that time of day menu, the food was still delivered fresh & quick. The pool area was clean & well stocked with lounge chairs/towels. In their brochures, it says water is 80 deg, but hmmm, not sure about that. Kids there still enjoyed it. We used the spa a few days too, and it was clean & well stocked. There is a separate whirlpool there for spa guests only if you want something a little quieter than poolside. The couples massage was excellent & well-priced for a spa. Still more expensive than you would find at home, but good for surroundings. Water sport rentals are available too. Prices seemed reasonable, but I don't have anything to compare to.

We arrived for a nice weekend at a resort that we had been to in the past. Looking for a quiet time we were greeted by a crowd similar to spring break gone wild. We were upgraded to a suite, probably because we paid over $500 for our weekend when everyone else there paid under $200. The decor was outdated, but clean, so no real concerns there, First off the water from the faucet was scalding hot on hot or cold. Both sinks, the one in the kitchen and the bath had the same issue. Obviously something was not plumbed correctly to get hot on the cold side. The shower however seemed to like to pulse from scorching hot to freezing cold. Then after midnight there was major partying and screaming coming from the rooms below us and across the way. It was as if they were in our room. Now maybe we should have taken them up on the screaming at 2 or 3 AM asking everyone to go skinny dipping, but we were there for alone time. We called the front desk after midnight to complain and were greeted by a statement \"well, it IS the weekend, what do you expect\" and then after insisting they said they would send security. By the continuing partying and noise they apparently didn't send anyone that had any hearing out to see what was going on. We complained again at check out and were told that they would make a note of it, but no apology or anything - until my review and response to their survey when I was offered a free basic room for one night and a refund for $100 on our stay. Yeah, right. A nice effort, but really a poor showing.

The bathroom was probably the low point - carpet under the sinks, and a standard shower tub with one of the lowest shower heads I've used. I'm 6'3 and usually it's not an issue, but I felt like Will Ferrell in the movie Elf when he was taking a shower and had to slash water up on his face. On top of that, their water heating system must be old, because every time we took a shower without fail the water temperature would fluctuate from scalding to cold with no warning (we weren't flushing our toilet or using the sink, either). Enjoyed the free Wi-fi access, but had to pay for parking, since it seems that parking is a premium in Pacific Beach, AND not to mention that their parking garage has an over abundance of compact car parking.

On a side note, they did not have any laundry facilities so my wife and I had to trek into town to find a laundry mat...I guess I would have hoped they had a small one on the grounds for families with that need.

The reception and all the staff were very helpfull, and the reception area was very attractive with a waterfall and fish in the large pool. Our 'standard' room was on the ground floor, with 'patio' doors overlooking the well kept gardens, where there were ducks and parrots. The room was very clean and spacious.

The water in the bathroom was always pipping hot as soon as you turned on the tap. Coffee was provided everyday in our room. The frigde was handy to keep fruit, milk and water As a guest booked via 'Trailfinders' we had breakfast provided up to $40 per day per room. This covered a full cooked breakfast, freshly squeezed Orange juice, toast, jam and coffee. The orange juice and coffee were topped up. This kept us going till our evening meal! The sun loungers and sun shades on the beach overlooking the bay were free to guests as well as Beach towels. This beach was swept early every morning. Although we didn't use it, the swimming pool and jacuzzi was always clean and the furniture around the pool area was new and of a good quality. The hotel also provided towels for the pool. The bar provded a 'Happy Hour' that was from 4.00pm-6.00pm, where the cocktails, wine and beer were half price. There is also a boat the 'Bahia Belle' that is free to guests, and takes you to a sister hotel 'The Bahia' that lies across the other side of the bay and runs every hour from 6.30pm - 01.30am. There were several conferences and weddings held on the 'South Beach' of the hotel whilst we stayed at the Catarmaran, but these did not interferre with us and what we wanted to.

I had two choices to make; Catamaran and Ocean Park Hotel, both of which are popular hotels on the PB strip, but with major differences. First, I want to start out by saying that I booked this trip on Orbitz, which has a Low Price Guarantee, but beware, if you book on short notice like me, and within the cancellation period, Orbitz does NOT honor their guarantee; so its kind of like a guarantee-only-if-you-plan-far-enough-in-advance. They did however, comp me a gift cert after time wasted with their system. Now, on to the Hotel at hand. I booked the CAT mainly because of its location and overall feel for the place I got from the reviews; and they were spot on. Here's the difference; if you want a nice family get-away that mimicks Hawaii with lots of on-location activities then pick CAT. But if you want a beach-front location and like to PARTY pick the OPH, since that's in the party action-zone where the CAT is in a tranquil, private setting directly on Mission Bay, and one block from the ocean. When we arrived on Friday pm, there was a huge cluster...at the valet since they have Luau every week at that time. This place is big on weddings and corp events so keep that in mind when booking. Not that its an issue since the weddings were entertaining and the luau is right on the public bay-front so everyone can watch; so you get a free show even if you skip on the admission. Check in was easy and quick. They put us in a king-bed garden deluxe room in the tower bldg which is right behind the bayfront room bldg. The room was clean and spacious; a suite complete with kitchen, dining area and living area with sliders out to the patio. The bathroom was clean and the room is generally well-kept, not terribly dated or unkept like many posters on this board have complained about. There are flat screen TVs in the LR and BR-and WiFi is FREE!. Frankly, those people need to get over themselves; what do they think this a Ritz or something!?! Its a fine hotel with beautiful grounds with amazing tropical birds on display, a koi/duck pond. The pool and hot tub area is large and very enjoyable as well. Kids will love the big arcade room. Ok, now to the best part which is the bay-front beach. This place is very relaxing with plenty to do on-site including an array of water sports. The lounge chairs are plenty so no need to fight for comfort. I took my wife and baby onto the Funcat for a ride around the bay which was terriffic. Service is fine and friendly throughout the hotel. The Snack shack girls make great smoothies and the pizza was excellent-they bring it right to your lounger!! The main restaurant has decent food with great service, but a bit pricey. The bar offers happy hour and was hopping during our weekend stay. The people staying there generally seemed like they were having a good time. Book this place and you won't be dissapointed. We will def be returning to the Catamaran for our next Get-away!!!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201c4 star in the 1960's, 2 star in 2011\u201d", "Author": "Tom G", "ReviewID": "UR117360068", "Content": "I don't usually judge a book by its cover but in this case it is appropriate. Upon entering the hotel grounds, one feels that this hotel has seen some of its best days in the 1960s. This resort was probably top of the line in the 1960s but by today's standards this \"resort\" is no better than a motel with beach access. The hotel grounds are dated with an Hawaiin theme that no longer works even by Hawaii's standards. San Diego is a modern City with beaches and resorts that should reflect this new era of technology and youth. The hotel does not even try to embrace today's tastes and desires. The pool is too small with an insufficient amount of seating areas. The saving grace at the pool is that the gaming area provides all the video gaming for free but the video games are far from modern with most games probably popular in the 1980s. The food services amounts to a guy or girl at a grill making hot dogs or hamburger or chicken. There is no waiter or waitress services at the pool and the bar provides only limited drink offerings again on a serve yourself basis. The parking areas around the resort fail to provide easy access to the rooms...and if you are lucky enough to park in one of the compact spaces in the parking structure, park on a low level because the structure has no elevator. Even at the lower levels, good luck getting all your stuff to your room from the parking structure. You will also most likely come back to some door dings on your car. Now to the room review. The resort offers tower rooms and the standard cabana rooms. We were given the tower and upgrade from a standard room to a junior suite. It sounded good at first but upon entering the room, Back To The 1960s both in style, appearance and cleanliness. The bed spreads were dirty. The carpet was worn with burns and stains. The bathroom was small, cold and inefficient. The kitchen was useless to us except for the refrig. The view was nice on the 9th floor from the balcony which was in poor shape with no amenities except from some outdoor furniture right out of Motel 6. The TV did not work clearly on most channels and the WiFi never worked well. This sliding doors was broken as were the shutters so we were awoken by first light. On our one night, I noticed that the resort catered to a large European contingent. This was confirmed when I asked hotel staffers who indicated that this time of year, they get a lot of German, French and English tourists. I have been to Europe. Hotel standards in general are not the same as those in this country. Maybe that explains the lack of upkeep devoted by the owners of this hotel to the facility. Maybe they feel that the current hotel is good enough for their largest number of visitors so why should they change anything. I would agree if I weren't paying $225 per night. This resort needs to close for a year and provide a major overhaul that is necessary toward making this facility world-class by US and world standards. Overall, I give this resort a 2 Stars out of 5 Stars.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBe Very Careful...\u201d", "Author": "EMVeccia", "ReviewID": "UR117299878", "Content": "We booked two rooms here (for a variety of logistic reasons).

On prior San Diego trips, we stayed at the Hotel Circle area. We decided to splurge this trip and stayed right on Mission Bay. We did not regret our stay at the Catamaran. In the midst of the bustling Mission Bay district, the Catamaran gives the illusion of being secluded. The grounds and landscaping are nothing short of spectacular. Waterfowl and tropical birds are on the premises and they have a daily bird show. The ocean is across the street, a short block away, and is easy access to surfing, bicycling, etc. The hotel itself is on the bay. We had a studio on the fourth floor of the tower which afforded great views of the bay, the nightly fireworks from Sea World and great views overlooking the gardens. The studio apartment was spacious and our two teenage children felt that the space was more than adequate, though they had to forego some of the privacy that we might have had with a condo rental. The hot tub was spacious and inviting and we never found any of the hotel facilities overcrowded. Parking was covered and, though somewhat pricey, very available in the garage. I used the fitness center every day for the week that we were there. The equipment was top notch and well maintained. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the restaurant, so I cannot comment on that.

Housekeeping is pretty much all day, so if you are in and out of your room during the day, they can clean your room late afternoon. Location is great.

If this is your first time to San Diego, and you can spend the money, I would hands down recommend the Catamaran. I have stayed at many other places throughout the years. That being said, I believe there are a few areas where this resort can improve. First of all the service at the bar is horrendous. It takes forever to get a drink and every bartender seems extremely overwhelmed. When you are paying that much for a drink and are at a beautiful resort, you should be able to get a cocktail quickly, no problem. The water pressure/shower is pretty bad.

The grounds of this resort are beautiful. Very well maintained, exotic, and lively with parrots, massive koi (coy) fish, and a duck sanctuary. The beach is well maintained and there are decent water activities if you're so inclined. The staff was also very friendly outside of the maid staff that pretend you're not even there. Great location, too. A block away from Mission Beach and right on the bay. This is where the compliments end though. If this place spent half as much time maintaining their rooms as they do their grounds, this would be a much better place to stay. Unfortunately though, they don't. The decor of this place has an 80's look and feel (because I'm sure it's the last time any of it has been updated). Rather than repair the damaged drywall around our sliding glass door, they used what appeared to be packing tape. When we finally made it onto the balcony, it had more spiders and webs than we saw at the zoo. Anything that could leak water, did. Our air conditioner leaked so much, the carpet was soaked all around it. I took a closer look at it on our last day and found mold all over the interior of the A/C unit. Unfortunately, I didn't see that until our check-out day. Who knows what we were breathing in while we were there. The pool is way too small for a resort this size. If you're there while it's busy, good luck getting a seat. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place.

Our first impression inside the room wasn't much better: we had two stained comforters on the beds, carpet that was in need of replacement, bathroom tile that needed some serious re-grouting. We were unable to get a king bed (hotel was booked solid they said) so they gave us what they called 'two queens', which in reality was two full-sized beds. The place needed a fairly significant face lift and freshening up--and perhaps a good hosing down as well. It did look like the hotel was replacing carpet in the rooms across the courtyard from us, so perhaps they're underway with the cleanup.

We got the conference rate, which was $259, but the price goes up to $400 after the conference ends which is way over priced for a hotel like this. I would not stay here. You can do much better I'm sure. Also, the restaurant is just so, so. We had a decent breakfast, but lunch was not good. And the hostess when she seated me started to put me at a table that wasn't set and was dirty as someone had just left, which I found very strange since there were other tables all set. She was brushing the crumbs off with her hands while I stood there. Then along comes one of the servers who told her that the guest sitting there was coming back! Very, very strange! And the salad I had was very bland. Having said all this the best things about this hotel is the location along the Bay, which has a nice boardwalk and we enjoyed running here.

It was huge and clean, but the view was uninteresting. We went back to the front desk and asked for a pool view. We were cheerfully switched to another room #303, that was perfect. Several times we remarked that this was an excellent value, as well as a beautiful place to relax. The pool temperature was perfect, allowing us to stay in the water for what seemed like hours at a time. On the second day, we rented Segways at the hotel for a ride down to Belmont Park, and up to Crystal Pier. (An hour cost us each $30).

Sad to learn and say though that, that friend has no taste at all or cannot tell the difference between the Nice and not Nice. The minute I pulled my car in the parking lot to check-in I had the feeling that I will not enjoy my stay here and I was totally correct. The Front Desk Clerks are not very friendly, inefficient and does not give the correct answer to questions given to them. Anyway, As I enter the room assigned for me I got really upset because the room smells as if someone took a dumb in the bathroom and to be honest I think someone did and of course smells will stay when there\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs no vent or exhaust fan in the toilet. The room was literally DIRTY UNMADE!!! Kitchen was dirty!!! had lots of crumbs on kitchen counter and floors. So I started to scrutinized the whole room and found the flaws one after the other. In the Bedroom, the bed was just haphazardly made. Some pillows that I think belongs to the bedroom were in the living room, the edge of the dresser in the bedroom was sticky and so did the Flat screen TV I was guessing a family w/little kids stayed here. The sliding glass door in the bedroom was broken! Then the sliding glass door in the living room from the outside/inside was dirty, again sticky w/hand marks of little kids. To be honest, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a fuzzy person and I hate to complain if the problem was minor and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really will make a fuzz or make a big deal about it but then I was thinking wait a minute\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am paying for this room $350 a night I have to be comfortable at least. I called the front desk to ask to be move to a different room but the answer I got was they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have and I understand that because it was Holiday and they might probably sold out so I said ok. The funny thing is that the clerk on the other end of the wire did not even exert some effort at all to ask why, you know\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6to at least find out if there is a problem on my side you know... If I even like the room or not. I took one more look of the room and decided I really have to complain about it because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not right. Called Front Desk again and finally told them the problems in the room and demand to be move or I will just check out. Suddenly they have the room for me when they hear the scenario I was having in the room and so I ask for the room facing the bay at the first level (and Literally ask for the rate of it) and I was actually given a standard king one but before that happened I also asked how much was the room I was actually told by Sara that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153COMPLIMENTARY\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (but not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153COMLIMENTARY UPGRADE\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 did she forget to mention the word UPGRADE? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u02dct think so!) so I just said Thank You! Then I was told that the room will only be ready in about 20 minutes and should go down to Front desk in 20 minutes to pick up the key card for the room they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving me to, I said that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. After 20 minutes I went down to the reception and was given the key card and also was told to wait another 25 minutes so I said ok again besides, what else can I do? 25 minutes lapsed I went over the front desk again to ask if the room is ready and Kelsey said, room is not ready yet and cannot give certain time when it will be ready because only computer will know if room is ready so it means that, if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up on their computer telling them the room is ready or not anytime that day I may just have to stay waiting at lobby I told her that I was told in 25 minutes it will be ready she answered me the same answer but this time looking annoyed with me. While I was waiting I decided to call the Hotel Del Coronado because I was so unhappy with what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on, it just ruined my short San Diego get away, before my call get picked up Sara waved at me from front desk saying that the room is ready, finally! I accessed the standard king room facing the bay small but way okay than the room given the first time and again, I must say that this hotel have a very poor housekeeping . Housekeeping overlooked so many things when it comes to cleaning, I believe that they only clean whatever is visible to their eyes, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they put effort in what they do because behind both night tables I found empty bags of cookies & chips. At night I woke up w/itching torso something bit me so the next day I put the tag on the bed to change the linens. I passed by at the front desk again to ask if I need to inform them for the housekeeping to clean the room because I was going out to check the Hotel del Coronado that day , the receptionist wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking at me when I approached her for questions instead engaging words with me while her eyes were glued to her computer while asking me of my room no. after answering her question she made me another key card I did not ask for key card my question was if housekeeping will clean the room automatically without me informing any of them at the front desk she naturally was not paying attention. Since I was so disappointed from the beginning I checked in I decided not to use anything in the hotel except for the room. To be honest my mind was actually set to get a nice massage in their spa and have dinner in their restaurant but because of all the problems I have encountered, the drawn agenda that I had totally changed that very moment. The next day, I drove to Hotel Del Coronado to get a room over there which unfortunately did not happen because they are totally sold out I believed them because they were packed and guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems all happy as I gave myself a little tour of the area. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive back and forth that day from San Diego to Los Angeles so, I just made the most of my 2 days here in this crappy hotel cooped up in the most ugly room I have ever stayed in a hotel in my whole life. In fairness to them the only good thing I could say about this hotel is their location it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by the bay but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to use because the weather did not permit it. It was cold to even sunbathe and by the time the sun came out it was about time for me to check out. At the time of check-out the confusion began, I question the bill because I remember Sara told me it was Complimentary the first night because of the inconvenience I was put through but no, the clerk that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s checking me out insisted that it was not complimentary and later on she said oh, it was complimentary upgrade but I told her you guys weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specific because I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t told that way I was told the other way. I was really devastated but because I just want to leave the place already I just paid the freaking bill and promised myself to not ever set foot in this ugly crappy place ever again. Sorry Folks so upset that i forgot to take pictures of the problems and of course, who wants to remember a crappy place like this one not me for sure! By the way, you don't want to have a room next to the restaurant because you won't be ab;e to have a good sleep because of the noise that's what happened to me I was up until 3 am.

However, i did tell her that it's still not 6:30, and there's no reason to not give us that menu - particlarly since the early bird was $22 for appy, dinner, and dessert (dinner including choice of steak, chicken or fish) and on the regular menu, the steak was $35 alone (heck we were going to order a bottle of wine and our oldest daughter is no longer eating from the kids menu, even though she keeps getting the kids menu)! She said she'd 'check with her manager' to see if they'd \"allow\" us to take advantage of the early bird...which they did. our first meal there (our first night) was ok - the waiter was a bit glum and not engaged with clients at all. the grounds are lovely - lush lawn with nice gardens. the pool is nice too with lots of seating. there looks to be a pool bar, but it was closed when we were there. lots of parking for vehicles too.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jerswy", "Title": "\u201cLovely grounds at a reasonable hotel with location\u201d", "Author": "namasteanita", "ReviewID": "UR104972655", "Content": "10th fl. suite with view of the ocean...beautiful grounds and great price.

I really love this hotel, and you can't but feel on vacation when staying here. You can't ask for much more out of a beach hotel, which happens to be one of the best in San Diego. Of course with a great hotel, means your going to pay a great price. The average price a night was $300, which could definitely put a dampening on your wallet, but a group of us stayed here so everyone pitched in making it much more feasible. It is a hotel that has much to offer such as, constant ferry rides back and forth from the south part of Mission Bay, on-site restaurants, and boat rentals. The rooms are pretty good, but I consider them a gamble because I would much prefer to have a bay view room over a garden view anytime. Also, you feel a little claustrophobic in the halls as the rooms are stacked on top of each other, thus making the rooms a little small. Overall, the Catamaran has never disappointed, but now that there are many beach houses available for rent, their competitive pricing almost makes it hard to stay there anymore. I would say that if you prefer the convenience of a hotel and you could afford the $300 a night, then the Catamaran is definitely for you; but if you can live without room service and clean towels then getting a house would give you much more value for the money you'll pay.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha NE", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay\u201d", "Author": "MomOboysOmahaNE", "ReviewID": "UR103623332", "Content": "We very much enjoyed our stay.

The staff was quick to locate and bring to our room, not one, but three pillows for me. We did run into one desk staff member who seemed a little clueless, but were directed to other staff to answer our questions. Some of our favorite things were the beautiful landscaping through out the property, the fun parrots on display, teenagers loved the complementary game room and pool, and the location to restaurants, grocery store, and shopping. We also utilized the water sport rentals by the bay. My husband and boys also rented sailboats on the bay, and dearly loved the experience. We did have a rental car to sight see during the day, but I can imagine you may not need one. The only negative I can specifically point out, is stay away from the free coffee provide in the morning on the bay. I don't think I've had coffee that bad since I had the instant stuff in college.

I explained this on check-in.

The TV was not visible from either bed or the couch that was in the room. The patio was no better. It overlooked a parking garage and a busy street. The ocean was visible if you looked out to the left past the parking garage, the street and the buildings on the other side of the street and the sound of the traffic was so loud that relaxation was impossible. I called the front desk and asked to be moved. The bellman came up and he seemed very concerned. He said that he would be happy to move me but that I had \"one of the nicest rooms on the property\"! Oh, lord help me. He explained that the room I was moving to was much smaller and did not have a kitchenette. I moved and the room was much smaller; however the TV was in an amiore at the foot of the bed and the balcony overlooked the pool and the gardens. Yay! The trade-off was the stained carpet and broken lamp. Happily I chose my breakfast for the morning and humg the room service tag on the doornob.

It was very tasty. The next day, the same thing. Ordered breakfast, none came. Nobody picked up the room service order from the doornob. Also, noboby came to clean my room that day. And when I checked out they had charged me for parking for for three nights. I did not have a car. They asked me when I checked in if I had a car. I think it was $12/ day!

Room was clean, view from ours was amazing, pool/beach (on Sail Bay) are great....Restaurant not worth using in our opinion. Concierge extremely helpful in renting us a car for the day. Locally we loved the Eggery for breakfat and lunch, the beach Bar (Lahaina) for sunset and beer, Kono Cafe for lunch (ask where ocean front seating is). Rented bikes up on the beach beacuse it was cheaper, dont use hotel rental. Check out a place called the wave house (south of hotel on beach).

Everyone, without exception, seemed wholly disinterested and lethargic about their job and their customers. Slow check-in, though we were the only ones in the lobby. Concierge was unable to make a restaurant recommendation and didn't know how long it would take to travel to the restaurant offsite that we did choose. No shuttle services at all. SLOW restaurant service and after asking both the hostess and the waiter for booster seats, finally just went to the couch myself and took cushions off for my kids to sit on. Housekeeping showed up at 5:30p on Sat to clean our room just as we were all readying to go to dinner. When we called the front desk about this they simply said \"housekeeping has until 5:30p to clean your room\". Uh, how 'bout informing your guests of that BEFORE 5:30p?! The parrot handlers and groundskeepers were all very friendly and engaging and clearly enjoyed their jobs, taking the time to answer questions and offer information about the wildlife.

Well, the reasonably priced water rentals for Kayaks and paddle boats as well as the beach volley ball court on the bay side; the pool and arcade (Opens at 7 AM) kept the teens busy and then walk across the street to the ocean and there is enough surfing and skateboarding to keep any teen very busy and happy. Did I mention that the bay view rooms have an unobstructed view of the fireworks from Sea World on the weekends in the summer? Hotel guests can watch the fireworks for free from the deck of the Bahia Belle a paddle wheeler that goes out on the bay in the evening. also great views from the lawn and the restaurant as well. Our garden view room was well appointed, very clean, nice carpet and very good beds and linens. While our room was at the back of the property and near some vacation rentals the landscaping kept our room very quiet. Business meeting? Well there were two while we were there. The receptions on the lawn looked fun and the bar area and fire pit had a lively vibe. Me, I wanted quiet, a great room, and family time. So while my teen was kayaking the bay the lounge under the trees by the bay was perfect.

The location is perfect, the grounds are beautiful and everything was clean and well attended. The service was awesome. I will start with the service at this resort. When we arrived (quite early) our room was not ready but they offered to call our cell when the room was ready. I thought, ya, sure. Well they did call! Our deluxe king garden room was on the second floor very near the lobby, a great central location. The room was good size, well appointed and clean. Nice flat screen TV and a fridge. Large closet. Comfy bed. The next day we got a call in the morning that the water heater had broken in our building and we had to be moved. That was a bummer as we had unpacked everything, had gotten groceries etc. I asked where we were being moved to. They said they would give us an upgrade to a BAY FRONT room. We packed our stuff and got assistance will our move. The view from the bay front room was awesome. The room was bigger, the bath and sink area was huge (double sinks, yay!), there was an even bigger flat screen TV as well as a couch. The bed was still nice and comfy (there is nothing worse than a crappy hotel room bed!). We had a room with a second floor balcony maybe 20 feet from the bay board walk and the white sand beach of Mission Bay. I was sooo happy that water heater broke and was very impressed with the management for taking such good care of us. But, it gets better. We left for the afternoon and when we returned to our room the management had provided us a wine and cheese tray as well as a card apologizing for any inconvenience! We have traveled to lots of hotels and have been on several cruises with various problems that have popped up and never, ever, have we been treated so well. After staying in both rooms I would recommend paying the extra cash to have a bay front room. I think it is well worth the view and the people watching. The location of the Catamaran is great. It is located on Mission Bay, which is a much quieter location than on the Pacific side of things. But, if you want to see the Pacific you just walk one block over and you are right there. There are great restaurants, shops and groceries within walking distance. We rented a car while in San Diego but your really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need one in this location with public transportation being what is and with everything being so close. (Parking can be a pain and you usually have to pay. Watch the parking signs on the street closely, we almost got a parking ticket!) Our favorite restaurant was just a few steps from the Catamaran. It is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World Famous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and is right on the beach. Go at sunset for an incredible view! They have the best lobster bisque soup I have ever had. The grounds of the Catamaran were very tropical. Lots of palm trees and flowers. They keep ducks, geese and other birds on the property-- lots of fun to watch and photograph. The pool and the hot tub was clean and good size. The spa seemed very nice as well (a little spendy though). The lobby has a huge waterfall. We did not eat on the property but we were there on Mothers Day and there were lots of people paying $40/person for the buffet. I guess it must be good. We would not hesitate to recommend the Catamaran. Everyone from the front desk staff to the maids to the gardeners were very friendly.

We were able to sleep with only the screen door shut and it was fantastic. The only downside is that they don't provide beach towels. You can take one of their bathroom towels to the beach, but they don't recommend it. Additionally the parking was $13 a night which isn't too bad considering the prices at the other hotels.

We all enjoyed to place we didn't eat at the resturants so don't know how food was we did lots of site seeing in 3 days we were there. You can also rent bikes to ride on the pathway that goes along the beach of the hotel that was nice but pathway can get busy. We have 14 and 18 year old and they enjoyed it to. Also Belmont Park and shopping is just down road about 11/2 so if you are up for a walk you could walk it or there is parking down there but go early for good spot. Also recommend zoo, and old town if you have older teens recommend ghostly graveyard tours it was fun not scary but some adult content nothing bad though it was fun.

We were travelling from Ottawa, Canada via the Syracuse airport and the price of $625/US/person including flights, accommodation and car (versus close to $1000/Cdn/person from Ottawa) was unbeatable so we really don't have any complaints about anything. The hotel grounds are lovely and extremely well tended to, including the pool area where freshly laundered and rolled towels are always available. The restaurant's Sunday buffet looked fabulous and the view can't be beat either from there or from the fitness room and little hottub in the very classy spa. We had places to go and things to do so we didn't eat at the hotel so unfortunately can't comment on the food other than what I've mentioned above. Service was excellent and the front desk staff were very helpful. Before we left I had read some of the comments on this site and was a bit concerned about being over the garage in the tower so I contacted the hotel to request a room on the bayside where we would have a view from our balcony. A little juggling around by the front desk staff upon arrival made this happen. Our package included a free upgrade from a regular room to a studio with kitchenette (subject to availability which was arranged with the juggling noted above!) which was great because we wanted to cook our dinners in. Our room was spacious and comfortable with room to move about. The bad part was the kitchen which was incredibly poorly equipped to the point that cooking a real meal was impossible. Our stove was about 50 years old and not all the burners were even connected to anything. The turntable in the small microwave spun in both directions with no rhyme or reason and the only cooking implements we had were : 1 pot, 1 frying pan, 1 slotted spoon and one large spoon. That's it, that's all. No can opener, spatula, sharp knife (other than the 4 or 5 sets of cutlery that were provided) or anything we could put in the oven to cook with. No big bowl for a salad...We adjusted though and ate cereal, boiled eggs and fruit for breaky, pigged out at lunch in Mexican eateries around town and so soup, pre-cooked chickens and cold vegetable platters from Ralph's in the evening (also lots of potato chips which we don't usually buy so our 18 year old was happy!) became our staples. As far as the beds go - they were really, really comfortable - especially the pillows. The sheets were crisp and seemed to be new. I hate hotel blankets because they don't get washed very often but the Catamaran encases them in the sheets which is great and something way more hotels should do. Because the tower rooms have balconies we could open our room to the night's fresh air which made for great sleeping. We're used to a King bed though...doubles these days are really way too small and we would suggest upgrading all doubles to Queens throughout the hotel. New microwaves are pretty cheap these days too and it's definitely time for that! Would I recommend this hotel? Yes - but not to everyone! If you want to cook a real meal, forget it. If you want to picnic in your room and you don't mind a double bed and furniture that is somewhat dated (clunky wooden table and beds) then go for it. We didn't mind a bit - the price was right, the value for our trip was great, staff were pleasant and helpful, grounds lovely, and the rooms were spotlessly cleaned. The location is prime and is close to everything, everywhere. The free hi-speed internet was also great because our daughter had exams to study for and used it daily. Thank you Catamaran for this - I've never understood hotels that nickel and dime their customers with internet fees. I wouldn't want to pay a couple of hundred dollars a night for the room we had but...we didn't so for us the Catamaran was a great choice and we would return in a heartbeat.

Overall, we had a nice stay at the resort and enjoyed our patio that opened directly to the beach; however, it did have a few shortcomings. The first shortcoming was the lack any real cold water. The water was generally luke-warm to cool, at best. Second, the carpet had multiple stains on it. And third, the lawn maintenance crew was very inconsiderate. They would mow and trim the lawn right in front of your patio only inches away from where you and your family were trying to enjoy a nice, relaxing breakfast overlooking the beach. The resort did have some positive aspects, as well. Of course, we liked that our patio opened to the beach. The rooms were well-appointed with bath items, a safe, ample closet and drawer space, and flat screen TVs in the master bedroom and living room. The lobby had a nice waterfall with a koi pond and the courtyard displayed exotic birds that were very pretty. The resort was also centrally located to most of San Diego\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main attractions like Sea World, Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo, and even a couple wineries (Bernardo Winery and Orfila Vineyards). We ate a breakfast and two dinners at the resort restaurant, the Atoll. All the meals were very good. In fact, our first meal was on the evening we arrived only 20 minutes before the restaurant closed because of difficulties with our Advantage rental car reservation. They were incredibly gracious; our server was very attentive; and all of us enjoyed our meal. Our extended family even joined us for cocktails and at no time did they motion or ask us to leave because they were closing. This really helped to ease our earlier bad experience with Advantage Rental Car. The resort also held various free evening events. One such event we attended was the S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores night on the beach. My husband, kids, and extended family members declared them to be delicious! The Catamaran also offered a free evening boat ride on Mission Bay. Unfortunately, we did not find the time to take advantage of this offering, but it looked fun. My family also spent time at the pool while I got a massage. They enjoyed themselves, but they stated it was a little too small and crowded. Finally, Mom & I received an aromatherapy massage at their spa. It was a very nice spa with showers, steam room, sauna, whirlpool, fitness center, and relaxation room with tea and fruit. Mom & I also noted the particularly pretty tile flooring. We both thoroughly enjoyed our massages and would highly recommend the spa.

It was a quick walk to the beach and restaurants. The area is very easy to get around by car or bike. Definitely go to Pirates Cove and ride the Giant Dipper, one of the oldest wooden roller coasters in California. I was not crazy about the food at Catamaran except for what was served from the bar menu. I don't like to slam anyone, but the barbecue night could definitely use some inspiration. The buffet choices were very limited and the hot food was not hot. It was not worth the $25 per adult and $17 per child. But the patio and the view of the bay made it worthwhile. The entertainment was a little hokey, but the kids enjoyed it. S'more night was a lot of fun. There were many, many nice people staying at the resort and my daughter made lots of friends.

It seemed all they were dealing with were complaints from guests...and they made it known they didn't care. After changing from our first room (when we checked in and got to our room we had to relocate as the room wasn't habitable), we were taken to a room in the tower - next to the elevator (I'll get into that a bit later in the review). The room was \"an upgrade\" and yet it still had an out dated feel, and made us uncomfortable about the stay and about the price. We also felt somewhat short changed as a result of the dead bugs on the wall (only two- but still two too many) and the blood spot on the door inside the bathroom. Our first night was rough. We were on the eleventh floor located next to the elevator. So, when the elevator moved past the floor we heard it - the entire night. Evidence of the outdated structure of this facility is also found in the fact that this hotel doesn't have an elevator lobby. My first advice is to stay somewhere else. However, if you decide to stay at the Catamaran...do not stay in a room next to the elevator. Additionally, do not stay in the tower rooms as they are outdated and do not provide the relaxing hotel feel (they do provide the cheap motel feel at the expensive hotel price). Finally, do not expect the management to address any issues you may have. They seem to be worn down from the constant complaining from guests (you will see what I mean when you check in). Positives.... San Diego is a great place to vacation. We are looking forward to Sea World, the Ocean, the Zoo, and other tourist spots.

Because we are a family of five, we had to book the largest room available- the bay view suite- and could not have been happier with the view or location. The beach was literally right outside the back door, which meant less travel time and packing with our small children. I chose a bay side hotel so that we wouldn't have to worry about waves while my children played in the water, and the bay water was perfectly calm all day long. We showed up at noon (check-in isn't until 4:00), and expected to wait a few hours before we could get to our room, but they checked us in right away. The pool was clean and the staff at the front desk was very helpful. I experienced a very rude Concierge on our second day, but went back later and talked to someone else who was much more pleasant. Unfortunately, we left our room horribly messy every day, but we always came back to a perfectly tidy room with clean sheets. Just to be clear, the 'refrigerator' listed on the hotel's amenities is a mini-fridge, and there is no microwave (which most hotels have these days). Also, the restaurant at the Catamaran is far too expensive for families, so plan on eating across the street at the Eggery (for breakfast or lunch), Tony Romas, or grabbing a pizza to go at Oceanside Pizza. There are no activities here, but the beach makes up for it, if that's what your kids like to do. I was disappointed that the use of paddleboats and kayaks were $17 extra per hour, though. For nearly $300 a night, I expected that to be included, but that was my own issue.

I have to say we stayed from 04-19-09 until 04-24-09 and this was a WONDERFUL experience. I will be as detailed as possible. When arriving to the resort, the valets are great and you will go in for check in. The valets are efficient and the front desk staff are friendly. The property itself looks as if you drove right off the Pacific Highway into Hawaii. It is beautiful and also inside there are tropical plants and waterfalls. The entire property is beautifully maintained with ponds with people friendly wildlife and plants. Our original reservation placed us on the top floor of the tower. I have to say if you are booked for a tower room, that is the only thing that I would change. The views from the tower were okay, but after staying in the tower one night we asked to be moved. The tower is 12 stories high and the rooms are in general not as nice as the other rooms on the property. We were moved to a first floor garden suite. This was beautiful. The room was modern and offered a refrigerator and plasma television. Double sinks in the bathroom and a private shower room. This room was considered as the same grade as the room in the tower but was almost twice as big and ten times the quality. I was a little hesitant to stay on the main floor after reading reviews speaking of the noise of people walking past. I have to say that during our 5 nights on the main floor there was absolutely no noise what so ever. It was amazingly quiet and peaceful. One thing to think about is the parking, it is 13.00 a day to park on the property. I thought it was well worth it but I can see if you are not prepared for the extra charge where it would become a problem. There is nearby street parking but I felt much safer parking in the parking garage. Also if you happen to be lucky enough to be there for a sunday brunch, do not miss it. The price is a little hefty, at 40.00 a person, but it is well worth it. They serve prime rib and fresh seafood and also champagne until 2pm. It is truly worth each penny. The bay front is not all it is cracked up to be. Although it was nice, my husband and I chose to walk across the street to Pacific Beach almost every day instead of the beach on the bay at Catamaran. The hotel has a wonderful heated pool but I will say that if you are looking for the typical resort amenities such as pool service for drinks or even beach service you will not be happy.. On the weekend there is a server in the pool area but ONLY during the weekend. Also there is never anyone serving drinks on the beach. This could be a deal breaker for some people but we were not very bothered by it since everything else was so nice. The concierge is wonderful and will offer suggestions and vip coupons and free valet slips to nearby restaurants when requested. The resort has a very safe feel to it and that means a lot. Each room has a private safe and that makes everything more comfortable when traveling. The housekeeping staff is honest and hardworking. I left products in our first room on accident and housekeeping immediately returned them to me in my new room, I have to say I have stayed at 5 star resorts where my things were \"lost\" but not at the Catamaran.

Details below: Positives: 1) Great view of Mission bay/ beach with view of the fireworks at Seaworld from our Bay view studio's balcony. 2) Great location close to Mission & Pacific Beaches and around 10 min drive to Seaworld. 3) Good resort overall with well-maintained grounds. 4) Friendly and courteous staff. Negatives (Major): 1) Very bad smell in the Living Room shoes closet. Hits you hard when you enter the room from outside.

Negatives (Minor): 1) Bathroom shower head a little bit low which makes it inconvenient for people more than 5' 10'' tall to take a shower. 2) Shower water a little lukewarm in the mornings. 3) Small rooms with small beds.

First of all, the positives...This hotel is on a nice part of Mission Bay, right on the sand, with GORGEOUS views from the tower of the bay and the ocean. Although it is in PB/Mission Beach, which looks a little rough around the edges, it really is a good area for an affordable vacation. The grounds, as others have mentioned, are lush and landscaped beautifully, along with the pool, birds, etc. The lobby is also extremely nice, as is the restaurant and the patio area by the bay. All of the grounds and the main building seem to fit the $180/night room rates. Now, for the problems== the rooms. This has been mentioned by other reviewers, but I want to stress that this isn't just picky people who don't like the decorating...these rooms need to be remodeled! My father-in-law's first room was a \"garden view\" ground-floor room, which had alot of problems. Although the room was clean, it hadn't been kept up very well, and the bathroom smelled strongly of mildew. Then one morning he noticed a large ant infestation coming from the bathroom and taking over his room. Now, I can't blame the hotel too much for this, because it rained a ton and everybody gets ants when this happens, but there were so many holes he had ants coming in 3 different places. When he told the front desk, they said they would take care of it, and then later told him they would put him in a new room because the ant problem was too big for their maintenance man to handle (!!). The front desk lady was very nice and moved him to a Tower Studio room, which was a major upgrade. The view from the porch up there was awesome. The problem was, that room was also in bad shape. The handle came off the shower, the curtains were destroyed, one of the chairs in the room was broken, and there was a huge gap in the wall around the a/c that he ended up plugging with a towel to keep the wind out! For a room that is upwards of $250/night, this was not good quality! All in all, I think there are plenty of other resorts/hotels in the area that offer alot more for the price..", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crane MT", "Title": "\u201cExcellent resort and location\u201d", "Author": "vacationgirl029", "ReviewID": "UR24207139", "Content": "We recently stayed for 2 nights at the Catamaran before going on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera.

The Catamaran was a perfect find. I found a great AAA price for a King bed Garden room, called the hotel directly and booked it. When they confirmed my reservation via email, they had already upgraded our room to a Bay View Tower room, which we really appreciated, since it was also a romantic get away for us. I was asked what time I wanted to check in and when I said noon, they said no problem. The grounds are beautiful, as other reviewers have stated, with ducks, parrots, koi ponds, and black swans. It is located just across the street from the Mission Beach boardwalk with all of its restaurants, and right on the Bay, which is more private. The hotel has beach chairs with umbrellas right on the bay beach. There were boats and other water toys to rent. We did not take the river cruise or eat at the restaurants. We had dinner in Old Town and it was not far at all from the hotel. Our bedroom had a nice balcony which overlooked the bay and had a side view of the ocean. It had two chairs, a small table and a foot stool outside. The King bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows. There was a flat screen TV in the room. We had a coffee maker but no fridge in our room. There was a desk and a comfy chair. We noticed the alarm clock had an IPOD docking station which we liked. The bathroom was nice-although not very big. There were nice toiletries and lots of towels. The furnishings may not have been new, but we found the room very comfortable. We could not hear any noise from the other rooms. We were overlooking the River cruise dock and there was some noise from the passengers getting off and on, but nothing that bothered us. We appreciated that the check out time is noon. That's ample time to get up, go over to Mission Beach and eat breakfast, then return and walk around the grounds for a little while.

We only parked in their lot a day or two before we started parking around the corner from the resort for free on a residential street. It was worth saving $13.00 a day. And one thing I didn't understand was that they only put out like 8 beach chairs on the beach, and when we asked for more, they said it was first come first serve. Seemed really ridiculous considering the size of the resort, and the money we paid. Overall, the resort was in a great location. They gave us pamphlet with directions to the local attractions like Sea World (which is only like 10 minutes away). And the path by the beach lead us to a great little playground for my daughter to play. The views from the tower bay side were great. We loved that we could just walk out our door and go across the street to eat, or walk along the beach. My daughter especially liked the ducks, birds, and koi fish pond at the resort.

A high floor room in the hotel is nice since it keeps you above the noise of the ducks and birds (and people) on the grounds below. Sea World fireworks were done for the season while we were there but there was a boat race this same weekend and we got to see the fireworks for that from the balcony of our room. The hotel grounds appeared to be the nicest part of the immediate area. We had a rental car and it was nice to be able to drive places (Point Loma, San Diego Zoo, Sea World, etc). Walking from the hotel around Pacific Beach at night was not as nice as we had hoped it would be. We didn't eat at the restaraunt at the hotel, and in hindsight, should have since it appeared more upscale (and low-key) than the places we went to in Pacific Beach. We opted for the self parking for $13/day and were able to get a low spot in the parking garage every day. Complimentary tickets to the Bahia Belle cruise were nice as well. The first adult cruse (10PM) where you have to be 21+ to board was packed with a group from a wedding at the hotel so we waited and just went on the next one at 11 which wasn't as crowded.

My husband and I wanted a relaxing beachy vacation, so we decided (within one day) to go to San Diego - guaranteed good weather, beaches, things to do during the day and night! We've been to LA and San Francisco together, and knew we liked Cali. Everyone loves San Diego, right? We contacted a friend who lives in Ocean Beach, and he suggested the Catamaran. We went online and read the reviews briefly, and decided to go....it was such a last minute trip that many hotels were sold out for Labor Day weekend...Catamaran was not. My husband contacted the hotel directly, and they gave us a fantastic rate ($143 for weekday nights, $229 weekends) which we were quite surprised to pay...booking online was considerably more money. We arrived and were wowed by the lobby and gardens...our room was not ready, so we sat behind the resort on the Mission Bay beach and relaxed. Pool was nice, and there is a pool bar, but it was filled with kids. A little noisy. We discovered that there is a ban on alcohol on all Pacific Beach (PB) beaches, including resort property beaches....we aren't alcoholics, but had been thinking about sipping drinks beachside ever since the 4 hour plane ride started...so we were disappointed. We were told by hotel officials and some servers/bartenders in the area that if you are caught drinking on the beach, you'll be ticketed on the spot. We didn't try it. We did pay $12 dollars each to rent a cheap sand chair, which seemed ridiculous...but they don't comb the beaches for seaweed, etc. in PB, so we were glad we had a chair. On Mission Bay, I suggest renting a paddle boat or kayak - the water is beautiful and very calm...so relaxing! When our room was ready, we were so disappointed. Our \"partial ocean and bay view\" room in the tower (26th floor - two from the top) had a view of a huge parking lot....if you strained your head over the balcony, you could see the ocean on one side and the bay on the other...our room was terribly dated - big mirrored closet door that didn't slide well at all, old carpet and sliding glass door, cheap plastic furniture on the balcony, TINY bathroom (not lying - smaller than any NYC hotel we've stayed in!) and tired furniture/linens. MUCH in need of updating. You can tell that the hotel is trying to update somewhat....there was a flat-screen TV in the room, an iPod dock, cute silver bath accessories...but the shower!!! The head was situated so low on the wall that it was comical. I'm 5'7 and it was even with my neck....my 6'5 husband literally showered on his knees!!! Shower really needed updating in general - it was old and dingy....it was clean but just tired, like the room. We were trying to make the best of our situation, so we asked for a room upgrade to the bay view side of the tower- this has a much better view if you're on the 6th floor or above....but exact same room. They moved us and also comped our valet parking for the week, which was great. We knew we had a ridiculously cheap rate, so we kept that in mind. The Catamaran is NOT luxury...the rooms that were right on the bay seemed a lot better (two story buildings) for location, but we were told by the front desk that the rooms in those buildings were not updated like the tower rooms supposedly were. Those are the rooms you see pictured on the website. After one night in the area, we realized that you get what you pay for...if you stay here, you are definitely not in San Diego - you're in \"PB\" as the locals call it...Pacific Beach. It is quiet and reminds me of a LA's Hermosa Beach or a Florida gulf-coast town...the surfers are everywhere, and you definitely don't feel like you're in a very touristy area...very low key. Great restaurants. Go to Gringos (Mexican restaurant) just north of the resort, about a 5-10 min. walk. It's awesome!!! We also liked \"World Famous\" right on the beach, for breakfast and dinner...it is a little older, but food is great. We had a great lunch at the \"Pacific Beach Alehouse\" - super food and awesome servers!! I would not waste your $ at the hotel's breakfast buffet - it's WAY overpriced for what it is!!! Just ok food. After two nights, we decided to go to a different hotel that was closer to San Diego. We stayed at the Coronado Marriott Resort and Spa on Coronado Island...it was beautiful. Coronado is just lovely, and we had fun at the Hotel Del, on the beaches, and at the fantastic restaurants that overlooked downtown San Diego. We took water taxis to the city at night, saw a Padres game, and sat at the luxurious pool where servers brought us lunch and drinks to our chairs! It's more expensive, but I think it's completely worth it. There were a lot of families there, too, as well as couples like us. When the hotel heard it was our honeymoon, they upgraded our room type and left champagne and choc-covered strawberries in our room!!! Nice touch.

We chose the hotel because we wanted to be close to the beaches and not in downtown SD. The location was perfect! Right across the street from the beach and near lots of restaurants and shopping. There is a bit of a party atmosphere in the area (especially on the beach) but the Catamaran seems worlds away from it. The grounds are beautiful and the staff is friendly. At check in they wanted to give us a room on the ground floor in the tower, which we didn't want. I told them I would prefer a room on the second floor in one of the bungalows, which they were happy to give us. It did require a bit of a wait though, so we went down to Mission Bay. There are lots of water toys to rent, and the beach area was almost deserted. Nice for small children to splash in, but we preferred the ocean. Our room was clean and large enough for our family of 4. The bar area with refrigerator was perfect for our snacks. The balcony overlooked a pond with ducks, perfect for sitting outside with our morning coffee. Our only complaint with the room is that the mattresses were old and the sheets seemed too small for the beds and were usually completely undone by morning. The pool area was great. The pool seemed a bit small for the size of the hotel, but it never seemed crowded. My son loved the free game room, which is right off the pool. We only ate one meal at the hotel, breakfast. It was fine, nothing spectacular, with good service. We skipped the luau that is offered on Friday nights, but we did venture down to the cafe off the lawn area where the luau was held and enjoyed the show from there while having coffee and dessert. Tips Don't miss the bird show or a ride on the paddle wheeler. Take the last family cruise of the day at 9:00 and you'll see the fireworks from Sea World right over your heads. Rent the bikes from the hotel and take the path around Mission Bay. Its less crowded than the boardwalk on the beach and takes you through some nice parks. Great place, great location.

We stayed Sunday-Friday and the hotel was consistently quiet from 11pm - 6 am... all other hours plan on some noise coming from either the ducks, other rooms, Sea World firework show or other guests walking the grounds.

Beware though that the room next to the elevator tends to shake a bit. The room was a bit shabby. We had just come from The Resort At Squaw Creek, where the rooms are pretty amazing, so to walk in to this room, which was large for sure, was a bit disappointing. We were given a room with a small kitchen, which was a nice bonus, but the cupboards were pretty beat up and the utensil supply was minimal. The coffee makers are very small, as are the coffee cups. The room was decorated with a pseudo Polynesian theme. The view was pretty darn amazing, and we were afforded two good size balconies with this room. I have to agree with a previous reviewers thoughts on the bed covers, as they were abnormally heavy. A huge walk in closet was nice. If they spent some dough redoing these rooms, they would be pretty amazing. We went down to visit some friends staying at Lowes Coronado and were very impressed with the conditions of the rooms down there. The resort was a great place for our two kids, ages 7 and 11. The arcade room, where all the games are free (much to dad's delight) was a great place for them to go hang out in. The pool was nice, very well maintained. I think if we ever stayed there again, which is unlikely, we would book a room on the ground floor, maybe one that butts up to the bay. Those rooms, with their easy access to grassy areas and the bay, look to be a bit more kid friendly. The staff was always cheerful. We did not eat at the restaurant, seemed a bit stuffy.

I asked if there was anything else and he offered me a room in the 200 building that had a shaded garden view of the pool. I was a little concerned with the pool noise (kids really use this pool during the day) but it wasn't too bad.

TIPS: 1) If you are booking with hotwire, know that your room is going to be a standard garden room and that you may need to check it out to see if it meets your standards. 2) The bayview front rooms seem awesome as their porches step right onto the baywalk. If you can swing it, it seems worth the extra $. 3) Book spa treatments well in advance as they seem to book up. 4) Many attractions within 15 minutes' drive: zoo, Sea World, Balboa park, Old Town. 5) If you want to save a little $ on food, some nearby restaurants are good - I enjoyed Piccolo Mondo (within walking distance).", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCatamaran is awesome!\u201d", "Author": "GordyNic", "ReviewID": "UR15882562", "Content": "Some mixed reviews had left me a wee bit nervous especially as this was the location we were staying longest at on our honeymoon.

We were on the 9th floor of the tower with a bay view room. We had only signed up for a garden view room, so were happy for the complimentary upgrade. The view out of the patio was wonderful. Our room was a \"standard\" room with 2 beds, and small bathroom. The room also included an area with kitchen space..coffee maker, refrig, microwave, counter space, cupboards,...and also a stove which we didn't use. The beds were fine for us, but I know that they would be \"too small\" for some adults. (not queen size)-- Same with bathroom and room, they were small, but adequate. The beds themselves were comfortable and not dowdy in how they were made up. The room worked for us, we didn't feel like we were on top of each other, for such a long stay. It was really nice to have the patio, microwave, refrigerator, coffee make, and *counter space. The room also included 2 bar stools, table, chairs, and patio furniture...which were handy. You could see a lot from our room: the mountains in the distance to the left, then downtown, directly in front was the bay, and to the right the Pacific. It was a really nice view. Our sliding glass door worked OK for the patio. We didn't have any issues with: noise, the elevator being slow, the water pressure, or the water temperature in the bathroom. We had good house keeping service..(I tipped daily) and we had enough plug ins for 3 cell phones, etc. The lighting and tv were OK. Check in and out and bell-hops went well. The main thing I noticed about the Catamaran is how well it is suited to the Pacific Beach area. It is not a ritzy glamorous area, so the hotel fits right into its locale. The location of the hotel itself in the Pacific Beach area is excellent., with good proximity to the bay, the beach, Starbucks, Ralph's, the boardwalk, the Pacific Beach area, eating, shops, bus stops, etc. Pacific Beach is really nice, and I personally liked it better than La Jolla, which is odd...La Jolla, is more the cliffs, rocks, caves, and drama, while Pacific Beach is more the wide sand beach. The sand and beach area were very clean and well maintained. Both locations are excellent, but in different kinds of ways. The homeless weren't a problem, and I wouldn't have even noticed them, if they hadn't been pointed out to me. They seem to have their own protocol. People tend to donate their recycle items to them, and they keep the beach area clean. So, it seemed like the locals thought it was a win- win situation. We didn't eat at the hotel resturant, or use room service. We did use the spa one day and had a massage service which was good. The swimming pool and whirlpool were good. The grounds were really nice, and they had 2 outdoor flat screen tv's and fire pits in the court yard for sporting events on tv in the evenings, etc...a real nice set up. All in all the Catamaran was a good place to stay, in an interesting area, real close to the ocean/Pacific Beach. I stayed at the Catamaran with fear and trepidation after reading so many negative reviews, so hopefully, this additional review, will assist others who may be considering a stay at the Catamaran.

Our room had just been re-carpeted the day we arrived so everything was neat and clean beyond belief. Our room looked out over the bay. It was quiet and relaxing - we never heard our neighbors once. There is a free ferry for guests that comes on Friday and Saturday nights and takes trips around the bay back and forth between another hotel. There was live music on the ferry - some people even danced which was fun to watch. There was a bar on the ferry too which as we learned attracts many younger people. We ended up getting off the boat even though we would have liked to stay longer, simply because it ended up being like we were in a bar. We ate at a great restaurant in the GasLamp Quarter - the Brazilian Steakhouse. It was awesome!!!! Excellent food, excellent service - expensive but worth it. I would highly recommend this.

On check in we were advised our room wouldn't be ready until after 4PM - this seems bit late to me but my fault because I didn't check first. After we had waited around we were given room 355 - do NOT stay in this room carpet was bare in places, it was dark and dingy, smelt revolting, the furniture was chipped, kitchen shabby and the shower didn't work. When I called reception I was told the hotel was full and we were unable to be moved I was furious but tired so I didn't pursue this. The following evening at 8.30 we were disturbed by what seemed to be hammering and drilling I called reception again and they apologised for the disturbance. The following morning I called again as there was still hammering and complained again I was then told that they were refurbishing the floor below us and this would take place for the duration of our stay. I am a travel agent and for this not to be disclosed at time of booking or when we checked in is shocking but can happen to us too! I called the front of house manager immediatley and advised this was totally unacceptable. We were offer to be moved almost straight away to a room on the 12th floor with city and ocean view as the room was exactly the same I was not keen we were eventually offered an upgrade to a bayfront room but as this did not have a kitchenette we declined the offer and moved up - this was MUCH better. Grounds and reception are lovely, pool was clean, evening strolls around the bay were lovely. I didn't think much of the beach and surrounding area it seemed to be full of college kids drinking and clearly taking drugs with total disregard for anyone around - definatley not my kind of area I do not go to the beach to be constantly worrying about my son. The restaurant is overpriced in my opinion. Service was bad and food not great. For local eating check out The Boardwalk Cafe (come out of the hotel and turn left or walk along the bay about 10 mins on the beach side of the main road) great for breakfast we didn't go there any other time of day also The Mission just before the Boardwalk also great open only for breakfast. We also ate at the steakhouse opposite the hotel I can't remember the name Jo something - this was ok for casual eating but it gets quite busy. My advice would be to spend your money elsewhere.

I booked a deluxe king, but was upgraded to a bayview suite. Room was nice but not over-the-top luxurious, clean, bed was very comfortable, had a balcony (2nd story) overlooking bay. Breakfast isn't normally included in price, but I booked the bed and breakfast special that included breakfast in the restaurant. It was very good - had choice of buffet or could order off the menu. The grounds were wonderful - loved the ponds and the parrots, pool looked nice but didn't take advantage of it - spent my time at the bay or the beach instead. Took advantage of a free yoga class, but didn't use the fitness center. Rented a kayak and a bike - was about $10 per hour for each - would have been nice if room included vouchers for an hour or two of rental time for something, considering the price. They did give out vouchers for a cruise on the Bahia Belle. Had a massage and a facial at the Spa - they were about $100 per hour for each - more expensive than I usually pay - but the massage was the best I have ever had. Spa was newer than the resort and very nice - had a steam room, sauna, shower facilities, etc. I didn't have a car while staying at the Catamaran - I had stayed with a friend for a few days prior and did all sorts of sight-seeing on those days - Tijuana, La Jolla, the zoo, Coronado - and then spent most of my time at the Catamaran at the bay or beach. I did take a cab to Sea World while I was there - about $15 each way. Then I booked the airport shuttle that the hotel recommended, was about $12.

As we have lived in San Diego before, we knew the location and wanted to be near the beach so we didn't have to bother with driving and parking at the beach over the busy weekend. The Catamaran is a little piece of Hawaii in San Diego, it has a very relaxing, tropical atmosphere when you walk into their lobby and around the gardens. We paid for a garden room with a free upgrade to a suite in the tower. I think we would have preferred to be in the garden location as the elevators were slow, one was out of order all day on Saturday. For a resort hotel I would have expected the rooms to be a bit more upscale, such as having queen beds instead of doubles, a double bed is quite small for a couple, especially when you're used to sleeping in a king. The air conditioner was right next to one of the beds and it was very noisy, it kept me awake most of the night we were there as my husband had it turned on high due to the heatwave we experienced there, it was very humid. The bathroom is quite small, the bath needs a good scrub as there was mold growing on the tile around the faucets, and the drain was plugging up while running the shower. There needs to be another mirror in the bedroom, instead of a picture hanging over the desk the only decent mirror was in the bathroom, or the mirrored closet doors but if you have another hairdryer you need to have a plug handy, a little inconvenient when 2 people are trying to dry hair at same time. We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it looked very nice with lots of lounge chairs, a snack bar and a video arcade, even live music during the day. The bay at the hotel is very quiet and relaxing, great for water activities i.e. kayaking, canoeing, parasailing etc. They even offer a bay cruise free of charge to the hotel guests. A great place for couples and families, a perfect location for beach goers or just anybody that wants to be in the middle of the beach action in San Diego, lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance.

Check-in was no problem and our room was in the Tower (3rd floor). Overall the room was clean and everything worked ok. The carpet was in bad shape in a number of places and the sliding door to the balcony was in dire need of repair. The door would open but the sides of the door would wobble badly when the door was opened. The balcony was nice but very dusty. We think the maids would dump the dirt/dust from the rooms above and it landed on the balcony of the lower rooms. This meant that each evening everything that was left on the balcony (towels) was covered with a fine layer of dirt and dust. Our travel agent had told us the room would have two queen beds, in reality all the double rooms (according to the front desk) had double beds, and not queens. Not a big deal unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to get 2 people to bed -- the smaller beds made for very uncomfortable sleeping. Lesson learned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c check with the hotel about the rooms if you have any doubts. We ended up having one of the kids sleep on a fold-out-bed, not comfortable but better than the previous night. We went to the family BBQ that was on Wednesday night on the beach at the hotel, the food was ok. A bit pricey for BBQ, but we enjoyed it. We went on the free cruise around the bay. Is you time it right you can take the cruise during the Sea World fireworks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kids enjoyed that but were mostly bored by the cruise (not much to see or do for kids). We had heard the beach right across the street from the hotel had a more rowdy crowd so we decided to go to La Jolla for the beach. La Jolla was an easy, quick drive and the beaches were beautiful. We ate dinner most nights at the hotels restaurant. The food and service were fine, except for one night. One night we went to the restaurant and along with everyone else in our section ended up waiting 30 to 40 minutes for menus and to even see our waiter for the first time. I made a number of trips to talk with the manager, who said the waiter was on their way, but again we waited. Normally we would have left but we were going on the cruise that night and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to waste any more time driving somewhere.

There was a 27\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV housed in cabinet that had three drawers below for clothing storage. There was a separate closet which I believe had drawers below for more storage. There was a separate sink, standard coffee maker, and mini-fridge in the bedroom area, which also included a table and two chairs.

Standard TV channels were offered, in addition to pay-per-view first-run, family, and adult movies. Free HBO. The air conditioning unit was more than adequate/rarely needed. Note: It gets quite cool at evening being near the ocean. The view from the room was as promised and as described on the web site: right on Mission Bay. The room was very clean and the bedding was quite comfortable. The noise level between the rooms was more than OK. I know. On our last night, there was a bachelorette party in the room right next to us!! They partied until at least 2:00 am. The only time we heard them was when they were quite loud on their balcony. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. Indeed, the staff accommodated a parking request for several members of the baseball group at SDSU who wanted to visit the beach. My kudos to the staff at the Catamaran. Our favorite activity: rent bikes (located on-site) and cruise the cement walkway on the ocean and the cement path that (seemingly) surrounds Mission Bay. We ate dinner at the Atoll Restaurant. Good food but very $$$$$. SD has many better dining options. Having read most if not all of the TA reviews of this property, I offer the following \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This is an expensive hotel, but it is the location of the property that demands the big price. That being said, however, we were more than pleased with our stay and suggest the Catamaran is worthy of the (relatively) expensive price. Our room was not five-star quality. For example, the doors hiding the mini-fridge did not close completely, and the mini-fridge itself seemed quite old. A minor point, but not of five-star quality. The grounds, however, do live up to billing. They are immaculately maintained and indeed the Catamaran IS an oasis given the surrounding area. The pool area, while somewhat small for a resort of this size, was adequate for us. We were surprised by the number of families (and thus small kids) staying at this property. As a result, during our stay, there were quite a few kids at the pool. Free towels are provided at the pool, and each day at the pool they had a band playing, with a full service bar and grill area. The hot tub is located next to the pool. The ocean is indeed across Mission Boulevard from the property. The beach is very expansive, nice, and clean. However, on the weekend, we found the beach to be body-to-body people; very crowded. Perhaps it was the time of our visit, on the weekend before the 4th of July, but perhaps not. There were lots and lots of 20-somethings populating the beach and (I was 20-something once) they like to drink and have fun. Lots of kegs on the beach on the weekend we were there. On weekdays: no. On the weekends: yes. And, scary/worry: no. Crowded: yes. All in all, we should be returning next year for the same SDSU baseball camp. Will we return to the Catamaran: YES!

After all, you'll spend 80-90% of your time at the hotel in your room. I found the room to be an extreme letdown, given the ambience of the lobby and the rest of the premises. Noise reduction was certainly not the best, the room felt small, and the bathroom was adequate. I'd rate the actual room 2 stars out of 5, using the scale that AAA and other traveling sites tend to use. It was slightly better than a motel room.

The view was unobstructed with just a lawn, walkway/bikeway and sandy beach out front. We rented bikes outside our front door and rode for hours. The jogging paths at Mission Bay join up regularly through alleys to the Pacific Beach walkways. The snack shack outside at the beach was awesome for early morning coffee. You could rent any kind of beach chair, boat, or water apparatus there as well. There were free Pilates and Yoga classes for hotel guests on the beach. My daughter and I did it together. There were daily activities and a very helpful full concierge staff ready with recommendations and maps at a moment's notice. They even helped me locate a store I very much wanted to visit. We enjoyed the wonderful onsite family friendly restaurant. We had breakfast there each day and room service once. The fresh decaf coffee and mountains of freshly sliced papaya, mangos, pineapples and strawberries were a hit. Everything was delicious. Eating at outside tables each morning (almost on the sand) was pretty special. We loved the warm pool and large jacuzzi. The pool bar staff were very helpful. Pina Coladas were a hit. Adjoined the pool, the free pool tables, hockey game, and arcade/games room were a bonus for the kids. It was never too busy. Because parking is set-up outside of the core resort grounds, it was always tranquil and peaceful. You had that feeling of being on an oasis far away from the stresses of day-to-day life. There were cool pathways, ponds, palm trees, beautiful exotic birds and parrots to keep you company during your strolls. The hotel is close to everything. The concierge recommended Gringos for great Mexican food with flair. He was right. We walked there and loved the fun atmosphere and fantastic food. Food markets, drug stores, bars, restaurants were all within easy walking distance. The drive to La Jolla was about 6-7 minutes from our hotel.

This included a peek at Sea World's nightly 9:30 fireworks from across the bay. However the sliding glass door was off the track and the lock was broken, neither of which inspired a lot of confidence. Both bedside reading lamps were broken as well. Engineering was able to fix the lamps and the door, but not the lock. The showerhead position was permanently fixed to the wall, something difficult to deal with when you are tall and the original installer was not, plus it was green with corrosion. I had a hard time finding extra outlets to charge my cell phone, etc. and the decor could use some updating. The food served at the wedding was truly appalling. I've had better entrees on airplanes. However the wedding was beautiful as it was on the lawn with the bay as a backdrop and of course ultimately you don't go to weddings for the meal. The banquet rooms were nice and the staff was very well-organized. I did not see any problems or delays which I'm sure was a relief for the brides. I did not use the pool since it was August and not necessary but it struck me as very crowded with many families and small children packed into it every day. I think a hotel of that size could do with a larger pool, or at least a second one. The spa however was fantastic as it is only a year old. Both of the women that did my treatments were well-trained and friendly and I felt like a new person after I'd finished. The only complaint is that the spa is hard to find as you must walk through the breakfast area and find an unmarked door. A very kind valet parking attendent walked me all the way back there though. Overall the staff was excellent, very helpful and friendly which made getting around San Diego much easier. The parking was $14/day for valet and $11/day for self-parking so it almost made as much sense to use the valet as it did to park yourself. There was little or no street parking available in August. Overall I would not rush to book another trip here but if you are able to get a good discount through AAA or some other organization it might be worth it with children. I think you'd get a similar experience in a nicer setting at one of the B&B's along the bay, or by renting a vacation home for a week. The hotel reminded me of an aging surfer of 45+yrs still wearing Jams and trying a little too hard to be youthful.

We actually picked it because of TripAdvisor feedback. Initially booked for only 2 nights not knowing how it would be once we got there. I had some reservations based on some of the negative comments. Found it to be everything we wanted and stayed for another 5 nights. Hotel - Not sure about others who complain the rooms are outdated. We stayed on the top floor of the two storey buildings, not in the tower. The room was lovely and Clean! While we didnt' have a view of the bay, we did overlook the gardens but truthfully we spent very little time in the room therefore this wasn't a huge consideration. There were no musty smells, the air conditioning worked great, the bathrooms were great with two sinks! But most importantly for us, we didn't hear a peep out of the room next door. Often we've had problems where the walls are paper thin. This was not an issue at the Catamaran. The room also has a small fridge so you can store some drinks, etc. The colour of the bedspread isn't something we care too much about. Clean, spacious, nicely appointed. That's all there. Staff - Lots of friendly helpful staff. Restaurant - didn't eat there as we prefer to explore and there's tons of choice within walking distance to the hotel. It looked nice however and received a good review. Grounds - The grounds are lovely and reminded me of a scaled down version of many of the all inclusives we've stayed at in both Mexico and the Dominican. Location - We loved this location. If you wanted quiet beach, there's the bay area for sun bathing or for the kids to play in the sand. We didn't go in this water to swim. The pool is a more lively area however the pool was like a bathtub. We would have liked it to be a little cooler given the heat outside but if it was cooler I think the warmth would be wonderful. Loved going to the ocean to body surf. The Pacific is magnificent and great for swimming. You have to be a good swimmer however to go too far because of the waves. We loved starting off the day with a walk along the bay looking at all the lovely homes along the way then we'd go directly to the boardwalk on Mission Beach and walked back to the hotel. Rented bikes directly from the hotel which was wonderful. We made it almost to La Jolla. Rented a car for the last half of the trip in order to explore. Found the Catamaran to be well situated to everything. Went to La Jolla and checked out a couple of hotels there. We liked where we stayed more and because it's not directly on the beach, I think you avoid some of the mouldy, mildew smells that I did smell in a room I checked out. Loved dining in La Jolla. Fun to walk around after dinner. Enjoyed having lunch and dinner on Mission Beach (The green flash) while watching the sunset. Nick's was also good. The weekends are a little too crazy on the Mission Beach strip filled with young people drinking beer and playing volleyball. If you're over 21 you'll feel old but it is fun to people watch. By Monday the beach had a totally different feel. If you have a car you can avoid Mission Beach on the weekend and check out some of the beautful beaches including the beach at Torrey Pines, the beach at Coronado island and the beach in La Jolla. Catamaran allows for the best of both worlds.

It was wonderful the two times we ate there. We had made reservations for the Sunday Brunch- It was amazing- so much good food. It was a little pricey, but worth every cent.

The negative comments on Trip Advisor gave me room for concern; I was ready to walk away if the problems were real. But most of the negative feedback turned out to be overstated. Our room was in nice condition; the carpets weren't worn. The mattress was very firm (too firm). We had a tower $uite with kitchen and as stated in some reviews, some noise came through the walls, especially plumbing sounds. All hallway activity noise was transmitted under the room door. We ate at the Atoll only once and the service was just as described in one review -- sort of loopy. But our server was well intended and corrected the things we prompted him for; the food was good. We ate out rather than use the very popular appearing room service; there are plenty of nearby places to eat or dine at. And there's a nearby Ralph's market. The landscaping is notable and extremely well maintained; the rooms are not at the aesthetic level of the landscaping. I've read complaints about how dark the grounds are at night. They are, but the lighting seemed okay to me. Security came out when we complained about kids throwing stuff from upper balconies. Our pre-teen kids enjoyed free arcade games, the pool, the sandy beach, the dock (the sting ray's eyes glow in the beam of a flashlight at night), the bird show (very non-corporate), the live-in ducks & geese, bike rentals and boat rentals. The parking garage spaces were indeed tight, mostly compact size. Across the board, the staff was always friendly. But none of the special requests for our reservation were met. And nobody I asked gave me accurate info on handicapped parking. We're glad we stayed here, but we'll try other places before we go back to Catamaran for the price; they were full for Spring Break and won't miss us. Except for parking, I never had a sense of being crowded. As for the homeless and the Pacific Beach location, we did encounter some homeless looking people on the bike path and around town. Pacific Beach struck me as a typical California beach town; no, it isn't Marina del Rey or La Jolla. Besides Belmont Park, SeaWorld, Balboa Park, and the Wild Animal Park, we happily spent most of our time at Catamaran.

I thought the kids would enjoy the Bay beach more, but it turns out that it's kind of mucky and jellyfishy when the tide is out. So they actually preferred the ocean beach. But the Catamaran has nice lounges and umbrellas on the Bay beach, so the adults preferred that. The pool was warmer than I expected it to be. Nice, even on a cloudy not-so-warm day! The pool was plenty big enough for all the families there for Spring Break (no sign of the rowdy young adult crowd). Plentiful lounge chairs and towels. Nice large hot tub. The landscaping is very nice and gives a tropical feel. The building exteriors are aging, and could use a little sprucing up. The interior is dated, as many have mentioned. It's not super luxurious. But everything was clean and in good shape. Certainly not the dump that many reviews have made it out to be. The \"kitchenette\" is the smallest \"kitchenette\" I've ever seen. And very sparsely stocked. 4 spoons, 4 cups, etc. And there was no real eating area -- just a counter top with two bar stools, and your standard hotel table with two chairs. So really not much of a \"suite\". But if all you really need is a refrigerator for your milk, a bowl and spoon for your cereal, and a microwave for your popcorn, it's fine.

Don't touch this place!\u201d", "Author": "Kaygee", "ReviewID": "UR4042605", "Content": "My family and I were looking forward to a relaxing break in San Diego after the fast pace of Las Vegas. I had reserved the rooms in June, two garden view rooms on a high floor at $189 per night for 4 nights, one room for me and my husband and the other for my Mum and Dad. When we checked in my husband and I was given a room on the fifth floor of the tower, apparently this was a garden room. As soon as I walked into the room I could smell that damp foist smell that comes from somewhere or something getting wet and then being allowed to dry... it was nasty! Then to make matters worse the 'garden view' was really the view of the concrete multi level car park of the hotel... doesn't mention that on the website! My parents room was exactly the same, still the fifth floor of the tower but their room came with less of a smell, it did still smell, but not as bad as the first and it also came with that lovely view of the car park. So it was back to reception and two more room keys were issued, this time in the two storey buildings next to the reception. The first room was fine (room 100 - literally next to reception) - clean, tidy and a nice little veranda with two seats and a table, and on the ground floor... and facing the gardens and the ducks! This was perfect for my Mum and Dad, so they were happy to settle with that room. My husband and me then went around to the next room (221 I think). It was supposed to be a non-smoking room and if this was non-smoking I am the Queen of Sheba! If we had stayed there our clothes would stink within an hour of hanging them in the wardrobe! So back to the receptionist! They had nothing else to offer us apparently unless we 'upgraded' to a suite for another $35 per night. So with Mum and Dad settled in their room we opted to pay the extra. The suite was on the 3rd floor of the tower facing the gardens and not the car park thankfully. Apparently all of the suites are the room right next door to the lifts, which was a worry at first but we didn't really hear it. The rooms were all dated but they were clean enough - but they needed to have some serious tender loving care. The air con unit was so loud we didn't dare turn it on for fear of waking the neighbours! The bathroom was small but clean and plenty of towels. We all thought that things were all settled and we could enjoy the rest of our time in San Diego.....WE WERE SO WRONG!!! Mum and Dad were sat watching TV on the second night and heard a gurgling noise and thought that it was just the pipes from the room upstairs. They had heard them before and gave it no second thought, then Dad went to make a coffee, which was next to the bathroom, only to discover that it was the pipes all right, but the water from the shower upstairs was pumping out of my Mum and Dad's bathroom sink, and the second hand water mixed with dirt and old hair was now all over the floor in the bathroom as well as the dressing table area... and my God did it smell bad! Reception didn't react very fast considering they were right next door and sent the TV repair man at first...Then the plumber, who recommended to Dad that he contact house keeping to clean the mess up.... they really did expect my Mum and Dad to stay there with soaking carpets, broken sink, no drainage and the most disgusting smell! So it was back to reception... they offered another smelly room at first and then decided to give them a large room in the tower, just along from my husband and me. The hotel did make amends by giving us all a free dinner at the Atoll restaurant (drinks not included) and waving the extra cost for the suite that my husband and me were paying... We noticed that someone else was in room 100 the next night - poor people... hope that had no sense of smell! By the way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bar next to reception has a pianist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he is good if you like modern jazz or pretty tuneless tinkling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he is very LOUD\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in fact he spoiled a quiet drink. Think about going somewhere else if you want to be able to talk to people without the need for shouting! The last few days at the hotel went fine - except the evening we returned from Sea World (this place is brilliant!) to find that there were no parking spaces at the hotel as they were all being used by attendees for a convention! They were turning away paying guests from using their own car park that they were charged $9 a night to use and allowing convention guests to park! UNBELIEVABLE!

The pacific beach and Mission beach area full of homeless, and most folks drinking alcohol. We walked along the beach a few times, twice AM, twice PM.

This was a big mistake. We arrived in our room, which was on the second floor of the two storey building. First, one of the lights in the room had a short in it, and I had to call the front desk to get someone on there to fix it before it started a fire. Then I noticed that the phone didn't work because there was a short in the cord, and that had to be replaced. The carpet had brown threadbare patches. We opened the door to the patio and realized that our room was next to the bar and restaurant area and there was a large screen TV outside with a football game blasting. In addition to that, people were smoking at the outdoor tables and the cigarette smoke blew into our faces. We went to the front desk to complain about the situation and we were told that the game would be over at 7PM. We figured that we would simply put up with it as it would be over in a bit. Well, they lied, it was a doubleheader game and it went on until about 9PM. We complained again and we were offered another room in the tower, but one that had a garden view, which I suspect meant that it faced the street. We paid for a room that faced the bay, so we decided to wait until it was all over and we could enjoy the room the next day. Wrong. The next day, when we looked out of the balcony, we noticed they were setting up tables and chairs on the grass right outside of our room. They had a convention eating lunch outside the room, so we couldn't enjoy the view then either. Fine, we figured they would be finished by dinner and we could have dinner out on the balcony. Wrong again. They set up the tables and chairs again, but this time, in addition to having a full complement of diners outside our window, they also had blasting live reggae music. We were upset, and called the front desk again. They offered to give us another room in the same building, facing the beach, just a little farther away from the room we had. We asked them if the music would be lower in the new room and they said, \"Probably not.\" They also told us, \"No one else has complained about it.\" So we said that we didn't want to have to move rooms for little change. They then asked us if we wanted to leave. I thought about it but realized that if I left and drove back to Orange County, I'd arrive home at 9:30 PM and would have to send our friend home, who was watching our dog. They couldn't comp me a room as I'd paid with an online reservation service, but they removed the charge from the extras: dinner at the restaurant, parking, and room service. Other problems: the grounds and the stairs are really dark at night, the hotel is in a marginal neighborhood that doesn't quite feel safe (we saw several scary homeless people), the restaurant food was really good but really expensive (we had three appetizers and two side salads plus two sodas and the bill was over $70), we ordered room service and put our tray and dishes outside the room...five hours later, the dishes were still out there and we had to call for them to remove them. The bottom line is that the hotel doesn't really seem to care about their guests. They seem more interested in their convention business, which is probably where they make their money. There isn't the kind of attention to detail that good hotels pay attention to, and for the price, I expect this. We expected that on our honeymoon, we would be able to relax in and around our room, but we weren't able to do that. I got about $100 back from the hotel, but they're never going to be able to give me my honeymoon back. Don't stay at this hotel.

I am inclined to post this review only to help anyone who might have doubts on this hotel because of a few of the negative post immediately below.... First of all. When we drove down from Anaheim last Tuesday we were immediately impressed with the hotels grounds. Very nicely landscaped around the parking lot, plenty of palm trees and lush vegetation. Our first reception was by the car valet. Nicely opened my wife and daughter's doors and welcomed us to the hotel. We were checking in early and he offerred to park our rental while we went to the front desk. As we were checking in early the front desk staff told us our room was unoccupied but needed a couple of hours to be cleaned. No problem with me as it was only 1:00 at the time. They invited us to use the gym or the pool. We chose to walk a hundred feet past the parking lot to the ocean. A bit of advise - the Mission and Ocean Beach promenades are a bit gritty. The odd homeless person, etc. At no time did I ever feel unsafe but I know some people get freaked out. Not me. Once we were able to get into our room - one hour early I might add - we found our bags already there a brief note from the bellman and valet explaining how to retrieve our vehicle when required. This was a nice touch and I had to make sure to drop a tip for the guys who were doing such a great job of taking care of us. On to the swimming pool. Awesome. Plenty of chairs and loungers. It looked like the towels had been all used up and were promptly replenished by housekeeping before I even thought to call. Hot tub is amazing. So big you could swim in it. We used the pool area every day. Never crowded - always clean. The grounds are magical. Rare and beautiful birds waddle about the various pools and jungle like gardens. Big hit with my kids. The restuarant was great. We only used it for breakfast so I can't comment past that. The service was very friendly but I'll admit was a little slower than most resturants I'm used to. I am pretty forgiving of slower service while on holiday. I am in no big rush ever while away. All in all the room we had was nice. Two big beds and a nice sofa with a couple of comfy chairs. The view from our balcony was impressive. Full south exposure of Mission Bay and the Ocean. With the slider left open we could hear the waves crashing on the beach at night. Realistically I don't think it could be better for the money we paid. Average rate of $235/night. I think people making comparisons to Four Seasons or Westin Hotels should re-address what they should expect in this price range. I would rank the Catamaran as a three star that some might find expensive but it is right on the Bay with commanding views of the ocean and really nice ammenities. You will always pay for that location. We will be back for sure.

He recommended it as a boutique-ey hotel with a lot of character and atmosphere and a great location. Sounded good. I checked their website and it looked fairly nice, and I figured for a little more money than a typical family style hotel (Saturday nights - $359) we would give it a try. I did see some less than complimentary comments on TripAdvisor, but I chalked them up to fussy, nit-picky people who are impossible to please. Boy, was I wrong. When we drove up to the place, both my wife and daughter said, \"This isn't it, is it?\" Even at first glance, it was apparent that it was old, and a little beat-up. First impressions aside, we checked in and hoped for the best. We were put in the tower on the 10th floor which was fine with us. The first thing that caught my attention was the tacky decor. The Polynesian theme is fine - we have stayed in some Polynesian themed hotels before that were beautiful. The Maui Prince (In Maui, HI) comes to mind. But this was the 1970's all over again. The dark woodgrain doors and the faux bamboo reminded me of a bad rumpus room. The elevator to the 10th floor was creaky and groany and my wife made the comment that it was scarier than the Tower of Terror ride we were just on at Disneyland. We got to our room and the first thing that struck us was the musty, mildewy smell throughout. The kitchen was scary. The appliances were circa 1979 and falling apart, and the cupboards and sink and fixtures were right out of the Bates Motel. I went to check out the balcony, and after using all my strength to force the door open, it fell of the rails. I fortunately caught it before it fell 10 floors and killed somebody. My daughter immediately commented that the bedspread she was sitting on felt greasy. Then there was the bathroom. What caught my wife's eye immediately was the black hair stuck on the wall. What caught my eye were the shower curtain brackets that were completely rusted out and the black mildew between the tiles around the tub. Those brackets would cost them $1.49 to replace, and a bottle of bathroom tile cleaner about the same. That is what brings me to my point about this place. They seem to fancy themselves as a high-end resort hotel. We got a huge laugh out of the room service menu. They were charging Four Seasons prices - I don't remember them all, but I do remember $10.00 for a pot of coffee, and $75.00 for a bottle of liquor. In the Four Seasons I would pay that kind of money, but not in this place. My suggestion would be that if they want to be a 4 star resort, they completeley renovate, which I suspect would cost millions of dollars, or they instead prescribe to \"truth in advertising\", and market it like it really is - a great place for surfers or college kids to come on Spring Break, where they can come and crash after partying all night and hang their towels on the balcony (if they can get the door open) and grind sand into the old carpet. But for us, a family that will spend a few extra dollars for modern, clean accomodations - it was a huge disappointment, and we left the next day. By the way, I have seen the oohs and aahs on this site about the beautiful grounds here. We spent 10 days in southern California - there are LOTS of palm trees in this entire area, folks!

Jet ski's were a short walk to rent. My 9 year old loved the talking birds and the ducks that roamed the grounds the best. (They were not noisy or dirty.)

The watersports offerings on the beach were fantastic and reasonalbly priced. We had anticipated doing some surfing which is offered across the street at the main beach. We did that for about an hour, but it was a little rough for beginners. The beach was a place for older teens - twenty somethings and the partying was everywhere. The Catamaran offered a secluded escape from that with plenty of fun on the bay. We enjoyed the paddle boat ride and the dance music party that was offered. The hotel also had Hawaiian night, which featured food and entertainment, it was great. The Atoll restaurant was pricey (not outrageous), but the food was great, so it was well worth it. The hotel offers 2- 2 story buildings with rooms that have ocean view. When I return again, I will be sure to book one of these rooms which I'm sure go fast. The tower where we stayed offers ocean views on higher levels and garden views. We did have garden view on the 1st floor which was fine except when we opened the drapes to the sliding glass doors, we were on display like fish in a fish bowl.

It was my aunt and I with our three small children (all under the age of 5). We felt that $319 a night was a little pricey, but it was a special vacation with our kids and we were having girl time.First of all, the umbrellas on the beach on the bay side, the hotel says they are for the guests with no charge. A lady came by and told us that they were $10 for half a day or $20 for the entire day. So, there's $10 extra! At lunch time, around 1:00p.m. We decided to go the Oasis snack shack on the beach, It was closed. Everyone in the hotel directed us to the Oasis snack shack, not realizing that it was closed. WE finally got our lunch in the bar and took it to the beach. But, nobody at the hotel knew why the snack shack was closed! That night we go to get on the Bahia Belle and it breaks down! Thinking that they might get it fixed, we stayed on the boat for an hour. It was never repaired, and our kids were REALLY looking forward to this. While on the boat a lady informed us that she only paid $169 for her room! We also called the Catamaran that night to see if rooms were going for that cheap! We could have booked the exact same room for $205, if we would have called the hotel direct. The management did say that they would work with the internet company and get some of our Money refunded. But, needless to say they did not! They did however take $70 of incidental charges off of our room (Overpriced parking, Lunch from the bar and breakfast, that was really good) The room was avaerage, but the view was great!

We were in room 804 (a garden facing room with 2 beds), it was quiet, clean and suprisingly roomy. We are a family of four ( 2 adults and 2 children). We found pleasant surprises around every corner. In the lobby, the beautiful waterfall leads down to a duck pond that streams throughout a good deal of the grounds. The ducks and swans on the pond were fun to watch (especially the newly hatched ducklings). The exotic birds were displayed in a non-caged outdoor display. Bird handlers walk around the grounds and allow guests to ask questions and view the birds up close. We were happy to notice that groundskeepers clean all bird droppings promptly from the sidewalks. Our kids loved the pool, it was warm and clean. The beach area was also well kept and there were lots of options if you wanted to rent water sports items. We saw many people just beach combing or sunning on towels. We enjoyed a free movie night on the beach. The hotel set up 2 TV's, a sound system and staff passed out free drinks and popcorn as we watched Shrek 2. We were also happily surprised to be entertained by Hawaiian singers and dancers on the beach, and a live Reggae band was played at the pool periodically. The Catamaran's main restaurant, The Atoll was pricey, but good. For less fancy, inexpensive meals, you could get small plates at the Morays Bar, or the pool grill, or the Snack Shop at the beach, which is steps away from the hotel. All in all, we were thrilled with our stay. It was a very good value, great location, the parking garage was well lit and easy to get in and out of.

Then I heard about the Catamaran from a friend, looked at their website and booked it at a very reasonable price for that type of hotel. When I arrived at the hotel I decided to valet my car and the guy who took my car was very friendly. Upon entering the lobby, you immidietly notice the giant koi pond and waterfall. The lady at the front desk was extremly helpful, pointing out all of the ammenties on the grounds and offered to have a bellman take my bags up to my room. When I got to my room, on the ninth floor of the tower, I was surprised to see that I had a kitchen in my room. The view from the balcony was absolutly amazing. I had what they call a city view of the pacific beach area and it was outstanding, you can even see the pacific ocean and watch the sunset from your room. The actual room was exactly what you would expect from a hotel room, A bed, closet, bathroom and tv. Nothing to exciting and nothing to really write about but staying in the room was not what I was in town for. I wanted to be close to the beach and from what I hear, the Catamaran is the only hotel in the mission beach area that you can acctually walk to from the hotel. The reastraunt was a little expensive for the area but having stayed at resorts around the world, I would say the \"Atoll\" reastruant was excellent and right on par for the price. As far as other reviews claiming that the shower and water presure was horrible, I dont know what they were talking about. I took a 10 minute shower and so did my girlfriend, and neither of us thought the water presure was bad. The temperature of the water statyed the same througout the whole shower.

The concierge went above & beyond for us in resolving an issue with a hot air balloon company and seemed to go out of his way to ensure all guests were taken care of in a respectful manner. We were originally given a room right across from the elavator on the 7th floor and after looking at the room, asked for a different location. The desk staff had no problem in finding us a different room on the 10th floor. This room was the last one on the floor and housekeeping never seemed to clean it before 3 pm which caused a few problems. We'd leave for the day around 9am and returned in the afternoon to a dirty room. We ate breakfast at the resturant and the service and food were outstanding. I don't think I'd stay out on Mission Bay again; LaJolla was nicer and quieter and I would recommend staying there if possible, and if you're a couple with no children. Even thought the pool area was nice and large; THE WATER WAS FREEZING!!!!! So most everyone laid around the pool, but no one was swimming. A few brave kids were in the water, but not long. Had to pay for parking in their ramp, but at least the car was secure. Steps out of the ramp were a problem for luggage; no ramps available to roll suitcase to and from the hotel grounds. Pretty decent place in all; I'd give it a B.", "Date": "September 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Windsor, NJ", "Title": "\u201cMet our expectations\u201d", "Author": "jlbigguy", "ReviewID": "UR2508360", "Content": "We had a great time at the Catamaran. I am surprised at the number of negative comments. We spent 6 nights in the tower (facing the parking lot) and our room was pristine. Very clean, no odors, no mold, and no outside noise. The beds were firm, and the room furniture had no visible wear. Plenty of hot water, too hot, as one could scauld themselves too easily. The room was very large, and being an early riser I could turn on a lamp at the couch and read without waking up the family. The kitchen has a full size refrigerator, full size oven (who's cooking on vacation?), but was missing a microwave (need hot popcorn for movies!). The grounds are lovely, and the wildlife dresses it up even more. We did not see any areas of the resort that looked worn or in disrepair. The beach on the bay is clean and quiet. Be sure to bring beach towels, as the hotel does not supply them. Just a little unnerving knowing that anyone can be watching you on the webcam. The beach on the Pacific Ocean is only a short block away, but is very busy, and has quite a few homeless spending the evening there (made early morning walks on the beach uncomfortable). The Atoll restaurant has very good service (but is pricey), and it is the only choice at the hotel. Fortunetely, there are plenty of restauraunts nearby. Plenty of entertainment right at the hotel, from the parrots, nightly torch lighting, Tuesday night family movie on the bay, murder mystery cruise, the bahia bell, and the Friday night luau. Plenty of watersports available at reasonable prices. My son had a great time in the Arcade, which is the best I have seen in any hotel, and the price cannot be beat (all day for $10), and you can get free 2 hour coupons at the front desk by just asking. Was it perfect? No place is. We had purchased the 3 in 1 package for Sea World, the Zoo, and Wild Animal Kingdom in advance from the Hotel. Upon arrival, the front desk told us to go to the gift shop to pick them up. The gift shop told us to go to the front desk. No one knew where the tickets were, but they did know that we paid for them. It took 30 minutes to find the tickets. That bit of aggrivation should have been avoided. The lodgenet in room movies was not working in our room the first night. However, it was promptly repaired once we reported it. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. The location is great, having both the bay and the beach, and major attractions (Sea World, the Zoo, and Downtown) are just minutes away. Should we return to San Diego in the future, we will stay at the Catamaran again.", "Date": "September 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, CO", "Title": "\u201cFully Satisfied\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2490994", "Content": "We were happy with the hotel and had a wonderful time. Was the hotel perfect? No. If you're going to dwell on the occasional mishap & ruin your vacation, you're a fool. The best points of the hotel were: 1. A nice, uncrowded stretch of Mission Bay Beach right behind the hotel; 2. a nice, uncrowded, wide, well kept stretch of ocean beach one block away; 3. the parrots; 4. the video arcade, with a 2 hour free trial for kids; 5. good food at the hotel; 6. lots of nearby resteraunts; 7. nice pool & hot tub; 8. in-room movies; 9. in-room refrigerator; 10. pretty grounds; and 11. complimentary boat ride. As an added bennefit, there is a Hooter's resteraunt nearby that had the best service I've ever received at a resteraunt. Hooter's has a bad reputation in my town, but I serously suggest you give it a try anyway. These were really friendly waitresses. As an example, one waitress spent 15 minutes playing with a couple's baby so they could enjoy their meal. My very fussy daughter ate her entire meal; and my husband was tickled that I took him there. Seriously, ladies, give it a try. Back to the Catamaran, here is it's only flaw: the hotel staff were competent but not outstanding. They work by the rules management have given them & only have so much leeway around that. As an example, the worst clerks I've encountered are borred college students, who don't know their merchandise & don't care. The best I've ever encountered was a McDonnald's manager who gave away free small fries coupons when people complained; they always walked away happy. The Catamaran hotel staff fall some where in the middle ground, as do most service personel. If you read the complaints of other reviewers, most fall into this category: the staff did what they could to address the issue, usually competently but not always to the guest's satisfaction. That was my experience, as well. The combined access of Mission Bay & the Pacific Ocean make this nice hotel a wonderful choice for a family vacation.", "Date": "August 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but not worth four stars\u201d", "Author": "carlag", "ReviewID": "UR2447054", "Content": "We just returned from a four night stay at the Catamaran. I have to agree that this hotel is not worth four stars. Much of it is in disrepair. The room they put us in when we first got there was run down, and had wet carpet as a result of a leak. In was in the tower facing the parking lot. It had a small kitchen which was nice, and was large, but other than that, I was not impressed. As we went to bed, we heard \"drip, drip\" as the leak fell on the air conditioning unit, and my husband thought he saw mold which we didn't want to breathe in, so we requested another room. This room was nicer, had a pull-out sofa and was even larger, but still not worthy of four stars. The grounds were okay, but coming from Phoenix where there are many beautiful five star resorts, again, I was not that impressed. What I did like was walking around the area - the bay side behind the hotel is very pretty, and across the street is Mission Beach which was a bit dirty, but nice. The last night at the Catamaran, I was laying in bed and put my hand up on the pillow and felt something sharp (my infant son was sleeping right below this pillow). In the morning I checked it out, and it was a maid's name tag under the pillowcase. The needle was sticking straight up. I showed this to the manager and they gladly comped most of our bill. I was happy with how they handled the situation (they apologized and contacted numerous departments of the hotel to discuss it), but sheesh!

It was unfortunately in the tower just across from the elevator and had a connecting door to another room. The noise was dreadful. The hotel definitely needs a major face-lift.

They should have a more toned down menu for families if they choose to eat at the hotel, but there are places close enough to make up for it, especially the Eggery for breakfast. Finding parking in the lot was a bit of a hassle since they were open to the paying public & did not block spots for their hotel guests (even though we had to pay as well).

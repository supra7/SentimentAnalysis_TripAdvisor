Checking out the next morning was total chaos but the front desk explained that it had something to do with 2 buses showing up that weren't expected. I will say this, Anthony was a professional and perfect to deal with during this mess. He was incredibly helpful and even made a point of having some inconsiderate man who just walked up to the counter wait so that he could help me being as I was waiting in line.

I don't like Miami so I won't hold that against the hotel. We had a suite at the end of the hotel closest to the entrance to I-95. Not a good idea. Apparently in Miami, they don't need mufflers on cars and motorcycles. The noise of these vehicles starting up the ramp and warp speed was unbearable. Even my hard-of-hearing husband could hear them! They woke us up early in the morning gunning their engines as they raced by. Stay at the other end of the hotel! We got there around 3:30. The Bistro restaurant was closed. So we ate from their little grocery area. I had a frozen small meal, hubby had a tuna sandwich and we each had a drink. The sandwich was soggy on one side - no, WET!! Took it back. Over $30 for this. In the morning, we went to the Bistro for breakfast. You stood in a line like a fast food restaurant. They wanted $10 just for scrambled eggs and biscuit. That's not including coffee or juice! Then we would have had to eat off of styrafoam and use plastic utensils. So for probably over $30 it just wasn't appealing to us. We ate after we got on the turnpike to head home! Room total cost with parking was around $265. We should have had a waiter and good restaurant service for that price! Staff was nice. One guest complained that there was no beach! Hello!!! It's in the middle of downtown Miami! The guy at the counter was very nice and explained how to get to the beach. Credit for not laughing at this man! I hope to never have to go to Miami again so I can't say I'd stay here again.

First the key system just did not work. I was constantly having to go to the lobby for fresh keys only to have them work no better. I would have to try them at least 10 times before they would open a door and one set would not open the work out room no matter what I tried. And then the lady they sent up to help me told me it was because I need to clean the key on my clothing before inserting it in the slot. Really?! She then wiped it on her pant leg 5 times before that worked. At which time she looked at me and said \"see, you just have to clean it.\" Okay, REALLY???!!! You think that is normal that someone has to wipe the key on their pants, try it in the slot and repeat that process 5 times before a door opens? Then, the staff just was not helpful in really any other way. The hotel really doesn't offer food. When I asked for a recommendation I was told I wasn't really going to have luck anywhere since it was Valentines day. I asked if there was anything near by and the guy rattles off a columbian place, a brazilian place, etc. waiving his arm in random directions like the scarecrow and not telling me names or anything. I realized I wasn't going to get anything out of him so gave up. I wandered the neighborhood on foot really not finding anything that seemed to match his random descriptions. Ended up picking up not so great sushi to take back to my room. Then came nighttime. Now, I know this isn't the hotel's decision but they could have warned me that the city had decided to do road construction IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT - two nights in a row! OF course, if they had warned me I would have found another hotel but really if one can't sleep why would you expect them to stay in a place designed for, duh, sleeping. All of that almost makes me forget that my alarm clock also did not work so I took my chances the first night. I reported that on my way out to work and by the time I got back they had replaced it and I had a nice apology note from the maintenance person in my room. So, I do want to credit them for taking care of that issue promptly. The room was also clean at least. So if you don't want any help from the hotel staff and plan to stay out on Ocean Drive all night, this hotel may work just fine for you.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, helpful staff, expensive restaurant!\u201d", "Author": "mchmjc", "ReviewID": "UR124293215", "Content": "We stayed here pre-cruise.

However, with it's close proximity to the port of Miami and so many people leaving on cruises the next day (including us) it was a hopping place. The downstairs reception was very friendly and helped us find our way to Bayside which was only 3 blocks east and 3 blocks north and was VERY surprised at the amount of shops and restaurants that were open on Christmas night. The walk is in a downtown area but seemed perfectly safe and there were a lot of people out. The whole Bayside area appeared open and as busy as any Saturday night. (And Christmas was on a Sunday this year) We enjoyed an outside Italian dinner on the bay overlooking all of the yachts. Our room had some renovation to it but obviously it was still an old building with popcorn ceilings. For one night it was perfectly fine. We had a suite that had a bedroom with a king bed and a sitting area seperate with a pull out couch and sink/fridge etc. We didn't really need that but had to choose that to have a second bed for our child. It felt like an old room with new things in it. The bar/snack area was a little bit unusual and the service was lacking. We actually sat at the bar and drank a beer and drank slowly and never was asked if we wanted another. Finally, we did get the attention of the server and ordered again. The same place was open for breakfast and we had already checked out and wanted to pay cash form some coffee and they said they couldn't take cash. Transportation from Ft. Lauderdale: We arrived at the Fort Lauderdale Airport at 4:40pm on Christmas night and were able to take public transportation all the way to the hotel. First we took the Tri Rail from Fort lauderdale to Miami and got very lucky to make the last train at 5:03pm. We wouldn't have made the shuttle if we had checked our bags! The schedule said there would be a 7:03 train also but arriving at the station found out that the last train had been canceled for the day due to the holiday. We actually arrived at the station about 5:03 bought our tickets and waited about 10 minutes and the train arrived. Overall felt very lucky as we were unsure of transportation options on a Sunday Christmas evening. We took the Tri Rail to the Metrorail transfer and then took Metrorail to Government Center. At times the Metrorail didn't feel very safe and on a future visit I would most likely make a different arrangement for transportation. At the Government Center we transferred over to the Metro Mover and had to use the elevator due to our suitcases and found it soiled with urine. We also wanted the Omni loop and somehow got on the Brickell loop. Luckily we recognized our error and were able to get off and go in the opposite direction and still get off at Knight Center Station. Once at Knight Center Station we exited the building and it was less than a block walk to the hotel. Overall I would do the mass transit option again if I felt the Metrorail section could be safe. Maybe it was just because it was evening on a holiday. Overall this route only cost us $7 per person. $5 for the Tri Rail and $2 for the Metrorail and then because we had been on Metrorail the Metro Mover was free.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Peru", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel near everything!\u201d", "Author": "CharlitaatBC", "ReviewID": "UR122389590", "Content": "This hotel is right in the heart of the city which gives it a great view, and with a great location!

My rate included buffet breakfast and transportation to the Port. When I arrived at the hotel I was upgraded to a one-bdrm suite as I'm a Silver Elite Marriott rewards member. That was very unexpected and definitely appreciated. The lobby looked like most other Courtyard properties I've stayed in, open and spacious with an eating area at the far end. The internet cafe was to the right of the dining area which included four terminals (free.. always a plus..) but there were some problems with the connections. My room was nice, a spacious suite with separate living and sleeping areas. The bed was Marriott comfy however I could tell the hotel itself is old, but renovated, as the pipes in my bathroom were LOUD and the airconditioners were also loud. The room had that 'hotel smell' but for one night it was fine. I ate at the restaurant in the evening and again in the morning and was very pleased with both the food and the service. I caught the shuttle to the Port in the morning and though there was an initial mix up with the time, the staff at the hotel were quite accomodating and called me to let me know the time had changed. As well, when the shuttle came I was at the internet cafe. Someone actually came over to get me to ensure I was not left behind. All in all, this property reminded me of why I remain a loyal Marriott rewards member. It's not always because of the physical hotel itself as the last few I've stayed in can do with some updating and remodelling. What keeps me loyal is Marriott's service standard which is high and consistent, no matter what property you are in. The Miami Courtyard downtown provided the level of service I have come to expect and appreciate.", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno NV", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "vonluvscruising", "ReviewID": "UR20145522", "Content": "We arrived at the Courtyard Downtown after a very very long day of flying from Nevada.

However, they failed to make a reservation with the hotel. The lady at the front desk, Cedelia, was wonderful. She said that this had happened with EasyClick a lot. Luckily (due to numerous cancellations from looming Hurricane Ike) she had a room for us. It was a beautiful king room overlooking the pool and downtown. She even gave us complimentary breakfast buffet coupons for the next morning for our trouble checking in. Loved the room! We were too tired at that point to explore downtown or go to Bayside so we ate at the hotel's restaurant. It was good and reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet the next morning was also good. Checkout was a a breeze. We caught the shuttle to the Port of Miami at 10:30 the next morning for $5.00 per person which was also reasonable.

I was on the 14th floor with a large, king-size bed room which was quite clean and nice. In fact, I have always had spotless rooms at this property. It is ideal for a business traveller needing to be in the downtown area. It was cheap in the off-season at $119 per night. The hotel has the usual small, but functional gym that most Courtyards have, plus a decent outdoor pool. The restaurant/bar area is adequate when you need a quick meal and don't have time to get out. In terms of the area, it is obvious that lots of folks reviewing this hotel are not used to being in large, metropolitan areas. This area is no worse than any sizable city's downtown district. Yes, there are a few homeless folks and loiterers hanging around, but I've never had anyone approach me panhandling, etc. During the day, the streets are bustling with office workers, it's only after 7 PM that many local stores and cafes close up. That is probably my only complaint about the area, you do need to walk a few blocks to get to any place in the evening to eat. However, Bayfront Marketplace has numerous choices, plus in the direction of Brickell Ave. there are several upscale choices such as the Capital Grille and Azul in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel (great places to take customers!)

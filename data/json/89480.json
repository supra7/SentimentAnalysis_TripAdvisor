My friends and I stayed at the comfort inn over the labor day weekend. Don't let the few negative reviews keep you from staying here. We found the room clean, comfortable and best of all - cheap. This isn't a beachfront establishment, but its quick walk across the street to access the beach. Avoid the Dennys next door, the lines are really not worth it, especially since the Fractured Prune (Unbelievable Donut Shop) is just down the street. Theres also an all-night bus that drives up and down coastal highway, so theres really no need to drive your car to the bars (Oh Seacrets....) One thing, be sure to bring bug spray because the sand flies bite.... hard. One note on the staff. For a hotel on the lower end of Ocean City, the staff here was incredibly welcoming and thoughtful. They were very attentive during check-in and provided several recommendations for food options in the area. Also, following a freak thunderstorm Saturday night, my friends and I finally made it to the hotel, cold, soaked, miserable and hungry. While looking at food options in the store next to the front desk, the night clerk brought out towels for us to wrap ourselves in without us even asking.

The front desk and staff -- Great folks! Friendly, helpful, efficient. Excellent first impression. The room -- Not so pleasing. A few pluses: The table lamps all had electrical outlets in the bases. I've never seen this before and consider it to be a great addition to any hotel room where there are never enough receptacles. Ample storage space for clothes. Fitted sheets. The negatives: Ground floor room 101 had a very uneven floor (assume it was concrete under the carpet). This could be very disorienting to someone with balance problems. Wall switches and receptacles were crooked, just sloppy workmanship. AC was either freezing or too warm. Room stayed humid the entire time, making sleeping very difficult. You were either cold and damp or warm and damp. Pillows were very uncomfortable. I would rather have had just two decent pillows than the five awful pillows provided. View of the bay was obstructed by the cloudy window. Had the potential to be a nice view. Door to the outside that was used by staff was right outside our room and was constantly being slammed during the afternoon. The mattress on the bed did not reach as far was the headboard. There was hair and other things below the headboard. A good cleaning is needed and the mattress needs to be lifted and moved back into the proper location. Pool-- There were a lot of people in the pool when we took a look at it. The water looked brownish and unappealing. On a positive note, there was an employee in the pool area, which is something I haven't seen very often. We did not use the pool. Dining -- Continental breakfast is NOT available here. However, there is a Denny's attached. Prices there are very reasonable, especially for a resort area. Access to beach and local restaurants and shops -- The walk to beach was not too long but you do have to cross the main highway. There were quite a few restaurants within easy walking distance.

However, desk clerks were bickering behind front desk one night. Tonight they seemed very impatient with someone on the phone. Never greeted people when they walked by the front desk and seemed to not enjoy their jobs. -Dumb little square bed pillows. -Message on envelopes asking for tips for housekeepers seems a bit pushy.

My only complaint was Denny's next door not that Comfort Inn can control it. But the amount of flies in that restaurant was just pure nasty. It was very difficult to enjoy the convienence of Denny's for its flies.....So try the House of Pancakes in 70s. Nice quick breakfast.

The hotel was clean considering the large turnover in guests. There is no breakfast included, so we had to eat at a Denny's a few doors away, There are other restaurants within walking distance.

The hotel is located in a strip mall and therefore you parked in a strip mall parking lot all night.

The room was not vacuumed very well if at all..peices of hair were left in the bathroom from the rag or the last guest..(ewww I hate that) . There was a paper towel with some food particles on it sticking to the wall on top of the microwave. It's up high and not easy to see..but I saw it and I bet it's still there. The outlets had big cavaties arount the outlet covers in the \"newly renovated room\" the windows are crappy and there is duct tape around the air conditioner.. We left the do not disturb sign on the door the first night so we could sleep in a bit.. We got up and went to the beach which is just across the street. We came back around 11:30 am on the way though the lobby I stopped and asked the front desh to send some towels. We got to the room and had a message that our room was not cleaned because of the do not disturb sign..which was fine...We went to the pool which was nice. We came back two hours later still no towels. I called the front desk again a man said we'll get them right to you..we used our beach towels after our showers and went out for the day..we got back at about 8 pm..you guessed it..still no towels..I called the front desk told them this was the third time I asked..they apologized and sent a lady with them right away.

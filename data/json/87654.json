We had often walked by Talbott in previous visits, and decided to stay here due to that and the Tripadvisor reviews. First impressions: Very European in style, small reception area, cosy nooks with fireplaces, but most especially, extremely welcoming staff (shout out to Bellman Dewayne!). We booked an Executive king room. It was nice and large, with comfortable king bed, nice linens, large bath the separate huge shower and soaking tub. It was very clean. I would say the carpet looked a little rough and should probably be replaced soon, but again it seemed clean. The rate was $225 per night, plus a $15 credit per person for breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, which doesn't really cover breakfast, but puts a nice dent in it. Loved the fact they have rich bath sheets, not scrawny cheap bath towels. The room had two robes, but they were quite small and not soft, mine barely closed and I am not an overly big gal. The state of the art TV is a hoot, with great internet options, including hooking up to your own Netflix account. The wi-fi was a little slow and spotty, but it was free, so not a problem. Our room was right next to the elevator, and I was afraid it would be noisy, but it was nice and quiet, except for some street noises to be expected. The only problem we encountered was the maid waking us up on our last morning when we were sleeping in. We had the privacy knob/latch turned on our door, but I don't know if it was broken or she just didn't see it. I would hazard a guess we were not the only guests who experienced this. I suggest going back to the old fashioned door hangars so this doesn't happen. Overall it was a great stay. We appreciated feeling so welcomed each time we returned.

Also the couch and chairs in the living room were frayed and uncomfortable which was too bad because it is a nice big room. The other issue I had was I self parked in a garage the hotel told me to use and was told self parking was $34 a night valet was $51. When I went to pay at the garage it was $51 because I checked out 30 minutes after the 24hr period. I feel the hotel really needs to inform guests of this when they give them the validation ticket at the front desk. I went back to the hotel to tell them of the problem and was told to call the parking the garage because they charged me the $51 not the hotel.

Though very nice and polite he was not informed enough to help with my queries so I asked that I be put through to the hotel, itself. I then spoke to Robert Byars in the on sight reservation area and he was amazing. Cordial, helpful, informative and offered and was willing to answer all of my queries and accommodate all of my unusual requests. For various reasons we ended up speaking often that week and I grew so fond of him on the phone that my next trip to Chicago - even just a day trip - I intend to stop by and meet him in person. He personifies customer service in an industry that demands it. My daughter took photos of the lobby & the room for me and sent me information each day she was staying. The lobby is exactly what a visitor to Chicago in the winter would hope to find. Warm wood walls, brass lighting and a fireplace burning...and tastefully decorated for the holidays. Their guest room was wonderful. There were 3 women staying together and the room was huge with 2 double beds, seating, and a large bath that could accommodate all of them getting ready at once.

Like New York City, hotels in Chicago are expensive, but this one is an excellent value. We booked a King suite and a deluxe King, so we would have some comfortable space for \"downtime.\" When we were shown to our rooms, we were absolutely amazed at how big they were, and how beautiful. The suite had a large bedroom, large bathroom (with tub, shower and 2 heights of sink counters--the low one had a chair to do makeup, or would be great for kids), and hallway and a beautiful living room with 2 front windows, beautiful desk, small bar, and living area with huge flatscreen TV. It was bigger than most one-bedroom apartments! My father's deluxe King was also extremely large with a living area in his bedroom and large bath as well. We felt like we were in the lap of luxury! And because I booked online at their website breakfast was included ($15.00 value apiece) for each day in the wonderful Bice Restaurant downstairs, which has a beautiful bar and delightful outdoor dining area. Very popular place. Although certainly a \"splurge\" weekend, for the same prices, we have more often than not gotten much, much less for rooms billed as \"suites\" and \"deluxe.\" Additionally, everyone who worked in the hotel and restaurant provided the most attentive service. Check-in and out was a breeze. They also have a top-notch Concierge service. All 3 people we dealt with handled everything from transportion from the airport, to helping us with sightseeing, to restaurant reservations. They were pros and we would have been lost without them. The location is north of the Loop, about 3 blocks off Michigan Avenue, not far from the John Hancock Observatory and the American Girl place. We walked everywhere, even my dad, it is totally flat. We were just close enough to the \"Miracle Mile\" and to many of the sights, or to Lincoln Park to the north, where we toured the fascinating Chicago History Museum. Yet we were just far enough away to be quiet and relaxed. It is right next to another small park and a residential areas which are quite nice. There are plenty of great restaurants nearby, too.

The appearance of the hotel is very elegant on the outside, slightly more casual inside. Frankly it needs an overhaul. The color scheme of the rooms is drab and slightly depressing, all browns and creams. For hotel furniture it is excellent though. But I'd lose the chintzy swags over the beds.

Great places to eat and shop right around the corner. If you are going on a girls trip or a romantic getaway, this is a GREAT hotel. Beds are comfortable, linens are luxurious. Very much a boutique, tiny lobby, small elevators, tiny bar and a business center that is really just a computer and a printer.

If you have a small group, it's perfect, but there is no room to grow if your meeting does. Unfortunately, the stats on their website regarding meeting rooms capacity do not include the space needed for audio/visual, catering set up, etc. so plan for less than what is shown. Restrooms for meeting attendeesare very small so plan for longer breaks . 3) The catering is horrible. For the price, you expect there to be enough food in the buffets, more variety in the snacks, and of course for it to taste halfway decent. It simply did not meet expectations. You have to stay on top of what you ordered because they seem to have no quality-control or attention to detail, no one to say \"they ordered the nuts but there are no nuts here.\" If you don't catch it, they don't, but of course you have already guaranteed payment. This was true of all kinds of things (no coffee creamer, no spoons, etc.) In their defense, the help is quick to get whatever item you mention, but you have to bring it to their attention.

The location is excellent, wonderful restaurants everywhere you turn, and don't forget a stop at Sprinkles Cupcakes for dessert!", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westerville, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for American Girl Experience\u201d", "Author": "AllAmericanGirls", "ReviewID": "UR102171188", "Content": "My husband and I brought our girls here for their birthdays and chose the Talbott because of the wonderful American Girl package the hotel offers.

Not to mention all the personalized welcome letters, keycards, room service menus, postcards and stationary custom for each girl. Also, they each received keepsake plush American girl doll beds, personal shopper Ensley at the store and cupcakes and milk delivered for each of our girls and dolls! Service was top notch, the hotel is right around the corner from American Girl, and right on a fantastic strip of shopping and dining. Overall, the experience was PERFECT. I felt I got what I paid for and never felt differently throughout our trip. The American girl experience is a newly added option to the Talbott and I felt they offered exceptional differences from other hotels.

After further thought we should have asked for a higher floor to get a better view then an alley, but another time. The room was great, king size bed with down pillows and super soft sheets. The bathroom was spotless and well lit. The towels were large enough for two to use, if one wanted to. We had a good nights rest, considering that we were not in our own bed.

He gave us prices for both and one pressure to use the hotel's service. He helped us to get our luggage and walked us into the hotel and told the person at the desk our name. We noticed the charm of the lobby, it was like an old fashioned hotel lobby from a black and white movie. It was warm and inviting with wood, greens and granite counters. We were quickly given our keys and our valet, who now we knew was DeWayne showed us to our rooms. DeWayne could not have been more gracious and welcoming. He asked about our stay and gave us several suggestions of things to do and see in the neighborhood. He showed us how to turn everything on and told us to call down for anything, even ice and they would bring it up. We order some lunch from room service (yes, we splurged!) the service was fast and each room has a little door bell! The food was very good and the coffee was very good. The young man who brought up our lunch was very nice chatting with us about the NCAA tournament and wishing us well with our stay. The room was cozy a king sizes bed decorated with warm greens, creams and browns. The beds was very clean and comfy. The room was lovely with Italian marble in the bathroom and dark wood dressers. When we started to get ready for the wedding, we realized we had forgotten some things, the concierge gave us some suggestions and was very helpful.

My husband and I were traveling with our two children (9&6), as well as my mother-in-law, for a birthday trip to American Girl Place and other Chicago family attractions. After an early morning flight we were warmly greeted and told that our rooms were available for early check-in. We were also checked in personally by Tim, the head of the concierge staff, who took special time to greet my daughter (and her doll), wish her a happy birthday and tell us about the area. There were even personalized key cards with the names of my daughter and her doll at the bottom. The rooms were incredibly spacious, which was especially nice since we were often in one room to plan our day or to enjoy the terrific room service. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. We were about a six-minute walk to American Girl, the John Hancock Tower and wonderful shopping along Michigan Avenue, but were able to enjoy the quiet of being away from the hustle and bustle and the hospital. Both kids loved the ice skating at the top of the John Hancock Tower and the gourmet cupcakes at More right across the street from the hotel! We experienced all of the amenities you would expect with an American Girl hotel package (doll travel bed, cupcakes at turndown, etc.), but it was really the graciousness of the staff that made our stay extra special for all of us and truly sets the Talbott apart. The entire concierge staff went out of their way to make us feel at home.....everything from greeting us by name, offering opinions about the best Chicago pizza and making reservations, to arranging a car to the airport from the Field Museum so that we could make the most of our last day in town. The intimate, warm nature of the Talbott was exactly what I was hoping for on our special family trip. Everything exceeded my expectations.

Dining: Lunch: Pizano's -- excellent Chicago style deep dish pizza, a block away from hotel Ditka's -- great burgers, 1.5 blocks from hotel; really good crab bisque too Downtown Dogs/Pippin's Tavern on Rush -- good chicago style hot dogs and beer; about 3 blocks from the hotel Giordano's -- world famous stuffed pizza - excellent; 3 blocks from hotel Dinner: Bice Restaurant -- Italian; connected to hotel; average quality for us; although there seemed to be a lot of patrons on other nights Rosebud on Rush -- Italian; excellent; 3 blocks from hotel right by Giordano's Japonais -- sushi; 5-6 min cab ride; excellent, very fresh, chique atmosphere (recommendation from Tim -- thumbs up!) Devon Grille -- seafood; 3 blocks from hotel; excellent, wide variety (another excellent recommendation from Tim -- thumbs up!) Overall, we had a fantastic long weekend in Chicago. The Chicago Marathon (10-10-10) was cool to see. Lots of people out and about. Weather was great! We felt safe walking around the area of the hotel at night.

We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned. We called the front desk to ask to send someone. The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening. The room itself was pleasant. It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much. We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin. We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service.

It was unbelievable. I got a deal on the room on the hotel's Web site to stay for $195 with a free suite upgrade and $30 breakfast credit. The staff at the hotel was very friendly upon arriving and we found that to be consistent throughout the trip. The housekeeping staff and the maintenance staff even greeted us and told us to enjoy our stay. The one exception on the service was the awful service coming from the restaurant's breakfast staff. I don't know if they are resentful of everyone taking advantage of the free breakfast offer or what. They were not attentive or courteous. The first day, I think they were understaffed and we just stood at the door waiting to be seated for like five minutes. We had tried to try to just sit down and one of the waiters shoo'd us outside to wait by the maitre d table. The seating arrangements in there are awful as well. You sit right on top of the people at the next table. The food at breakfast, however, was really good I thought. My husband ordered the steak and eggs one day and didn't like the steak very much otherwise the menu was great and the food was delicious. We tried stuff french toast, omelets, eggs, and pancakes. The room was the best part. We stayed in a suite on the top floor. It was huge. The bathroom had a beautiful jacuzzi tub. They had bathrobes and the bathroom was all marble with two separate vanities and a small flat screen in the bathroom. The bedroom was great. Bed was super comfortable with a great TV. The living room had a wet bar, large desk and sofa with chairs facing another big flat screen TV. The location was really convenience too. Very close to Magnificent Mile and near the John Hancock building. We found it easy to arrive via the subway to and from the airport.

It also won some awards. I was therefore really looking forward to this stay. For context, I have stayed in one of their suites. Overall, slightly disappointed but still a comfortable stay. I would only get this hotel if they upgrade you to a suite and you are prepared to go somewhere else for food. Good Points: 1. The suite is sizable and clean 2. The furnishings are in good condition 3. Great location for those who like to shop - on the doorstep of the Magnificent Mile Disappointed with: 1. Lobby was small and looked tired 2. I could barely understand the service staff as most were foreigners 3. The restaurant is small and poorly serviced. I did breakfast there, whilst I was seated quickly (I arrived early), some people had a long wait. I also observed one couple leaving their food because the waiter never brought the toast. The breakfast was poor - the omelet was at best basic and they gave a really small piece of toast. 4. The room service and restaurant menu is very limited, but after the first breakfast I didn't even want to try anything else anyway. 5. The room whilst large lacked the small touches which I would expect in a luxury hotel. It would have been nice to have slippers for example. The bathroom was large but the bathtub was very small. 6. On the first day the cleaning lady didn't turn up until quite late and that point I was already back in the room and didn't want to be disturbed. The second day I turned the button on for my room to be serviced, thinking they would attend to it quicker, but when I came back 3 hours later...the cleaning lady was just beginning. 7. The concierge was not very knowledgeable about tours of the city, I wanted a walking tour in a group and all he could recommend was a bus tour. I found out myself that you can join a walking tour for free throughout the weekend. 8. If you do choose this hotel and you are from Europe, do not take food recommendations from the staff. I think I have eaten the worst pizza of my life from PIzanos from around the corner. The base tasted and felt like it was fried and the toppings were tasteless.

Confused? Let me outline the pros and cons. The good bit first. The location and service at the Talbott is exceptional. You're within easy reach of some great restaurants and the best shopping is close at hand. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the concierge extremely helpful. There wasn't much of a view from our window, and the room was dark, but as we were out for most of the day, that didn't really matter. Our two-bed Queen room was spacious, giving us plenty of room to spread out. The down-side. Although you have access to a near-by fitness club, there isn't any at the hotel itself, which for me wasn't great. To be fair, one doesn't expects that at a small boutique hotel, so there the rest has to be pretty fantastic to compensate for what you don't get. But the place needs a little sprucing up. It's all in the details. We sat next to the bussing cart in the breakfast room. Couldn't they find a place in the kitchen for the dirty dishes? The decor of our room was beginning to look a little shabby around the edges. There was some kind of white muck on the drapes that ought to have been obvious to the cleaning staff. Black mold was creeping around the tub edges just a little. The whole burgundy and hunter green motif looked a little tired. Although the bed linens were Frette, they hadn't seen an iron, and the pillows were small foam ones. If these details don't bother you, then you'll have a fine stay at the hotel.

We did a lot of research and settled on the Talbott. From the moment we arrived and saw the cow climing up the building to the moment we left, we were delighted about every aspect of our stay. The staff was incredible. Without fail, every single staff person we encountered smiled and greeted us and treated as if they were pleased we were spending our leisure dollars at their establishment. Such an easy way to impress customers...but so rare in the hospitality industry. The lobby was cozy and beautifully decorated for the holidays. Our room (the one room suite) was clean, comfortable, and full of extra amenities. The beds were comfortable, the linens felt wonderful, and the bathroom was outstanding. We loved the bathrobe and actually purchased one at checkout. We generally stay away from hotel restaurants, but we got behind schedule one evening and two mornings and found ourselves settling for the hotel restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised that the food was so good. For breakfast, we highly recommend the pancakes and the omlets. The only problem was a stale croissant on the second day. For dinner, we recommend the whitefish...it was outstanding. And of course, in keeping with the hotel standards, the staff was outstanding. The biggest miss of the weekend was the horrid internet connection. It didn't affect us much because we only used it to locate pubs, nightlife, and restaurants. But had we been there for work, it would have been a deal-breaker. Note to The Talbott...whoever is handling your internet service needs to be replaced. We are both in that line of work and it's not that tough.

I tried The Fairmont a few years ago...before the renovation...And it had really gone downhill. It has now been renovated in IKEA style...YUCK! Then I discovered The Talbott! If you love traditional hotels, you will LOVE The Talbott. The lobby is all dark wood, has several fireplaces and, although small, it's comfortable and welcoming with intimate seating areas. Upon arrival, doormen are friendly and ready to assist you in any way. My check in was very fast, and all my special requests were met. I also asked for a mini-fridge which was sent up promptly and free of charge. Lovely Christmas decorations really made me feel at home since I don't get to see my family until Christmas day. I booked a 800 sq ft 1 br suite. The living room has a comfy couch, 3 chairs, coffee table, very large desk, and a 42 plasma TV. The marble bathrooms are HUGE! Jacuzzi tub, separate shower, 2 vanities, (both with hairdryer) separate commode room. Towels are soft and fluffy, but I found the robes to be a bit itchy. I prefer soft terry cloth robes. The bed was very comfortable with linens to die for. The bedroom has a 32\" plasma TV and plenty of drawer and closet space. Free wireless internet was reliable and fast. A safe big enough for my laptop was very convenient. Room service breakfast was delivered quickly, but was a bit bland. There are certainly many restaurants in the area, and you couldn't ask for a better location...5 min from a subway stop and a 2 min walk to the mag mile. You will not get a better bang for your buck in Chicago than at The Talbott. Orbitz gave me a great rate of $182 a night!

The bathroom was also quite large with 2 sinks. What a treat to not have to share! We booked on-line, so we received a complimentary continental breakfast. The free breakfast is very limited: juice, cereal, yogurt, cold cuts and muffins. We were able to upgrade to a better breakfast for $5. However, we would not have known about this if we hadn't been eavesdropping on other diners. (Our waiter was not very helpful.) The $5 breakfast was 2 eggs, sausage or bacon and potatoes. This was quite a bargain and it arrived piping hot! Always a plus in my book. The Talbott is in a great location. It is only a few blocks from Michigan Avenue, very close to the Hancock Building and Water Tower Place. Despite all the construction being done outside the hotel, we did not hear any noise. (We were there Friday/Saturday.) I am not sure if the noise would have been worse during the week. Another plus was the free Wi-Fi. I am still amazed that so many high-end hotels charge for this.

It had a good TV if needed also. It was quiet and although our room was near some building work next door, we rarely heard anything at all. We were located on the 8th floor overlooking the front. The Concierge made our stay worth while in every way. He was friendly, informative and very approachable and willing to help and advise. He is worth his weight in gold. Although all the staff were friendly and helpful, I was say the Concierge, Gene, was the star member of staff. We ate at some very, very good restaurants - our favourite being the Le Colonial, on Rush Street. A French/Vietnamese style restaurant. Our second favourite in the same area was Gibsons. What a great place for a fantasic choice of steaks. Hugo's next door for seafood was also outstanding. There's a restaurant called Japanais, which had brilliant reviews, but we ran out of time to go there - next time! Gene booked us to see the Jersey Boys at the Theatre. Although the tickets were a bit pricey, the show was outstanding and worth every penny. I learnt a lot about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and thoroughly enjoyed the music and their performance on the everning. I would go again!

Previously I had stayed at the Le Meridien (now the site of the Conrad Hotel) and was debating a return stay at that facility since my previous exeperience was great. I did some research and decided to try and stay at a different hotel. Using tripadvisor as my main source, in addition to Orbitz and Expedia, I kept noticing that The Talbott Hotel came up as a favorite spot, so with some trepidation (I will admit) I booked my 4 nite stay there. Arriving at the hotel, for me the first thing I noticed was the small lobby area....having stayed mostly at Hilton, Hyatt and other business-type hotels, I was used to larger lobbies, and multiple desk attendants, but I absorbed the experience and checked in. I was upgraded due to the fact that I had reserved my room thru the slh.com website (Small Luxury hotels), of which The Talbott was a member. That website encourages the person to create a list of their pet likes, pillow types, food, etc...and I created a list of things I enjoyed. The room, was spacious, wonderfully appointed, comfortable and met all of my needs. A few minutes after I had started to uppack my luggage, the door bell rang, and a waiter appeared, carrying a large bowl of fruits and other items, I was surprised as I had not ordered anything. When I opened the letter, it was a typed welcome letter, indicating that enclosed were a few items I had indicated I liked (chocolates, bottled water, etc....) and that anything I need I was to contact the desk. What a wonderful way to be welcomed, I thought. I had a few things I wanted to do while in Chicago, and so I went downstairs to the Concierge and met Stephanie. Now any of you who have read back reviews from folk who have stayed at The Talbott will recall that many people praised Stephanie as a wonderful host, and Concierge. Well, I cannot say enough about her. I spent the better part of 40 minutes chatting with her about what kind of restaurants i wanted to try (it was my birthday) and other things i wanted to do. She took notes, went online and showed me different restaurants that she could recommend, called them up to make reservations as I was sitting there, and mae a couple reservations at those that the times were amenable to me. I ate at the RL restaurant (yes, Ralph Lauren), and was personally greeted when I walked in. I asked them how did you know my name, and they replied that Stephanie had called them to let them know I was coming over. I was overwhelmed...I had never experienced such special attention at any other hotel. They comped me on my desert, since Stephanie had told them it was my birthday, and all in all, I had a wonderful time. I told her that i wanted to go see a Jazz or Blues show and she pointed me to the Backroom, a few blocks away from the hotel. She looked in her draw and found me a ticket for free entrance to the show (normally $20 at the door). The concert was great, and I was there for nearly 3 hrs, drinking and enjoying the music. The place is small, intimate, but the sound is great, so it is a good place to enjoy a show. Everyone at The Talbott was gracious, smiling and helpful. I felt like I was staying with family....I cannot explain it any other way. Every morning I would come down and chat with Stephanie for a few minutes about what I was doing that day, and she suggested other things that i might do also. It was like a well-choreographed show!!! The location is perfect, near to Rush Street and the bars, restaurants and stores, Michigan Avenue is about a block and a 1/2 away.....there are buses, free trolleys so there is no problem to get where you want to go. In my stay in Chicago I had purchased a few items that could not be packed in my carry-on, and so i asked Stephanie if the Hotel could arrange for the stuff to be sent via UPS to my home. No problem, she said. I gave them my address etc....and all was arranged. I received the items aboout 4 days later. I really was sorry to leave. It was such a wonderful experience. Time and time again while I was sitting with Stephanie other folk would come in and thank her for reservations she had made for them, recommendations for theatre, restaurants, walking tours, etc....and would turn to me while I was sitting there and tell me that they always come back to The Talbott because of her. Some brought in small gifts of their appreciation....I have never seen this at any other hotel I have stayed at. I have to say that I did initially have some trepidation when i booked this hotel. I was not familiar with smaller, boutique-styled hotels, but I was sooo pleasantly surprised that I would feel as if I betrayed them if I were to ever re-visit Chicago and not stay at The Talbott. My trip was that special. That, I can safely say, is the kind of experience that makes it very easy to return time and time again to a hotel. I can safely recommend The Talbott to anyone who is looking for a different type of hotel stay....one that does not revolve around a large, Business-type place (Hilton, Hyatt etc...not that I am knocking them).

Giordanos on Michigan and Superior (get there at 1045am walk to the bar and order your pizza as it takes 45 min to cook so when you sit down at 11 you can eat a salad or something then your pizza comes and you will not be waiting in line for 2 hours like everyone else, i recommened the stuffed spinach if you just like your pizza easy cheese instead of overly cheesy), if you want a specialty coffee shop the only one i found in the city is Cafe Deluca on Damen in Wiker Park everything else is a starbucks.

I was a little worried - being assigned to a smaller hotel - you just never know - you really have to trust the reviews. Boy was I thrilled. The hotel is on a tree lined street, within a half block of the Four Seasons (that tells you the neighborhood is in fact nice). The best part of Magnificient Mile is two short blocks away - you can see Michigan Avenue from the hotel. The doorman greets you as you arrive. There was one present almost 24 hours a day. When you walk in, there is a small lobby, with a living room style seating area on each side with a fireplace. You immediately get a cozy feeling. I had arrived very early the day of the Chicago Marathon, it was cold, and I was wet from the rain - they got me a room within an hour (was sold out the night before so they really rushed). I had an executive king - a very large room with a huge bathroom with a seperate tub and shower. Aveeda soaps, etc. All the furnishings were new - in good shape, soft bedding and nice carpet. I asked if they had a small refrigerator since I would be there so long, and they brought me one along with a microwave. Day in and day out the service was excellent. From the doorman to the concierge, to the maid, everyone was very pleasant and helpful. One of the front desk attendants knew I liked bananas, and when she was on duty, made sure the fruit bowl with the apples and oranges had bananas also. There was a beautiful but small bar - with gorgeous wood. I was mostly too tired to ever go in. There was fresh coffee - complimentary - each morning, along with the fruit. If I had to nit pick - there are some areas in the hallway to the rooms that could use some touch up paint - after being hit repeatedly by the luggage cart. The food could have been better too, I never ate it, but both my work mates declared it could be better - but I always went out - around the corner to some great Italian food at Pizano's or the other many restaurants on Rush. I rarely eat at hotels - the local food is too good to pass up and since this hotel is so close to everything you can walk out, and turn towards any direction and find good restaurants and shops. This hotel is for people who like small intimate settings, cozy, one on one service with people who remember your name and who don't need loud bars and restaurants, etc. I travel for a living and prefer this style of hotel - I want a quiet place, upscale furnishings and great service. The Talbott delivers. We had almost 50 staff in from all over the country, and the hotel booking service had us in about 10 different hotels. Based on what everyone said about their hotel, and the many I saw when visiting others over the three weeks, I know the Talbott was superior!

My in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. They were lured in by promises from The Talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide \"special, personal treatment\". Nothing could have been further from the truth. They failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. Now the worse part. Mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. Case in point: I had requested on several occasions when I made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. Of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid Chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. My brother recalls the \"indignation\" of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. Then Another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. When I finally was able to get across town, leaving a Cubs game early, I again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. Again they agreed, but never did anything about it. In the end when my older brother checked out on Sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his ATM his account was frozen from \"unathorized overuse\". The hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. When he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. I spent Sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on Monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling The Talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. The most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that \"I was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters\".... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that I was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. In the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. When I was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. The communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant. Fortuneatly the staff at the Signature Room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the The Talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests.

The bathroom was great it had been recently remodeled - it had a double sink and great counter space - the only complaint is that the tub/shower lacked any kind of shelf or soap dish. There are only about 10 rooms on each floor and the hallways were nothing special - once again it may be due to the renovation in progress but the floor I was on was extremely tired and dark. Other complaints included the heat/airconditioning and the room lighting. Since the seasons were beginning to change it was cool at night but warm during the day. Heat was supplied by an old iron radiator hidden under a radiatior cover - it's a good thing it was hidden - it was pretty nasty looking. To regulate the heat you had to lift the cover and turn the valve (not an easy thing to do in the middle of the night without getting burned). Once the heat started it never stopped. To cool the room there was a residential room type air conditioner mounted through the wall and a newer air conditioning unit with a thermostat that had a sign on it saying it was not yet operational - in any event I had all three going most days and nights and it was almost impossible to get the room to a comfortable temperature. I would assume once the new system with the thermostat is working - that things will improve.

It was one of the best decisions I've ever made to stay here. Right in the middle of all shopping and the cable car that takes you to Fisherman's Wharf. Staff were spectacular and super helpful. I got there right in the middle of rain, and of course, forgot my umbrella. The staff were in tune with this, and were able to point me in the direction of the closest store with umbrellas so I wouldn't get too wet (not that this was hard since the hotel is next to everything shopping!) I chose a room facing the street, which yes, there was some noise, as I was warned. But after living in many cities, the noise was not unreasonable. If you are not used to city life, do not choose a room facing the street. The room was small, but comfy. The king bed was soft, and inviting. The bathroom redone to a modern taste. My only complaint was that there was not enough counter/shelf space for my toiletries around the sink. There is free wifi, and every outlet you could possibly need for all your electronics. There was also an ipod dock for your alarm. Each afternoon, there is a \"cocktail\" waiting for you at the end of the front desk. On the weekend, it was a true cocktail. On the weekdays, just a nice fruity pick me up. Oh, and if you have the chance to have the continental breakfast included in the room, don't bother. I went the first day, and it was a croissant with a small cup of fruit, juice or coffee. Not much. I'd probably go to the Subway next door and get one of their breakfast sandwiches. Overall, I'd definitely stay there again when I go to SF again. It's around the corner from the cable car stop, and right next to the BART. Can't beat the location, great service, comfortable rooms...what more could you want? (ps. I did notice there were some umbrellas by the door when the weather became better. Perhaps a few more umbrellas for the guests to borrow would have been nice)", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wi", "Title": "\u201cWhat a find!\u201d", "Author": "maryjWi", "ReviewID": "UR127311453", "Content": "My husband and I and 27 year old son stayed here for 3 nights in a Junior suite, and there was a door between our king bedroom and the sitting area where our son slept on the sofa bed.

I had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel highly to visitors to San Francisco. First of all, the hotel has probably the most central and convenient location in San Francisco. Walk a block south and you're at the busy Powell Street-Market Street intersection. This area is a shopping and public transport hub for the city - there's a MUNI booth where you can buy public transport tickets, the main cable car stop for cable cars going north to Fisherman's Wharf and the Powell Street BART Station (where you can catch trains to and from San Francisco International Airport). A couple of blocks north and you're in the Union Square shopping and dining area. The hotel is boutique-style with 91 rooms. It's in a historic building (I'd say built around 1900-1920) which was totally modernized and renovated in 2008. The renovation is impressive - the hotel throughout is clean, fresh and slick with an attractive orange, grey and black themed decor. I particularly liked the gas fireplace area in the lobby - very enticing to lounge about in a San Francisco winter! I paid around $110 per night (it was a holiday special) and for that price, I was expecting a fairly nondescript convention-style hotel. To my surprise, however, my room was of a standard I would have expected to find in a much more expensive and luxurious hotel. My room was thoughtfully laid out to make the most of the space (it didn't feel cramped). It had an iPod player and radio (a bit fiddly to use though) on the bedside table and, best of all, a 42 inch wall-mounted LCD TV. A TV this large was a real treat and a credit to the hotel - far more expensive hotels I've stayed in have a 32 inch TV at best. The bathroom was spacious and looked very new and fresh. One delight was the L'Occitane toiletries - again a brand that would be at home in a more expensive hotel. The in-room WiFi was free, fast and worked well. The only negative about the room is that there was no climate control system in the room, only a window-mounted dual heating/air-conditioning unit. This worked well enough, but took a while to heat the room up on a cold San Francisco winter morning. Overall, though, my room was a pleasure to stay in. The hotel has a young staff who were warm and friendly. When I checked in, I was made to feel welcome and given a choice of rooms (one more spacious, but facing the street and therefore noisier, and one facing the inner courtyard and quieter but a bit smaller). I'm an independent sort of traveller so didn't need their assistance much but the queries I did have were handled promptly, professionally and with a smile.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "kkbrig", "ReviewID": "UR124966696", "Content": "My husband and 2 daughters stayed at the Hotel Abri Feb. 7-12.

I recently stayed at the hotel for 6 nights on a business trip. There were four of us in four rooms. First, the hotel is very clean and sits in an excellent LOCATION; but unfortunately, one colleague and I had to deal with an unpleasant odor in our rooms. It was significant enough that my co-worker demanded to be moved, which did happen; but to a noisy room. Noise was also a minor problem in some of the other rooms. I decided to rough out the smell and stay in my very quiet room. I combated the odor by keeping the windows open (windows that open, another benefit) and running the heater/ac unit - the rooms have a window unit for heating and AC. The window units might turn some of you off, but it worked for me. Other negative attributes are that my bathroom didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a counter and the bed was lumpy (my co-workers had counters in their bathrooms).

This is not a resort nor a spa - it is a downtown hotel in a major city. If you want shop and be near BART, MUNI, or even cable cars and don't want to spend a fortune then Abri is a smart choice. I travel for business and being close to public transportation and a wealth of food choices is paramount. Abri, as well as the other Larkspur properties, will not win any records for Internet speeds, but the wifi is free and more than enough for file transfers, browsing and email. The rooms on 5 can be a little musty (moreso than the 4th floor), but they are further away from the street. If you have stayed in a hotel in Chicago or NYC, the street noise is typical. If you are exting peace and quiet in a city hotel, then you definitely need to request a quiet room away from the street or stay at a larger hotel that can get you further away from the everyday hustle and bustle. Abri acknowledges the noise and does their best to compensate with fresh ear plugs and eye masks nightly. The adjoining restaurant is always busy (that's a good sign) and has happy hour pricing until late on Mon and Tue. It is noisy, but never rowdy - definitely a wine and cocktail crowd and while busy, is fine for those traveling with kids. The staff make a noted effort to get to know their guests and make them feel welcome. The evening complementary drink in the lobby is kid friendly during the week and adult only on the weekends. The suites are very spacious yet cozy with seperate spaces for sitting a sleeping. The TVs offer hookups for your own devices for movie watching if you brought your own. Their is comp coffee, tea and newspapers in the morning in the lobby (as David will be certain to remind you of as you exit). There is also a large selection of snacks and electronics for purchase in the lobby should you get hungry or forgot your charger. As someone mentioned, there are pan handlers out in front frequently - the staff does their best to move them along, but unless you stay on top of the hill at the Fairmont or somewhere else away from the busy shopping district, that is unfortunately the norm for San Francisco and should be expected.

If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend. Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job. Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead. The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition.

Everything about this hotel, from its prime location, to the intricate detailing and personal service, assure an exclusive experience of comfort and satisfaction. This hotel is completely and unpretentiously classy. It is an establishment knowingly providing personalised service and comfort to all guests. The Hotel Abri has been awarded a three and a half star rating, however this is indeed no reflection on the level of comfort and service provided, from check-in to check-out, and at all times between. When making a reservation, I often contact the hotel prior to my stay in order to make requests, ranging from high floor to quiet room location. On this occasion, my request was for the both of these, and I was very surprised to have been provided with a room that met these criteria. Check in was immediate, with no line to wait in. I was courteously checked in to my room by Tyler, who greeted me and offered his services during my stay. As mentioned, all members of staff are personable, and very approachable. I only had one other encounter with a member of staff: Jonathan, who followed through with my request almost immediately, and followed up with a call to ensure my request was taken care of. A few things worth noting are that the rooms are quite small, however this is commonplace in San Francisco, particularly the rooms being that of an older building. That being said, the room has been designed well, and there is sufficient room to move about as freely as required. Other (very minor and petty) points worth mentioning are that the showerhead was positioned at an uncomfortable angle, and the coffee was not replenished for the coffee machine throughout my entire four night stay. The lifts were also a little slow, but none of these points bothered me at all, really. It just may be worth mentioning for the benefit of others. I am not difficult to please, however when reviewing hotels, I always offer the rating that I would provide the hotel as an official rating. This hotel comes very close to the full five stars (I would award four and a half stars, given the opportunity, however this is not possible), even considering the fact that there lacks services common to establishments of such rating, such as a gym, spa or 24 hour room service. This is possibly as close to the full five stars that I have ever been, and this is comparing a three and a half star hotel, to many hotels that have been awarded a five star rating. It is for this reason that I will only choose The Hotel Abri when venturing to San Francisco.

This is a big winner for me every time! The Abri fit all my requirements as to location, cleanliness, and room function. Upon checking in I was advised that if the street noise was a problem I could change to a rear facing room. Although the street facing room was much larger, I decided that the garbage collection trucks at 3:30 AM did not work for me. My new room was perfect: but small. If you want to be in the heart of things (many do not) this is the place to stay, especially if you are on a limited hotel budget. I like city buzz and a quick walk to 24 hour bacon and eggs if the mood strikes. Be advised that San Francisco has a generous population of people who's main source of living is asking passers by for handouts. Know this in advance and try to go with that bit of SF \"color\".

I will start by saying that yes, the location of the hotel is great, but there are a lot of other \"true\" 5 star hotels that have great locations as well. The rooms themselves are quite small and had I been staying any longer, or travelling with luggage (I just had carry-on) I would have found the space to have been much too cramped. The room I received was facing the inside courtyard, so there was no obvious street noise which was nice, BUT, the rooms are not sound proofed at all! You can clearly hear doors shutting to other rooms, TV's in adjacent rooms, conversations as people passed by your door...If you're a light sleeper, good luck. The overall quality of the room wasn't much better either. It looked more like a cover up job, than a remodelling job. The door to the bathroom had chips and scratches all over it, the baseboards were cracked and had visible marks all over them, they had forgot to sand before patching something in the ceiling, the window sills were filthy and showing their age...Like I said before, not a 5 star. The front desk staff were pleasant, but had there issues as well. It is difficult to hail a cab from this particular hotel. The bellman/front desk agent actually gave up when I was trying to get a cab to go to AT&T park and referred me to the hotel across the road.

I frequently travel to San Francisco and try out the different boutique hotels around the city. When one of my usual picks was fully booked, I decided to try out the Hotel Abri based on its very high TripAdivsor ratings. Overall my stay at the hotel was average. I agree with some of the other reviewers in therms of the hotel strong points. The hotel staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. Out of all the boutique hotels in SF where I've had the opportunity to stay, this staff in particular stands out. When my first room did not meet my needs, the front desk staff did not hesitate to place me into another one and even offered me some honest caveats about my potential room switch (which I will detail later). The location is somewhat of a mixed bag. It is a big plus that it is located very close to the Powell Street cable car turnaround and Union Square. The minus is that the area can be noisy, and there is a popular club located across the street that, from what I understand, can get very loud late into the night. Why should noise be an issue? This leads me to my major point of contention with this hotel. I understand that it is a historic property, but I don't feel the owners made the necessary improvements to modernize it fully. I don't mean this in the sense of decor and style, which without question the Abri has sufficient. It's more in terms of the infrastructure. The rooms are small and updated, but it seems like certain things were left out of the update. Although the window face a busy intersection, there is not sufficient soundproofing. The first room I had faced onto the street, and when I was on the phone in my room, the person with whom I was speaking thought I was out on the street. Also, the air conditioner is mounted on the window, which blocks off half of the light coming in, making the rooms incredibly dim. Rooms also had a musty, old smell. I've stayed in historic hotels previously, and this was not a problem. However in the Abri the room always smelled musty and old even though it was completely redone. I found myself having to turn on the air conditioner to \"freshen up\" the room even though it was cool outside. And usually I'm alright with small rooms, but these rooms were some of the smallest in which I've stayed. If you're spending most of your time out of doors, it shouldn't be a problem, but be aware the rooms, especially interior facing rooms, are very tight with little room for suitcases. I'd probably not stay here again. I think this hotel is probably better for vacationers or younger tourists.

The hotel is near all the great (more commercial) shopping, but I was also able to hit up a few cool vintage stores(check out torso vintages). Food/nightlife: It's central b/t fisherman's up north and the castro, etc., south of downtown. Nearby, Seasons(steakhouse) is great, but you have to do a bit of dining research to avoid all the downtown tourist traps before stepping a foot in a restaurant(the hotel italian restaurant is quite tasty, as is L'ordoise-near Castro St./take Muni). If you're artistic, the nearby galleries south of the hotel are Amazing and are a great way to pass the afternoon. Breakfast: check out Dottie's True Blue Cafe(yum!) around the block.

Polite & friendly, we were offerend a complimentary drink when we arrived. We were checking into a room but when we arrived there housekeeping was just starting to clean it & basically just told us to go away. Went back downstairs & were appologized to & given a new room, however we were moved from the 5th floor to the 2nd floor, we were afraid this would be much noisier since it was NYE & there was a club just across the street. Overall the room was a good, a bit on the small side, but since we were going out it didn't seem like that big of a deal. It was very clean & well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. In the end we weren't really bothered by the noise & my husband liked the fact he could see the street and everyone going out on NYE from our window. What we were the most disappointed about was that when we wanted to check out the next morning & called down for our car (which we had valet parked - and were charged more for an \"oversized\" vehicle when it's really not that big) we were told that it would be 40 minutes or more to retreive our car. I realize that it was New Years Day, and everyone was checking out, but that seems odd to me. You know you're going to be busy so staff appropriately, don't be surprised when everyone \"wants their car at the same time.\" You do afterall have a checkout time. What was the most disappointing about this was that the front desk person was not appologetic or helpful about it at all.

Also the hotel is located in Union Sq, SF's main shopping area. This is a central location but personally after having explored SF I would have rathered stayed in some other areas, such as Nob Hill. Union Sq is busy, noisy and a little bit dodgy- lots of homeless people and just a few blocks in the worng direction from the hotel you end up in the Tenderloin which is SF's worst area for crime- I ended up having to visit the police station there after being pickpocketed on my way from the airport to the hotel! And one small gripe- we payed for bed and breakfast. The breakfast is provided by a restaurant next door to the hotel, and the set offer is for an american breakfast. I don't eat eggs or pork (which is basically what an american breakfast is) and asked if I could change to granola (which is $3 cheaper on the restaurants menu) and they refused as this was outside of the set deal that they have with the hotel.

The hotel itself left me feeling kind of 'meh'. It is perfectly nice and modern and we had no issues during our stay but it is maybe a little over-sold on their website. it is an older building that's been renovated but retains quite a few original features like interior doors and picture rails/skirting boards so the non-uniform room layouts and less convenient details (eg small wardrobe space in our room) are mainly due to that. The great TV, ipod dock, fridge, good coffee and decent hairdryer were all appreciated. The adjoining restauarant served great food but had slow service.

So tiy have the good and the bad- proximity to Union Square (and its bars - more on that in a second) and shopping, and a seedy element very nearby. I stayed there for two weeks in a row on two separate business trips. What I need is peace and qiuet at night - so I requested and got a top floor room in the interior of the hotel. The first week's stay was qiuet and uneventful and the staff is friendly. In San Francisco yo should not expect very large room sizes and you do not get one at the Hotel Abri. It is small, but comfortable enough. This week I stayed there again and things tun a bad turn. I am not saying that it is the hotel's fault, but after going to bed at 11 pm, I was awakened at 2:15 in the morning by loud talk and even shouting in the hallway outside my room. I was literally startled awake. I opened the door and asked the 2 men outside to please be quiet, I was rudely cussed at by one of them. I siad I was going to call security and he dared me to and threatened me. I closed the door and called the front desk. Here is where the hotel has to accept responsibility. The front deak person could have cared less. I asked for them to send up security and he said they didn;t have any and that he would call the police. I said yes please do so as the two men had entered the room next to me and were carrying on and partying very loudly, with knocks at their door from other men and a lot of shouting and drunken, foul language coming through the walls and door. Meanwhile, nothing from the hotel, no police, nothing. I was kept awake until 4 in the morning. Shame on the drunken louts who have no respect for anyone inclusing themselves, and shame on Hotel Abri for not protecting their guests from people like this.

They were very nice and accommodating. The great thing about that company was that they allow you to park in their garage just two short blocks from Hotel Abri.

There were only bedside cabinet/lighting facilities on one side of the king bed and on the no-light side, about a 6 inch gap between the side of the bed and the wall. That was a bit odd. It got very cold during the day and there did not seem to be a thermostat in the room. The kids in the 5th floor suite above partied hard but were gone by evening of day 2.

It was very comfortable and QUIET, which according to reviews I have read of other hotels, is not an easy thing to find in Union Sq. True to other reviews, the staff was FANTASTIC! The concierge, Hillary, was extremely helpful with booking transportation, tours, special arrangements, anything I asked. And the doormen/bellmen went above and beyond and make it a point to remember you by name. They all make an effort to be the best and it shows. And they have FREE Wi-Fi.....they get big points for that alone! The location was perfect, trolley, cable car turnaround, and BART are all literally around the corner. There is plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and a Walgreen's right around the corner for all those essentials you may have forgotten. There is an italian restaurant attached but we did not get a chance to eat there, although it smelled great and looked to be pretty full every night so that's a good sign. A BIG factor for me in reviewing a hotel is whether or not the beds are comfortable. If you've ever had an uncomfortable bed you know it can ruin a vacation. The beds here are outstanding in my opinion. Very comfortable and cozy. I gave the room 4 out of 5 because there were a few minor things I thought were lacking, such as no mirror outside the bathroom, and no full length mirror, and the towels, while they looked to be new, were not very soft. Also, we like it very cold when we sleep and the window AC unit struggled at times, but it did an ok job, it's not like it was hot outside so it was still comfortable. These are extremely minor things and it would not deter me from staying there again. I just feel there is a little room for improvement. Overall, for the price we paid we felt we got an amazing experience at Hotel Abri and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Union Sq. area. I walked down to the Westin for a masage in their spa and the lobby was so crowded and noisy, I was virtually unseen.

The rates were exremely reasonable considering the downtown location and weekend timetable. The Abri is just around the corner from the Powell Street BART station. We traveled for a week in California using only public transit, so the BART ride from the airport to the hotel was simple and fast. The cable car to Fisherman's Wharf departs a block away, as well. And the Market Street trolleys are equally convenient. One evening we bought ice cream at a nearby shop and just people-watched by the cable car turnaround for 20 minutes or so while licking our cones.Great show! It's also an easy walk to shopping, Chinatown and other notable neighborhoods. It is undeniably an urban location, on the edge of some scruffy blocks. There's a popular nightclub across Ellis Street from the hotel, plus you'll find San Francisco's plentiful \"street people\" represented in this 'hood, too.

Total cost for the food: Just $12. We spent more on wine than the food!). Our rooms were compact but efficiently laid out and stylishly appointed.

Bed, linens, bath, etc. excellent. Tourists and residents alike know that this area of SFO is very noisy. Coming back to my room was like visiting a private oasis of cushy silence. 5. No hitches with reservations, requests, etc. Some parts of the hotel could use a bit of renovation touch-up...paint here and there, door frames, wear & tear, carpet edges, etc. I didn't try the continental breakfast (minimal extra charge) but the set up looked nice. The hotel doesn't have a pool, fitness club, etc. if that's what you're looking for. They do, however, arrange for in-room yoga, massage, beauty facials, etc. for rather high prices. A very nice, comfortable stay overall.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wynn Vale, South Australia", "Title": "\u201cMonticello In - Great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4163817", "Content": "We selected the Monticello on the basis of our research on the Internet and in particular for its location to the BART. This enabled us to travel from the San Francisco International Airport to within about 150yds of the hotel. When we walked up the ramp from the BART to the the end of Powell Street we were blown away as it was our first time in San Francisco and with the cable car in front of us it was like being in a postcard. We also used Google Earth to check out its location within the city and its closeness to other facilities. The hotel was most acceptable given that we didn't want to spend our limited funds on expensive accommodation. Its location is superb. The hotel is an old hotel that has been refurbished but I wouldn't say modernised but it is clean and the staff are very friendly. The rooms are rather small but that didn't bother us as we spent most of our time out looking around the city. It is near to the corners of Market & Powell Streets which gives you immediate access to the cable car terminus, trams to the Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square and Maceys, The BART terminus and there are plenty of tourist shops and food stores nearby. If we went again we would definitely ask for a courtyard room because the noise on the street side rooms was terrible. We were jet-lagged after a trip from Australia so needed some good sleep but it was just not possible in the room we were in. So with that proviso we would definitely return.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWIll Be Returning to the Monticello\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4122786", "Content": "I travel to San Francisco on business every few months and am always looking for a better hotel deal. SF hotels are across the board on price and quality and you quickly learn that a higher price does not necessarily mean a nicer hotel or location. The Monticello Inn is well-located for tourists and business travelers alike: less than two blocks from Union Square and less than a block from the SF Mall (Nordstrom's, etc.), BART station, and several good restaurants, five to ten minute cab ride from civic center plaza or the business district. One of the biggest pluses of the Monticello (for those of us who like to have our best friends with us) is that they accept dogs (I believe the entire Kimpton chain accepts dogs). I arrived with my three 50+ pound dogs - no problem. At check-in the clerk even offered a free upgrade to a suite so that I could have more room for the dogs. Incredible; very appreciated. The suite was spacious, nicely decorated, very clean. After reading reviews here I requested an inside room and it was nice and quiet though the view is of the air vents. Staff was very friendly and always greeted my dogs as well as me. Continental breakfast in the morning for $6.50 is a true \"continental\" - just coffee, juice, muffins and fruit. I prefer more substance. Valet parking with in and out privileges for $29 is very reasonable for SF. Only complaint would be that valet was slow in retrieving car when I wanted it. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel and will be staying here again myself very soon.", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in the center of SF\u201d", "Author": "attractiveprof", "ReviewID": "UR3912827", "Content": "Not much to add to the previous reviews: A great location (BART, cable car, everything...)...nice decor...clean and pleasant rooms...friendly staff...wine reception...breakfast if needed (note that there are also many Starbucks around)...free wireless internet and newspaper.

Very clean room and bath. We were not able to attend their wine reception one night, and a nice man on staff was able to produce a glass for each of us. They provided continental breakfast vouchers for us. This proved a great time saver for us on the days that we just wanted to get out and get started on our sightseeing days. It was very handy to grab a muffin, croissant, juice and coffee as we hurried out for our busy days. I did not dine at the restaurant on site, nor did we order room service.

We chose the Monticello based primarily on Kimpton's pet friendly policies and the hotel's proximity to the Moscone Convention Center. We were graciously welcomed and our little dog developed a huge fan club. The front desk staff consistently went above and beyond the normal 3 star call of duty by providing us with directions - calling cabs - giving us restaurant recommendations and helping with reservations. They were also great about keeping our cell phone number on hand just in case our little dog got distressed and started barking or something during the few occassions we left him alone in the room. The room was average - nothing special though. We booked a Jefferson suite, so it was nice to have the extra space. The bathroom was a little worn and could use some updating, but it was clean and well kept during the course of our visit. I can't say I'm a big fan of the dispensers for soap and shampoo and whatnot, but I'm sure that the environment is (at least that's what the little sign said.) The only problem (and I can't say that it was an insignificant one) that we had with our room was street noise. We were on the second floor (the only pet friendly floor) and the noise was pretty bad. Being near an intersection, we heard a lot of sirens and brakes squealing. Every morning around 3 a.m., the street sweepers and trash trucks came through. The staff was apologetic and we realized, of course, that it was out of their control. They could not move us to another floor because of the dog and all of the inside rooms were already booked, so we made the best of it. Thankfully, we always travel with a white noise machine and that helped somewhat. We would definitely consider staying at the hotel again, but next time we would specify that we wanted a room as far away from the street as possible.", "Date": "August 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3609810", "Content": "I stayed at the Monticello based on reviews from Trip Advisor.

But they are clean and attractive. The location is unbeatable. Minutes to Union Square & around the corner from the trolly & BART (30minutes directly to the airport - unbelievable $$savings!!). The corner room I got was twice the size of the pictures posted here & the shampoo/conditioner/soap were high quality. Staff were very friendly - I never waited for service - early check-in/late check-out & they stored our bags while we were out of the room but not yet ready for our flight. The $6.50 per room! breakfast was well worth it for a quick morning snack. Much more affordable than the greasy $20 diner breakfast around the corner. My biggest complaint was that the air conditioning didn't work. HOWEVER - I was advised that the entire hotel would have new units by Aug05.

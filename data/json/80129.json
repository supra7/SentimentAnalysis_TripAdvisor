While the bed was a little too soft for me, it was perfect for the other members of my family. The bathroom was spacious and the shower amazing. The water pressure was just the way I like it. The only frustration with the room is the lack of electrical outlets bedside. It made it difficult for me to charge my cell phone and lay in bed which is something that I like to do.

This hotel definitly facilitated that need. The bed is , quite honestly, the best I have ever slept on. They use duvets instead of those awful bed cover-things older hotels use. The pillows are full, firm but comfy. The staff cleaned well and clearly left 'our stuff' alone. There is a fidge in the closet and grocery stores nearby (not walking distance though) to get any special items you may want or need. The hotel is right by the hwy 163 junction so getting anywhere is really relatively easy. The staff were very helpful, courteous, efficient and happy. All the staff seemed to genuinely like working there which says a lot to me about how they will do their jobs. They always had hot coffee and water available as well as coffee maker in the room. It was just easier to go downstairs and get water when it was already done for us. Though this hotel is rightnear the freeway and airports,it is very quiet (I am very noise sensitive) and we had a real restful visit. The staff were very knowledgable about the city and had great tips for where to eat, shop, site see etc. We stayed a week at this hotel and every day it was the same, quiet, calm, happy. There was a shriner's convention staying there on the weekend and we did not hear anything from them. Breakfasts were from 6 am-10 am and always had eggs and another hot item, waffles ( not eggo, real ones!) Fresh fruit, various cold cereals, real hot porridge, bagels, muffins, toast, english muffins and more. Juice, milk, coffee and tea. The breakfast lady is very nice and works hard to keep it well stocked and fresh. The eating aa is not that large but also not cramped and it seemed to work. There is no hot tub but the pool is beautiful and clean. Parking was easy and a gas station is litterally 2 doors down from the hotel. Though this hotel is not downtown, I would rather stay here as a 'hub' for my trip than get stuck in downtown traffic every day. I hope you find this helpful and you enjoy your stay as much as we did.

I visited Christmas weekend, and there was a beautiful Christmas tree in the lobby, and I was wished a Merry Christmas that morning by a staff member passing in the hall-very nice!

My family has always had good experiences with Hampton Inns, and this one is the best so far. Access is a breeze from the airport or driving in - on California SR163 at Clairemont Mesa Blvd, just south of SR52. Torrey Pines/La Jolla is just 20-30 mins away depending on traffic, ditto for downtown/airport/Balboa park so the location was ideal. Lots of free parking. We had two different rooms, both about the same - only difference was a queen in one and two doubles in another. Otherwise the rooms were spotless, fresh clean linens on those great Hampton beds, fridge in the closet for water etc. Big flat screen TV and WiFi (access code is printed on the sleeve containing the room key cards). Normal outside pool, two PCs to use for email etc. in the lobby, printer available on request. Nicely equipped fitness centre. Breakfast, also as usual, very nice - fruit, juice/coffee, cereal, milk, \"make your own waffles\", really nice doughnuts, as well as bagels and some sort of egg/breakfast meat dish (omelettes/sausage, scrambed eggs with bacon, etc. - different every day). Typical for Hampton Inn and one of the reasons we like the chain. Always hot, reasonable quality and there were three ladies keeping everything moving because this is a VERY busy hotel on weekends. Where this hotel shone, however, was in the staff. Everyone was friendly, consummately professional, and very patient but \"Robert\" was truly exceptional. Friendly, knowledgeable (we took him up on his dinner recommendations and weren't disappointed once) he is a treasure and my wife and I truly are big fans of his. He even loaned us his personal bottle-opener when we bought a celebratory bottle of wine and forgot that we didn't have one ourselves! Kevin and the ladies in the morning (never got their names) were also wonderful. Also, the hotel has a big binder full of pre-printed MapsQuest and Google Map directions from/to the hotel and different attractions in the city, and for the most popular ones (airport, Sea World, La Jolla Cove etc.) they have little index cards - on one side how to get TO the attraction - flip it over and you have directions on getting from the attraction back to the hotel. Wonderful. We were worried about not staying near the beach, but the central location of this hotel and the world class care the staff take care of their desks, plus the usual, though in this case EXCELLENTLY executed services common to the Hampton Inn brand make this an excellent choice for a day, a week or even a month's stay.

My issue arose when I discovered my work colleague had booked a double-double and I, a king-bedded room ... with our rate varying by $10. When I asked for a minor variance on rate, so we could bill identical hotel charges to our client, the kind desk staff referred me to the GM. I know she was the General Manager not just by her namebadge, but by her clear need to announce her title to me. She promptly corrected my adjective, ensuring I now know that a $10 variance in rate is not \"minor.\" She then declined my request. I felt this was unacceptable, to which her fallback position was to raise my colleague's rate by $5 and lower mine by $5. I was then lectured on how \"incredibly busy and sold out\" the hotel was. My response was (an admittedly toothless) threat to check out, given that her hotel is \"so busy\" she could re-sell my room to another guest at a higher rate. She seemed perfectly content if I were to have elected that option. The feedback I left with Hilton Worldwide was met with an auto-response e-mail about how important my business is and a promise to get back in touch ... but I haven't heard anything.

If they didn't have a card, they used Google Maps to create the directions.

The lobby is very nice. The breakfast area is small. I don't think they had a full house the nights that we stayed, but had it been the middle of summer it would have been a tight squeeze in the area provided for the breakfast. The food was typical buffet style with DIY waffles, etc. The fresh fruit was definitely a nice touch! We had leftovers to heat up for lunch from the previous night's stay and the staff allowed us to use the microwave in the pantry area. That evening we wanted coffee, but didn't want to drive anywhere....we called downstairs and the gentleman on staff that evening told us he was just finishing up making fresh coffee and had cookies waiting for us! What a nice surprise to wind down the evening. The pool looked really refreshing, but we didn't bring our swimsuits to enjoy it. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the San Diego area. It is fresh, clean and the staff is wonderful. It's only 6 miles from Hotel Circle, where the prices can be almost double during certain times of the year, not to mention this property has FREE PARKING!!!! Only a short 15 drive to anywhere you want to go while in San Diego. I also HIGHLY recommend Filippi's Pizza Grotto in Little Italy. There is a location near the hotel, but we were told by the waiter at the Little Italy location that that location is owned by someone else and the Little Italy location is the original. Upon stepping inside the smell was AMAZING! I knew it would be a great restaurant...and it was. The *best* homemade sausage I have ever tasted!

The room also has a desk, a large LCD tv, a pull-out sofa, a full length mirror, and an alarm clock radio. The comfortable and spacious bathroom (wonderful shower!) is stocked with toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also has a hair dryer that is not attached to the wall, which makes it convenient if you want to dry your hair watching tv while someone else uses the bathroom. There is a coffeemaker also, with sugar, cream and coffee packets. There is free breakfast every morning, and even though it can get a bit crowded (mainly 8-9am), it does offer an assortment of breads, bagels, donuts, eggs, sausage, waffles (make your own), instant oatmeal, coffee, tea, juice, and hot chocolate. I really enjoyed the breakfast and if it's crowded, you can always take it back to your room. As another review pointed out, the staff keeps the area clean and well stocked. If they start to run low, the friendly staff will gladly help you get what you're looking for. There is a meeting room and a fitness center also located on the main lobby floor. The fitness center offers a variety of options to work out as you overlook the pool area. Besides the location next to freeways, there are plenty of restaurants, a market, fast food options, and a Walmart down the road. It is also located right next to a gas station. My room was on the second floor and had no complaints about the noise levels or lights.

There are a few restaurants down the road from Panda Express to Subway. Check in and out was easy, quick and professional - hotel was extremely clean. Only minor flaw was that there is some sort of convention center behind the hotel and they were having a loud concert of some sort for a while - other than that it's an absolutely fantastic place!", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cQuite Surprising\u201d", "Author": "Jaid96", "ReviewID": "UR50084808", "Content": "I would normally consider a Hampton Inn a 2 star type of hotel, but this hotel was far better then I expected.

This was a perfect choice as it is conviently located next to the highways used to get there and about a 10 minute drive. Our room had two double beds so there is NO pull out sofa bed. The beds were comfy (pillow top) I was afraid it would be too soft as I have back problems but I woke up pain free. One bed had synthetic pillows and the other bed has feather pillows. We booked 5 in the room. They do NOT have roll away beds here. The little one slept in the chair with footrest as it was big enough for her. They were kind enough to bring extra blankets and sheets for it. The 42\" plasma TV in the room was GREAT! Although they do have wi-fi, they still provide a computer in the lobby for anyone to use which had the biggest monitor I have ever seen. It looked like our Plasma TV in the room. There is a mini fridge in the room. I did miss the microwave as at another Hampton Inn they not only provided one but also popcorn! That was missed. The lobby is beautiful with a very large aquarium that separates check-in from the breakfast area. There are about 7 tables to eat at. Also two sitting areas with sofas. One secluded area with sofas sported another Plasma TV .The food was great for a continental breakfast. It included cereal, fresh fruit (apples, bananas, mixed cut up fruit), yogurt, toast, muffins, eggs, ham, donuts, bagels, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit juices and milk in an all you can eat display. It was crowded on our morning but many seemed to be going to the Air Show like us and were on the same schedule. Some took it to their rooms instead since seating was sparce for a time being. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate were available at night. I wish there had been some cookies to munch on. :) It has a nice workout area. I counted 14 machines. It overlooks the pool and of course, sports another large Plasma TV. The pool was ordinary but it was steaming warm while raining outside. Staff was very friendly. Parking convenient and free. Yes, there are two nudie bars down the street. But far enough away that it didn't spill over into this area. Next door to the hotel is another hotel and on the other side, condos. Also on the same street is a Souplantation, Cocos, Walmart, a grocery store, Starbucks, McDonalds, LA Fitness ( a very large and nice one) and several others places to eat. I was most impressed with the cleanliness. Super Clean! Everything seemed brand new. And, the owners of this hotel even sent a nice thank you card to our home afterwards. Impressive again.

They also have a small, small Korean town with good restaurants and small stores. We love Korean food and found the prices comparable to home.

But inside, the lobby is quite nice, has a guest computer terminal and printer available, and the staff was very friendly, even at near-midnight. The room itself was lovely, had a 42\" HD plasma TV, and a VERY comfortable pillow-top bed. Our daughter (a young adult, not a child) also got a good night's sleep on the sofa-bed. The bathroom was interesting - very nicely decorated, with granite countertop, brushed nickel faucet, Rainhead shower with bowed curtain rod, and water-saving fixtures, but the sink counter was unusually high, probably around 38\", with open shelves below. Everything except the Kleenex holder and the little toiletries were on the shelves. The blow-dryer, coffee-maker, ice bucket and cups were way down on the bottom shelf near the floor. The towels were stacked on the middle and upper shelves, but there weren't any towel rods for hanging them up after use. Breakfast was a treat, especially nice since it's compimentary. Their \"hot\" items included sausage patties and French toast sticks (no eggs), and they also provided fresh fruit (both whole apples and bananas and a \"salad\" of cut-up melons and grapes), yogurt, cereals, hot water for tea and/or instant oatmeal, several pots of coffee (including \"robust\"), whole and low-fat milk, real half-and-half, juices, and a nice variety of breads, bagels, muffins and pastries. The dining area was also larger than most, with plenty of tables as well as sofas and chairs near another TV. Some of the staff is strangely misinformed about what the hotel offers, however. After I booked the room online, I called the hotel directly to ask if they provided feather pillows. The girl who answered said, \"No,\" so we packed our own. When we arrived: feather pillows on the bed. A nice surprise, but it was frustrating that we'd wasted luggage space. Since we weren't going to arrive until close to midnight, and would be tired after a very long day of driving, I also called ahead to ask if they would kindly pre-make the sofa-bed for our daughter (I figured my Hilton Honors Silver VIP status should be worth SOMETHING!) Sarah, the hotel manager, assured me it would be taken care of. When we got to the room, though, the sofa-bed still looked like a sofa, so I called the front desk to see if we had been given the correct room, explaining the sofa-bed promise. He answered, \"Our rooms don't have sofa-beds.\" Huh? Anyway, when we opened up the sofa-bed, it was made up and ready to go. So - kudos to Sarah the manager!

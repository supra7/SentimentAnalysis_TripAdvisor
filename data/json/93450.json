Looks like the lobby has been renovated fairly recently and it is pretty nice, though not very smartly utilized. The hotel lobby shop is convenient and has a good selection of drinks and snacks. The lobby bar is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive, even by New York standards. I was shocked because it was just an average hotel bar. The rooms are hit or miss. On one occasion, I had a small room with the bed very close to the front door - you could hear every voice or footstep in the hallway. The second time I had a larger room and the noise level was a bit better. Both times the bathrooms were horribly crowded and poorly designed. The glass shelf over the sink prevents you from being able to wash your face and splash water to rinse it. There was very little counter space for toiletries. Both times the heating/cooling system was inadequate. On one stay it was scorching hot warm in the room and it simply wouldn't cool down (this was in the winter!). In the end, I wouldn't stay there again.

Having said that, my last stay there was probably my least pleasant one, and there were some glitches. First, upon arriving at about 9:00 pm on a Tuesday night, I was informed that class of the room I had booked well in advance--one with a king bed--was not available, and that I would have to take one with two double beds instead. Because double beds tend to be 6' long and I'm 6'4\", it isn't comfortable for me to sleep in a bed in which my feet hang over the edge--which is why I reserved a king--so I objected to this. The desk clerk did accomodate me, and moved some other unlucky guest's reservation from a king to double beds, and gave me their reservation instead. Upon arriving at my room (on one of the lowest guest room floors--the 14th, if I recall correctly), I was disappointed to see that it was much smaller than the rooms I had been given in the past (though still pretty spacious by typical Manhattan hotel standards), and that dit had only one tiny window facing the center of the hotel that was always in shadows, so even at high noon there was no natural lighting and the room was extremely dark without all the lights turned on. But worse, there was a distinct cigarette smell, despite the room being on a non-smoking floor. I went down to the front desk to notify them of this--not so much to complain as to let them know that the smell was there when I arrived so that nobody accused ME of the being the one to smoke in the room, and the desk clerk apologized and said that he could probably move me to another room the next day, but not that night. He also gave me a $60 food credit to the hotel restaurant for the inconvenience, which was nice, so I enjoyed a nice dinner. The next morning, the smoke smell seemed to be gone, so I didn't ask to be moved. But when I arrived back at the room that night, the smell was back--and that was the pattern the next couple of days of my stay, too. I assume that there is a smoking floor/room directly above or below that one, and the smell seeps in at night when there's been enough smoking on that floor throughout the day, and dissipates overnight when people are sleeping and not smoking. Otherwise, the room was as comfortable and quiet and I have come to expect from this hotel, and as always, you can't beat the location and nearby amenities. Though this wasn't the best stay I've had here, I think this was an abberration, and I won't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boca raton, florida", "Title": "\u201cAt The Crossroads of the World\u201d", "Author": "LSK09", "ReviewID": "UR126738197", "Content": "The newly renovated Grand Hyatt above Grand Central Station in New York City is a very exciting place to stay.

Nevertheless, the upgrade option was rather disappointing, it was 2 rooms but had no desk or work area nor did have a \"comfy chair\". Instead it had what looked like a kitchenette table with a cushioned bench seat and extra TV. So i switched back to my original room. Again it has a modern decor. Room size was pretty good for NYC and bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was also modern. It was a little small compared to the room itself but still functional and fine.

The picture is actually worse when you try to use an HD TV without HD channels 2) The set up could have used a little more practical design. The desk area has a single outlet and one of the receptacles was taken up by the lamp. The night table also had one outlet and one of the receptacles was taken up by the Ihome clock radio plug which unfortunately obscured the other receptacle.

This time, we got a great online deal through Orbitz for what we originally planned as a one night stay. We changed our minds and stayed the entire weekend. Check in was a breeze and we were given a Grand King room on the 26th floor, away from the elevators, and at the end of the hallway. Our room was a nice size (we've paid more for much less space ... it is New York after all), with a sitting area featuring a sofa, table and chair perfect for a spreading out some work papers and a laptop. We had a roomy closet, and a very comfortable bed, the kind you love sinking into after a day out in the city. Nice touch having room lighting and temperature controls built into the headboard, along with individual reading lights. Two windows looked out onto other buildings, but that wasn't a problem. (We only looked out to check sky for weather anyway.) The bathroom was clean, and yes as others will say, a bit on the smallish side. The sink is a little hard to get to, with the shelf directly above it. Shower was good size, with adjustable/sliding showerhead. Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, hairdryer and toothpaste were provided. Would we have liked a coffee maker in our room? Yes, but coffee was available (as well as many other food items) in the downstairs 24/7 \"market\". We really appreciated the market, when we got caught in rain walking back from a show and grabbed some steaming hot chocolate and some sweets before heading to our room. Our original plan was to stay for only one night, see a show and go. We asked the front desk what it would cost to stay an additional night and it was only $20 more than our rate, and we could stay in the same room. Still a bargain! The Hyatt was running a limited time sale on rooms, and we were able to take advantage of that. (Not bad at all, considering the Orbitz rate was no longer available ... in fact, it jumped back up another $100.) The staff were very friendly and helpful. We went online ourselves and purchased tickets for another show, after consulting with the concierge for suggestions. Hotel brokers can be a bit pricey, so we didn't go that route. The location of the Grand Hyatt is great, right next to Grand Central Station. The Oyster Bar is in the station, just a few turns down a hallway and that alone can be the one single reason to stay here ... proximity to this wonderful place. We walked to the two different theaters with no problem, and in less time than we expected. This was a theater weekend, so sightseeing or shopping weren't our focus but given that, if we wanted to see sights, the Hyatt's location is very convenient. We'll definitely stay here again! I gave 4 stars, as we didn't use or visit any of the other hotel amenities ... fitness center, pool, or even visit the bar or restaurant.

It took almost as long for the water to heat up as it took me to take the actual shower.

The elevators were reasonable and the public space in the lobby is beautiful but not comfortable or ample for the people using the space. The fitness center was awesome, clean with everything you need. There was an attendant on duty during peak hours. This hotel should be ashamed of the price gouging in their take away market in the lobby. $7.50 for a bagel that you have to toast yourself is offensive, There is no free wifi in the lobby and the daily charge for wifi is $12.95 or $16.95. In this day and age these type of charges are not cool. In Grand Central Station there is both a market and a food court.

We were a party of 9 all travelling together. The hotel was perfectly situated right on 42nd Ave, yards from Grand Central Station. On arrival the hotel was ok, not as grand as I'd expected but ok. At checkin it emerged that we had been put on different floors despite my request that we all be close to each other. Eventually this was resolved and they managed to find us a floor where we could all be together. The first thing I noticed was that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in any of the rooms, the second was the smell of damp in all 3 rooms, The rooms were ok, not as clean as I would have hoped for and thankfully there was no sign of bed bugs - we did look, the bed was really comfy though. The staff in the hotel Market Place food area weren't very friendly and didn't seem too keen to heat up the baby's food when we asked. I certainly wouldn't reccommend eating there or stopping for a coffee, their chicken nuggets were $2 each (gasp) and when we asked for 2 for the baby, we were told that ther minimum we could buy was 5, $10 for 5 chicken nuggetts! Prior to arrival I called the Hotel restaurant to book our Christmas meal and was told (quite abruptly) that they were too busy to take my booking there and then but that it would be ok to book when we arrived. The day after we arrived we went down to the restaurant to book, only to be told that they were fully booked, but if we went back on Christmas Eve they would find us a table, we did this only to be told that they were full and couldn't sit us for dinner, at this point I was really peed off and in no uncertain terms, made my feelings known. Low and behold they managed to conjour up a table for 9. To be honest come Christmas day I wished we hadn't bothered, the lunch was the worst meal I've ever had in a hotel/restaurant. Not a sprout in site, no parsnips and believe it or not, no roast potatoes. On our plate we had a piece of goose on top of some stuffing with a portion of braised red cabbage to the side and gravy, no colour to the meal apart from brown. Pudding was sticky toffee pudding and ice cream. 2 of our party were vegetarians and there wasn't even a veggie option available, we had to ask for pasta with tomato sauce so they had something to eat. Twice the maid service entered our room in the morning before 8am waking us up to clean the room. I couldn't believe, it before 8 am? We also had an incident where someone entered my son's room while we were out, put his case on ythe bed and rumaged through it, nothing was stolen and the hotel couldn't find a record of an entry to their room. The corridors are quite dirty and food trays are left outside rooms for days, the carpets need hoovering more often as well. Finally, the hotel actually charges $2 per case, if you want to store your baggage there after checkout, they didn't charge in Dubai.

I actually loved that GCS is like its own little city -- or really an indoor mall (it reminded me of the underground in Crystal City, VA except GCS is above ground). It has shops (had to scoop up some shoes at Camuto), restaurants, food court, news stands, gourmet market, etc. Everything you might need w/o having to put a coat on in winter, including a ride to wherever else in NY you want to go via subway or train. Restaurants are good, drinks at the Campbell Apt. v. romantic. I never thought a place I would feel most comfortable in NYC running about would be Grand Central Station! I was a little incredulous that you could be right next to GCS w/o noise as other reviews said, but it is true. We stayed on the club level (I think it was 16th fl) and we never heard a sound from GCS, the street, or other rooms. Very quiet so good night's sleep here. Nothing but good things to say. There was a slight mixup with the room on checking in -- we were told on the phone that our Grand Deluxe King was the room with the wood floors on the website, but were informed that this was not true on check in. They did do some checking and after a bit of hassle put us in the large king with the wood floors afterall. We were very happy about that. It was like a studio apt. with a walk in closet, separate foyer/entry, sitting area, desk area, and bedroom area. We thought it was spacious for NYC and well appointed.

After reading reviews I was slightly concerned but I cannot fault the hotel at all. Its in a fantastic location within walking distance of major attractions and direct access to Grand Central station which is an attraction itself. We checked in using the automated service and were very disappointed with our room due to its gloomy location. We asked for another room and the receptionist was very helpful and although we were 3 hours early for usual check in time she found us a lovely large room with a wonderful view on the 28th floor so it was very quiet. It was light and modern with two double beds. Nothing was too much trouble from any of the staff. They were all extremely helpful and friendly. The concierge gave out good information, very helpful. No coffee machine but when I asked they brought one up straight away no charge. Theres a fridge and safe again no charge like some hotels do. Great shower always hot water. Plenty of toiletries so I dont know how people can complain about that. Who needs them anyway? Good gym although we were too exhausted to use it! Nice cafe around the corner for breakfast and drugstore nearby if you want to fill the fridge with beer, wine,water.The only negatives were the price for internet access although it was free to use for airline check in. Also you have to pay $2 per bag to store your bags if you have a later flight but they are locked away safely. I wouldnt hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone and cant understand anyone who could find fault. We had an amazing holiday and picked up lots of tips from the guides on the hop on hop off bus tours. Not only are they extremely informative about NY they give great tips how to save money and places to visit. Must things to do are visiting Jersey Gardens which is an outlet with loads of designer shops. About 40 minutes bus ride costing about $11 return. Hollister and Abercrombie and Fitch were almost giving stuff away. We bought over 30 items for around \u00c2\u00a3130. We were told of a rooftop bar near the empire state building. It was just amazing with fantastic views opposite the empire. There are heaters and red hooded cloaks to wear. I had a manhatten cocktail, pricey but well worth it because of the whole experience. A great eating place is Ellens Stardust diner. The food was good and the atmosphere fun and unique. All the waiters and waitresses are wannabe performers who all take turn to sing great songs as they dance around the room and entertain you. We had dinner and breakfast there and loved it. Half price tickets for shows are best purchased down at the south shore harbour office as there are no queues like Times Square. Phantom was amazing. Tonys Italian restaurant had the most delicious food we ever tasted and very reasonably priced. They serve platters and they will halve them for two people. Planet Hollywoods were also good for breakfast and dinner. We visited Ground Zero. We booked online first, no charge and saved us having to wait around as you go at a set time. It is very moving and emotional though. The tranquil setting makes it very difficult to imagine the carnage that went on there. Personally I felt it was something I had to do to pay my respects to all who were injured and died there. NY is an amazing place.

We flew in from Heathrow to JFK and decided to transfer in an iconic yellow cab! This was a flat rate $45 plus tolls and it took about an hour. We pulled up right outside the hotel but the name is on the side walls and can only be seen from further down the road so the cab driver had to direct us! Our first impressions were great, open, airy and smart looking. Thank fully we were not dived on by porters hoping for a tip and we got to take our own bags in which was fine as we had little luggage and didn't want to be tipping already - tight I know but we were on a budget. They have a lots of staff milling around but we did find that they don't offer help you have to ask for it. Self service check in desks which were great but very impersonal and rooms are easy to find. They have several lifts up and we never had a problem with them. We were the 17th floor and overlooking the rear roof so nothing spectacular but it was quiet. Our room. This was our first disappointment. It had a nice tiled area immediately as you walk in with a double wardrobe and full length mirror. Going into the room we had two double beds and a bathroom with a half height bath with shower, toilet and basin. This was great until you started to use things.....the toilet was cracked, there were several large chips out of the bath, there was toothpaste dribbling down the shelf, we had to ask for more towels despite the booking being for four, no tea and coffee making facilities, no bottled water or mini bar, ripped bed linen, dirty decorative cushions, only two pillows per bed, the reading light from one of the beds was missing and the hole had been gaffer taped! The rooms also had touch lights and the night light function didn't work. We booked through lastminute.com and wondered if this was one of their allocated rooms and so you get a bit of a raw deal?! It was a shame as in comparison to a four star in the UK and the Hyatt name we were gutted. Arguably we could have complained and perhaps been allocated a new room but we'd checked in at 2.30pm, dropped our bags in the room and went straight out to explore. All of this was discovered on return at 9pm when we were to tired to think about doing anything. The room was clean and liveable so we just got on with it. The location is fabulous. There are doors from the lobby straight into the passage for grand central station and it's within easy walking distance of Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Center and Times square. Once you start walking there is so much to see it's hard to stop but this place is huge and if you're a keen walker then navigating and distance is so simple once you get the hang of the streets and avenues. However, the subway is also easy and very cheap; they only sell ten trips, weekly or monthly tickets on the subway. The weekly was $29. We didn't eat in the hotel as breakfast was not included in our tariff but McDonalds was just up the road and Pershing Square was almost opposite and although a little on the expensive side it was nice! The hotel had a mini market in the lobby where you could pick up fruit, water, soda, beer, wine, sandwiches, salads, hot drinks etc at a premium but it's convenient. The hotel charge a $2 fee per bag to hold at the hotel for the day. We travelled back to the airport via a shuttle bus that operates just across the road from the hotel. We paid $46 and it goes every 15 minutes. We bought the tickets directly from the bus company but they can be purchased from the hotel lobby. We also discovered my husband had lost his wallet when we got to the airport security; on contacting the hotel they were extremely unhelpful and we were passed from pillar to post and were very unsympathetic. This also happened when we contacted them on returning to the UK.

The hotel was cleaned everyday and we were given new toiletries & towels every day, the room was very spacious with a closet to store cases, iron and ironing board & also a combination safe which you can set yourself. There was temperature control in the room which we didn't actually need as the room was warm enough. We had a view of the street and grand central from our room and the window could open.

Shower was not very hot and sometimes would take a good minute to warm up. It seemed as though the hot water system was underrated. 7. Basin difficult to use due to shelf above it 8. No tea/coffee making facilities in room 9. Charge for internet usage - hotels need to wake up to what the modern world requires - should be free 10. Didn't eat in the hotel once - the restaurant was too expensive for breakfast. Ate at Pershing Square (100 feet up the road) which was a good meal at a reasonable price. 11. Great location with easy access to subway via Grand Central Terminal 12. Mini-market in the hotel was useful but expensive. Better and cheaper options located in Grand Central.

They took the old Trump Hyatt Gold gaudy glitz and buried it.In its place is a world class dramatic lobby of today and tomorrow that clearly is in keeping with more of the Grand Hyatt architecture and design tradition more so of Hyatt International standards. Check in Reception Excellent and highly hospitable with can do anything attitude The new and inspired club lounge inside and out is simply sensational looking. It ranks up there with the slickest looking executive lounges I have seen anywhere in the world. In nice weather they even have an outdoor deck to enjoy the offerings outdoors. Brilliant! The silly dead butterflies on display seem odd to me inside the lounge and I'll assume some decorator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weird idea of what would go well in the new lounge. The club is now located on the 16th floor (previously the 31rst floor) and only there did they do really do a hard renovation to the hallways and immediate areas entering the club. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a welcome refresh. It would have been cool to follow through on every floor.....Relocating the lounge on the 31rst floor was a good idea as the elevators are poor and take a considerably long time to get up to that floor. Especially when the hotel has high occupancy. The hotels elevators are looking worse for wear and they are the same small cramped elevators. One would hope they are slated for replacement or refurbishment. The club lounge closes for breakfast at 9:30 AM in the morning For those of us coming from other time zones especially International guests this seems uncaring and insensitive. The breakfast is satisfactory however the hotel should pay more attention to baking quality and variety of offerings as the previously did in the past. Evening offerings are now very minimal also compared to years past. The beverage selection is outstanding Accommodations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The folks at check in couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more hospitable and welcoming They upgraded me to a nice jr suite as a Hyatt Diamond long time guest Unfortunately it was very noisy on a mid level floor facing 42nd street. I liked my room otherwise. The caring good folks here yet upgraded me further to a quieter larger suite where I had a wonderful one night stay overall after moving. I really appreciated the small refrigerator that they now have in every room! The unexpected upside here to the new rooms is though the bed is a platform (not a fan of such beds typically) it appears Hyatt has indeed found a mattress that can disguise how firm the platform bed really is. One gets a satisfactory enough night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Housekeeping overall needs a little more attention to detail. It seems that they are rushed to finish their duties leaving some small unattended concerns. Mind you it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in the acceptable range The Grand Hyatt New York Executive Club lounge was in years past the Gold standard of club lounge offerings they do need to step up their game less on presentation which is excellent and more on substance. It would bring me back more frequently. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope for more continued improvement certainly the hotel has been made more desirable.My thanks to the hotel for recognizing Gold Passport members. This is where the hotel still shines Guest Program recognition. The Hyatt may not be the best choice in town but it still remains on my very possible list every time I come into town depending on rate which frequently can be wildly overpriced. The Grand Hyatt is dependable overall and the location can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. Experiences will widely vary due to size of property and a very different array of room types. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a great renovation it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an adequate one and a hotel after many years is now looking better. The hotels management has changed a number of times over the course of the years. What's great about the hotel is Hyatt finds some remarkable individuals that always seem to care about the customer with or without issues that can arise. Even though challenges remain at this hotel at times I continue to return thanks to the caring team that helps you to forget this is a large convention hotel with 31 floors and over 1000 plus rooms. Just think how hard it must be to manage all guest expectations. They do reasonably well despite the service bumps along the road. Thank You Grand Hyatt for many years of caring service at the end of the day and taking good care of me! Kudos too for being interactive with your customers/customer service online and off!

Staff members were all pleasant and helpful - from check-in to check-out everyone we encountered was wonderful. Just one thing that I didn't care for: The new lobby - I'm sorry Hyatt, I love you but the new lobby is pretty non-functional. The Jetsons chairs look great but have you noticed that all of the guests have to practically fold in half to get in and out of them, and everyone looks hunched over? I normally love to grab a cup of coffee and a muffin at the Marketplace and sit in the lobby to check my email/messages and get ready for the day - it's something I look forward to usually. I just couldn't do it during this stay. Even the bench seats look great, but again, not very comfortable. They barely come up to my shins - I should have just sat on the floor. I'm hoping that these become accent pieces and the real lobby furniture is still on order?? So, bottom line I still highly recommend the Grand Hyatt to anyone travelling in NY.

For those who prefer a taxi, you can catch a cab right outside the door. Most importantly for us, the shuttle bus that goes to/from LaGuardia and JFK was literally across the street. It was a simple and cheap way to get to/from the airport. Being connected to Grand Central had a lot of perks, including having several coffee shops and restaurants as well as a food market in the same building. There was a Rite Aid pharmacy and even a MAC Cosmetics in the Grand Central shops as well. The area directly around the hotel had a lot of shopping and a few restaurants and bars. There are more \"nightlife\" type spots a few blocks north and south of the hotel (not exactly walking distance in the winter, but maybe in the warmer months). The hotel itself was very nice. I booked a Queen room, but when we checked in I asked if we could get upgraded in some way and we quickly received a room with a king size bed and a \"view.\" The view wasn't phenomenal, we could see the reflection of the Chrysler building and I think it was the best we could get in that area. The room was definitely big enough for 2 people. (I was worried after reading how small NYC hotel rooms can be.) The room had a closet, ironing board/iron, small couch and table, iPod docking station/alarm clock, hair dryer, toiletries and toothpaste. The best part was the shower. The shower head was a large square with amazing water pressure and felt like being in a rain shower. Honestly, it was probably the best shower I've used in a hotel in recent memory. The only negative comment I have about this hotel is that on the last night we were there, the front desk accidentally booked someone else in our room and issued him room keys. We were watching TV when he literally walked right in. I called the front desk right away and they were very apologetic and offered to move us to a new room immediately. We declined to move since it was our last night and we didn't want to move all of our stuff, but they did make us new keys and the front desk manager was extremely helpful. Aside from that, we had a great stay. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.

The hotel was cleaned everyday and we were given new toiletries & towels every day, the room was very spacious with a closet to store cases, iron and ironing board & also a combination safe which you can set yourself. There was temperature control in the room which we didn't actually need as the room was warm enough. We had a view of the street and grand central from our room and the window could open. There is a place to store your luggage upon check out if needed for $2 per bag - although I've never had to pay for this service any where else before I would rather pay $2 than carry my suitcase around all day! There were also some plug sockets in and around the lobby waiting area to charge phone etc which came in handy for us. If you go out the hotel doors to the right and go in the first doors to grand central station take the escalator down to the right - this will take you to the 'shuttle' which is a subway train (there are 4) that only run directly between Times Square and Grand Central which was amazing! We paid $29 for a 7 day unlimited subway pass from which we got our monies worth! This is my 2nd time in NY and I did not use the subway system on my 1st trip as I'm claustrophobic, however the trams are quite big and run so frequently they are rarely too packed to get on, you can get practically anywhere in manhattan in 15 min - journies which would take over an hour by any other means.

Our room had been renovated and updated since our last visit and it was done well. Staff at the front desk when checking in were friendly, accommodating and efficient. Because we were staying 16 nights we were given a larger room which was very much appreciated. My only complaint is that our room at the end of our stay had a cigarette smoke smell coming in through the air vents. Not impressed, I contacted reception + my husband spoke to them. New York has some of, if not the toughest bylaws on smoking in the country. I do not understand why the Grand Hyatt has smoking rooms available for an additional charge. We were told our floor was non smoking. When checking out I mentioned the cigarette smoke in our room again and I was told the guests who were smoking would be charged an additional $250 service charge. Unfortunately, this does not help me. My husband is allergic to cigarette smoke and we experienced four restless and sleepless nights because of the smoke odor in our room. It is not difficult to determine if a guest is smoking in a room and I think management should have been more proactive about speaking to the guests rather than simply dismissing it with a service charge at the end of their stay. Consideration has to be given to the remaining guests on the same floor. I love the Grand Hyatt but I have to say that serious consideration will have to be given for our next visit because cigarette smoke is not acceptable when you are booking what you believe is a non smoking room.

On a short trip to NYC we found the hotel to be very conveniently located above/beside Central Station and within walking of alot of major sites. Subway located within the building for sites further afield, and the bus to JFK airport for our return trip was located directly across the road which was of great convenience. Our room was on the 20th floor and i can only assume from reading other reviews that our room, which although comfortable and quiet was rather compact as was the bathroom. The main problem encountered was concerning information provided by the concierge for a restuarant relatively nearby (or should have been) that we had made a reservation for. We gave him the restuarant name and the area it was in so that he could google and provide us with an exact address. I appreciate that i should have taken the address or number with me but even with this oversight i didnt think it was too much to expect to be provided with accurate information after he had checked on his computer. The end result was we found ourselves a block and several streets away from where we were due to be and with my wife in high heels on a cold freezing night giving me a hard time was aggravation i didnt need!, Eventually after having to seek directions from numerous passers by on several streets, we ended up almost 45 minutes late but luckily we reached our destination and enjoyed our meal. We did not sample food in the hotel but did have a drink one night (a hot whiskey and a beer) which came to about $24 which i thought was a bit OTT, so didnt return. Overall Our stay went well and these gripes are minor compared to what many other people have to deal with regarding hotels. One final tip would be that there is a great cafe nearby on Lexington Ave.(Scotties) that serves up a mean breakfast at very reasonable prices...

The reason we chose this hotel was because of the regency club rooms and the lounge. We've noticed over the years the regency club expand, but not the facilities, so we were delighted when we heard of the renovations. Unfortunately, while the lounge has expanded slightly, the number of people with access seems to have expanded exponentially. This is the first year we were unable to stay on the floor of the club lounge(although we are on the old club floor 31) - it used to be that only people on the club floor had access to the lounge - those were good days! In my opinion the club experience has become pedestrian. I may as well go to time square to get my coffee - I'm sure there will be less people. Other things - door man asked if we needed help with luggage, I said yes, and then he helped the taxi driver get the bags out of the taxi, and left them on the sidewalk for us. The room while nice and roomy does not have a desk. There is a fridge in the cabinet, with nothing in it. The new safe has room for my computer, which is nice. The bathroom is the smallest one of any hotel in which I've stayed. The new closets are nice and roomy. The bed is comfortable and the convenience of having ac and lighting controls next to the bed is a plus. The new geneva sound system does not work.

This one was a disappointment like nothing I had faced before. This is the reason why this hotel deserved my lowest rating ever: 1. Horribly rude staff. I remember my husband and I wanted to share the tea we took from the little coffee shop downstairs. The tea was complementary for us but we did not want to take another cup hoping to not waste anything. The guy behind the counter replied in a curt manner 'Sir, in this part of the world, nothing comes free of cost. Fork out the money for an additional cup'. I was ok with him not wanting to give us an additional cup, but that kind of remark was unsavory. While my husband brushed it aside as a typical New York sarcasm, I found it offensive. 2. The rooms are stuffy. They should have a better ventilating system in the rooms. I developed a severe allergy due to tiny particles in the air which would often make it difficult to breathe. I complained about it to the management who got the room inspected and casually added 'It happens some times. We will make sure the room is properly cleaned and fumigated'. I dont know what they did but the discomfort continued for the 2 weeks we were in the room. 3. Bad service - I am a vegetarian. Usually wherever I stay, I ask for customized dishes to be made for me. This usually involves replacing the meat in a dish with veggies. I did not expect to be rudely turned down specially in a place which charges you a bomb! I told them 'I am starving and it is snowing outside, so can you send over some plain rice. I will manage with it.' to which I got 'Sorry mam, we do not serve like that. You will have to order something off the menu' I can go on and on about what a horrible experience it was... They pretty much tried their best to ruin my 2-week trip to NYC, a place I had been wanting to visit ever since I got hooked onto to FRIENDS.. Before I conclude, let us not forget the few pluses: 1.

Bed is extremely comfortable, room very clean, fridge and safe in room and a large cupboard with clothes rail in and shelf to store your luggage. Ironing board, iron and hairdryer all provided.

Other than that the hotel was extremely quiet which I was amazed being in a big city. Toilet roll holder is on the wall next to the toilet but its behind you so you have to reach round for it - which in the middle of the night can become a bit frustrating! TV is to the side of the bed rather than in front so you have to sit rather uncomfortably if you want to watch TV in bed. Also would be handy to have a tea and coffee maker in the room. But these are just minor things, did not ruin our stay at all, they are just observations! Staff were very friendly from reception to housekeeping. We had to call maintenance out to look at our shower and they turned up within a few minutes. Turns out it was just us being idiots and not realising how to use it! We didnt eat in the hotel - only used the Market for drinks and snacks so cant comment on the food.

We started on 16 in a deluxe room and asked to be moved that night as it was so noisy from their ballroom. We moved to a GRAND deluxe on level 30 (ie20) and that was brilliant. Big, carpeted, and quiet as a mouse. 2. Don't pay for the Club privileges. They don't even include beer or wine and the food selection in the evening is 2 types of cheese and one hot canap\u00c3\u00a9. Waste of money, you are better off heading out for breakfast and evening drinks as there are tones of places around. 3. Don't do the hotel car to the airport when you leave. They say it will be $65 flat rate as opposed to a taxi which is $45 plus tolls plus tip, but when you get in the hotel car they took us the back way, no freeway.

I understand it is a large convention type hotel, but not exactly any hospitality. Better hotels are able to bridge this gap.

Two, one day copious amounts of smoke came in through the bathroom fan (nasty neighbors I guess.) Ick. Ick. Ick. (On n/s floor). What really ticks me off is the 12.95 per day for internet.

We were celebrating my mum's 60th birthday and I had let the hotel know, so they immediately wished her happy birthday and had champagne and strwaberries dipped in chocolate sent up to the room! The room itself was beautiful. A standard room, but large, newly refurbished, bright, spacious, with comfy beds and an amazing view of the Chrysler building. Throughout the stay the room was quiet and the hotel was a true haven of peace in the middle of a lot of hustle and bustle! Just what you want in NYC. The location is second to none, much better than Times Sq (in our opinion) as you are nearer to downtown and also out of the bright lights and mayhem of Times Sq, but still only a 5 minute walk away. Grand Central food hall and restaurant complex is downstairs (you don't even have to walk outside to get to it) and there are some great options for food, snacks or coffee in there. So now onto the small detail that let them down. On checkout we queued for at least 35 minutes and didn't move. The queues were astounding. Yes, it was a busy day, but there were empty workdesks where we could have been checked in if there were staff there and the staff who were checking in were chatting away to the people (for 20 + minutes) they were checking in, paying no heed to the growing queue. We nearly missed our bus to the airport because of this! Finally, when I got to the front of the queue, the operative informed me that I had nothing to pay (I knew we hadn't had any extras but always like to hear that on check out). 4 days later on checking my card bill, I had been billed $900 by the hotel. The room had already been paid for in full, so I have spent the past few days liaising with British Airways, who I booked the hotel with. I also called (at my cost) and emailed the hotel and granted they were helpful and said the money would be returned to me as it was their error. But who has $900 spare before Christmas? And it took over 5 days to be retuned...and I am now \u00c2\u00a310 short due to exchange rates so I am now having to scan in my statement and send over to BA. What a waste of time! To cut a long story short, great hotel and would return for a similar price, but what a shame they couldn't get the basics right.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cI urge anybody looking for a great hotel in the centre of New York stay here\u201d", "Author": "Michelle2710", "ReviewID": "UR121546441", "Content": "I stayed here for 5 nights over thanksgiving just gone.

But in saying all this it is minor detail as it is still my favourite hotel in New York. Check in was a breeze after a long flight you need an easy check in. Our room was on the 21st floor and we loved the newly renovated rooms really modern and super clean. The bathroom has a fab shower and is so relaxing afer a long day.The beds are amazingly comfortable loved climbing in every night after a long day enjoying NYC. Hotel in best location possible next to Grand Central it even has an adjoining door from the hotel to Grand Central which we never saw before on previous stays..We had breakfast most mornings in Pax a little place when you turn left at hotel and go up like 2 blocks.. Great value breakfast. There is a TGI Friday's 2 blocks up which is great. We are getting married in NYC next year and have the hotel booked for us and some of our guests. The only problem we had was on check out was the queue to store our luggage. It was crazy and no need for it. There didn't seem to be anyone giving out the tickets and storing the luggage for minutes on end which left lots pf people just standing there in a queue far back from the lifts.Not a major deal just thought this could have been avoided.

It wasn't horrible, but there was hair in the tub and soap remains in the shower. It seemed like the cleaning staff were in a bit of a rush.

Not very professional at all, infact a huge let down, and when you read the rest of the reviews on this website a pattern emerges. There were four of us in our room but we only ever got three towels!!!! Rubbish, absolute rubbish. I could go on and on about this hotel from the rudeness of staff to the unkept corridors that need a really good vacuuming to the sink and bath in the bathroom that needed a good clean. All I am going to say is think very carefully about staying here when there are so many good hotels to choose from in New York.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls", "Title": "\u201cComfortable rooms\u201d", "Author": "NFcycler", "ReviewID": "UR120682169", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for two weekend nights in Novemer 2011.

When we arrived there was still work going on in the lower lobby area. The lobby itself is vast - more like a airport than a hotel - very sleek and minimal with museum like rows of seats. We were quickly checked in and received excellent and friendly service - just what was needed after a hideous long flight. Our rooms (25th Floor) were spacious with 2 queen size beds in each, a small seating area and a small bathroom. The one thing lacking were drawers for storage - there is a decent sized closet with plenty of hanging space but no drawers apart from 2 in the central bedside table, As a consequence I had to keep things in my suitcase on the couch. The shower was great when we got it to work but it was an art trying to work out how to use it and how to get the right temperature. In the UK we're used to having tea and coffee making facilities in hotel rooms and I missed this in the morning - I didn't appreciate having to get up an dressed and go down to the Market to get my first cup of the day. We didn't have breakfast included in our rate so it would be nice to have a coffee / tea maker. We didn't venture to the restaurant / shops during our stay as they're a bit hidden away behind the lobby - we found the shop on the last day and it looked good value compared to others we;d found in the city. We had a drink in the bar - a bit pricy compared to other bars but was fine and service was good, quick and efficient. We got a good rate for the hotel through Expedia (\u00c2\u00a3225 per night) which compared to other hotels was pretty reasonable,. Overall would I stay again? Probably at this price, not if it's more expensive. On the plus side the location is perfect and there';s a great breakfast place right across the road (Pershing Square), rooms are clean and functional.

We stayed in a Deluxe room and a tip would be to request a room behind the lifts as these rooms have much larger bathrooms with a double sink. Some of the other rooms have very small bathrooms. The room itself was pretty large, with modern brown colours. The bed was very comfortable and a good size flat screen TV. We had to move rooms because our shower was broken, so when we left for the day we packed our belongings and the hotel said they would have it all taken to the new room when we got back. Some of the poor service we received - we got back after a day sightseeing and there was no record that we should be moved, nothing had been done. They eventually found a room, but did not have a bath as was requested. So went downstairs and again no record of any request. We eventually found a room (without a bath) And said that was fine - service at breakfast was extremely poor, the people were blunt and rude, we requested a spoon for the oatmeal, it never arrived. We requested jam for toast, again never arrived. We had to ask several times for orange juice. It always felt like hard work trying to get anything - the worst part though was seeing the chef who was working the pass (the person that inspects the food before it. Goes out from the kitchen), and we saw him wipe his nose with his hand, and then continue handling food. Now that was a shock and something that I have reported to the hotel. Overall even with the refurb it is a hotel that I would only go to if it was for business and the offices we're really close by. So many better hotels around the area.

Let me run through the different ways in which the staff DIDN'T make our stay memorable: 1) We arrived at 11pm. Upon checking in, we were told that there was no water available in the rooms for showering as the hotel was connected to Grand Central Station and necessary water works were being carried out there overnight. Why this was happening the night before a long weekend didn't make any sense to me but fine I can understand that this was out of their control. Why then did they not notify me earlier about this? They had all my contact details - surely a mass email would have been better service so customers can make other arrangements IF it was a true inconvenience to them. 2) The person at check-in also mentioned that tap and toilet would be working. We went upstairs and they didn't work. So no ability to wash our face or use the bathroom. Not ideal for someone who has just traveled into town. We called, the lady assured us that we could get another room without too much trouble so I went back down to sort that out. 3) There was a long queue but 1 staff member was standing by himself. I told him the problem and he went to a backoffice for about 5 mins, came back out and told me couldn't help me and that I would have to queue up. He clearly didn't understand that at midnight, after traveling for 5 hours, a customer may be a little tired and cranky at having to change their room. 4) After queuing for 20 mins, I finally reached a front desk agent who immediately apologized and then told me that there were no rooms available. I told him that it was unacceptable to not even have working toilets in our room so he said he'd look again. Lo and behold, he found a room (after 15 mins of tapping on his computer and going to the backoffice to consult with his manager). The impression I got is that the only rooms with water were the more expensive rooms - rooms they were unwilling to give other customers. 5) The next day, after doing a round of shopping, I asked the concierge to have my bags delivered to my room while my wife and I went out for dinner. He gave me a flat \"no, it's not the hotel's policy\". No apology, no attempt at finding another solution. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.

This was a Dream Come True for me. I had imagined the hotel to be awe-inspiring, luscious, modern, yet with a tip o' the hat to the Grand Central Station roots. I don't know WHY I expected I expected what I did...but I did not expect what I got. Backing up, our night at the Grand Hyatt New York was the second of the two free nights we received for getting a Hyatt Visa card. Our two-night trip was a combination Mini-Moon (we got married @ Hyatt Regency Boston...Love them. XOXO) and 40th birthday trip for my wife. We wanted to stay 2 nights a the Grand Hyatt, but it was out of rooms of the class we were eligible for, so we had to \"settle\" for the Andaz 5th Ave. See my other review. So...I had interacted via social media with the Grand Hyatt folks and learned we could check bags if our room wasn't ready. What social media did NOT mention was the fee ($5 or less) per bag for the bell stand to check a bag. (As an aside, this hotel has the Most Awesomely Responsive social media folks. The social media was, I think, the BEST part of the hotel. But I digress.) We got in line to check in...and there was a line. The lobby, under construction, was PACKED with people.There were two front desk staff, keeping their calm despite the lines of people wanting their attention. Two concierge staff joked with each other and answered questions, sending people either to the bell stand or to the line for the front desk folks. A Diamond Gold Passport Member was ahead of us in line. I know he was a Diamond because he said it a couple of times, frustrated that the desk staff didn't ignore the long line of Not-Diamond people to help him. Fortunately we could get into a room, so, with great anticipation, we entered our slightly upgraded room. Small and dark. That sums it up. Small and dark. We came from Bright, Cheery Andza, where we were treated to snacks and beverages. We were faced with the single bottle of water with that tag that says something like \"Drink me!!! We will add $8 to your bill!!). To be more objective, the room was much like those pictured on the website...but darker. There is a little fridge hidden in the lovely new built-in furnishings. The rooms were all just upgraded, so they are spiffy, for small and dark rooms. It felt like a cruise ship cabin, the kind with a balcony, only there was no balcony or ocean. We had been given coupons to get a couple of beverages from the handy 24 hour market. We got water & coffee. Ok, I got coffee. I love good coffee.The coffee was pretty good. Before going to the Grand Hyatt, I had fantasies of exploring every nook and cranny. Once I made it through the crowded lobby, I did not want to see the rest of the hotel. WAY too many people in a smallish space for my liking. The Good News: My yearning to go to the Grandest of Hyatts, the Grand Hyatt in New York, has been satisfied. The Bad News: I expected more. After the trip, the nice social media people tweeted me, wishing us a safe trip home.

Had to call the house keeping 3 times before they send the correct items to my room (and had to tip them for their mistakes as well). I kinda suspect that the previous person that check out didn't leave tip, so the house keeping don't bother to top up the tolietries. I did an experiment over the next 2 days... on 2nd day, I purposely didn't leave a tip (since they didn't do a good job when I check in anyway), the housekeeping did a very terrible job and didn't replcae any tolietries. On the 3rd day onwards, I left tips of a few dollars and they will then top up the tolietries, but the standard of cleaning is still very poor as I can still broken pieces of wood from their furniture left there for a few days. They say that a heary breakfast is a good way to start your day - but the breakfast there seems to spoil the rest of my day. First, very long queue for breakfast. They probably have less than 80 seats available for a hotel that 'boost' of more than one thousand rooms. Then the waiting staffs have bad attitude and still expect 15% tip for bring 2 plates of food and drinks that cost around 60 USD for breakfast!. To make it worse, they even charge us extra for items we didn't consume THRICE!!! The first 2 times I spot it and raised it the staff and front office to resolve. the 3rd charge , i only discover after I went back home and check my crdit card statment to see that they have charge me a second time for my prepaid breakfast. Just ridiculous that they overcharge me 3 times in 7 days! Coincidence that it is so careless so frequent ? Or just plain dishonesty? You decide... Also, there is rennovation noises throughout the day at the moment so please feel free to dine at their 'fantastic' resturant if you prefer drilling noise ...and also a likely chance to be overcharged by the bad attitude staffs there. And the rooms have this 'intelligent' lighting and cooling system that is actually soooo stupid. Not user friendly at all...and it beeps frequent in the middle of the night to ensure your sleep is disturbed further, as if spoling your day thorugh poor breakfast service and dirty rooms / horrible housekeeping isn't bad enough, To be fair, this hotel has a very good location and a few of the front office staff were quite nice.

Results are mixed. As customary at Hyatt, the staff are wonderful. The beds are extraordinarily comfortable, the rooms quiet, the air system responsive and effective, the shower/tub design and materials accessible and secure, the elevators accessible and fast. This has the basic ingredients of a fine Hyatt hotel. Unfortunately, the excellence of this hotel is undermined by user unfriendly aspects of renovation design. Drawer space for clothes is insufficient, as are shelves and hooks in the bathroom. The toilet is dangerously close to other accoutrements. The hot water tap in the bathroom sink dribbled at best. The futuristic clock radio, while white, was an unusable black box. The light switches should come with a manual. The mattress foundation sticks out below the wonderful mattress and barks shins with its hard, pointed corners. The aesthetics of the renovation are dramatic and often interesting, but the predominance of white in rugs all over the hotel ends up displaying dirt as much as design. Although the hotel clearly offers alternatives to traditional check-in and check-out desks, the lineups for both were still enormous some times of day. The hotel solicited our use of internet check-in, which was then refused when we tried to use it. On manual check-in the room type confirmed was not available, leading to the need for housekeeping to provide alternative furnishings for the room allocated. The hotel location next to Grand Central Station on 42nd Street and across the street from airport buses on Park Avenue is superb, but the interface of the hotel itself with cars and taxis is both confusing and nightmarish. Lots of good food in the hotel and its surroundings.... For these positive and less than positive attributes, the Grand Hyatt charges the high level of room rates typical of upscale Manhattan hotels. Hyatt is typically generous in its senior citizen discounts, but the base rate is rising quickly in the Grand Hyatt, as elsewhere.

I proceeded to the bedroom which was very modern, nicely decorated, had a large TV and a sound system, I went out for a few hours and was dissapointed when I returned to find that the door to the adjoining lounge was still locked, I phoned the reception desk and they advised that they would send someone straight up to open it, I opened the door on the bedroom side in anticpation, about one hour later a male hotel guest walked through the adjoining door and in to my bedroom area, embarrassed he quickly retreated, I called the reception and about 10 minutes later a guest services rep arrived at my room to apologise and advised that the adjoing door had been opened on to the room on the otherside by mistake. The lounge was of very high standard with white leather sofas, wooden floors, large TV and an extra bathroom, however the movie channels could not be accessed from this TV (problem with the set-up I think). The next day the maid came in to my room twice even though I had the privacy button on and my note about the Movie channels not working was ignored. It also cost me $25.00 for 2 days internet access, breakfast (which is limited to a drink and ONE of the following; toast, cereal or croissants) was supposed to be included in my room, it wasn't, I ordered breakfast in my room and for $25.00 I got a pot of coffee and two of the smallest croissants I have ever seen, when I queried the inclusion of breakfast at reception I was told it was not detailed on my booking, after showing them my confirmation slip that showed I had booked the 'awaken package' they told me they would credit my bill with $15.00 towards the hotels market place food store (incidently the Awaken Package was not registered on my booking a couple of years ago when I stayed at a Hyatt in Dubai either, on that occassion the waitress chased me through a very busy reception area when she thought I had not paid and it was highly embarassing) the following day I received my check-out invoice and there was no $15.00 credit for breakfast I queued at reception for 15 minutes to go through the story again and get the credit, I then waited around 15 minutes to use the ONE PC in the reception area that you can print boarding passes at and then a further 15 minutes in the long queue to be seated for breakfast before deciding to give up and go to the shop and buy myself a coffee and croissant. Already feeling slightly annoyed by this point, I returned to my room to find that the maid had again ignored the privacy button and was stripping the bed even though I clearly had 1.5Hrs before check-out and my belongings were visibly still in the room, I asked her to leave and come back later which she did. When checking out I used the self-service portal because the reception area was chaotic, there are very few seats for guests waiting for taxi's etc...and if you want to store your bags while you wait it is $2.00 per bag which I feel is innapropriate when considering the cost of rooms at this hotel.

The Hyatt has always been our first choice as we had lovely times in Sharm and Hawaii with this hotel brand. The Grand Hyatt in NYC did not disappoint for a city hotel. 1/ Location: next to Grand central terminal so it was convenient for the metro and easy to find. It is only 10 mins walk away from Broadway/ Time Square. 20mins to Bloomingdales/ 5th avenue/ Penn station/ Macy's. 2/ Comfort: we expected a little room with miminal space but this was not the case. Our room was relatively spacious with a couch and a king size bed, plus plenty of room for suitcases and shopping bags :). Our room did not have a view but that didn't bother us as we were only there to rest and recharge our battery for the next day. Our room was recently refurbished so all was clean and fresh. The only downside for the ladies is that there is only one mirror in the bathoom. Lucky my striagtener cable was long enough for me to do my hair in front of it. 3/ Hotel service: Majority of the staff were very nice and friendly, thank you to Veronica who upgraded us for free of charge. There was one or two individual less helpful (friendly) at the concierge desk but all in all was very good. 4/ General: It was nice of Hyatt to give us 2 vouchers pp to exchange for tea/ coffee/ water at their store, this was a nice touch from them expecially after a long day of travelling, made us felt very welcome. There were 2 downsides: firstly; wifi. It is hard to believe a hotel like Hyatt does not provide free wifi when even Bloomingdales and Au bon pain (nice breakfast) do! The cost of wifi is $9.99 per day but for a couple like us, we didn't need an all day service, we just need to look up a few things on the iphone before we set off for the day. Secondly, luggage storage. The Grand Hyatt was the first hotel I have been that charges you. We checked out at 9am and our flight wasn't till much later so we left the luggage with them while we have our last day out in NYC. The cost is $2 per bag, we had a hand luggage and a suitcase each so $8 in total. The cost is not expensive but we were surprised at it as we've never been charged for luggage storage before. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel, we had a lovely time staying there. The cost to stay there was not cheap but well worth it.

Not nutshell small like at Hotel 41, but notedly small in relationship to the Grand grand lobby and surrounding floors. Room was very simple, dark in texture and design. Not as quiet as hoped (aka, not as shielded with strong glass against street noise, but maybe that's being changed).

Yes, the lobby was under construction - but they don't work weekends, and so no noise while I was there. The good news is - the sleeping rooms have been remodeled and were very modern, clean and new. The only noise I heard at night - were voices in the hallway, which at 3am I found to be extremely rude. But it was a Friday night, and this is an \"in your face\" loud, large hotel, not a boutique bed & breakfast. I won an incredibly low rate on Priceline - so was hesitant to ask for a view room, but I did and the very nice woman (from Brazil) accommodated my request. We were on the 25th floor - overlooking Grand Central Terminal with gorgeous views of the city. The room was of decent size, bathroom small but clean. The shelf above the sink is placed so close to the sink, one needs to pay close attention when brushing teeth and spitting the rinse to not knock your head on the shelf. As others have mentioned, the TV reception was \"fuzzy\" on some channels. Not a big thing, but odd. The day we checked in, there were only two of five of the elevators serving the 24th floor and above level (there are also five for the 1-23rd floors) and the Hyatt had a staff member manually operating the lifts - to increase the efficiency and expedite service. Nice touch. I had drinks the ultra modern bar off the lobby (great, friendly staff there), used the mini-food station in lobby also - and they were priced as you'd expect from a lovely, corporate hotel in the center of Manhatten. We loved the underground access to Grand Central Terminal and I highly recommend the Oyster Bar there. A very unique restaurant with every type of seafood you could want. This was our first ever stay in NYC and the folks at the Grand Hyatt made it superb. The doorman offered the \"company car\" service to the airport - when I asked for a taxi. At $45 plus $6.50 toll was well worth it, the driver (retired Hyatt Front Desk Mngr) was execptionally pleasant and made our exit wonderful.

Space is, of course, at a premium in NYC, and a number of hotels I have seen or stayed in call a glorified 150 square foot closet their deluxe room. Not so, the Hyatt. The room was long and narrow, as hotel rooms often are, but it was normal-sized by any other city's standards, and giant by New York's. It's possible that you get more space in the standard room with 2 queens rather than one king, so request that if you are concerned with space. The bathroom truly is the size of a postage stamp, but the shower's nice, and you don't spend that much time in there anyway. The decor is sleek and modern, with dark wood.

We understood before we arrived that the lobby was under renovation so we were prepared for that...and besides, who comes to NYC to spend time in the lobby!?? We arrived very early in the day, around 10:30 a.m. We were using one of our free nights that we got from gettng a Hyatt Mastercard. We did not expect our room to be ready, but thought we would give it a try. We were met by Claudine, who was training a young man by the name of Chris. Claudine made a few phone calls and said our room would be ready shortly. To make up for \"any inconvenience\" she gave us two coupons for free breakfast the next morning (which isn't cheap, by any means!). They then gave us some coupons for free coffee/water/tea at the little market in the hotel. We got to talking and mentioned that we were in the City for our anniversary. Claudine made us feel like we were her best friend. Chris took time to talk to us and was so very friendly. I cannot imagine anyone complaining that the hotel staff here is impersonal! There was not one employee, from the housekeepers to the maintenance men, to men in suits and ties, to the restaurant staff, that didn't say hello to us and talk to us. Our room was a \"deluxe king\" which meant it had a little extra space. It was new and clean. It even smelled great. The bed was amazing. The linens were perfect. I have no complaints about the room. Yes, the bathroom is very tiny. There is no bathtub, but it was adequate for our needs. I will say that the toilet paper is a little hard to reach! There is something that looks like a clock on the nightstand. It may be an Ipod docker, or clock radio. We couldn't figure it out! We couldn't find the time anywhere. The alarm went off in the middle of the night (to some very, very loud music). We must have it the snooze button because it went off again. Finally, I had to unplug it. It would be nice if there some instructions in the room as to how to use the thing! When we arried back to our room later in the evening, there was a tray with crackers, cheese and some other goodies. There was no note, but Claudine must have picked up on the fact that it was our anniversary. It was pouring rain the day we were there and it's great to be able to access the hotel through Grand Central Station without having to go outside in the rain.

The lighting controls are smooth soft-touch plates with markings on them (and various places to touch for \"all on / all off\" or \"entry lighting\"). These have all sorts of problems built in, including it being nearly impossible to set reasonable lighting for certain purposes (like turning off all the lights except a reading light and a light in the bathroom). Added to this seems to be a timer that turns everything off after a while (whether you're still there or not). They also put in a sophisticated clock/radio/ipod dock that was so hard to deal with that it wasn't set to the right time when I arrived (if you could even tell it was a clock) and at the same time had two sets of instructions in the room. Clearly this place is trying to look high tech, hip (very much like a W hotel), and cool, but in the process it has make it less warm, comfortable, and usable. The second part of my bad experience was related to having business meetings here (on the mezzanine level). Not only wasn't there a bathroom on the level, but hotel security wouldn't let several of us use the men's room on the next level (the ballroom level) because they were limiting access to badged attendees of another event (this was enforced at best sporadically, since others from our group weren't stopped), and I feel it is simply unacceptable to have no nearby rest room and then close access to the closest one (without notice).", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, invisible staff\u201d", "Author": "Platinum2709", "ReviewID": "UR118338281", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for ten days.

Anyway given this is a hotel review I shall not rant on and on about Continental's appalling service even in First Class (a short flight EWR-BOS flight admittedly) So with a booking for 4 nights arrived at just after midnight at the Hyatt - could see that it was basically a construction site in the lobby. Checked in and was assured we had a \"nice room\". We arrived in a shoe-box with a window which overlooked the Park Avenue junction. It was a newly renovated room but there was no hot water. On calling reception was told that work was happening in Grand Central Terminus below and it was a one-off and hot water would resume in the morning at 5am. (The hot water the following morning finally materialised just after 6am.) We were tired after the flight and called up room-service to request some bottles of water - were told there was no one available and asked to go to the shop next to the lobby (I thought this was being unhelpful at best, probably bordering on rude). I also complained about how small and claustrophobic the room felt (after all we were paying in excess of \u00c2\u00a3240/night (almost $400/night) just for the room with no extras). The woman at reception was generally helpful and said they would look into seeing if they could move us the following day. To be fair I did get a call the next day and went to check out a room on the 17th floor (I think!) - apparently corner rooms are bigger. This was and we moved. On to my next gripe - we made the mistake of ordering room service breakfast the following day. The food was really quite poor - the toast was cold, chewy and the rest of the food was barely edible. And they do not even offer a simple cornflakes or weetabix!!! And to add insult the bill for this breakfast for two was a whopping $119! When we complained about the quality, they merely said that no one else had remarked and that the food was fine. Breakfast at the restaurant seemed somewhat better the following morning. Also, the whole place seemed to be overrun by teenagers from some dance school/troupe for practically the 4 nights we were there - it appeared like there was some event. This merely added to the general feeling of chaos and poor customer service we seemed to experience I'm not sure what the service is like in other $400/night hotels in Manhattan is, but I'd like to think it can't be worse than this - especially the quality of room service food and room service staff I'd certainly not recommend this hotel for the price - it seemed a 3-star masquerading as a 4-star!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "kazfoodie", "ReviewID": "UR117112054", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Grand Hyatt New York during our holiday in July.

While refurbishment work was still ongoing, we did not feel any inconvenience, although the lobby was partly sealed off for the refurbishment. Our room had been redecorated to a very high standard. The twin-bed room was large enough for the three of us. There was a two-seater sofa and a reclining chair, plus a long writing desk in the room. The walk-in closet was also very spacious so that when we spread our three suitcases we did not feel crammed at all. The bathroom was also beautifully done and brightly lit. For me, a dim bathroom was intolerable. While all the facilities/amenities were well maintained, strangely there was no coffeemaker (but there were several bags of coffee powder) in the room. I called up housekeeping and was told that as a matter of policy they would not put any coffeemaker in the room but will make one available to the guest on request. I asked for one to be sent to our room right away, and that was shortly after 8pm. Half an hour later, the coffeemaker had not yet arrived. I called up housekeeping again, and was told that they were handling quite a few orders at the same time and that my coffeemaker would arrive in due course. Eventually, it did arrive, at about 9:30pm. Frankly, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is right for a guest to wait more than an hour for a coffeemaker.

We usually request this location for the room in order to have some view. Although sitting over a busy street the noise does not bother us because the insulation is very good. More importantly the bed in a renovated room is super comfortable. It is more comfortable than their mid-town competition - whoever selected this kind of bed should be promoted!! I appreciate hotel's relatively new internet provider - no more numerous logins as before - just once would do and the speeds are close to 3Mbs. Another feature I love is the Geneva ipod dock and radio in the room. The sound is truly fantastic. If you like it too, one can get it from a MOMA store!! Apart from the new furnishings, renovated rooms also have touch-sensor lighting. I found it cool, to be in control of it from the bed. While the bathroom remained small, it feels much brighter and only has a shower rather than a tub. The only negative of the new design is a wooden shelf running above the sink and below the mirror. You need to remember of it if you need to wash your face with your eyes closed and need to lean over the sink not to end up bumping your head into it. Another negative is their TV system. While a flat panel TV is of a good size, their channel guide is hidden behind numerous screens, and some channels far from being hi-def have snowy view. Much prefer Starwood's TV system over Hyatt's: I don't need to browse for half an hour just so as to locate a channel a need. I understand that Grand Hyatt is not \"luxurious\" enough to provide printed channel guide in it's rooms, but I would be surprised if one of their focus groups have not specified to them about the importance of this. Personally I will stick to iphone steaming over the Geneva.... During our stay Club Lounge usually accessible for extra fee or to Hyatt elite guests was closed for renovations with the new lounge on 16th floor slated to open in September. Hyatt offered complimentary breakfast to Platinums in their renewed restaurant sitting above 42nd street. The restaurant decor is very nice, modern, airy and comfortable.

I had to spend a few hours working in my room and found that this was not an ideal set-up - it's really not set-up for working on your computer or writing.

I was pretty disappointed with this one. It was clean and had the great little coffee shop downstairs and was in a good central location, but there were some serious service glitches and the bathroom was so small it was ludicrous for a room that is in the high three hundred range. I used points, but it took alot of them and in the past I have been treated much better in using my points. First, I was charged as a no show when there was a note in my reservation that said I was coming in on the red eye AND I had phoned the evening before to be sure all was in order with the late check in - I tried to check in via internet but for some reason that service was unavailable so I double checked by calling and spoke with a human who assured me it would be fine to show up the next morning and that everything was in the file. The first front desk person to check me in greeted me with a \"you were supposed to be here yesterday.\" I pointed out there was a note in the reservation, and she gave us the room but I guess she did not correct the no show notation and it was not until I was checking my bill the last night that I caught the $163. charge. Luckily the woman at the desk that night had originally taken my reservation and she corrected it. But why should it take three tries to get something that simple right? Then, when I was shown to my room it was miniscule and recently renovated a horrible dark grey/brown. Really, it was back to the seventies and not in a good way. I went down and got a slightly better room but as someone else commented, the bathroom is the size of a tiny closet with no room to put toiletries of any amount - not enough for a couple for sure. No BATH. Just a shower. Really. Hideous mural behind the bed. The lights are some weird touch pad. My husband is a techie and I am not impressed by gadgets that don't work well. The lights were literally all on or all off, no in between which is difficult if one is sharing a room. The TV on demand channels did not work at all. The housekeeping staff were great. The concierge (male) was unhelpful. The doorman tried to strongarm me into taking a limousine when I had specifically requested a yellow cab and one was sitting right there - seriously, if I had not dug my heels in I would have paid twenty dollars more for the same ride with someone whose \"marketing\" was dubious at best. I felt that was a violation of the hotel's duty to provide a range of options that I was being steered so hard into a choice I had no intention of making. I had a friend come in from out of town and just told her to stay elsewhere. I even went down and asked to pay for a better room, but there were none to be had. No regency club rooms, no suites, nada. I think Hyatt should rethink this - I was just online thinking to book a room (at full price) at the Hyatt in Waikiki and there are no suites and the pool is closed due to renovation. I get that renovations need to be done, but save a few good rooms for your loyal customers, please! I am going somewhere else, kissing those points for the dollars spent goodby. It was that bad. I just don't want to repeat that. I should say I stayed at the Disneyland Hyatt when it was under renovations - they gave me a fantastic room and treated me beautifully, so it is not just that I am a prima donna who can't walk through a construction zone.

Service was great: Friendly, engaging staff. They upgraded me to a bigger room on their own accord, checked me in much before their scheduled check-in time. House-keeping was prompt and cheerful. 3. Newly renovated room, quite plush and clean 4. Nice gym 5. The deli in the lobby, The Market, is quite useful - good variety of food and very reasonable prices. 6. Good clientele - important when you have kids with you. On the flip side: 1. There is no coffee machine in the room, you can either order in (room service is expensive) or get it from the deli in the lobby. 2. Bathroom is somewhat small. 3. Wireless internet is charged. 4. Hotel is under renovation. However, we were not inconvenienced in any way. Overall, we had a lovely stay. Great for staying in NYC if you have kids with you. Would definitely stay there on my next visit.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BUENOS AIRES", "Title": "\u201cMy Hotel at NYC ...

What started out as a potential problem turned into a nice benefit: Upon arrival at about 9:30 pm, I was told that there had been some staffing problems and unanticipated demand, and that my room was not yet ready for occupancy. Before I could object, the check-in clerk asked if I had eaten dinner yet, and when she learned I hadn't, she offered to provide me dinner at the hotel's expense in the hotel restaurant, and handed me a $100 hotel voucher to be used in the restaurant--or anywhere else in the hotel. I had a nice dinner and including food and wine the tab actually came to a little over $100, plus the tip, and the hotel picked up the whole tab, including the tip. After dinner, my room was ready. As always, it was a nice room--very clean, nice modern styling, comfortable bedding, and quite spacious by Manhattan standards. To say the hotel is \"centrally located\" is an understatement--it's located right on top of Grand Central Station, and you can enter the station without even going outside if you want. Every sort of store, restaurant, and service you could want can be found within a block or two. Despite the location, the rooms are very quiet, even those that are on the lower floors. The sound insulation must be top-quality. Prices at the hotel are generally on the high side, but there are plenty of available discounts and deals on the hotel website, so depending on the day of the week and time of year you're staying, you can actually get a very nice price.

For a Grand Hyatt, the service was below standard - reception did not greet me upon arrival, two agents were talking to each other and it took a third (who was with a guest) to signal to them that they should check me in. I asked for a newspaper to be delivered but was told that I could not receive the New York Times. This was rectified when I went to the front desk to complain. I made a complaint about my phone being full of static but no one ever fixed it, even after two calls to housekeeping. I gave up. Laundry bags were not replaced after use and when I called to have another one delivered it never showed-up. After all of this, the hotel charges for delivery of packages to your room - a \"mail room charge\". I've stayed at many hotels and never been charged for receiving a package. It wasn't an elephant that I had delivered, but several small boxes. In terms of food, the lobby market cafe is a nice touch. Food was reasonably priced. However, don't get the room service. I asked for oatmeal in the morning and got a relatively cold, plain bowl. The description in the menu said that it comes with \"fruits\" but all that I got were some raisins, butter and sugar! On the more positive side, I had a renovated room which was nice, and the bed was comfortable. Also, when I checked-out, I told my story to the agent who was very apologetic and took notes of everything and reversed the mail delivery fee. I wish I had seen more of that while at the hotel.

There was no coffee or complimentary bottles of water in the room. Another reviewer wrote not to forget to ask for complimentary coffee and water from the cafe in the lobby...but I never knew to ask in the first place, so I paid for mine. The main issue we experienced was that there were hundreds of teenagers staying at the hotel for the duration of our 4 nights in NYC. They were running up and down the halls, yelling to each other, and slamming the doors from 10 pm - 4 am. The last night of our stay, patience gone, we called guest services to explain the situation and asked for someone to address the other guests. A manager came up to speak with the teens, but never followed up to make sure that they stayed quiet (they did NOT), nor did anyone follow up with us to check on the status of the issue or appologize. If I were managing the hotel, I would have made sure to monitor the noise level at night on each floor. I mean, there were hundreds of teens staying at the hotel, sharing rooms! It would have only taken quick walk-throughs every so often to make sure things weren't out of control while the teens were in lodging. Instead, I paid over $1200 to stay at a hotel between business meetings...and felt like I was staying in a dorm room or hostile. The food at the hotel was also ridiculously expensive. If anyone has ever been to Seoul, I can only equate their food prices to there...which is the most expensive city (food-wise) that I've been to. If you eat at the hotel, you'll pay at least 2x, if not 3x what you'll pay on average in Manhattan. TIme for the positives! The bed was soft and comfortable. I was able to turn the lights off from bed...but only one of the 3 buttons worked. The shower head was large and the water pressure was good. The absolute best part was the location.

The shower head is a large (about 8 inches by 8 inches) with a lot of holes and it send you a nice blanket of water streams. Elevators are fast and there are two banks that overlap on the 24th floor. We never waited longer than a couple of minutes. We used two meeting rooms and found them to have very good climate control, good comfortable chairs and nice lighting. What they do not have is WiFi (apparently this can be had for an absurd fee), and the cell service (at least in the room we had) is marginal at best. Hotels will likely add free WiFi in the future as more and more people demand it and are unwilling to pay a lot extra for it. The food we had ordered for breakfasts and lunches was quite good, actually unusually good for a hotel. There is a restaurant adjacent to the lobby for breakfast and two days I ate there. The service is not fast, but adequate. The prices here are over the top and many folks no doubt hit the street and find something a lot cheaper. We had two eggs, with toast and a small side, juice and coffee and the price was something like $46. Welcome to New York. But, that said, an extra glass of juice (very good) was offered, and the coffee kept coming. And, instead of what is effectively hash browns, I was allowed to substitute. I substituted roasted mushrooms, which were plentiful and simply superb. A very fine and wonderful strawberry jam (no seeds) is served for the toast. The same area is open for drinks and the wines by the glass that we had before heading out to dinner represent a good selection. Probably pricey, but I did not cover that tab so I don't know for sure. All in all, given the location and the comfort level, we like this place and will stay again.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pulaski, Va.", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but be wary of transportation.\u201d", "Author": "LeePulaski_Va_", "ReviewID": "UR107120042", "Content": "I stayed at the hyatt for two days for business.

We were allocated a room on the 23rd floor, a refurbished room looking out towards 42nd Street and the hotel entrance. The decor was fresh and vibrant with some attractive modern furniture and a very large comfortable bed. We had no complaints about the size of the room whatsoever, infact we found it to be quite spacious overall. The room offered some nice faciltiies such as a fridge and a good quality iPod/iPhone dock. We had no problems with the functioning or performance of the air conditioning and the room had an opening window. We had no issues with noise either outside or inside the hotel. With the window closed, other than the occasional siren, noise levels were completely acceptable given this hotel is in the middle of New York city and throughout our 8 nights, we slept soundly! We did encounter one or two dusty surfaces (shelves above the suitcase storage area) and my wife would have liked an additional mirror somewhere in the room where it's easier to use the hairdryer and apply make-up. We loved the Marketplace shop in the foyer, this was so useful and quite well priced. We used it a few times to grab a quick breakfast before heading out sightseeing. You can also buy a wide range of soft and alcoholic drinks, coffees, good quality snacks and confectionery, there's a great range of cakes and pastries and some hot food available too. We ate breakfast in the restaurant on our first morning where we had great service and wonderful eggs benedict! We also frequented the bar one or two times which was very nice with great views along 42nd Street. The location of the hotel is first class, away from the hussle of Times Square with easy access on foot to many of the attractions we wanted to see. And of course, Grand Central terminal right next door for attractions further afield. There was some refurbishment work going on in the already plush foyer, the space is already so large you'd hardly notice it! A nice feature next to the concierge desk was a PC allowing access to airline websites for online check-in and a laser printer to print your boarding pass. There was no charge to use this service. Outwith the hotel, across the street Pershing Square offered good breakfasts and dinner and there's an airport shuttle bus service right next door to it.

First time was in year 2000. I was too young and to naive to complain about anything. Since I'm neither now, it's time to review. Likes: - Location location location: right next to Grand central Station. Very convenient. - While I normally am not a fan of Hotel bar, we ended up checking out the Hotel bar here after a flight from hell we encountered earlier. Amazing desserts!!!! Pricey, but what hotel is not charging you premium prices? - We got the newly redesigned room on the upper floor. The room, while tiny (typical NYC hotel size) is pretty. Normally not a huge fan of red walls, but it works quite nicely here. - A nice \"welcome\" drinks and fruits delivered to our room was a nice touch. Not sure if they do this for everyone, but I'm a Hyatt member, so perhaps that had something to do with it. - Comfy beds! Had a hard time dragging cousin out of bed in the morning. - Walk-in closet. Seriously! Not huge, but still, a walk-in closet in a tiny hotel room in NYC. Dislikes: - Construction construction construction. We didn't know about this when we made RSVP. Funny, we called in our RSVP. You would think they would inform us about this fact. They start so early and they end so late (or did they even end at all since I heard them in the middle of the night too?). Our room is on Floor 23, and we could hear the drilling. Is that even possible? Not to mention the dust.. gross! dust everywhere... - Our room was really really dusty. We were there for 5 nights and it got worse everyday. They came and cleaned our room but why didn't they dust it? Gross.. - This one is weird, but I absolutely detested the toilet. It's one of those toilets that you normally see in public restroom. There's no way to flush the darn thing without closing the top off. They spent all the money redesigning the room and bathroom, which is nice and all, they skimped on the toilet? For reals? - I guess this really isn't the hotel's fault, but I'm going to mention this incident and probably add thin walls under my cons list too. We were the lucky people who ended up with a neighbor from hell. For the last 3 nights, we ended up having to share the floor and the walls obviously with some weird dude. First night, around 1 AM, we were awoken by screaming match between him and some girl. The second night, at 3 AM, we were awaken by a drunken outburst; from the peephole, we saw him being escorted to his room by security people. Seriously, how much did you have to drink to have to be escorted back to your room? It's not Vegas, people! Third night, it was raining, so we stayed in our room instead of roaming round the NY street. We heard noises right in front of our door. We peeped and guess what we saw, our wonderful neighbor was leaving his food tray in front of our door. Seriously dude? Why can't you just leave it in front of YOUR door? It's your trash. Okay, maybe I was just PMSing but I was really annoyed and waited till he went back to his room and pushed it back to his door. Cousin and the Mr. were worried I was going to get caught and start a major fight, but I can move like a ninja, so he didn't hear me :) - no free WiFi. Seriously, Hyatt, when are you going to stop being stingy and give us the free WiFi already? You're supposed to be a business hotel. It'd be nice to be able to do business while staying in your hotel without having to be penalized for it (aka having to pay for WiFi). Thank God for the Mr's Adroid phone, he is a Hot Spot lol.. we were able to use the internet without having to pay for it. Overall, it was an OK stay, but for the price, you could probably find a better hotel with a better service and hopefully better neighbors. Another cousin was in town for pWc event at the same time, and stayed at the 70 Park Avenue at Kimpton. Loved the hotel and wish we had chosen that instead. It's worth mentioning that since we didn't pay a dime for our stay (thank you Hyatt points), I'm a bit generous on my 3 star rating.

NY followed crazy 4 days in Vegas so we were looking for a little R&R and a chance to catch up with some friends in our fave city. Booked through Asda travel, around \u00c2\u00a3150 per night in total which we thought was pretty reasonable for 3 people midweek. We were allocated a room on the 25th floor. First with the positives: - Room very clean - Considering this was a standard double, I actually thought the main room was not a bad size for NYC (remember we had 3 adult women sharing). We had enough space for three large suitcases on the floor without killing ourselves walking about the room. Bathroom small but perfectly formed. - Hotel in middle of refurb and we were on a brand new floor. I thought it looked great and lots of nice decorations in the hallway. This did lead to our only complaint though (see below). - The one complaint we did make (see below regarding the refurb noise), was dealt with superbly - immediate unqualified apology and $100 comp'd to our room to spend on dinner. Nice touch and although the issue we had was very annoying - it was enough to help us forget about it and get on with the holiday. - Hotel is in a really great location. 10min walk to Times Square, right next door to Grand Central, and fab delhis on Lex. Really couldn't hear much noise from outside. - 5 Mins tops to check in and out and only a short wait to leave our luggage with the bell desk on our last day ($2 per bag charge) - Liked the buzzy feel in the very grand lobby - makes you feel like you're really in the thick of it which I think people look for in NYC. - Fab service in the restuarant at dinner - very attentive red head who was charming and provided fautless service - Nice view from 25th floor Now with the not so good: - Only one restaurant in the hotel and the food was VERY rich (a little too much for our pallette). I'm sure when I stayed here before there was more choice and a cocktail bar ? - Mattresses were so soft that two of us had bad backs in the morning. Our other friend who is the only one to sleep on her side had no problem. Guess bed firmness a very personal preference and dependent on the way you sleep! - Refurb work was being done on the 26th floor immediately above us. We were woken up on our first day at 7am and honestly thought someone was about to come through the floor. Sounded like very loud dragging sound and very noisy banging. It was continuous so we couldn't go back to sleep after 7am :-( Exactly the same on morning 2 and we'd had enough. I phoned the front desk and as I mentioned above - they offered what I considered fair compensation and if we insisted I think they would also have moved us. We said don't worry as we had to get up early on the last day anyway and were more than happy with the way they handled it. I really thought the service in the Grand Hyatt was great - I think that says so much more about a hotel than the official star rating.

When notified at 4PM that the room phone is not working do they really have to take so long that we were all in bed at 11PM to try and fix it? The bathroom door handle was so poor we were afraid to latch the bathroom. On the other hand, every door opened and closed up and down the hallway was a loud crash. Poor picture on the TV. Bedside clock bolted tight to table so you cannot read it from the bed. How stupid is that? NO AMENITIES AT ALL. Even as a Hyatt Platinum member the only thing I was offered was on and off internet. Cost for a coffee refill...$3.00! When we checked out no one bothered to mention that the cars were delivered from the valet to a different floor than the front of house were we dropped it off. Waited for 30 minutes before a cabby told me the details. No thanks to the 3 hyatt guys working the curb. Alas, they lost the keys anyway so no vehicle was waiting for me. Thankfully I had a backup well hidden. I can best sum this place by my 20 year old college daughters comment on day two when we debated leaving due to impending snowstorm. \"I do not want to get stuck in this [-].\"", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Location & Great Service\u201d", "Author": "vlfair", "ReviewID": "UR93550988", "Content": "This was my first trip to NYC and honestly, I don't see a better location.

Luzema the concierge was fantastic. The doormen were very helpful with getting a cab. There is a great little market downstairs to grab a bite and it wasn't too outrageously expensive. There are plenty of cafes around the hotel. The rooms are a bit on the small size (bigger than a European room but smaller than a typical American room).

Due to all the recent crazy snowfall we were so happy to be going as we really did doubt it! after a great flight with virgin atlantic we arrived at jfk, customs took about 30mins so that was good. The 20 minute trip from JFK to midtown Manhattan took 3 hours because the roads were so bad in Queens, NYC state, which we had to drive through to get to Manhattan. On arrival to our hotel we were greeted with a luxurious, well kept, enormous lobby. the decor was beautiful, huge vases of flowers everywhere and a cascading waterfall at the front rotating doors. The colour everywhere is gold. We were welcomed quickly by a friendly female receptionist, we told her we were on our honeymoon and she upgraded our room free of charge to a larger newly refurbished room on the 24th floor. The hotel is undergoing renovation at the moment and Virgin let us know this about 6 months ago, but during our whole week there we did not see one work man or hear any noise at all, you would never know it was there. The main hotel restaurant was closed for refurbishing and there was a temporary one there instead, to be honest i didnt even notice as it was done so nicely. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we chose to eat out but there is a very convienient 24hour store called Market in the lobby which sells wine, beer, soft drinks, hot meals, breakfast, chocolate, crisps, cookies, icecream whatever you want and it didnt cost any more than the news agent in Grand cenral terminal nexct door Hudson News. Rooms gorgeous modern and new, nice shower and bathroom, king size bed awesome heaven to sleep in. large LG tv in room with about 50 channels, nice desk and walled in closet. Lifts were fast and well kept. Overall I would 100% go back to this hotel or any other Hyatt hotel.The hotel is sandwiched between grand central terminal and the chrysler building, it takes 10mins to walk to Times Square, 5 mins to walk to New York Public Library, 10 mins to Empire State. The subway is quick and easy to use and is good when going downtown to ground zero, statue of liberty and to the brooklyn bridge. Grand central terminal is awesome for food and breakfast in particular. There is a large cafe opposite the hotel called Pershing Square breakfast here is awesome, quite expensive but worth it. Overall NYC is expensive at this time due to the economic climate but it is still more reasonable than UK, as you get a lot more for your money. Going off the beaten track is defo the way for cheaper meals. PIzza by the slice in NYC is awesome, better than Italy dare I say it!! Ate once in TGI Fridays as we left it till 10.30pm to eat as decided to go to Rockafeller center top of the rockl after the xmas show at Radio City, it was probably the most expensive meal we had as chains in the USA are as overpriced as they are in the UK but my NY steak was awesome, cooked perfectly. If you want to see a Broadway show be prepared to wait a few days before you will get in and be prepared to pay a lot. We saw Wicked which was amazing, tickets cost us $114 each which is about \u00c2\u00a380 each so quite similar to west end prices, maybe even a little more. Those seats were the orchestra seats so thats good.

As with the other Hyatt we stayed in, the room was nicely decorated, helpfully had some iPod speakers next to the bed and was generally very comfortable. And after a long day of sightseeing / shopping, it was just perfect to return to it. The only noise we heard, apart from the traffic which wasn't a problem, was a noisy neighbour.

This year, we stayed in two rooms on the newly renovated 24th floor from 12/15 - 12/19. I was very impressed with nearly every aspect of the Hotel and the renovated rooms. Upon check-in, we were greeted by the very pleasant and helpful Amanda who granted our request for two rooms next to each other, both with two double beds. The upgrade to the renovated floor was a nice surprise, and Amanda even gave our three girls their own Hyatt teddy bears. What a great welcome! As others have stated, the lobby is very large and beautiful. There is always a lot of activity there, and music booming in the bar area gives it the feel of a trendy NYC club. But the noise disappears when you step into the elevators--and there are a ton of elevators. We never waited more than 15 seconds for an elevator, and they move very quickly. Not even time to enjoy the television inside the elevator before arriving at our floor. The corridors and rooms on the 24th floor have a very chic, modern feel. The color scheme is sophisticated yet comforting. Rooms are very roomy by NYC standards. A few touches I enjoyed in the room included the iPod docking station/radio/alarm, flat-screen TV, the safe lighted from the inside with room for my laptop, the big \"rainfall\" shower head, chaise sofa, modern light fixtures and light switches, and nice size walk-in closet. Beds were plush, the room temperature always comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were upscale. Our window looked out over Grand Central Station, and we never heard any street noise. Hot water was plentiful--never an issue. Plenty of towels for the entire family. And no evidence of any bedbugs in either room after four nights. The tub was missing a stopper. We stuffed a wash cloth in the drain to hold water for baths. Housekeeping did a nice job cleaning the room but was inconsistent in leaving clean wash cloths and drinking glasses. And, as others have pointed out, a coffee maker would have been nice. My only other concern is the security of this hotel. There is nothing to prevent someone from coming in off the street and going up the elevators to the guest floors. I would recommend adding room card access to the elevators. Hotel personnel were usually standing by the elevator bank, but I never saw them question anyone. We had no problems, but I did see one person who didn't appear to be a guest go up and then quickly back down one day. I couldn't help but sense he was making some sort of delivery (hopefully a legal one). I could be wrong about him, but there is nothing to prevent this. The Grand Hyatt is a straight shot across 42nd street to Times Square--a 10-12 minute walk. Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral area is an easy 12-15 minute walk up Fifth Avenue. The New York Public Library and Bryant Park--where we love to ice skate, is a very short walk, and the Empire State Building is not far from there. Not to mention everything is easily accessible from Grand Central Station, where we also enjoyed cheesecake from Junior's every night. Tip: the iPhone GPS makes using the subway SUPER easy. It will tell you which train to get on and how many minutes until departure and arrival. Overall, I give the Grand Hyatt very high marks for location, comfort, and value. The staff was very friendly, though not intrusively so.

On arriving to the hotel our friends were given a double room and we got a king room. After taking our luggage to the room we went to see our friends' room - and were astonished. Their room was almost twice as big as ours, and they had a nice view to the city compared to our view, which was the opposite wall! We went immediately to the reception to ask for a double room, and were lucky enough to get one. Especially if you pay the full price (which isn't advisable, by the way - use Priceline instead), don't be satisfied with a king room, when you could get a much bigger one for the same amount of money. In addition, the king rooms don't have a bath, only a shower. Due to a high floor, our room didn't have any kind of problem with the noise from the streets. The downsides of staying in a high floor are the elevators. There aren't enough of them for a hotel this size. Almost every time we had to wait for one, and on the way down they kept just stopping and stopping until they were crammed. Besides, our room was facing the elevators, and the noise woke us several times during the night. The hotel lobby is very grandiose, but otherwise the hotel and the rooms are more low-keyed and stylish. There is a indoor connection to Grand Central Terminal, which is very convenient: you get to the subway station in a couple of minutes. Naturally the location of the hotel is very good, but since there are so many interesting places to see in New York, you won't manage without a Metrocard - at least we didn't. Grand Hyatt is a relatively good hotel, but there are a few deficiencies, which a hotel of this standard shouldn't have. Firstly, there aren't coffee makers in the rooms. That might sound like a small failing, but we believe, that it's the small things that make the stay enjoyable. Secondly, Grand Hyatt charges extra for everything. In hotel lobbies the wireless internet connection should be free, but not in Grand Hyatt. Also the luggage storage sets you down a couple of dollars. Again, those are small amounts of money, but we think that these kind of things show, how much the hotel values their guests. Especially if the hotel is as expensive as Grand Hyatt, there should be some extra perks to cheer guests up. Thirdly, the young concierge clearly wasn't equal to his duties. He gave us inaccurate information of the airport transportation. He didn't know that the hotel had its own cars for the journey, and besides, he gave us a truly flawed estimate of the price of the cab ride. The hotel's transportation costs about $80, and is a good option, especially if you are travelling in a group and have lots of luggage.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlisle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ShirleyRuth43", "ReviewID": "UR90249085", "Content": "My Sister and I stayed at this Hotel for her 40th Birthday, We e/mailed ahead to check if they had our booking and when we arrived thay had put 50 dollers on our room to spend in the hotel Ruth also got a birthday card and some Chocolatesdelivered to our room on the first night.

First off, I want to make clear that it's not that the hotel's quality is terrible, it's more so that the PRICE and star rating considering the quality is terribly deceptive and way off. This is considered (I guess) a four star, and runs over $400/night, and I would say it is really only worth $150/night. Secondly, the staff was really helpful in dealing with my problems. That said, if you really need and value a genuinely clean and modern establishment, these rooms might not be for you. Then again, it's a huge hotel with over 30 floors and I can't let my experience speak for all the rooms. The lobby looks like a palace, but the rooms were another story. When I checked in, the concierge was very polite and I happily went up to my room, only to wonder why the toilet seat was closed (they are typically open in a cleaned hotel room). I open it to find a huge amount of fecal matter and dark urine. I even decide I'll flush it and stay, but when I do that, it doesn't all go down and at this point I'd need tools to clean the toilet. So, I went downstairs and the next staff person quickly provided me with a new room. This second room was also not clean. The toilet seat was down, but I was in no mood for anymore surprises, so I left that alone, but noticed that the linens were out of wack, soap had been opened with the wrapper left on the sink, and the cabinet door underneath the tv was open. A pillow was misplaced on the other bed (it looked like someone was laying on it, not like the cleaning crew accidentally placed it on the other bed) and the vertical throws at the bottom of the bed was missing from one double bed and placed messily on the other. I could tell this had not been fully tended to and went downstairs for a second time. The woman I got was really apologetic and put me in my third room. She apologized and gave me a coupon for free breakfast and beverages from the hotel's Market. I checked in the third room which seemed OK (it was cleaned by staff). I went to the gym and when I returned, there were complimentary (and yummy) chocolate chip cookies, a bottle of champagne, and a card with a lollipop that apologized again for my situation. I really appreciated the attention and it helped make a frustrating night better. As for the room, I was surprised at how aged it looked (I know it's a historic building, but judging from the lobby and prices and reputation of the chain, I'd expected pretty on-point renovations). The carpet is sort of dusty looking and you can tell it's pretty old and kinda lumpy looking in spots, the bathroom is super small, and the doors (bathroom and closet) are old fashioned with a few small chunks of wood missing and paint chipped. I've stayed in much better non-chain, cheaper hotels that have been beautiful, overseas and domestically. There was no fridge, so I had to throw my leftover Chipotle away. There was no coffee machine either. I called the front desk to see if there was a fridge in the building for occupants' use, and was told that I could \"rent\" one for $20.00. No thanks. In the trash the burrito goes. I didn't take a shower because the shower floor looked a little dirty (not terribly, but I didn't feel good about going in there) and the drain was rusted. There was a piece of trash on the floor under one of the beds, so the floor hadn't been thoroughly vacuumed. My total was over $450 and this was under a reduced conference rate. I slept with the lights (and in turn, tossed and turned every other hour) on because I would bet bed bugs are in there and they tend to really come out in the dark. I expected free wifi, but the wifi browser was prompting me to pay. I could deal with it for one night on a business trip, but if I'd have booked this hotel for a week for vacation with friends, I would have been highly pissed and frustrated. This hotel should make more investment in the infrastructure of the rooms. I was on the 17th, 24th, and 29th floor and can only base this on my 3 experiences. Location and views are great, and if you are easy-going hotel wise and aren't going to spend much time in the room, it's probably fine for you. But, I'm sure there's better for less out there, nearby.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing hotel but good location.\u201d", "Author": "Expat_wife", "ReviewID": "UR86774837", "Content": "Since we were only going to be NYC for a few days, we chose the Hyatt because of its central location and because the Hyatt is a reliable brand. We have stayed at beautiful Grand Hyatts around the world and were sure this would be the same. However, we had a unexpectedly mixed experience at this property. On our last day, our maid told us that the entire hotel was undergoing renovation and that our floor would be next. She said that we should come back next year to see a brand-new beautiful hotel. I wondered why it took a maid to communicate this bit of advice, why wasn't this information on the hotel website or elsewhere??? The positives: 1) Great location. Attached to Grand Central Station -- transportation around the city couldn't be easier. Plus being in mid-town means you can walk almost anywhere. 2) Good fitness room on the top floor. 3) We got good rates for our rooms. Now, the negatives: 1. The rooms (we had 2 rooms) were as ordinary as could be. The bedrooms are small and plain, the bathrooms were plain 3-star hotel style with a shower/tub combo, shower curtain and tiny sink. One sink was partially blocked and did not drain well. The door is not sound-proofed so we could hear anyone talking in the hallway. The amenities in the bathroom were not replenished after the first day. We had to call for more shampoo. There is a sign that you can request turn-down service, which defeats the luxury of coming back to your room and finding it all prepared for evening. 2. There was no refrigerator in the room. Not having a minibar probably saved us a lot of money, but I was hoping to store some snacks in a refrigerator. 3. The breakfast buffet costs $30 a person and we were required to pay BEFORE being allowed into the room to see the buffet. It was quite odd and the hostesses (there were 3) acted like they were blocking the door. Once we went inside, we could see why. It was a disappointing display of stale pancakes, a few half-empy bowls of fruit, some yogurt and pre-cooked eggs that were slightly grey on the edges. Again, we've eaten like kings at some Hyatt buffets but not this time. It was very disappointing. Luckily, there is a market in the lobby that sells fruit, yogurt, baked goods and granola that we took up to our rooms on the following days for a much better breakfast. 4) The water to both bathrooms was turned off when we woke up on Sunday morning. That was a shocker. Luckily the water came back on fairly soon, but with a nasty brown blast. The water wasn't clear until a few hours later. No apologies or explanations from the front desk. Early sightseeing was out as we couldn't take our showers as early as we would have liked. 5) In all of our dealings with the front desk, service was brusque. A couple of times, no one picked up the phone when I called from the room. I know this is New York, but really? The Hyatt needs to do some customer service training sessions. Overall, I was shocked that Hyatt is running a property so out-of-line with the rest of the brand. I am glad to hear it is undergoing a physical revamp, but it needs a lot of work in many areas before it is up to standards. If I didn't know it, I would have guessed this was a 3-star hotel. I think I would stay here again, if I heard that things were better.

We(my and my 5yr. old son) met my husband who was in New York for work. PROS- Great location of Hotel, close to all Our room; we were upgraded (used a suite upgrade coupon) which was a very large room with sitting room. This was great so our son could sleep in a bit and we had 2 closets to store suitcases, etc.... The room was on the 18th floor, which is a bit misleading and is actually the 8th floor. ( I think they just want you to think you are on a higher floor than you actually are so they've added 10 floors to each level) Since we were on the 8th, our view was a large wall of the Grand Central Station and an office bldg. On the the 8th floor we were unlucky to hear the garbage truck come by a few times starting at 7am or so. (I've included a photo) Keep in mind, I'd rather have the larger room and deal with the not so great view and noise from the trash trucks, it is a city after all. The Doormen were very helpful, esp. the man who gave my son a huge lollypop everyday! It was always easy enough to get a cab with their help. BEST part of the hotel was the concierge (Chris) on the Club Floor. He went out of his way to make our trip the best it possibly could, he got us the most amazing tix to the Lion King, dinner reservations that were right on and he just had the best personality and I am sure represents everything Hyatt wants to represent in regards customer service. He even helped out with last minute passport problem we had! (same day passport was achieved) OK, the not so grand.... Design of the bathroom was in need of help. The sink was almost as small as a pedistal sink, there was no where to put any items. (though they did have a little shelf across the bathroom) I think they are updating/remodeling, if so I'm sure the bathrooms will be updated. We had a few problems with the room within the first few days: 1. the room was dark, (due to the view of a wall) and one of the large stand-up lamps was broken. I called to have an engineer come and fix, 4 hours later no one showed up. I had to call again and they lamp was broken, they did replace it. 2. 1/2 way though the trip the airconditioner went out (or would not turn on) in our main room with the bed. I also put a call in for that and never heard back. I didn't want to wait around for someone to fix it so I just let it go, it was not very hot anyway. 3. Our last night my son and I went to dinner (about 6pm) and asked the doorman for an umbrella (tons of rain), he said I need to go back up in the hotel registration and get one from the front desk for a deposit of $100. OK, that's fine..... I'm not going to steal the 4 foot bright orange Hyatt umbrella, but OK. Long story short no umbrellas! None, zip, nothing. Come on you should have more umbrelllas than you have rooms, it was not fun trying to walk down a city street with a toddler in the rain.

We werent disappointed by the friendly reception staff who processed our reservation in seconds. We got a room on the 26th floor to the rear of the hotel. No view but you are compensated by some piece and quiet when you want it. The next building opposite is just as big but mainly offices so all quiet on weekends.

For a quality breakfast i recommend the cafe/restaurant below the overpass outside the hotel directly opposite Grand Central Station. 'Pershing Central ' I recall was the name. Bit pricey at $48 for two cooked breakfast, coffee and juice but you got to do it once. back to the hotel concierge very friendly and helpful. Use them to find the best deals. It has a PC and printer in the foyer to do your check in boarding pass for flying out which was easy to use and quick. Staff will ehlp if you cant use it. The 'Market' shop in the foyer sells quick snacks, coffee, drinks porradge, cereals etc to take away or eat in. We used it for a coffee,hot chocolate in evenings and breakfast on last day. Quality food !.

The hotel is by FAR the best value for the same standard around the city and the location (attached to Grand Central, five minute walk from Times Square and 5th Ave) is unbeatable. Rooms are lovely, modern, clean, big and comfy. The first time we stayed in December 2008, we got an upgrade to the second level. When we went thesecond time we just had a standard room and to be honest the money isn't really worth it. The room is probably 50% bigger which is a good amount but is not really needed, the standard room is PLENTY big enough. The bathrooms are bigger to but again, not necessary, plus our view from the upgrade was of the roof of the building next door. The view from the standard room was of 42nd Street (Quite an inspiring view). The hotel has a new cafe that was opened in between our two stays and this provides croissants, fruit, cakes, cereal, crisps, chocolate and all hot and cold drinks you could want. It isn't 'cheap' but it is handy and great value. Alternatively the Grand Central Food Court (In the basement from the main Concourse of GC) has loads of cafes and is really cheap and very nice. And of course there is a Starbucks on every corner if you like a name. The lobby of the hotel is very nice as well which is always nice. The hotel is very cheap no matter how you book. The first time we booked flights and hotel seperately and it was around \u00c2\u00a3750 for seven days, however we didn't take into account the taxes so it ended up costing around \u00c2\u00a3800-\u00c2\u00a3850. The second time we booked through Thomas Cook and for five days it was \u00c2\u00a3750 so just shop around at the time you are booking. Location wise, the Tube is fantastic. Even better than London's to us because Manhattan is one narrow island. The Green Line goes North to South and can take you between museums on the Upper East down to Wall Street and Brooklyn Bridge. and connections on the tube can get you anywhere and everywhere. In the City itself, you must go to Soho as it is so nice. The atmosphere is really alive (Although don't go early as everywhere is shut... 12pm onwards is when shops open) and at night it comes alive. Really recommend Lombardi's Pizza, you will NEVER eat a tastier pizza. It's near Soho, corner of Spring & Mott Street (Get the Number Six Tube to Spring Street and go east two blocks) Anyway, on the whole New York is the most amazing city we have ever been to, and the Grand Hyatt New York is the ideal place to explore the city from.

Firstly the service; I thought America prided itself on great customer service, it really wasn't apparent at this hotel with most staff not conducting themselves in an overly helpful manner (the customer IS king, remember!) and actually I wouldn't say they were understaffed, especially in the bar. Some of the staff at breakfast were very miserable looking it has to be said! Secondly, the expense of everything else. The rooms are a reasonable price, but $70 for breakfast for 2, you have to be kidding! $16 for a small glass of wine of average quality? $4 to \"store\" your bags whilst waiting for a taxi back to the airport!? Needless to say we didn't eat or drink at the hotel apart from breakfast and next time, I'm sure within a short walk we could find breakfast for less. Thirdly, the worst part of our stay, interconnecting doors between rooms and the general corridor noise. This is NOT a quiet hotel at all, which is probably to be expected for one of this size, but the interconnecting doors were a nightmare. Our \"neighbours\" seemed to enjoyed some slapping and rough sex at some ridiculous hours of the night/morning and was very tiresome. Due to the poor customer service, I couldn't be bothered to go down and argue my point as to why I would like another room as I have a feeling it would have been met with the usual \"we can't do that\", which seemed to be a common theme from reception staff to bar staff.

We were able to get drinks (water/sodas/coffee/tea) most of the time there - which was also fantastic. Our room was lovely - the bed comfortable and the bathroom very clean and modern. We were not bothered by noise bar one night when some young teenages were staying next door and being very loud. We spoke to main reception and they sent someone up immediately to rectify the situation. The staff were lovely - but i felt not enough of them on the main desk for check in and check out. They allowed us to check in early at midday and gave a late check out at 1pm.

Let me start with the positives: friendly staff, particularly for NY. I had a very positive experience at check in, with a clerk who actually took the time to care about my stay, gave me a few extra little perks and was generally helpful. Also, the people in the \"market\" store/cafe were very friendly and nice. Made an impression. The location is central--next to Grand Central. I had a deluxe king room, which was fairly roomy for NYC. The layout was a bit odd---sort of an L shape, with the tv as an artificial barrier between the entry and bed area--but it worked. Nice workspace. The negatives--the room was not very \"fresh.\" Yes, it had a 37 inch LCD TV, and the decor was fine. But the carpet needs to go. It smelled sort of like a wet dog. It was purely a product of it being too old. Otherwise, the room was fine. The bathroom was very small--that didn't bother me much. The lobby was an happening place--for better or for worse. Its starting to look a little dated, also, I think--there's this waterfall type of thing which is fine, but its kind of got that glitzy Vegas in the 80s feel to it. The bed was nothing special. Not especially comfortable. For a NY room, though, it was quiet. Street noise was minimal, and interior nice was nonexistant which was a very pleasant surprise. I know this has been a problem at this hotel. At my request, I was given a room without a connecting door and I think that makes a difference. I'm picky but I didn't hear a thing. Overall, if the price is right, and you are looking for a \"nice\" hotel in New York--go for it.

We were checked in quickly, and the staff were polite and courteous, without being overbearing. We experienced the same service from everyone in the hotel, which was great. Room We had two rooms, both on the 32nd floor. Both were large for NYC, one especially so. The bathrooms were a little small, but I didn't come to NYC to sit in the bath. The decor was fine, and both rooms were clean and had great views out over Midtown. The only downside was the placing of one of the rooms (the larger), which was directly across from the elevators. This inevitably led to a fair amount of noise, but there was nothing excessive about it. Location Really spectacular. No need to stress this any further. Right next to Grand Central Terminal, and within walking distance of pretty much anything you might want to see. Of course, if you need to take the Subway, then it's right next door. Value The room rate was good for the location, although the restaurant pricing was a little steep. Not excessive for NYC, but you can eat cheaper elsewhere. The snack bar/coffee chop in the lobby was great, though. Decently priced and the food was great. The Roast Beef sandwich I had really was excellent. Also, internet access was charged at $9.99 a day.

We drove in and the vallet staff was very helpful and made a few trips to our car to retreive additional items, when needed. The cafe staff was super nice and generous beyond expectation! The kids were fussing at one point, in the check-in line, and the desk staff gave them chocolate Turtles. My only two complaints were - First: that there was not a coffee pot in the room and there was a charge for coffee in the lobby cafe. We did receive two free coffee vouchers upon check-in, but of course, you need them daily, if you are a coffee drinker. Second: the bathroom was so small that you can actually hit your elbow on the sink countertop, which is also very small, no counter space, while trying to unroll the toilet paper. Guess this is normal for a standard room. For the price we paid, however, through Priceline, again, it was not a big issue.

First off, I think what you are really paying for is location, which is great--right next to Grand Central and within walking distance of a lot of NYC attractions. Also good was the lovely lobby, which has a little shop that sells yummy sandwhiches, drinks etc. However, there were a few negatives as well. There was a mix-up with our reservations-we had a number of rooms which we booked online to be on the same floor, so the whole family could be in the same part of the hotel. Ahead of time we were told this would be no problem. When we arrived we found this was not the case. This to me wasn't that big a deal, but what was a real hassle was the front desk staff, who tried to switch things, then couldn't, then said they could, then gave away some of our rooms by mistake, then tried to fix that, all while giving us the run around. It took much longer than necessary to sort out (hours), and I could tell the staff really didn't care one way or the other about fixing things. So if you are looking for great service don't come here. Also the many reviewers who said the rooms need updating are correct. I was surprised, after seeing how lovely the lobby was, that the rooms were really just average, outdated, and a bit on the small side (bathroom was tiny). However, we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway, so if you are looking for a simple base of operations, it serves its purpose. Did have some street noise and noise from other guests walking down hallways, etc. while trying to sleep, so I'd say it needs some soundproofing too. Also made the mistake of going to the bar one night and two drinks cost $30, which I thought was ridiculous, even by NYC standards. Overall I'd say the experience was average--not great and not terrible.

Certainly when compared with the grandeur of the lobby, the rooms are a let down. The concierge was also not as useful as the Sofitel. Given there are so many places to eat in NYC, a bit of advice is helpful - the guys at the Sofitel seemed to really listen to what you were saying and help you choose exactly the kind of place you were looking for; here, it felt like the concierge were just working off a list - you want steak, go here; you want fish, go here.

The hotel is overall one of the better places to stay in NYC, but has a few problems that I wish they'd address. One was the check-in duration. At other Hyatts, I am used to being at the desk just a few minutes. Here everything was in slow motion, including a problem with the reservation that inadvertently dropped the last night of our stay. It was eventually fixed, but only after about 20 minutes or more, including a trip to the back office to consult with a manager. Upon return, the receptionist mumbled something about a \"new computer system\". A second problem was the internet service, which was terrible. I am running a corporate laptop with Windows XP, and was losing the service every 5-10 minutes despite \"excellent signal strength\" on the wireless. I called the T-Mobile support number and was told that they have a known problem with XP, and that I should get some kind of adjunct wireless device from the front desk. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother, since I was using it only a little while each AM before going out to sightsee, but if I had been on a business trip, and needed to get work done, I would have been furious. Since I have no problem with the same computer elsewhere in the country when I travel, I can only conclude that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their ISP or server set-up. According to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems, 50 % or more of the computers connecting to the internet are running XP, so they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be having these kinds of problems. Lastly were the elevators. They had an event Saturday evening which had a large grpoup tranisiting from the lobby to the ballroom floor. They had reserved an elevator with a operator for the event. This in itself was fine, except that the other elevators weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all operating. That same elevator was the only one returning to the lobby level, but regular hotel guests couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it. A long line of hotel guests trying to get to their rooms formed, and only after a minor rebellion did we get to board the elevator. It seemed at other times also that only one or two elevators were responding, which kept them unnecessarily crowded on every trip. Again, Hyatt remains one of my favorite hotel chains, and none of these problems are deal-breakers; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just little operational nuisances which a hotel of this caliber should fix immediately.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cOnce beautiful.. what happened to the Grand Hyatt NYC???\u201d", "Author": "Ms.Me2", "ReviewID": "UR67404485", "Content": "I've stayed at this property several times over a few years...what happened?!?!?!

For those people with access to the Regency Club (you can pay a little extra for access)...it is well worth the additional cost! The breakfast has a wide spread, the afternoon snacks and desserts are simply wonderful. My keys died a few times, but that was such a small issue. The staff was very apologetic when it happened. Quite frankly, I didn't care about this. The hotel staff was so wonderful. They also give free black&white cookies around 3-4pm (which is check-in time)... a nice touch.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed here several times ~ alone on business, with colleagues for a conference, and most recently, together with my family ~ four stays in the last couple of years. What makes a great hotel? I would say consistency of excellence. For us, this hotel has never failed to disappoint. The staff are absolutely first-class. At check-in, you always see a line of smiling Hyatt check-in agents. Yes, sometimes, at busy times you might have to wait. But when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your turn, you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rushed. The staff gives everyone the time they need to ask questions, they explain about the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amenities, and they are unfailingly cheerful and polite. They help with finding you the right room, discussing with you what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more likely to be quiet, or to have a little extra space. As a tripadvisor member wrote when s/he checked in early, the front desk agent told her they love early check-ins because it gives them more time to get to know you. How many times have you been told this when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve checked in early? And they absolutely mean it. In the executive club lounge, if you are lucky enough to be on that floor or have access through your status, again, you encounter first class staff who do everything they can to give you a great (relaxing) experience during the daytime, and to speed things along so everyone gets a great breakfast in the morning. The food and snacks in the lounge have always been very high quality as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gourmet deserts you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay a fortune for if you were outside the hotel, for example. Every room I have had has been spotless, the amenities reflect Hyatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high standards, and whenever I see housekeeping staff they invite me to have a nice day. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had service like this, first rate on every level, at any hotel, and over the last few years I've been Diamond with Hilton as well as Hyatt, and stayed in big cities all over North America and Europe (although I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t traveled much in Asia where I hear the hotels are also a cut above). As a final word, for a recent visit, I mentioned to the manager (Mike), that it was my mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 70th birthday and I was a repeat guest. From that point onwards, nothing was too much trouble, from allocating us the perfect room, to treats and amenities, and a genuine concern to make sure that my mother had a great trip and we were all really well taken care of to the best of their (considerable) abilities. For example, at check-in, the front desk agent (Diane) showered us with kindnesses, from fruit & wine for my mother, to t-shirts and cookies for my daughter, as well as coupons to try out their excellent new Marketplace in their lobby (a great addition which has high quality ready prepared food and snacks you can grab and go, in other words, bye bye expensive room service - why don't more hotels do this?)

I would probably rate the experience a 3.5 star, but I will admit I am pretty picky. I will share the good and the bad for us. The Good: #1 - Location, location, location!!! Just very central to everything. We walked to the theater, walked a lot on 5th Avenue, walked to Central Park, walked to the Empire State... You get the point. You can not beat the location. Subway is directly underneath the hotel which quickly takes you up and down Manhattan to anywhere you want to go. What else: The lobby is very nice and spacious. The air conditioning is very pleasant (it was hot in NYC). The staff is professional and courteous. The bed was very comfortable. And did I mention location? There are a lot of options to eat nearby. So for breakfast we would just find a local place and at. Grand Central Market, which is very nice, is right there! The Not so Good: Our main complaint is around the room itself, which was \"average\" to say the best. - The hotel is pretty worn. Our room looked dated. - Bathroom was very small and had a lot of wear on it. It needs some serious updating. - Bathroom had no tub, and we were in an apartment suite! - The hotel does not get much natural light, so the rooms tend to be a bit dark. - A lot of hallway noise at all times. The other problem we had was getting good advice from the concierge. They were very nice and polite, but the advice they give is very generic and super-conservative. For example they told us to plan for a one hour ride to La Guardia and to be there two hours before due to security. We did that. It took us 15 minutes to get to LaGuardia (it was a Sunday) and there was nobody in the security line. So we waited at the airport for over 2.5 hours. The hotel prices for food are insane. $9 for drip coffee!!!! But this was easy to solve as you just walk half a block and there are options everywhere. Overall it was fine and the location was great. The room is just to sleep.

Very uncomfortable, imagine if we had kids with us? It was a good stay minus our loud neighbors. I believe if the hotel would just get rid of the connecting doors the rooms would be a lot quieter. If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room, we were on the 28th floor and could still hear the sirens through the night slightly, i can only imagine how loud they were on the lower lvls. I'd like to point out that the concierge desk had very helpful and nice people, the front desk staff was very polite and the housekeeping staff was very thoughtful, first day we had the TV on and the housekeeping staff didnt even bother to knock, they just skipped our door as we could hear them knock on the neighbors doors. The next day they knocked very lightly saying housekeeping in a low voice and i said busy and they moved along. So many housekeeping staff in other hotels knock very loud, banging on the door yelling HOUSEKEEPING and you can hear them all the way down the halls.

In the mornings there is a little \"coffee shop\" in the lobby that serves Starbucks, pastries, and fruits. This is super convenient for taking something up to the room instead of opting for the expensive room service. The corridors and elevators are, again, a little outdated (not damaged, just older), but the room decor is modern, bright and crisp.

Housekeeping respected our do not disturb signs which was a relief and did an excellent job cleaning up after my darling but at times untidy children. I would like to note however that the noise level between rooms could be a bit quieter, due to no fault of the guest but more likely that the walls are just too thin. Otherwise we were very pleased.

Housekeeping responded quickly and nicely to our requests for a crib for our toddler and a coffee maker (usually standard in most Hyatts I have stayed in). The concierge was very helpful, too.

The hotel is right beside Grand Central Station so its ideally situated if your using the subway. The only fault I found with this Hotel is the fact that they charge 2$ per suitcase or bag if your leaving your bags there after checkout, it not much but considering the price of the rooms per night I think this should be free of charge.

However, when I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York, I was so disappointed that I decided to shift to another chain of Hotels which at least keep some kind of standards throughout their chain of hotels. In this Hotel, there were some good and bad points: let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with the good, the location is excellent if you are there for business or pleasure. The hotel is connected to the Grand Station Shopping Strip which has many nice shops including a gourmet food store which had a lot of nice stuff, Starbucks, and other coffee shops were very close, transportation was easy, just one thing, DON'T rent a car in New York. I did, big mistake, I rented a mid size car for 79 USD/a day, the parking for 4 hours was more than 48 USD at the Grand Hyatt where I was staying. Imagine if I left the car over night!! Oh the Valet Parking attendant took more than 30 minutes to bring my car, so much for Valet!! If you are not familiar with New York roads, forget your GPS help, it simply just does not work in Manhattan because of all the tall buildings which obstruct the satellite reception, you will be completely lost. Just use the Tube or Taxis and save yourself money and time. The staff at the Grand Hyatt were really friendly, the club lounge was always busy, a bit small for a hotel of this size, but had a good selection of hot and cold drinks and some nice snacks but not a place to have a quite business meeting, one thing was very annoying was that they closed the Club Lounge for cleaning between 1 pm to 2 pm so if you were in a business meeting they politely asked you to leave!!! The Rooms view were not so great, all you will see is buildings around you, but the reception staff went out of his way to please me and upgraded me to a junior suite to make me happy. That was nice of him, but all the rooms which I say (more than 3 rooms) the interior was horrible, plain walls, plain colors, plain fabric, just like a standard 3 star hotel. Clearly not what I was used to in the Hyatt chain in Asia. Room Service very expensive, regular filtered coffee cost about 15 USD. Never had breakfast in the hotel, so I don't know much about that. Oh, get this, no mini bar drinks in the room because there is no refrigerator, and when I asked why, the reception lady said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sir we have more than 1,000 rooms, can you imagine how much work it would take to maintain all these refrigerators? I felt at that moment I was in a motel not the Grand Hyatt. But she did offer to give me a refrigerator if I want one, I told her, ahhh, I just checked out I wish you guys offered me this when I checked in!! The lobby was too busy, a lot of people going and coming, it was more like a mall not a hotel lobby.

I was very pleased with my selection, with the exception of the noise. I was unfortunate enough to stay at the hotel during some sort of kids dance competition, which meant I was surrounded by obnoxious pageant moms and unruly kids. Despite the great room, I encounter challenges sleeping each night thanks to guests who did not realize other people were staying at the hotel. My sleep was continually interupted by guests in the hall talking at all hours, kids running up and down the halls, a conference call first thing in the morning in the room next door, and people yelling from room to room at one another. I highly recommend this hotel as long as you feel you can sleep through anything. On another note, I would like to pass along a word of advice that the taxi driver from the airport shared. I flew into LGA, and the taxi driver told me to make sure I pay roughly the same price on the fare into the Hyatt as when I leave. He said many doormen and drivers have quite the scam going in the city for tourists. I definitely encountered this with the doorman I dealt with at the Hyatt. I specifically asked for a Yellow Taxi. He quickly shuffled me into the taxi who had been waiting in a 'no standing zone'. The driver explained my fare would be a flat rate of $37... $12 more than it should be. I aked him to explain, he said it is always a flat rate on the way to LGA, and that meters are not used. Do not be fooled this is completely inaccurate. I promptly hopped out, grabbed my luggage and moved on to a taxi that was driving by. I was told AGAIN this is one of the many scams taxi drivers and doormen pull on unsuspecting tourists. He also encouraged me to report the driver, as he can lose his lisence.

My girlfriend and I just made a 1week trip to NYC and we chose the Grand Hyatt. First off I selected some options from TA (Trip Advisor) from the reviews (which was not one of the best!) and the narrowed down to price. We made reservtions from Hotels.com. it Worked and was simply easy to do everything. We prepayed our hole stay at the Grand Hyatt. the service offered by hotel staff since checking in to check out was really great. People had smiles on their faces all the time. They were very helpfull. We had room 3421, on the last floor. It was a simple King bed. Someone told us later that rooms in the 34th floor were somehow bigger than the other standart rooms. (?) Upon arriving, i have to say, the room looked huge! We had a very big bathroom, it had doors in the shower, and not those curtains as seen on some pictures of the hotel. There were lots of space around the sink. The room featured a desk with a nice office chair, a small couch with place to lay your feet, and a good size closet. The closet had an iron and iron table. A very nice 42'' lcd. 2 telephones.and an in-room safe. The King Bed was perfect! Very comfortable and nice sheets and great pillows. LOCATION was the best! The hotel is located right beside the Grand Central Terminal. Its in walking distance of all the sight seeing. And for those who do not want to walk could easily use the subway. It was very cold in new York when we were there, and with cold winds in our face made it even colder. So we decide t use the subway sometimes. The hotel has a direct entrance to the Grand central.,and form Grand central we had subways to all prime locations. There is Shuttle to Times Square every 5 min, and a nice subway line going down-town and up-town on lexington Av. Its very nice to use the subway. This helped us a lot! The hotel didn't provide free wi-fi. They charge $10 a-day. If you stay in all-day i dont think its expensive, but it was not our case, we used only 1-2 hours max from the wi-fi. So I thought the cost/benfit of the wi-fi a little bit over rated. Other than that, The Grand HYatt New York is a great place to stay! The rooms/bathrooms are larger than usual NY hotels. It is very beautiful hotel. Great Location. And it should not be placed in #146 of the TA hotel New York City List. im sure that no one will be unsatisfied staying there.

Absolutly fabulous hotels!! The first thing we said to each other upon entering the Grand Hyatt New York was..well, this is nothing like the Hyatts in China. That being said, I will now review. We drove into the city and pulled up to the hotel on 42nd street about 10pm on a Thursday night. Not sure we were in the right place as no doorman approached the car, no valet could be seen and no bellhop was around, I went inside. In that lower lobby, there were no hotel personnel so I went up to the main lobby and asked. Yes, they would send someone down to valet the car and yes it was the \"main entrance\". We had reserved a queen bed non-smoking room using a free night earned while staying in China under some promotion Hyatt was having....pay for so many nights and get one free. Can't beat the price but that doesn't mean the attention to detail should be lost. We had just spent 12 nights in China at their hotels, each time upgrading to the concierge level. We were not asked if we wanted to move up to that level....maybe because we were there for free but I still thought it strange that it was not offered especially since you have to pay for it. Our requested room was not available...we could have a smoking queen or a non-smoking double....not good. A king was not offered as an alternative until I asked. Yes, there was one but it too was smoking. So we took it. There was also no mention at check-in of the restaurants in the hotel and the health club availability. Our room was smal, decorated in neutrals, with a nice desk and one chair with ottoman and a large flat screen TV. Far from the elevator and ice machine. The bathroom had the usual toiletries including toothpaste. Small bathroom. We were there on a very cold night. The window was ages old and leaked cold air like crazy. It also did not do much for filtering out New York City noises. Internet is an additional charge. The location of the hotel is excellent. Sitting on Grand Central Station you have easy access to all trains and subway. You are in the midtown and can easily walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, the Flatiron district, etc. Upon check out, we retrieved our car on the upper level and voila, there were the valet and doorman. If you do arrive on the upper level, you will walk into a very plain lobby and will need to go down the stairs to the main lobby area.

It was our first trip to NYC and we selected this hotel intentionally after reading many online reviews, guidebooks and talking with friends. And we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappointed. The Grand Hyatt met our needs perfectly and was exactly what we were expecting. It is expensive, as is every hotel in NYC. On this point, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fairly compare it to the costs of hotels in other parts of the US. However, compared to other hotels in NYC, we think it is fairly priced and is somewhat of a value. The Grand Hyatt is not a 5-star hotel, and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t claim to be. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a resort destination. So don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go with those expectations. What you will find, though, is a clean comfortable place to stay. The location at 42nd & Lexington is right next door to Grand Central Terminal. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a walkway that connects the hotel to Grand Central if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk outside. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very convenient to many subway lines, which makes getting around the city and returning to the hotel very easy. The area right around the hotel isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t especially scenic or touristy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the middle of a very bustling area of Midtown Manhattan. But it is very safe. We even walked back to the hotel around 1am after leaving the top of the Empire State Building. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very short walk to Bryant Park and Times Square. (Or an easy subway shuttle ride to Times Square.) You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re minutes away from everything Midtown has to offer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue Shopping, Central Park, Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Theater District, etc. And if you decide not to walk, cabs are plentiful and the subway is also very convenient. Though its location next to Grand Central is very busy, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare to the frenetic pace of Times Square. You can walk there in about 10 minutes from the Grand Hyatt, but we found the Hyatt to be a nice respite from the 24-7 madness of Times Square. Check-in was very fast and easy. The clerk was personable and friendly. The lobby is very big and played host to a couple of different events during our stay. Our room was just as we expected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small, but functional, clean and comfortable. From what we understand about NYC hotels, they all have very small rooms, compared with other parts of the country. So we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappointed in our room size. It provided ample space for the three adults in our room. And both the closet and bathroom were, again, small but adequate. As tourists, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in our hotel room much, anyway. We were out and about everyday, only using the room for sleeping and showering. Everyday, upon returning to the hotel, our room had been serviced. They were prompt about filling requests such as extra towels or hangers when we needed them. We did not eat at any of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants. Other food options were plentiful, from the wonderful dining concourse next door at Grand Central, to cafes, restaurants, coffee shops and more nearby. On some mornings we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pop into Tim Horton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a block away for a donut or muffin for breakfast. Other days, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go to a nearby coffee shop or diner for a more hearty breakfast. From our room, we could see the top of the Chrysler Building on the next block. But I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to say that few of the rooms (if any) provide any really scenic view. The Grand Hyatt is surrounded by other high-rises on most sides, and because the streets are so narrow, there doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be much of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from any of the rooms. We were on the 30th floor, so street noise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue at all. We heard an occasional siren, but nothing that disturbed us. The Grand Hyatt is obviously a hotel that caters to business travelers, thus the high prices for room rates, room service, Internet connection, etc. But it also provided us with everything we needed and were expecting from our NYC vacation, and gave us a great base from which to explore the city. There are certainly more elegant and refined places to stay, more hip and modern hotels, and more budget-friendly locations around the city, but we plan on returning to the Grand Hyatt for our next trip to New York.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but....\u201d", "Author": "kseitz", "ReviewID": "UR53845632", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a long weekend in January. There are several kiosks in the lobby allowing travelers to self check-in and avoid the line at the desk. We took advantage of this and is was quite speedy. Our room was on the 16th floor, the 2nd or 3rd floor of rooms. The room was small, but not too bad for NYC standards..a closet just inside the door, a small hall with the bathroom off to the right, and the bedroom. CONS: Our view was of the roof of the lobby area. Cobwebs on the floor lamp in the room. Lighting in the room was poor and it was difficult for both of us to get ready at the same time. The only mirror in the room outside of the bathroom was in a closet with a dim light bulb. Walking back and forth from our room to the elevator during our stay, we noticed the same room service trays/dishes outside other rooms on several trips. We brought drinks up from the bar and our glasses were in our room for two days. Internet - $9.99/day for T-mobile Hot Spot (SLOW connection). There was no lobby bar, but instead a small bar in the back of the lobby level. We had drinks here one evening...strange vibe - dramatic paintings of Spanish guitar players and flaminco dancers with loud techno house music. We did not eat at the restaurant - also seemed small for the size of the hotel. There was a restaurant just above the lobby with fantastic views, but it is closed. Room service prices were ridiculous...bowl of oatmeal $15 plus tax and delivery. PROS: Location, location, location! The hotel is connected to Grand Central Station by a small hallway. At Grand Central are many, many restaurants and shops and access to all trains and subways. Many sights are within walking distance - Chrysler building (just next door), New York Public Library, Bryant Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location , Rude and Greedy Doormen.\u201d", "Author": "Epidural", "ReviewID": "UR53688843", "Content": "Arrived by cab and the doorman took the bags, he then took us to reception and refused to leave until we tipped him, not a problem but I had not checked in, got my room or even said hello to reception.

I was initially afraid that the location would be too busy/hokey/touristvictimy but, even adjacent to Grand Central, it felt perfectly safe and welcoming outside. And being adjacent to GC is a-maz-ing. We were able to take a bus from the airport, and take a bus or train anywhere we wanted to go after we arrived without worrying too much about negotiating subway stops. This A.

Our King size bed was very comfortable and we slept very well. The living area had a couch, table and chair which added a lot of space to the room and was a very nice place to relax when returning to the room. The refrigerator was a good size and very useful. The flat screen TV was a great size and swiveled to be seen in the living area or the while in bed. The room had a walk in closet that gave plenty of room for our clothes/shoes/dirty laundry and purchases that were made while visiting NYC. In the bathroom, details such as cotton balls / swabs / Q-tips in the bathroom were noticed by my wife as a nice touch. The shower / tub has a temperature dial, and the shower gave an amazing amount of water. What my wife and I liked the most about the room was its serenity from the city. We could crack open the windows to allow fresh air and a little city noise, but we could also close those windows and shut out the busy city. The view was very nice and gave us the great feeling of the NYC experience. We loved the high floor location of our room, and all that we could see. 2. Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The staff was very kind and professional. We were able to check in quickly and had help getting our luggage up to the room. The Bellman introduced the hotel on our way up to the room and told us a lot of useful information such as how to gain access to Grand Central from the hotel, and about the available restaurants. In our room, he gave us a tour and showed us features of our room. He showed us how to work everything and offered to hang our garment bag for us. He got us some ice and was very attentive to us. We had questions on how to get to Lincoln Center and how long it would take, and he was very helpful with recommendations and suggestions on how to get there quickly. We also had a great experience with our room attendant. She was very kind and refilled our ice for us too. The room was always very clean. Everyone that we came in contact with at the Grand Hyatt was very professional and went out of their way for us. GREAT SERVICE. 3. Location - GREAT LOCATION. The location of the hotel was a big plus. Outside temperatures were in the 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and we could get a deli sandwich or do some shopping at Grand Central station without bundling up. Because the hotel is attached to Grand Central, we were able to go from our room at the hotel all the way to the Natural History Museum on 81st and back without ever getting out into the cold. There was also a point when my wife and I were sick of bundling up, so we put on light clothes and went down to Grand Central to do some shopping. It turned out to be one of our favorite times. Everyone around us was bundled up, but we were dressed like it was 70 degrees out. We strolled through the shops and the Grand Central Market. We ended up getting something to eat and taking it back up the room. Ultimately, we had spent a couple of hours in the terminal and the shops. We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been able to do that if the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attached to the Terminal. When we were out and about in the city, we could do some shopping and come back to the hotel to drop off bags, or get something to eat, or take a nap before heading back out to the next venue. There were also plenty of drugstores and/or restaurants all around this location to be able to run out and get some quick toiletries or food if needed. This Hotel is the tops in location. I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel to others. We stayed here for a 5 day anniversary trip to NYC and we VERY pleased with our experience. My wife and I would like to say thank you to EVERYONE there that made this trip for us possible. We will see you next year. GREAT EXPERIENCE!

I wasn't sure how to handle, but I lucked out by finding a metered spot on 43rd Street; Only about 50 paces from the entrance to Grand Central.

A tip - for breakfast head over the road to Pershing Square which is a great place to get an all-American breakfast in stylish surroundings.

Overall it was a nice hotel, with just a few minor glitches which in no way diminished a wonderful week in New York. Upon check-in, the front desk agent informed me I had been upgraded to a \"Lexington Suite\". It was a nice big room overlooking Lexington Ave., and the Chrysler Building was right next to us. Beautiful view from room 1926! The bed was absolutely wonderful; comfortable and luxuriously soft. I normally have trouble falling asleep in a strange city (especially New York with all the horns honking 24/7), but no problem in this bed. There was a nice flat screen TV which swiveled so you could either turn it to face the bedroom or to face the TV area. Great touch. Other nice features were an in-room safe, an iron and an ironing board. The bathroom amenities were also unique and plentiful. The following are a few minor problems I noticed during my stay: The walls are thin (but aren't they all in hotels these days?). My next door neighbors (room 1925) were a bunch of loud guys who were banging around and yelling at all hours of the day & night. To make matters worse, they were smoking up a storm in the room. The rooms are non-smoking and the smell permeated the hallway and sometimes even came into my room. Nasty. There was plenty of hot water but it takes FOREVER for it to come out [hot] of the faucet. I had to let the water run for several minutes before it came out hot. I guess it had to travel a long way. After a long day of sightseeing and walking, my back hurt, so I decided to take a \"sit down bath\" to relieve my aching muscles when I realized the tub stopper didn't close. I tried and tried but it didn't work. So I used a washcloth to plug the drain (but it didn't work very well!). I didn't bother reporting it to maintenance since I didn't plan on taking any more baths. Oh, and wireless internet is $9.95 for 24 hours. I used it and the connection was fast & easy (T Mobile Hot Spot). Don't bother eating in the restaurants or using room service in this hotel. I cannot comment on the quality because once I saw the prices I stayed away. Nine dollars for coffee (for one person only)? Thirty-Four dollars for French Toast? Really, that is ridiculous, even for New York. And these were the restaurant prices, not the \"jacked-up\" prices for room service. Do yourself a favor and grab breakfast (or any meal) in Grand Central Station. It is right next door and you won't even have to go outside to access it. Just take the corridor on the lower lobby level and make a right. It will take you directly there. There's also a Starbucks in that corridor which is actually less expensive than the \"coffee cart\" in the lobby of the hotel. My favorite place was called \"Hot and Crusty\". I was able to buy 2 large coffees, a bottle of OJ, a bottle of milk and a wonderful croissant for a total of 8 dollars and change. Honestly, I don't know who would ever pay those extravagant hotel prices. I am still in shock! Here's another money-saving tip: If you are coming from an airport, go online and book Super Shuttle. Yes, it is a shared van that makes several stops, but it is a lot less expensive (and easier) than a taxi. My ride from La Guardia was only $13.00 plus tip (16.49). I also used it to go back to the airport. You can save a few more bucks if you book it round trip. Overall a great hotel, just a little bit away from the major noise and crowds of Times Square.

It was a great place chill and just get away from the hustle and bustle for a while. Also the toilets were beautiful and so well looked after by a lovely lady, who really takes pride in her job.

So I am not sure of the exact price I paid for the accomodation. It really is in a fantastic location, especially if you can work out the subway system. The hotel is situated between Grand Central station and the Chrysler building.The Empire State Building is a 10 minute walk around the corner. Time square is a 15 minute slow walk, plenty to see on the way though. I was in New York with my two daughters aged 16 and 21 and although initially worried about walking at night need not have worried as there are plenty of people around. The hotel room was a good size and the beds were very comfortable, on the 28th floor we were not disturbed by traffic noise. I agree with previous comments that the rooms are tired( but only in the yellowing of the paint work) and the bathroom is on the small size but both were clean enough, if you don't look too carefully in the corners and above door frames (grout could do with a little cleaning too.) The meals in the hotel are expensive but for breakfast we followed previous advice and went down into Central Station food court (you can either eat down there or take it back to your room.) There is not a kettle in the room and despite e-mailing the hotel before hand to ask if I should/could bring a travel kettle I did not recieve reply from them. However in the hotel lobby there was a drink station for use on a morning, the prices there were not too expensive. There is a booking desk in the reception area where you can buy tickets for the bus sight seeing tours. This was helpful as I did not like the idea of getting my credit card out on the street to buy tickets off the vendors. I would not buy theatre tickets from there though as you can buy them after 3pm for that nights performance, at a ticket booth in Time square for up to 50 % off. (Unfortunately we had already bought tickets for Shrek through Last minute before we went. It was a brilliant show but we could have got them cheaper if we had waited in the line at the ticket booth. ) However, I think tickets for shows such as Wicked are more difficult to get hold of, so my advice would be to book up with Last minute a couple of weeks before you go to avoid disappointment. All the staff in the Hotel that we met were helpful and polite, having said that I didn't really have any contact with them apart from checking in and out. We had a late return flight and the hotel will mind your luggage for $2 per case after you check out at 11AM, this is also helpful.

However, all of the polish and glamour soon wore off when we experienced the front lobby staff. As we were unable to use the kiosks, we had to make way to the front desk to be assisted by a human being. What we received was a flash of hatred only experienced as an American youth traveling to Communist USSR in the early 1980s. Instead of assisting us, the front desk agent went back to her keyboard, clacking away while her knitted eyebrows told us that we were almost to the point of death should we bother her with our measly request of checking in to our hotel room. About five minutes later, a second front desk staff member arrived, reassuring us that this was indeed the front desk, and this is where we check in. We were given our room assignment, confirmed my Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum status, and directed to the elevators. Soon, we were on our way to room 1971. As part of Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum status, I'm supposed to get the best room available within the category booked. To all my fellow travelers, I sincerely apologize. Based on the state of my room, I would surely suggest that your rooms were scarier. Room 1971 featured a lovely cracked closet door, mold (not crown mold) around the door of the bathroom, and a toilet wedged between the shower and sink that required the strength and acrobatic skills of Cirque Du Soleil to use. Additionally, for all of those that dislike adjoining rooms - you had not one, but TWO adjoining rooms - one on each side of the room. Nonetheless, the King-sized bed was comfortable, and the desk area along side the TV was useful to complete work on my partner's laptop. The room also had a functional A/C and Heater, and the noise levels (as you faced 42nd Street) were almost inaudible once the window was closed. Our further interactions with the hotel staff were just as cordial as our knitted brow friend, showing us that customer service is indeed on life support at this hotel. When we called to inquire about the correct method to use to obtain free internet, the response was \"If you're Platinum, you should know.\" Yes, because all hotels are the same. As a FYI, When you access the T-Mobile hotspot, and enter your room number, it apparently is automatically removed from your room charges. Bell staff were courteous, and unlike many other NYC hotels, did not tout their friend's town cars or expect tips for helping with bags or hailing cabs. While tips were appreciated, there genuinely seemed to be some helpful staff outside of the hotel. Directions and help with getting our navigation straight was truly appreciated. This, honestly, was the saving grace of service at the hotel - otherwise it would have been a terrible experience. With hotels fighting each other to keep in business in this economy, abusive service and rooms with cleanliness issues do not win repeat customers. Would it cost that much more to have someone fix a crack, kill some mold, and coach your front desk people to smile?

Since this hotel was where the seminar was held, we really didn't have a choice. We will never again attend a conference at this hotel. Check in was smooth. We were ushered to room 1602. Directly across from the bank of elevators. As it turned out, the room was huge and the elevator noise was not a serious problem. The room itself was in poor condition. On the bedskirt on the bed nearest to the door there was a huge liquid stain of some sort. Disgusting. Every single lampshade had holes and was bent crooked like a brawl had taken place at some point. The carpeting was ancient. Ancient to the point of pulling away from the walls and cobwebs and dust and food had settled into the cracks. I was VERY happy I had brought my slippers. This is the kind of hotel that makes you cringe everytime you look into a nook or cranny. Behind the tv set? Thick with dust and crumbs. Most unfortunate was the fact that this room was connected to other rooms on both sides by reed-thin doors. Forget about getting a decent night's sleep if you have a neighbor who likes to watch television. We were kept up until 3am on a Saturday night by our neighbor's television. The Grand Hyatt touts their E-Concierge service. They have a link to it on their website. However, I sent two different requests to their E-Concierge before we arrived and both requests were completely ignored. The first request was for dinner reservations. Ignored. The second request was for extra towels in our room....an option that their E-Concierge offers. That request was also ignored. We had to phone housekeeping for the extra towels. Every single day. We were promised a coffee machine and a fridge in our room. We had to phone housekeeping for those as well. The maid refused to stock the coffee maker with coffee and cups after the first day. Forget about getting any glasses in the room. We were drinking out of our hands from the bathroom tap while brushing our teeth. If you would like 2 wine glasses delivered to your room the charge is $6. We knew in advance, thanks to TripAdvisor, that the room service charges were astronomical, so we stocked up on juices and water and bagels from the shops down at Grand Central Terminal. One morning, we did order breakfast. One ham and cheese omelette was $24, with no toast and no juice or coffee. The omelette was dry as dust and cold. $24 for an omelette. Astounding. One small box of Fruit Loops was $10 with no toast and no juice. 6 mini pancakes from the kids menu was perhaps the best value. I would strongly advise people to order from the kids menu to avoid being absolutely gouged by the laughable prices. And make sure to order a pitcher of ice water. It's about the only thing that is free in the hotel. All of these complaints aside, the thing that really bothered me the most was the filthy condition of the glass in the lobby. There are several revolving glass doors and a couple of regular glass doors and every single one of them is literally covered in slime. No matter what time of day or night, the lobby was thick with the finger goo and faceprints and palmprints of the hundreds of people who go in and out all day and all night. It's absolutely disgusting. One employee, armed with a bottle of Windex and some paper towels could solve this problem by cleaning the doors once an hour.

We were wrong! Our room was on the 18th floor and we had a view of a high rise, which was to be expected as it is New York City after all and there are high rise building everywhere ;) The windows of the rooms are mirrored so the opposite people in the buildings could not see into our room. This was the least of our problems believe me... The first thing we noticed was mould growing in a corner of the ceiling near the aircon/heating system and also the paint had started to peel away I guess due to the moisture here. We were going to asked to be moved however I wasn't sure that they had other rooms as most if the US Open Tennis players were also staying there too. We also noticed no mini-fridge or minibar. We rang the front desk only to be told that this did not come standard and that you had to request for one to be sent to the room at a charge! I was certain that I read on their site that minibar/mini fridge was included in the room to which the staff member told me she'd send one complimentary. We also had to request bathrobes and slippers (not so much of a hassle, it was just weird that this was also not already in the room considering that this was stated on their site). Amongst other things our room wasn't clean properly everyday, the walls were thin and we could hear people snoring in the next rooms and people walking down the hallways. The staff were not that helpful (but we also found this throughout Midtown...we would always get blank stares, ignored or replies such as \"I don't know\" or \"that's not my job\"!) which was also a huge disappointment when you asked them for something. Everyone passed the buck and unfortunately we had to endure this for 2 week!!! Another thing was the draining system. The drain in the bathtub would clog and your feet would be in a pool of dirty water while you showered until about half way during your shower where most of it would drain away. And at times the toilet would also not flush properly too!! My suggestion to you is to stay somewhere downtown or away from the centre of Manhattan. We received excellent service from retail and food industry as soon as we left Midtown (such as in Greenwich Village, SoHo and also in Brooklyn). Yes staying Midtown was handy to get to Uptown and Downtown with ease, but the NYC Subway and bus systems are so good and so fast that it shouldn't take you long to get from one end of NYC to the other (PS- Subway MTA MetroCards are the way to go. We got a 7 Day unlimited pass for USD$27 and it was gold. You can use it on buses and subway trains all day. Make sure it's not the 7 Day MetroCard USD$20 as this is not unlimited, and made of thin paper card. It just has USD$20 worth of credit and you have 7 days to use it in. What you want is the $27 UNLIMITED MetroCard which is made of thin plastic.) Sorry to get off track...this Hyatt did not live up to it's reputation of silver service.

There was just 1 small window and just enough room to move around, but not much else. (oh, well, a huge walk in closet). I don't have much to stay, it was a terrible stay. The check in was fast because we used the quick automatic check in. We were assigned a room with a double bed. There was no complimentary tea or coffee or any kinds of hot water.

I called front desk asking for help, I needed some advil or any kind or medication (the kind you find at any store). They replied with a cold \"I'm sorry, we do not give medecine to our guests\", even though there was a Duane's Read right across the road and I really couldn't move at all. I don't mean they should do so, but it would have helped... Anyway, I didn't like the hotel at all. Too big, too cold (literally too, it was freezing cold in the corridors and lobby), no personality, the staff barely does the minimum. You're just another number to them, not a guest. I didn't feel welcomed at all. It's sad because I had planned on staying at the Hotel Chelsea for the whole stay, but after reading a few bad reviews on tripadvisor, I decided for one night at the Chelsea and the rest at the Hyatt, expecting a lot from a 4* hotel. Well, it ruined my stay. The Hotel Chelsea was just incredible, one of the best hotels I've ever been to. Hyatt, on the other hand, was one of the worst... Location is great, right next to the Empire State Building and Grand Central station (metro and all).

The room was quite pokey but I had read about NYC hotel rooms being quite small. The bathroom was tiny, the hand basin had no room to put toiletries on whilst getting ready. The hair dryer kept overheating (at least 2 - 3 times) whilst I was trying to dry my hair in the mornings which was really, really frustrating because I had to leave it to cool down before I get started again. We used to put the \"do not disturb\" sign up so that we could have a sleep in in the mornings but when I would duck out to get coffees whilst my Husband and kids were still in bed, I would find housekeeping's cart parked outside our room - waiting for us to get out of the room. I found this to be bit pushy and really wanted to wheel their carts down the hallway, The foyer also needs a bit of a makeover, a lot of gold metal which looks very 80's. The foyer/lobby were always busy. They would put these sheer white curtain things up to try and make an impromtu room within the lobby to host functions - if I had booked a function and it was wedged in their foyer/lobby in that fashion I would be most disappointed. Location of hotel is good. I discovered a great fresh food market around the corner (Lexington) - part of Grand Central (I think it was called Grant Central Market - not sure) but it has fresh breads, cold meats, cheeses, fruits, veges, seafood, cakes, nuts and heaps more. Towards the end of our stay, we got sick of eating out so I would get some fresh bread rolls, cold cut meats, chesse etc and make our own bread rolls. The variety of food sold is outstanding and the smell when you walk around is delicious. Lastly, the rooms do not have fridges but you can request one (I think it was $25 per stay).

I've stayed in a family suite at the Sheraton in Maui (on the beach) for 1/2 the cost, yes HALF the cost of what I paid to stay at the Grand Hyatt.

So I requested a roll-away for my son, simple enough right? Nope! We went up to our room which was extremely small, trying to stay positive and not show my son my disappointment I went down and asked if a double room became available if they could let me know so we could change rooms. They never did contact us. Once the roll away bed was set up there was absolutely no room to walk around the room. Then there was mold in the shower (which never got cleaned the entire time we were there). The air conditioner made noise the entire time it ran which made it difficult to sleep. There is ABSOLUTELY no counter space in the restroom to set your toiletries on while getting ready. There was only one very, very small dresser under the TV which had tiny drawers in it. You could hear the dinging of the elevator all night long. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed with staying at the Grand Hyatt and wished I'd spent half the money to stay at another location. I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone that I know is traveling to NYC! I do have to say though that the employees at the Concierge desk and out front of the hotel were extremely polite and helpful. Always smiling and very courteous!

The last couple of visits the rooms have been small but this one couldn't even accommodate a chair in the room. It was right next to the bed so no walking by space. The rooms do not come with a coffee maker so we brought ours from home. We had inquired earlier if a coffee maker could be provided in our room but we were told that we would have to check with Housekeeping when we arrived but they could not promise we would have one as it first come first serve basis. I feel they could be more accommodating to people who are staying longer and paying a very expensive room rate and/or arriving later in the day. No discounts or reductions given here in the room rate for a longer stay. The rate we paid did include one business shirt to be laundered every day as their website offered but after the second day the laundered shirt would be returned with a $15 invoice attached to it. When I called down to the desk the guy told me it was only one shirt laundered 'per visit'. My husband had to print out their website the next day at work to show the front desk. The desk agreed after seeing the ad that we were correct. However, Housekeeping kept including an invoice on the laundered shirt when it returned to our room. I went to the desk and they told me that the charge would not appeared on our bill upon check out. Indeed, we were not charged. Somehow you think they could come up with a better method so not to confuse their hotel guests. The walls in the room are thin and you can hear all the conversations in the next room. If you are a light sleeper this may be a problem. The one thing I can rave about is their breakfast buffet is excellent. It's very expensive and there is no menu- I think it was $28 per person? so you have to be very hungry to enjoy the buffet (fresh fruit, eggs made to order, waffles, bacon, sausages, incredible pastries, fresh squeezed orange juice, etc.). Otherwise, they do have a coffee stand that sells muffins, bagels & salads but it was a bit annoying that you couldn't order from a menu.

Looking at the reviews of the Grand Hyatt I started to get a little discouraged. It spoke of small rooms, lack of customer service, noisy and no hot water. Well I must say I encountered none of these factors. My flight was 10 late but upon arriving \"Melissa\" checked us in with smiles. I had let her know that my luggage was lost my flight had been delayed 10 hours and things just weren't going right. She promptly gave myself and my family a large back of toothpaste, deodorant, combs, mouthwash, and many FREE coffee coupons for starbucks which is in the lobby. She introduced me to the bellman who filled out a form so when my luggage was to be delivered to the hotel it would be sent right up. She also upgraded us to a larger room but that wouldn't be ready until the next morning. As promised by 11 the next day we had the larger room as promised and our luggage as there and life was good. Every morning we were greeted by smiles and our nights were restful no noise from any of the rooms and the hotel was pretty full. The shower pressure was strong and hot we were on the 28th floor. Now the rooms are smaller than other Hyatts but hey its NYC and larger by that standard. When you check in just ask if a larger room is available because they do vary with the same specifications you may request. The first night we had 2 dbl beds and the room and bathroom was small for the three of us but would be fine for 2 people. The room we went into the next day was perfect again with the 2 dbl beds. I just felt that I needed to write this so that you arrived less worried after reading the previous reviews. We were there for 5 nights and it was in walking distance to all of the attractions. The train station is right next door which offers shops, food and great people watching. On a the corner is a store that is open 24hrs where you can get water, juice, snacks, film underwear, etc and get anything you may have left at home. The area is safe. Now I will say that the room service was a little more pricey for what i usually pay. I like breakfast in the morning and I am use to the service fees and price per person but the Grand Hyatt was so high that I just stepped outside and went elsewhere.

We only took the free coffee though as being next to Grand Central Terminal, everything you could ever want is there. From Bagel bars to Hale & Hearty Soups, to Pizza and Chinese (although you might not want Chinese for breakfast!) Having arrived at Room 1663 (on the 16th Floor if you hadn't already guessed it) we were surprised to find such a large 2 double bedded room after reading some of the previous reviews on here. There was plenty of room for two guys who had packed far more clothes than was required for our 5 day trip. There was a more than ample writing desk, a large widescreen LCD TV, an iPod docking station, safe and much needed air conditioning. The bathroom wasn't overly huge but then who needs it? The only minus point for the bathroom was that the shower curtain had mildew on the inside which was off-putting. The beds were very comfortable and sleep was no problem whatsoever. I had the bed next to the aircon vent which if you're a light sleeper you might want to turn down or off at night. As for other noise which has been previously mentioned, I couldn't hear it! We couldn't hear any of our neighbours and barely heard housekeeping outside in the corridor either. Overall, the Grand Hyatt is what you would expect from an International Group and shouldn't disappoint with its facilities. There is a very handy 'Duane Reade' across the street (Chrysler Building) which sells bottled water, confectionary, pharmacy items, magazines etc, basically anything you've forgotten to pack. A short walk gets you most places like 5th Avenue, Times Square and the Rockefeller Center. I would recommend the Sightseeing Bus though as walking from one place to another can get pretty tiring as I found out - we did NOT take the bus! If all you need is a clean, decent sized room, a good location and the knowledge that you have a decent brand behind you then you can't go far wrong with the Hyatt. We took a Limo from JFK to the hotel which and returned to JFK in a Sedan. However, a NYC Taxi has a flat rate of $45 to JFK plus the customary tip of course. The guys on the doors at the hotel are fab and will help with luggage. We checked out at 1pm after requesting to keep the room on and after that we stored our luggage with the Bell desk. Be warned that a $2 per item is charged for storage so might be a good idea to try and avoid storing too much.

Only one thing is free for room guests, that's fitness center. And, there had no hot water in rooms either, if I want to have hot tea by myself. And, there has another minor thing I might need to complain. I had 2 different bookings, one is from 5/1 to 5/8, another is 5/8 and the check out date is 5/9. Before checking in, I asked the front desk that, if I should do anything for the 2 different bookings? For example, should I check-in again on 5/8? They said, I don't have to do anything. But, that truth is, our room cards were expired on 5/8 and we had to check-in again on 5/8. Fortunately, the front desk at that night was very nice. She is a black woman, but I don't know her name. Oh, about the noise, yes, it's a litttle noisy there, especially at night. And, the wall is truly thin as paper... Well, so the keypoint would be the service and location.

The alarm clock is also an ipod dock which was great. We missed not having a small fridge however. Overnight street noise was our only complaint! Even 21 floors up the all-night honking or horns and over-zelous horn and siren operators of the NYPD and NYFD made nights tough. Night 2 however was much different, I wore earplugs.

Upon check-in, I requested an upgrade from an \"executive queen\" room to a room with a king-size bed and the nice woman checking us in was happy to comply.

The workout room seemed to have lots of equipment and looked clean. We never had help with our luggage (it was offered several times, never forcefully) so I can't comment on the helpfulness of the bellhops. A couple of minor demerits: (A) the bed was not terribly comfortable because it transferred motion to my wife whenever I turned over during the night (but it was still passably comfortable...we have a very comfortable foam bed at home, so my expectations may have been too high); (B) The room was near the elevators and everytime one of them stopped at our floor, it would chime (this was very annoying at 2AM, so bring some ear plugs in case you are near the elevators or are a light sleeper). The only major downside to our trip was that parking was $57 per night (we decided to pay it to save time since we were only in town one night and also since we could take it up with the hotel if the car was damaged...which it was not!)

I booked a deluxe king room and had a best room on the day guarantee (through platinum status). The room was very plain and faced out onto another part of the hyatt (no view at all).

The front desk staff were very polite and helpful, but I could not believe that they charge a departing guest $2 per bag to hold your bags for you (maybe this is common in NYC, but I have never come across it elsewhere) - it's not the money that upset me, it was the principle.

First of all, New York is a great city, this was my 3rd trip but my girlfriend's 1st, there's too much to see and do there but staying at the Grand Hyatt made it easier thanks to its fantastic location. It's very well located downtown, a short walk from 5th Avenue and Times Square. A longer walk up to Central Park, but that's OK because walking around is what we do in New York, right? We were lucky that we were upgarded to a suite thanks to a friend of mine who works for the Hyatt Group having made the reservation for us, but I would guess that the quality of the furniture, fittings, bathrooms is equal throughout the hotel. And that quality is top class. If there is a downside, it is that the hotel is very very big, and that makes the lobby a crowded and busy place at times, but you have to love the multi cultural nature of New York and being in such a big place meant hearing different languages every day in the lift... Another downside is the costs of additions, wi-fi access in the room was $10 per day and a Starbucks coffee delivered to the room worked out at almost $15 including the room service charge, I'm no scrooge but clearly that's ridiculous, a morning walk into the neighbouring Grand Central Station sourced the necessary morning kick off for a couple of bucks...

We found our room to be of a good size (Club floor) - bags of room even though we had an extra bed for our daughter.

I have to say, however, service did seem to depend on the individual as on our second day we had a lovely lady in the club who was more than helpful.

Had a fantastic first time in NYC. The best thing about the Grand Hyatt is its central location and the fact that it is next door to Grand Central Terminal, which all the cab drivers know. About the hotel, the entrance and lobby are just spectacular and the desk and concierge were very helpful. However, sadly as is common, the guest rooms are a far cry from the elaborate public areas. Ours was basic, pretty small and had few frills. The bathroom was tiny. There was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board. No fridge, kettle or coffee maker however, and room service is astronomic so suggest you take a travel kettle and tea/coffee supplies. The room was quiet and warm, so no problems there. We had breakfast on Christmas day in the hotel, again big disappointment, food was cold, daughter found a hair in her scrambled egg, had to queue with people coming off the street (no special treatment given to paying guests). Cost over \u00c2\u00a3100 for 3 of us to have basic cooked breakfast which was pretty laughable. Across the street the Pershing Restaurant serves a fantastic breakfast, so comes highly recommended, however costly again, at \u00c2\u00a350 for 3 of us to have their fab. pancakes. I was told that most New Yorkers grab a bagel and coffee from Starbucks, which are on every corner. Apparently its only the tourists who pay the expensive hotel.restaraunt charges for breakfast! Back to the hotel, the room service was good, left a tip for the maid each day. Had to ask for a few things she forgot to replace, such as shampoo etc. Take LOADS of $1 dollar bills, because everyone has to be tipped. Here's an example $1 a bag, $1-2 a day for chamber maid; 15-20% tip for meals; 10-15% bartenders; cab drivers 15% of fare. Had Christmas day dinner in the Benjamin Restaurant, which is a steak house within a short walk from the hotel. The steaks were the BEST we have ever tasted. The meal was memorable. This classy restaurant is highly recommended as a special treat. The concierge can book it for you. Allow about $45+ per person for a steak plus sides are about $9 each. Weather - freezing! Do not underestimate how cold it is in NYC in winter. We wore thermals and thick tights, and hats and thick scarves/gloves are a must. Lots of New Yorkers wear North Face clothing, especially long coats, because it is SO cold. They sell ear muffs for $2 (the NYPD wear them so they must be considered ok!) they are a must if you want to keep your ears from dropping off. Lots of guys wear dear stalker hats with ear flaps (nice). Once wrapped up however, with sensible boots, you can happily trudge everywhere (the NY grid system is so easy to follow - take a pocket sized street map with you!) and get the subway or a taxi when you are tired. Heres a link to help you plan : [-] We took a full day tour (5.5 hours) with On Board Tours, which was a great day and we saw so much. Highly recommend this tour company. Professional tour guide, lots of getting off the bus and seeing the sites, including a staten island ferry crossing to get a great view of Liberty. This tour leaves every day from Times Square. [-] Also make sure that you go up the Empire State Building and include the NY Skyride, which is great. If you want to go shopping (who doesn't - 50-75% sales are on everywhere) Macy's is great. Unlike rest of US, the New York women are on the slim side, so size NYC US small = 6-8 UK, medium = 8-10 UK and large = 12-14 UK. Any bigger and you need to look for 'womens' in shops such as Macy's and Old Navy There is great shopping in SOHO. (blend of SO uth of HO uston Street, no relation to SOHO London!) . There is also an out of town (about 1 hour away) shopping mall that is supposed to be great. Ask the concierge. Also go to China Town for the famous NY 'knock off' designer handbags. All in all - what a great city. Next time I plan to stay somewhere cheaper, why pay for a swanky entrance lobby if all the rooms in NYC are small??

The room had climate control which was brilliant as it was snowing when we were there and absolutely freezing so it was nice to turn up the temperature when we got home to our room. Bathroom was small but shower was powerful and gave nice toiletries. New lcd flat screen tvs were getting installed during our stay but the work never bothered us at all and the satellite tv provided was great. We were on the 21st floor so weren't bothered by noise outside but the walls were pretty thin and could hear the guests in the next room's conversation. We were hardly in the room much so didn't bother us. The restaurant food at the Commodore Grill was excellent although the menu wasn't very extensive and was a little pricey. The homemade breads were a nice touch and the service was impeccable. The market grill in grand central was great to grab breakfast in the morning for a reasonable price and the pizzas at 'two boots' there were fab too! Don't eat at the TGI Friday's next to the hotel or the KFC, we grabbed some food from there on the last day for quickness and it was disgusting. The location of the hotel is excellent - walking distance to all the main attractions inc Rockefeller Center, Empire State, 5th Avenue, Radio City Music Hall, Times Square, Central Park etc etc. It was also extremely handy for getting the bus to the airport - buses to all 3 major airports just round the corner from hotel. This was very useful as it cost us $86 plus tip from Newark Airport at the start of the holiday which was a lot more expensive than we had hoped for and a bit of a shock to say the least! It didn't help that the exchange rate for sterling pounds was pretty awful either. You can also grab the subway just next door to the hotel at grand central for $2 each way which was very handy - we used it to go down to take the staten island ferry.

I was informed that it was a Queen Deluxe Room (which I knew in advance). *The hotel reservations person on the other end of the line happened to be one of the Reservations Supervisors. *I explained that I wanted to add my Gold Passport account number to my reservation and after doing so, asked if I could change my room to a King without an adjoining room. *The Reservations Supervisor was very accommodating and handled my request with ease. He told me that although I was blocked with other rooms at the package rate, he pulled our reservation out and put us on the 26th floor in a King Deluxe Room (see pictures) without an adjoining room. *I asked if it would be worth the extra money ($100/night) to upgrade to the Regency Club Floor, but with all of the activities of the events we were attending (ie. lots of food and wine), he didn't feel that the room would be worth the extra money. I really appreciated that. *When we arrived (Thursday late afternoon), our room was just as promised... on the 26th floor, on a corner, away from the elevator and the ice machine and without an adjoining room. *Although we had to deal with noise from a loud family across the hall in several rooms (without adjoining doors!), the overall experience was very, very good. --- Just a piece of advice, my Gold Passport number had not been used in many, many years so I re-enrolled two weeks before we traveled and obtained a new number. Even if you don't plan to stay at a Hyatt very much in the future, it is good to have a Gold Passport number as you will likely get better service as a loyalty customer.

Only problem is the bar is a rip off, go outside to some of the bars in the area if you would like a drink - gin and tonic at $12 is a bit over the top by any standards. Did the Hop on Hop off bus for the first time, would definitely recommend that.

I've worked in the hotel industry before, however, and know that at this price point, all that distinguishes you from another hotel is your service. The Grand Hyatt's service was dreadful, and I will not return because of it. We attempted to check in early, as we'd indicated on our reservation, and were told nothing would be available until 4 p.m., and that the onus was on us to call and check when something would be open. Annoying, but OK, no huge deal -- though we were tired from the red-eye flight, there was no guarantee of getting a room early. We then asked the snotty front desk clerk for a hospitality room or some sort of place to change our clothes and maybe even brush our teeth. He told us there was nothing and -- get this -- pointed to the lobby bathroom. I'm sorry, but at $250+ per night, I'm expecting slightly more than a point to the bathroom. Thankfully, a nice lobby agent walked us there and tried to talk to us and make up for the front desk clerk's snarky service. We changed in cramped stalls and went out to the lobby to rest for a moment before hunting for breakfast. As I sat down and placed my feet on top of a large ottoman, not 10 seconds passed before a security guard came over and demanded I remove my feet -- from an OTTOMAN. What exactly is it there for if not to rest your feet? In any case, I explained that we'd just come in on the red-eye, were just trying to rest for a moment before heading out ... yeah, nothing but another admonishment. That was the last straw. You don't have a room, fine -- but don't make the whole thing worse by being rude at every turn. The rooms are recently remodeled, so that's good, and they're spacious by NYC standards. Bathroom is absolutely tiny, but clean. Elevator service is fairly rapid, though a malfunctioning one did send us between our floor and the next one down three times before finally taking us to the lobby one day.

Hotels in Manhattan are always far more expensive than elsewhere, and the rooms tend to be far smaller as an added kick in the teeth. Although I was not paying, the rate was only a little more than some far less salubrious places around mid-town, and having done cheap in Manhattan I knew it wasn't a great idea to go budget. On arrival, despite (or probabaly because of) disrupted flights there was a pretty large queue, but there were a huge number of automated check in machines that no-one seemed to be using - walk straight up, check in and get the key, go. Not entirely sure why people weren't using these as if you have a confirmation code or have booked directly with a credit card it couldn't be easier. Good way of avoiding the queue, and although you're never going to get free upgrade you can change your choice of room on the spot even on the machines. I won't go on about the lobby area ostentatious water features as to my mind they are extremely tacky, but who cares? The room itself was, despite being the towards the bottom of the range, incredibly spacious for a NY room - the only downside was a pretty tiny bathroom, but still stocked with good toiletries. I can't comment on the room service as, this being NY on my free weekend, I didn't eat in. But I must say that the staff, who do check that you're staying if you try to get in after around 12am, were perfectly courteous despite me rolling back in a sorry state sometime around dawn. The location is obviously good for midtown - you are on top of Grand Central and all that entails - but as someone who ends up downtown it is not perfect, however hotels downtown tend to be either exceptionally expense boutiques or very rough, and at least taxis always know where Grand Central is. The rates here fluctuate quite a lot, and it is never going to be the cheapest place in town, but the standards are ones you can rely on, more so than at a Hilton, Marriott or other mid to high level hotels.

I'm a Hyatt Platinum Passport member, so I was able to get a room at the Hyatt at Grand Central using my points. Considering how expensive rooms are in New York, I was thrilled to get the room for \"free.\" We had requested two double beds; and, because we checked in early, we ended up getting a \"smoking\" room. I didn't think this would be an issue, but if you're not a smoker, the smell is overwhelming. We turned the a/c on and opened the window, but it never really dissipated. The room itself is smaller than average for a US hotel and the bathroom was tiny by American standards. I had asked for extra towels when I booked online and someone came up to the room promptly with an armful of towels. The room was clean (except for the smoke smell), but it's obvious this is an older hotel. One of the lamps in the room didn't work; in fact that outlet didn't work at all. So, they should probably do some updating and fixing to the electrical. The location is the best thing about this hotel. Located inside Grand Central, you have access to the subways plus the dining area, which is very good. Walking over to Times Square took about 15 minutes and was very doable. The Little Mermaid was the highlight of our trip. My daughter has always loved the movie, so it was a lot of fun going to see it with her. The theatre is older, but so beautiful. Every seat has a great view of the stage. Overall it was a fun trip. Next time, I'd wait for another room over taking a smoking room.

We arrived last Friday afternoon about 2pm. The room was not yet ready, so we checked our luggage and went out to do some shopping and walking. We needed to get back to the hotel by 3pm as we needed to be downtown for the rehearsal at 4:30pm.and we both needed to shower and change.

After checking back twice more between 3 and 3:45pm...the room was still not ready and the desk clerks never once offered an alternative. Finally my husband demanded another room to change in, but we were told we had to come back by 10:30pm in order to move to our original room. There was no offer made to move our things or assist in any way. We left the rehearsal dinner to head back uptown to check into our original room and then had to move our bags to the suite. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of proactive offers to help us. If we had not demanded a substitute room to change in, I'm certain we would've ended up changing in the lobby bathrooms. While the accomodations were ok, the bathroom was not what was promised via phone. My husband specifically asked if there was a soaking tub, and the response was yes, it was a marble bathtub. Well, the walls were marble, but the bathtub was not deep enough to soak in and the bathroom was mediocre at best. What was planned as a romantic and fun weekend was soured by a very uncaring staff.

I have been a Platinum card-holder with Hyatt for some years, and I must admit that their hotels are not all of the same standard. Most are large and impersonal, but that is the nature of that type of hotel, which caters more for business travellers and (in major cities) airline personnel than holidaymakers. This hotel is huge! The foyer is redolent of an airport terminal, with high ceilings, check in desks, roped off areas and large numbers of seats. Cosy and bijou it isn't, but it is impressive. There wasn't a time when it wasn't teeming with people, and we were struck by the large numbers of school groups that were staying there (perhaps that's why I keep hearing that some rooms are in poor repair ... most young people I have come across are no respecters of others' property). However I have to say that their hotel in downtown Manhattan was one of the best Hyatts I have stayed in. Admittedly I did use my points to upgrade to the Hyatt Regency floor (31st), and I would have been extremely disappointed had any of those rooms been as manky as those described in some of the reviews here, but in fact I was pleasantly surprised. Our room had probably been refurbished in the last year or so, because although there were scuff marks around the lower edge of the bathroom door, the general state of repair was very good, with no sign of wear on the wallpaper or paintwork. The bathroom was small, but not so small that it caused any inconvenience, and the shower produced a good powerful spray with no blocked nozzles. I have always disliked the baths that the Hyatt group install in all their hotels (at least in the USA) because they are usually a bit short and always very shallow, and the idiotic arrangement they have for the overflow - at a level no higher than your toes when you're lying down - means that even a reasonably svelte patron is going to have his or her belly uncovered. I find it impossible to have a relaxing bath in a US Hyatt, so the good quality shower was particularly important. What the average corpulent American does for a bath in this chain's bathrooms boggles the mind. My biggest complaint about this bathroom was that there was no extractor fan, so a shower produced a room full of steam and a completely misted mirror. Not a major issue, just a comment. The room was about 16 feet square and well appointed, with a (slightly too) soft double bed and a TV a bit too far away to enjoy properly without the aid of binoculars. Since we watched no TV other than the news it didn't really matter, but the picture quality was poor and the TV had a fault that made it make a loud crackle and picture jump at regular intervals. I'd have hated that while watching a film, but as I say, we didn't use it much. In keeping with most Hyatt hotels in my experience, the lighting was dismal. I have never understood why this chain is so miserly with its lights, but with no central light fitting in the ceiling (yes, I know it's pass\u00c3\u00a9) and what appear to be low wattage bulbs in the other lights, the room always had the feeling of being dingy ... which it wasn't at all. Window area is at a premium in New York so the available natural light was also limited. Not a problem and didn't spoil the stay in any way at all, but it's a comment for the Hyatt planners; Let There Be Light. The room was also quiet, and apart from one occasion when a gaggle of idiot women walked up the corridor outside our room conducting a shouted conversation at 4am, we had a quiet stay. The real high feature of our stay was the Regency Club room, which was delightful and something we made use of quite a lot. It serves a complimentary breakfast (largely continental in style), and there's coffee and sodas available free of charge all day. People were going out of that room with arms full of Voss still mineral water as if they were running a stall at the local market. During the day there is free food available, which changes as the day wears on. From the breakfast it changes to other salads and good quality dishes, ending with pastries in the evening. I have no idea how they afford to do this, but I have to say that it's a superb and very welcome service. The best thing of all about the club room, however, is the concierge. This is a person on the reception desk, dedicated to answering questions and helping club members ... and my goodness are they good at it! Each lady (and they were all ladies) was attentive, intelligent, eager to help and very efficient. She has a terminal connected to the Internet, of course, and she will research things for you, advise you on places of interest, places to eat, ways of getting there, and will make reservations for you. Of course the concierge down in the foyer will do that too, but you have to queue for his attention, whereas on this floor you have immediate and high quality attention. To give you an example, I asked for the names of musical instrument stores in Manhattan because I wanted to see if I could find a second hand guitar (a Gibson ES335, since you ask). The young lady told me to leave it with her, and the following morning she had a list of shops, their phone numbers, whether they had that guitar in stock, and the price ranges at which they held them. To say that I was astonished (not to say extremely grateful) would be an understatement. I hope to return to NYC in the not too distant future (we like to go there every few years) and there is no question that I will stay at this hotel, and pay for the Regency Club floor if I don't have the points. A comment about the staff. At no time were we treated in an offhand way by any one. On the contrary we were well treated, even down in the foyer by the desk staff, who don't appear to have a moment's rest most of the time. The mail room too, had a very helpful guy there who assisted me in sending a package. Someone mentioned irritation at the fact that the Hyatt charges $2 per bag to store for the day, and indeed this is true. But when I saw the military-type operation they have to mount to store the bags that were being deposited on the day we left, I would say that $2 is small beer. They must have a store room the size of an aircraft hangar, as the queue to deposit the bags that morning snaked along the foyer and required two full-time people to receive and ticket those bags. Finally a word about the location of the hotel; it's superb. It's a couple of doors down from Grand Central, so the subway is a moment's walk away and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good food market attached to GC station. There is a deli a few moments walk up the street (on the opposite side of the road), which serves a good breakfast. The hotel is also around the corner from what (in my opinion) is the world's most beautiful building - the Chrysler Building - and is pretty centrally located for walking to the main attractions. It's also on one of those rare occurrences in Manhattan, a two way street, so taxis can approach from both directions, making it easier to get to. And in our case the icing on the cake was that the airport bus to Newark stops just around the corner, so we saved a small fortune by taking that rather than a taxi to Newark. (Incidentally, I'd always fly to Newark now, rather than JFK, it's not much further and it's a smaller and more pleasant airport.) In summary, at least in Regency Club, the Grand Hyatt is a very good hotel and one I would recommend unreservedly.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brownsburg, IN", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "KCandAJ", "ReviewID": "UR18610008", "Content": "Got a good rate but was still worried about the reviews we saw.

The waiter said this had been going on since mid afternoon and that the manager would do \"something.\" Nonetheless they seated my family two tables away from the ruckus so I asked these guys and ladies to keep it down, they then offered to \"tear off my face.\" management finally did restrain them but apparently at least two of them returned to the bar and was served again was waiting to thrash me when I finished dinner, the hotel detective intervened but said it was my fault for talking to them. My position is Hyatt violates the New York Dram laws by serving obviously intoxicated persons.

Our daughter's school group had them booked here and we wanted to be close by, so we took a chance. We got an excellent rate of $223/night through a Hyatt promotion and were very pleased for the value we received in NYC. We arrived at 2 pm and were allowed to check in immediately. When we checked in, we were told there were no rooms with 2 double beds available, even though that is what we requested when we made our reservations 6 month earlier. We were given a room with a king and a rollaway and a promise to move us to a room with 2 beds the following day. We had requested a high floor with a view, but when we arrived at our room on the top floor it overlooked another wall of the hotel! The front desk was very accommodating about offering us a different room, but while it had a street view it was too small to accommodate the rollaway bed, so we stayed in the much larger room with no view. Because our room was not facing the street, we heard no traffic noise, which is very unusual for midtown Manhattan! The rollaway they provided was quite nice and appeared to have a full size mattress which worked well for our teenage daughter. The room was on a short corridor, so we heard no noise from either the hallway or the street . Actually, we decided the large, quiet room with a king bed and rollaway was more comfortable than a smaller room with 2 small double beds, so we stayed in that room for the duration of our visit. After looking a a couple of other rooms, we realized that our room was exceptionally large with a walk in closet as large as the bathroom! It served nicely to both store all our luggage and be used as a private dressing room complete with full length mirror. So, if you want a large, quiet room without a view, ask for room 3428. From the front desk to housekeeping and maintenance, we were very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism of the hotel staff. We experienced a couple of maintenance issues (toilet that flushed too forcefully with geyser-like effect and safe not opening) that were addressed immediately and professionally. They also readily accommodated our request for a 2 pm late check out. The lobby is beautiful and the connection to Grand Central and its food court made it very convenient.

I have stayed at many Hyatts and have usually had great experiences. The experience at the Grand Hyatt New York was not up to my expectations. I had requested early check-in when I had made the reservation on their website. I know this is something that is based on availability and is not something that is guaranteed. Our red-eye flight had arrived at 7 a.m. so by the time we got to the hotel it was around 9 a.m. When we got to the check-in desk and inquired about early check-in the clerk acted almost appalled that we were even inquiring. She said we needed to come back at 3:00 p.m. which was the check-in time. I understand that our room was not available but the attitude we received was not really appreciated or necessary. The clerk had a very thick accent and it was hard to understand what she was even saying so asked her to repeat herself several times. However, her attitude was not hard to understand! We stored our bags with the bellman who also had an attitude and almost scolded us. He said when we returned we must check-in first before we try to claim our bags. When we returned at 3:30 p.m. (30 minutes after their check-in time and the time they told us to return). We waited in line for 20 minutes to be told that our room was still not ready!!!!! At this point I became angry. I explained to the clerk that we had requested early check-in, had been there at 9 a.m. to be told to come back at 3:00 p.m., and it was now nearly 4 p.m. so there was no excuse for our room not to be ready. I was about to ask to speak to the manager and wouldn't you know it all of a sudden a room became available. Their elevator system was confusing. Certain elevators would only go to certain floors but it was not clearly marked. The room was small and dark and pretty ordinary. A few minutes after arriving at the room we heard something at the door. It sounded like someone was trying to get it. I opened the door and there was a hotel employee standing there and almost shocked that we were in the room. She didn't really have an explanation for being there and basically just walked away. I was too tired and exhausted to even call and ask why an employee was trying to get into our room but wasn't really looking forward to another employee with attitude. The next day we had gone out and when we arrived back at the room later in the afternoon it hadn't been made up. However, the housekeeping lady on our floor was standing in the hallway talking on her cellphone on a personal call. How professional! On the day we were leaving our flight wasn't until the early evening. I read in the hotel book that was in the room that they offered a late check-out based on availability. The book stated that they could provide a late check-out as late as 3:00 p.m. without an additional charge. I called at 8:00 a.m. that morning and I asked if we could have a late check-out at 2 p.m. The person I spoked to wanted to haggle with me. If it wasn't available all he had to do was say it wasn't available. I don't know why he insisted on almost arguing about it and then finally agreed. It wasn't an unreasonable request especially when it was stated as a \"benefit\" in their hotel book.

I got a great flight rate, so I decided to Priceline for a 4-star hotel in New York, and I wound up with the Grand Hyatt. I should have known I was in for a bit of a rough ride. And mind you, I definitely know I got a good rate. I would, however, be rather more unhappy if I had paid full price for this place. First, I e-mailed a request to Hyatt e-concierge to see if I could pay extra and upgrade to Regency Club. Mind you, I have done similarly in the past with Hiltons, several Starwood properties, and a couple of Marriotts (the ones that don't close their #*$%@ club lounges on weekends). It's never been a problem. I have also made simple bedding requests of other Hyatts, and I have been treated well. First, I got a flat, \"No\". I then sent an executive e-mail carpet bomb to a few Hyatt higher-ups to see why in the heck I couldn't at least try for something so simple--I wasn't asking for free, I was asking to pay for an upgrade. I actually got a phone call within 2 hours from the Vice-President of the GH New York, telling me the reasoning, and promising that he would check availablilty for me and get back to me. Needless to say, he never did. When I arrived at the Grand Hyatt, I was greeted with a rather gruff young woman who was basically shooing a young couple away when they were asking to change rooms. Uh-oh. I decided not to even ask about the potential upgrade. The young woman in question was fast, but she was cold, demanding, and borderline rude. Great 4-star reception. The room was not clean; there was even trash in the bathroom trashcan from the previous guest. The bathroom wall tiles are plastic, the grout is dirty, and the general feel of the place is very, very tired. The room size is actually pretty big for New York, but the layout was a bit odd. And, as previous guests have noted, the noise coming from adjoining rooms is borderline intolerable. Oh, and our next door neighbors left their room service trays in the hallway the evening we arrived, and they weren't carted away all day until, of course, we were actually drifting off to sleep the next evening. I knew the exact moment, as they made as much noise as humanly possible taking them away. Room service, by the way, is hand over fist the most expensive I have ever seen, and we travel a lot--yes, even to New York. A base price of $23 for a continental (not even including service charges) which is juice, coffee for 1, and a croissant, muffin, OR bagel is kind of, well, insane. Luckily, there are plenty of reasonably priced options within a 2-minute walk in either direction right outside the door. I filled out their survey during video check-out. I did that once at the airport Hyatt in Orlando with a so-so experience, and they CALLED my room within 30 seconds to ask how they could make it up to me. I gave this place a pure thumbs down and heard nothing. Here's the main problem I have. I got a 3-star room, 1.5 star service, and I was pretty much made to feel as if I didn't matter. If I had paid for a 2-star room in New York, I would probably be thrilled. However, this place is supposed to be 4-star, and it just isn't. In any way except for the pretentious lobby. No more Priceline for me in New York. I'll stick to my happy favorite, the Hampton Inn Times Square North.

I regret to report, however, this was by far the WORST trip we have had in this hotel. Thursday night shortly after midnight a large group of high school/college students who were performing Carnegie Hall entered the next room and began laughing and talking loudly enough in the room next door that the sound was traveling right through the wall, against our headboards. I called security at 12:40 am and security came up quickly and the room immediately quieted down, to their credit. Then the next night, a large group of young women, possibly from the same group, stood in the area around the elevator and were literally shouting with laughter, starting at 12:15. This time I called security within 15 minutes as it was clear they were going to use the hall as a social area. I realize that as a hotel return business is important and the large annual traveling groups are a dependable source of revenue.

It is absolutely unacceptable to pay $300+ a night and have to tolerate a situation akin to a college dormitory.

Although this is not a huge selling point, I always enjoy hotels that provide movies in the room (for an additional charge) and I was more than happy with the selection available. An added bonus is the handy dandy electronic check-in and check-out- great for people like me who dislike those tedious routines that come along with traveling. The staff were friendly and even approached us as we were checking out (electronically) to ensure that we enjoyed our stay. However, if you're seeking a uniquely NYC experience or that delightful gem of personalized service, comfort, AND sophistication I would strongly suggest that you look elsewhere. Not surprisingly, the Grand Hyatt's room lacked the coziness or luster that the magnificent lobby (and website) would lead one to anticipate. Although they have attempted to modernize the rooms they came short of accomplishing anything truly impressive- I would even go so far as to say the decor comes uncomfortably close to being tacky. Nevertheless, it is what it is... a standard, generic hotel room. Despite my negative assertions above my experiences at the hotel were nothing less than satisfactory- I was even startled to find out that the room was slightly larger than I expected. Also, my companion traveler and I were without our luggage (I have more than a few unkind things to write about Continental Airlines) and the hotel provided us with 3 kits full of deluxe-sized toiletries.

People staying here after visiting other hotels (perhaps even other Hyatts) may be shocked at how small the rooms are. What they should realize is that Manhattan is a tiny island that is full of millions of people - rooms are small everywhere. Maybe if you pay $800 a night on the Upper East Side you will have more space, but for $400 a night in Midtown, this hotel is amazing. The rooms are quite small, but are lovely inside. The beds are very comfortable and all the furnishings are new and elegant. Don't expect much of a view, but there are few places in Midtown that will have a fabulous view. There is far too much to do in NYC to worry about a small room with no view. Just be happy there are no cockroaches. On that note, I will mention that the entire hotel is beautifully clean at all times. The only meal I ever ate here was breakfast (again, in New York there is just so much choice - why eat at the hotel??). The brunch is quite nice - if you go at peak times, expect to wait in a rather long line for a table. The restaurant is generally full of businessmen, and they are in and out quite quickly.

This is not a hotel with particularly memorable spaces (bars, restaurants etc) but it is pleasant and the rooms are well sized and equipped. The location is very central, and decent venues are a walk or short cab ride away.

It was twice the size of other 4-star hotels in NYC, had a huge bathroom, and very nice amenities. SUper clean! There was a TV in the center of the room that swiveled so you could watch it in bed or at the desk, which came in handy.

My review goes out to holiday makers who may be swithering over it........ I arrived on the 29th Dec 2007 for 4 nights and was delighted when I walked in the entrance, lovely waterfall, grand decor. No queue at check in, girl was lovely and even though we were 3hrs early our room was ready. We got a king deluxe. The room was clean, bed was comfy and luckily our view was excellent (chrysler building). The cleaners were in everyday, bed was changed, towels replaced, bathroom cleaned all the usual, plus as a bonus a paper (New York Times)was left every morning, no charge. The only thing I would say about the rooms are that the walls must be very thin its quite easy to hear next door and prob vice versa however this was not majorly offputting at all and given everything else who cares cause what more could you want, seriously, your in New York, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room if your on holiday! Staff were very friendly throughout, we didn't eat in there but had a drink at each of the bars, expensive, normal for hotels, but comfortable...(theres a lovely cafe 'Pershing' across the road to the right for great breakfast)...there are a couple of shops in the hotel which we discovered last day! (should you need the usual keyrings etc before you go please try the gift shop before you leave the lady in there is lovely!) To check out you can do this self service or use the 'human' which we did and was fine, plus gave us a chance to say how happy we were with everything. So should you be pondering over the Grand Hyatt, please don't. If you want a lovely hotel thats close to everything (next door to grand central station for every subway you need, five mins walk to bryant park, 10 mins to times square) then go for it!

On the plus side, the hotel was very well organized for the company events, and the fitness center was well-appointed, clean, and modern, if not a bit small for so many rooms. The rooms are comfortable and modern, although not entirely cozy. One final negative point was the business center, which is closed Sundays.

I am giving it a 3 rating because it is just about what I would expect of an average 4 star hotel in NYC in that price range. I would give it a 4 rating based on our discounted priceline rate, but I think it is only fair to review it based on the published rate. The Hotel is so conveniently located within Grand Central Terminal that if you arrive by train, you never have to even step one foot outside before reaching your hotel room. You can also get to almost anywhere else in the city from there. We took the train from Stamford (just 45 minutes to Grand Central) and within 5 minutes of arriving at Grand Central Terminal we were checking into our hotel. The line wasn't too long, about a 4 minute wait. There are many electronic check in kiosks, but we opted to check in directly since we prefer a more personable check in, and to make sure that we are happy with the room they selected. The front desk was very pleasant and found us a very nice room on a high floor with a King bed. Views in this hotel are very limited since tall buildings surround it on all sides, but we were able to get a decent view of the Met LIfe Building. In the end it hardly mattered, since we were not in our rooms that often and when we were, we had little interest in staring out the window anyway. The Hotel is very large with a beautiful Lobby. Unfortunately the large marble waterall/fountain was out of order, but I can imagine how beautiful it must be when it is working. As some other reviewers mentioned, you can hear some hallway noises, conversations, and televisions from the neighboring rooms from time to time. It was not unbearable, but perhaps it is worse when the hotel is at full occupancy. Hard to know. Some better soundproofing would be nice, but this is fairly common in large hotels. One noticeable plus was the over sized walk in closet. Not sure if this is standard or if we just lucked out, but we had a walk in closet that was almost twice the size of the bathroom. They had an ironing board in there, which is also a huge plus. You need to pull it out to iron, since there are no outlets in the closet, but it wasn't an issue. The bathroom is a bit on the small side, but perfectly fine. It was very clean with marble and granite and very nice Portico bath products and a hairdryer. The shower pressure was decent, with a large Speakman shower head. The towels were a bit rough, likely from countless washes, but fine. Some reviewers mentioned that there was no toothpaste offered, but from my experience at many hotels, toothpaste is almost never offered unless requested. I'm sure if we needed it they would send some up, or you could easily go down to the hundreds of shops in Grand Central Terminal and pick up any supplies you need. There is a convenient ice machine and vending machine on the floor just down the hall from the elevators. There is no mini-bar in the room, but this ended up saving us a lot of money in the end. There are plenty of delis and stores all around the area, so you can get outside food and drinks easily. We did not order room service or eat in any of the hotel restaurants. The fitness center is better than most NYC hotels, with plenty of Life Fitness brand machines and towels, water, and full cable television programming on the ellipticals, treadmills, etc. At first I was sorry I didn't bring my own headphones, but soon I realized that they supply you with free headphones near the towels. The only downside was on our second day when there was some error with the red emergency phones within the Gym. At one point during my workout, about 2 Hotel security guards and 3 NYC police officers stormed in to the fitness center to respond to an emergency call that (apparently) no one had placed from one of the many red emergency phones within the gym. The Police came back a couple times during my workout, creating a distraction and speaking in a very loud and accusatory tone warning us all not to touch the red phones or they would shut down the fitness center. It was very uncomfortable. I was close to finishing my workout so I decided to cut it short. I have no idea how it ended. Either way, I felt the Hotel security could have handled this situation much better by putting a security guard there after the first incident or having better surveillance cameras. I'm sure there was a technical problem with the phones, which should have been their first consideration before assuming it was a prank or somehow intentional. On the bright side, if there ever is an emergency there, at least you can be assured that the authorities will arrive within seconds. The cleaning staff was very efficient and left our room spotless every day. We had a small problem with our in-room security safe. The safe was already closed and locked beforehand, so we could not use it. We called the front desk and they sent a security agent over (within minutes) but they could not fix it since they needed special equipment to drill it open. They apologized for the inconvenience. It was fine, since the Hotel is very secure anyway. Overall, it is a very nice hotel and we slept very comforatably each night, which is the most important aspect of any hotel. The beds were very stylish and comfortable. The rooms were spacious for NYC standards. Because it is such a large hotel, I realize it is often hard to get personable service, yet we had many positive experiences with the tour desk, cleaning staff, and other hotel representatives. It did take a bit long to get the front desk to answer the phone, but it varied depending on the time of day and how busy they were at the time. At one point we were on hold for over 3 minutes and I just gave up but on another day they answered it right away. The most important thing to remember is that if you smile and are pleasant and nice to people, they will usually smile and be nice back. You can help make your own experience better by having a positive attitude. If you are uptight and demanding to anyone then you are unlikely to be treated well and will be unhappy with service anywhere. Contrary to several reviews on this site, no one within the hotel staff was ever rude to us during our stay. Everyone was very pleasant. If you can book this hotel at a discounted rate, it is an excellent choice. On the other hand, if you have money to burn and want complete pampering and perfect service, then I would suggest a higher end hotel.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201cRooms Drab, service zero, location fabulous\u201d", "Author": "ruchirabajaj", "ReviewID": "UR12536686", "Content": "Grand Hyatt, is at the perfect location, right next to Grand Central, Time Square, Cabs, and all the other fun placed to be in New York, if you are a tourist.

The lobby is impressive,clean and busy with people moving in and out , so this is a great place for people watching. The staff was helpful and smiled even with a full house! Room- This is the major downfall of this hotel. It has nothing to do with the size of the living space or the bath. It is all to do with the cleanliness, which I have to give a 2 on a scale of 1-10. Moldy shower tiles, bath floors which look as if they have not seen a clean mop in years, dust and \"stuff\" all over fixtures,window sills and with no exaggeration, years of dust under end tables and by heat fixtures.

We ate out, and I suggest using Open Table, a internet reservation site which can aid you in finding a great restaurant, not only by category,but also by neighborhood. I found this site about 3 years ago and it is priceless in most cities. You can find restaurants on very short notice and eliminate the waiting game. Reviews are linked to this site,as well,so you should be able to find the right food at whatever price range that you choose. We did eat breakfast at the hotel, which has only one restaurant open in the am and encountered a long line. After about a 30 minute wait, we ate the buffet (at $30 per) which did have a decent amount of choices at typical NYC rates. HINT: Go downstairs into Grand Central Station which has a huge dining,floor with many,many dining choices. Real restaurants, as well as fast food in a historic setting. There are loads of stores underground,as well,so do not miss this detour!

Our room was on the 16th floor and appeared to be fairly recently redecorated; it was the nicest room we've had there and its decor reflected the hyatt website photos. The bath was small but OK, bed was very comfy. TV was in good working order. Windows opened but had view of air shaft (not a concern for us).

It was a \"complimentary\" stay earned from Hyatt's GoldPassport system, so I suppose beggars can't be choosers. Overall, we had a pleasant time, but it wasn't quite what I expected from \"Grand Hyatt.\" The Good: Very friendly and attentive front desk staff, bell staff and front door staff. As opposed to some others here who've found the assistance less than great, we were very impressed both days with the \"people\" component. I also thought that the \"StayFit\" fitness facility was quite nice - clean, well-stocked, with very modern equipment. Very impressive The OK: The room was clean and well-kept. The desk space was workable and the TV was functional. The closet was good, and there was drawer storage. But overall, the room was very, very SMALL. The ice bucket and hotel information menu had to be placed on the window sill because there was no other place for them!! I've been in comparable \"standard\" rooms in midtown Manhattan at the Marriott Marquis, Marriott East Side and Millennium Broadway - and they've all been larger, with larger bathrooms. The Grand Hyatt room had two \"double\" beds (as requested). I didn't have my tape measure, but the beds seemed even smaller than a standard double. My 10 year old and 12 year old were cramped in one... we won't even mention me and my wife. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked, but also minuscule - no room on the sinktop for much more than a toothbrush and toothpaste. The Bad: Room Service was a disaster. I'd made arrangements for a surprise - \"Milk and Cookies Package\" - to be delivered at 8PM for my kids. I did this via the E-concierge. Upon arrival, there was no record of the request (despite my e-mail \"confirmation.\") The front desk staff tried to help re-arrange things, but room service called to confirm a \"New York Survival Package\" 30 minutes after we got to the room (4PM). I straightened that out, only to have the \"Milk and Cookies\" sent right away (at 4:15PM). The people in Room Service were unhelpful, surly, and I sat on hold for long periods of time. When it came time for breakfast, let's just say that we dispensed with both Room Service and the $30/per person breakfast buffet and went to the food court in Grand Central Station, where we had a delightful breakfast from Zaro's Bakery for $25 for all 4 of us.

I'm supposed to stay there in December with my wife as a pre-Christmas treat, but we'll have to see... I might try to switch to another hotel.

I arrived at 10 pm and was attended to immediately. The room on the 28th Floor was comfortable, clean and had all amenities but lacked a minibar or any special touches. It was supposed to be a kingsize bed but seemed only a standard double and my booking was changed to a Deluxe King \"on request\" but this did not materialise. I did not complain as I was paying the lowest available room rate. It was also very warm and the air con didn't seem to cool it (although the window did open). It is expensive but then most hotels in New York are but a tip I would pass on is if you catch the airport non stop 'bus from JFK this terminates just opposite so you can save some dolllars on cabs/other transportation. Breakfast is a varied buffet - around $37 with a 15% tip, but there are alternatives in the area (I tried one 2 blocks down Lexington where a cooked breakfast with coffee, juice - & a bigger tip! - was $12) I asked for a late check out and was given 1.30pm which helped as my return flight was 6.15pm which saved the $2 charge for luggage storage(?)

The room as no minibar, bottled water or any other facility always found in hotels claiming to be five star standard. Laundry prices are ludicrous - it is cheaper to buy new clothes than use the service. I was invited to partake of the Regency Club's \"cocktail hour\" from 6pm to 8pm - this is a traditional service found in all Hyatt's as well as the best hotel groups. One difference at this hotel - you have to pay for the cocktails!! In my 40 years of travelling I have never heard of this.

The building was very impressive as was the lobby. There was a slight wait at the concierge to check-in, but the service was friendly and helpful. We had early check-in, and sure enough our room was ready. Our room was 2117, and as we approached through the hallway, it was littered with room service items. We figured since people had just checked out and housekeeping was just getting around to cleaning it up, but for the duration of our stay there was constantly trays outside. Luckily our room was well appointed with the updated linens and decor. The room was bigger than I imagined with a king size bed, tv with cable. The bathroom was definitely New York sized though, and I didn't feel like it was the cleanest hotel bathroom I've ever been in. But it did have nice Lemon + Lavender scented toiletries. As well as a so-so hairdryer. Our biggest complaint was the noise. The walls were paper thin and we could hear the guy next door sneezing and coughing as well as people talking in the hallway. Another complaint was the price of room service. Yes, this is New York, but $8 for a cup of coffee + $5 delivery charge + 15% gratuity + 2% tax? We're talking almost $15 for one coffee. I don't know who was able to afford all the plates of food we kept seeing in the hallway. Our checkout went smoothly, and we opted to do it through the concierge to avoid any strange charges to the room or whatnot that come with travelling. Then we left our bags with the Bell desk, which cost us $2 a bag. All in all, it was an average stay. I've never stayed in a hotel in NYC as I've always stayed with family, so it was my first experience.

I was travelling alone. I booked the hotel via Hyatt.com, and got a special rate using a code from the Travelzoo website. My stay happened to coincide with the steam-pipe explosion in New York, which happened 1-2 blocks from the hotel, so my experience of staying there was probably a bit abnormal, but nonetheless I enjoyed the 5 nights I spent at the hotel. I arrived in New York by air (from Philadelphia) and made my way to the hotel via the New York Airport Service bus, which drops off at Grand Central Station, next door to the hotel. You can enter the hotel either from the street or directly from Grand Central Station. The lobby interior is extremely well done, and if anything is a little over-the-top! Access to the lobby from either entrance is by escalator or stairs; I'm sure there must be a lift too, but I didn't see one. Check-in was hassle-free, though I arrived at midday and my room wasn't ready until 3pm (as advertised). They stored my luggage free of charge (there's a $2 charge per item if you store luggage after checking out) leaving me to go out and explore the Big Apple before getting into my room. The hotel is ideally located right next door to Grand Central Station, in Midtown Manhattan. If you're unfamiliar with New York the main city is on Manhattan Island, with largely residential areas on Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Uptown Manhattan has Central Park, while downtown Manhattan is home to the financial district. No prizes for guessing where midtown is :-) It's a good idea to use the metro to get around, and don't even consider driving - the traffic was absurdly bad! My room, when I got into it, was on the 20th floor of the hotel. It was large (I'm told a boxroom is the norm for a hotel in NYC, but this room was very spacious) and featured a small walk-in wardrobe, a comfortable King bed, a desk / working area, a small couch and TV, and a small but well equipped bathroom. (My room was at the end of the corridor so may have been slightly larger than others.) I was surprised to find there was no tea/coffee making facility in the room, nor was there a minibar (or an empty fridge). Perhaps I'm too used to traditional British hospitality... There was a fitness centre on the top floor of the hotel and though I didn't use it, it seemed fairly well equipped with weights / cardiovascular machines etc. It gave a great view over the city too. I only ordered room service once; returning from a Broadway show I had a craving for chocolate cake and milkshake, and it was delivered to my room within about 10 minutes of calling downstairs (at 1am). It was fairly expensive at almost $30 including tip etc, but worth it!!! I think there was wireless internet access in the public areas of the hotel, but I'm not sure if there was (free) access from guestrooms. The 24 hour business centre provided internet access at a hefty price - I think it was something like 50cents / minute, which to me is very expensive considering the cost of a room. As I mentioned above, the first night of my stay was when the steampipe explosion occurred in New York - scary, to say the least. For the remainder of my stay (until I was leaving for the airport!) the only access to the hotel was via Grand Central Station, but there were plenty of hotel staff around to provide directions and so on. Check-out was relatively hassle-free but I did have to wait in line for 5-10 minutes before diong so, which was quite annoying. The hotel has around 1000 rooms and I think you can check out by phone or with an automatic machine too, but I chose to wait in line with the 999 other people ;-) To be fair the desk staff were very fast at processing the queue, and my bill was in order when I was served. Overall this is a comfortable hotel in the heart of New York City, but I think with such high room rates the business centre should be free, or at least much cheaper than it is.

We have previously stayed at Hyatt locations in Europe so we had high hopes for our holiday accommodation. Our regret is to let you know that our stay at Grand Hyatt New York was a terribly disappointing fiasco. During our check in, after we had waited in the line for a long time, we were appointed to an awfully worn smoking room with absolutely no view at all. The room smelled so terrible that my fiancee got a migraine headache. When we requested a room change, we got downgraded to a lesser room which we accepted, because it did not have the smell, and we also could see out of it's small window. The television in the room was useless because we could not find it's remote control, although we searched the room as well as we could. The room did not even have a minibar. We did not mind the weariness of the property, but because our room was not cleaned properly, especially the bathroom was disgustingly dirty during our visit. This we could not expect in supposedly high class hotel. The service was generally inefficient with a careless attitude towards the service. We had to wait for three days before our laundry bag was collected after 5 phone requests. Once in the evening when we were ready to go to bed, we noticed that our bed linnen were changed into dirty sheets with stains in them. At this point we were so tired that we desided to not call housekeeping and just slept without the sheets. Also, the communication with the staff was sometimes quite difficult, because only few spoke english. The concierge service could not help us even with the most general questions, so we had to find out everything in the town by ourselves. For example, when we requested whether it is possible to find a swimming pool in Manhattan, the concierge told us that it is something that people do in Miami and is not possible unless we are guests in some other hotel. So we went to a beautiful rooftop swimming pool located at only a couple of blocks away from the hotel, which we found by using the Google internet search. The hotel's restaurant was vintage from the 80's. The service was unprofessional, for example when we ordered a glass of champagne, we got a glass of cava. After complaining we were told that the restaurant does not serve \"the real champagne\". The only thing high class was the restaurant's pricing. The staff's only talent seemed to be getting tipped even if there were no service what so ever. We had to pay all together $25 just to get out of the hotel with our bags, which we carried by ourselves. A taxi that the bellboy arranged for us took us to the airport with a fixed \"taxfree\" fee which was much higher than a metered fee would have been. The arrangement was not told us before got to the airport when we requested a receipt for the trip. We never received our complimentary morning beverage, which we are entitled to because I am a Gold Passport Platinum member and although we stayed at the hotel for six nights. When we checked out, we received 57% reduction of the morning beverage price which was in total $160 and we ended up paying because of the confusion. Also, I did not receive the Gold Passport bonus points that were offered to me for the stay. The customer service did never reply to my letter and I never received any compensation for the room downgrade, although I had prepaid for a deluxe room. We will never stay at Grand Hyatt New York again and I doubt that we will stay at any Hyatt location again in the future.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cA bad experience from start to finish...\u201d", "Author": "travelingirlUsa", "ReviewID": "UR8240469", "Content": "I generally stay at Westins and this is one example of why I'll choose other hotels over a Hyatt. Even the Hilton at Rockefeller Center had better service than the Hyatt at the Grand Central Terminal. From the moment we arrived, I knew this was going to be a disappointing stay. When our Towncar pulled up at the curb, two valets eyed the car, neither one of them stepping forward to open the door. Once our luggage was lined up on the curb, again, neither man offered assistance. Nor did they point us in the direction of the front desk. I'm a Gold Passport member and, despite the fact that my profile specifically states that I prefer quiet rooms away from the elevator, the room we were assigned was directly across from the elevator (noisy as hell during a conference, btw). When I asked for a room change, I was given a tiny room--literally, when you walked into the room, you almost tripped over the bed. Considering how small the bathrooms are--and the vanity has absolulely NO space for toiletries--we needed a second mirror in the room. So we stuck with our initial room, which was a step up from the tiny cave they offered us when we requested the room change. No amenities in the room--no coffeemaker, bottled water, refrigerator or mini-bar. I've had better amenties and customer service at lesser brand hotels. And what is the point/benefit of being a Passport member, anyway? The customer service was awful. I asked the tour hostess for a map and she literally threw it on the counter as though she was annoyed that I'd interrupted her (doing nothing by the way...). The food was nothing to write home about. The drinks were seriously overpriced, even for NY, and again, the service... horrible. After all that, they double billed me.

The bathroom was small with little room for personal toiletries. The wi-fi service worked well but cost an additional $9.95 per day. The hotel restaurant only serves a breakfast buffet which with tax and tip cost $35.00 per person. It was good but not that good. More reasonably priced restaurants are available across the street from the main hotel entrance. The food court in Grand Central Station can also be acessed without going outside and has many very reasonable food options. The lobby coffee stand is an another option but it also charges NYC hotel prices. I had problems at check in. I had reserved a room with two double beds. The first room I was given was a beautiful junior suite with one queen bed. At 4:00 p.m., I had to wait more than an hour for a room with two double beds to become available.

The full-length mirror on the closet door was filthy. I had them bring me a new desk chair since the original one had a large stain on it. Overall, none of the employees was especially personable. The bed was comfortable, but there were a variety of stains (black marks, what appeared to possibly be makeup, etc.) and holes on the worn sheets. A few random hairs were spotted in the room (on toilet, between sheets, etc.). The bathroom was small - not enough room to place your toiletries on the vanity. The bathtub in my room needed to be reglazed - it appeared quite dirty and I'd recommend that anyone who stays here bring flip flops to shower in. The towels were worn, clean, but quite used and there were one or two towels whose stains bothered me so much that I chose not to use them. I requested extra towels all three nights of my stay. The first two nights I requested towels all went well. But the third night, the man who delivered them seemed a bit bothered and barely grunted a greeting when I opened the door. Daily housekeeping was not great - it looked like someone rushed through the room on a tight time schedule. You could see the wipe marks on the faucet and you could also see spots on the vanity that the housekeeper missed. Given the details that were overlooked, I wondered if the housekeeper assigned to my room might have been cleaning the room with her eyes closed. The concierge was helpful in identifying a spot for dinner one night, but not too detailed in giving directions.

In addition, we were right above the newly renovated train station, which could easily get us anywhere around the City without even going outside the hotel.

We decided to stay in the area for lunch and checked our bags with the bellman. We returned about 2pm, when another receptionist told us they were sorry, still no rooms--again not very helpful. We were pretty frustrated as we wanted to change clothes and head out for a bike tour (great time--centralparkbiketour.com) through central park and we were killing most of the day. About ten minutes later I went to another receptionist who miraculously came up with a room for us when she did a little further computer research. We got a double room (no view) on the 17th floor, which was very nice and actually pretty big for NY standards. The bathroom was on the small side and very plain, but all was clean and comfortable, especially the amazing Hyatt beds. Other issues with the hotel were that there was not a coffee maker in the room. We did get tokens for coffee downstairs, but one of us would have to get dressed and run down there each morning. In addition, it seemed like the walls were very thin and we could hear everything in the rooms next to us. Overall, we still had a good experience as the location was superb and the hotel had the Hyatt comfortableness.

I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt several times in the past two years, and generally find it is an acceptable business hotel. They have large meeting facilties, so many of the New York investment banks hold Investor Conferences here. This trip I arrived to find I had been upgraded to a larger room than normal. The room had a large entry area that was separated from the bedroom area by a credenza with a TV on it that rotated to be viewed either from the bed or from the entry area. The room was clean, but it smelled like it had previously been a smoking room that they had sprayed \"clean\" to use it as a non-smoking room. There was a large desk, which made working convenient, along with a comfortable chair near the bed. The closet was large, but the bathrooms in the Grand Hyatt are extremely small with virtually no counter space for sundries. However, the rooms were remodeled in the past few years, and are reasonably nice. Also, the beds, pillows, and linens are very comfortable. I used the fitness center, which has a good collection of cardiovascular equipment with individual TV's, and a small amount of weight equipment. The fitness center also has a nice view of the city. I ordered room service, which took almost an hour to arrive, despite the 35 minute claim. The food was delivered hot. My only complain was with housekeeping. When I arrived, I called to ask for a robe to be sent to the room. I then went to workout. I returned to the room 90 minutes later, and there was no robe. Housekeeping explained that their deliver had not come yet, and they would send one up as soon as they arrived. After showering from my workout, I noticed there were no bath towels in the room. I called to request bath towels, and a few minutes later, the robe I requested was delivered. Then, I called again for towels 30 minutes later, and a second robe was delivered instead. I called again, and finally the bath towels were delivered. I haven't had this problem with housekeeping on prior stays. I am in New York every 4-6 weeks for an investor conference.

We asked for two doubles and each got a king and had to have roll-a-way beds brought in. In addition to that, they also had our rate incorrect by $30. They corrected this but then wanted to charge an extra $20 for the roll-a-way since they said two doubles was not a guarantee unless you want a room on a smoking floor. Frankly, I think this tactic is an insult. So as far as what we got... What was great: the property location. What was good: the bed comfort and the room size (until we had to accommodate the roll-a-way). The bad: the rooms do not have a coffee maker (although we got a complimentary cup upon checkout), no refrigerator (can't bring any drinks or perishable food to your room) and there is no full length mirror. The only mirror is the one above the sink in the bathroom. Not good when two people are trying to get showered and dressed at the same time. Also, the bathroom does not have a fan so it gets pretty steamy in there. We all had cold showers or the water would run cold then suddenly become very hot, then cold again. The towels were rough. Also, this is the only hotel I've ever stayed anyplace that charged guests ($2 a bag) for storing bags at checkout so we could spend more time in the city. We're not cheap... we always tip the staff for this service but does Hyatt really need the extra money from their guests?

Also, the sink drain didn't work properly and the door stuck on closing so you always had to remember to close it behind you by hand.

The hotel has a mini/mini snackbar in the lobby - which was closed in the evening, soda machines and a very expensive breakfast buffet (Try $29 per person!!) We did not eat at the buffet because I did not want to shell out $150 just for breakfast for our group of 5. I wish the hotel would include a small refridgerator in the room because if you needed anything to drink or eat you had to leave the hotel. (Of course I could have paid the extra $25 for a refridgerator in my room but I was already paying $225 per night and we would just make do with the ice buckett. What I did discover on the last day was that 2 blocks south of the hotel was a very good and inexpensive restaurant called Cafe Metro (or was that Metro Cafe) either way for $3.00 you got a good hot breakfast. (To find this restaurant - exit the front lobby - turn left, at the first intersection, turn right and cross street, go about 2 short blocks and you will see Cafe Metro) I didn't have any other issues with this hotel. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable. Everything worked and there were no surprises - a short walk out the front door to Grand Central Station - I know they say there is a direct entrance to Grand Central but some of the time it was closed off. (or else we would get lost in G.C.S. and end up on the street in front anyway) I just wouldn't stay here again because of the food & beverage issue.

The bathroom, as mentionend in other reviews, is absolutely the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in a GRAND Hyatt but due to the fact that one normally doesn't live in the bathroom, it was okay :-). What I disliked was the bad lighting in the room! Thanks to the big window we had enough light during the day, but in the evening I found it quite dark because there were no ceiling lights. We only had the bedside lights, a small and useless desk light and something of a floor light which was everything else but not bright. I also missed a fridge or at least a minibar... and the advertised Ipod-thing-stereo was in every brochure but not on my desk... Bed was really comfortable, 32inch TV (no flat... hm...) and the fitness center on 24floor is very good equiped! The a/c helped us to survive the cold nights, really, the heating is perfect. I would like to differ the cleanliness of the room and the rest of the hotel. It seems that housekeeping does just the rooms and nobody is responsible for the floors; especially leftovers (food) remained for hours (some for more than 24 hours) on the hallway.

Also I gave my Gold Hyatt passport number. The clerk was very kind and mentioned I would get points for incidentals only. There was no mention of Priceline I arrived at 10:30 AM for my two night stay and the clerk said Room 2235 was blocked for me but was not clean. I signed my folio were I saw the Priceline prepay price of $251.00. Again, Priceline was never mentioned. i was pleased with my bid after seeing the prepay price since my $110.00 bid came out to $266 that included tax and service charge for my two nights stay. The clerk offered to check me in and told me to place my luggage with the bellman. I was told to come back in a few hours. That was fine with me since I had plans to visit some friends. I returned at 9:30 PM and the clerk said my room was 2236. When I balked anf said I reserved 2235 she apologized and said an error must have occurred. I took 2235 and went to the large bank of elevators after picking up my luggage from the bell capitan. When I got to the room, which was across from the ice and soda machines, I opened the door to an unclean room. Back I went to the desk for a new room assignment. After a bit of going back and forth I got room 2335. That room was incredibly spacious with a sitting area, large king size bed, a walk in closet, and decent size tv. There was no mini-bar or coffee maker. Furniture blocks the bed from the sitting area and provides for spacious accomodations. I think the 35 - 41 rooms are some of the largest so I would recommend trying to get those. Remember the room may be large but the bathroom is small. Really, really small. Paramount small. You get a sink, toilet, and bathtub/shower. There is barely room to move around and forget about storing toiletries since there is no counter space, The Hyatt should be ashamed of the bathrooms. Products in the bathroom were not replished - half a shampoo bottle, no new soap, but its hard to complain if that was the worst of it all. I found the bed to be very comfortable, the tv full of enough channels, the sheets of good quality, and the towels abit thin. Finally, I got a NYTimes every day by my door. The negatives about this hotel: impersonal service thin bath towels no coffee maker no mini bar two dollar charge to store luggage ten dollar charge for wireless internet small,small, small bathroom there are many pluses my room was large it was quiet shower had good hot water and lots of pressure nice beds and comfortable pillows fast elevators good location - close to times square and in grand central station great price for NYC if you luck out like I did and land the $110 special on Priceline. I did not use the healthclub since this was such a busy trip for me nor did I use room service. There are plenty of deli's and things nearby and in Grand Central Station. There is a great bagel place in Grand Central and tons of small deli's for breakfast and sandwiches.

The tired theme continues throughout the hotel really, from the dented elevators to the chipped paintwork on the door of every room, to the antique shower in your room. You get the sense that this place used to be really nice, about 20 years ago, but no one can be bothered to even give it a lick of paint. For Hyatt Hotels this surely must be a flagship - I mean it's their huge hotel in NYC, but they've seemingly forgotten about it. Staff are friendly, the room was much much bigger than expected (and bathroom much smaller), the room decor is OK and the bed extremely comfortable. However the room temperature controls didn't work and there were a few things missing - room service menu, tea/coffee maker, mini-bar. A bit odd for this class of hotel. Oh and the hotel bar closes at 1am. Location is the best thing - you're right in the middle of where you want to be, but then again there are a number of large hotels in NYC that can boast that. The hotel always seems to be absolutely teeming with people so I don't expect it'll get the facelift it desperately needs in the near future judging by the amount of business it gets.

You're literally in Grand Central Station, so there are tons of restaurants, bakeries, and a Rite Aid right there. Plus you don't even need to go outside to get the subway. Our room had a very awkward lay-out, the sitting area in our deluxe king room was located behind the television. The lighting was terrible, the only lights in the room were the 2 bedside lamps and a paper-covered lantern in the corner of the sitting area. There was no desk lamp, which is odd, since the website says that they offer \"enhanced workspace lighting\". No overhead light, either. There's no coffee pot in the room but there is a kiosk downstairs where you can get free coffee or tea in the morning. Our room didn't have any literature on hotel amenities, NYC events, etc., not even a room service menu. Drinks at the bar were overpriced - this is NYC, I know, but it was excessive - and the bar wasn't that great to begin with. Hyatt advertises special iPod stereos, we just had a regular clock radio in our room. The window was very drafty and didn't seem to close properly. The room was extremely dry and always either too hot or too cold, the thermostat didn't seem to work properly. There were scuff marks on the walls and wallpaper was peeling in some spots. We were told that since I'm a Gold Passport member, we would get a free NYT delivered every day. Instead, I had to call the front desk and practically beg for a paper. I was told that since we didn't get one for the first 2 days of our stay we would get one on Sat. and Sun. even though they normally don't deliver on weekends...but we never got the weekend paper. One of the benefits of being a Gold Passport member is a late check-out, we were not allowed to check out late because the hotel was booked for the next day. The front desk staff was very unresponsive. I called the desk around 6pm and it took about 5 minutes for someone to actually answer the phone - I stopped counting after 30+ rings on my first phone call.

This hotel is always crowded. HOWEVER the staff is amazing for the amount of people they have to deal with on a daily basis. The staff at the bell desk is so helpful. The lobby is breathtaking, MUCH better than the Waldorf! I went by myself and stayed in a room with a queen bed. I found the room to be spacious for NYC standards. If you want to talk \"small\", try the W on Lexington. Bathroom is small but totally adequate. If you want a huge bathroom, go to Vegas and stay at the Venetian. The bed, sheets, pillows, and furniture in the room are very comfortable. For a hotel to be in Grand Central, I find it to be very quiet. I have had my best nights sleep in NYC EVER here!!!!! Now the BEST part of this hotel (besides the FREE coffee in the morning which was great!) is that you can actually PRINT your boarding pass in the lobby. Saves plenty of time for me at JFK.

We enjoyed the room's contemporary decor, and it was very clean. The bed was also quite comfortable. One problem was that our room adjoined with the next one, and the doors were not sound-proofed. There appeared to be several high school groups staying in the hotel, and the students staying in the room next to ours were arguing, talking loudly and squealing past midnight. We heard it all much too clearly and called the front desk to complain. The other problem was with the climate control in the room. We stayed during a January warm spell, and we couldn't get the room to cool down our first night. It was as if only the heat was working.

The city is like no other in the world, and neither are the hotels because the cost of real estate is so high. (Want sunken tubs? Try Vegas or the Poconos, bathrooms in NYC are functional and meant for business.) For posh decor and design with a touch of luxury, then 5* hotels are for you. They include The Ritz Carlton, Trump Tower, Mandarin Oriental, and arguably The Palace and Four Seasons. There are several 4* showhorse hotels that wannabe 5* so they try hard. They include The Intercontinental the Barclay, the Michelangelo, The Carlton, and The Plaza Athenee. Then there are the 4* workhorse hotels. The ones designed for business travelers looking for a nice place to stay in New York convenient to transportation and featuring business amenities. The most well known of these are the Sofitel and NY Hilton and Towers. But The Grand Hyatt is another. I like, I mean Sally Field reaaally like, the Grand Hyatt. Because it is geared towards business travel, weekends are often discounted. And I love a bargain. We were able to snag two rooms on the very busy 12/9/06 \"blackout\" weekend for $200 a room. We checked in at 10:30 a.m. That's correct, a.m.! We got two rooms with king beds. Very clean, very comfortable. The rooms look exactly like the photos on the hotel's Web site. Despite the hotel being very full, we never heard a peep all night. And the bed was almost too comfortable to leave. If you want a posh-type hotel this would not be for you.

Due to the time of year (the holiday season) - we had a hard time finding a room in our price range for the weekend. We originally booked the Hotel Wolcott (still $260/night - ouch) since we wanted to save some money for shopping - but a week before we left I read on this site some reviews on it that included bed bugs... so in a scramble I started trying to find another hotel room. So I tried Priceline - and named an offer for four star hotels at $250/night (this same offer did not work earlier that month - but I thought I'd try it anyway) and it was accepted by the Grand Hyatt. We were so happy to be paying less than our budget hotel and to be bed bug free. The location was awesome. It's right beside Grand Central which made getting to places sooo easy. We took the subway to and from dinner and down to Soho for shopping. The valet service was easy getting in and out - although pricey at almost $50 per night. We requested a non-smoking room in a quiet location. They put us near the end of the hall on the 26th floor - and it was quiet as promised. We didn't hear any street noise or anything which is amazing for New York. We had two double beds and the room was perfect for two people - but the size of the bathroom and the room would probably be uncomfortable for more than two (which I assume was the case for some of the reviewers on this site). Everything was very clean in the room although the hallway carpet was sort of dingy. Our only complaint about the room is that the heat/air unit was pretty weak - we turned the thermostat down to 49 trying to get it to pump some cool air - but ended up having to open the window to cool it down. If your feet cannot take you any further at night - do like we did and eat at the bar at the Commodore Grill in the hotel one night. Although very expensive ($20 for a burger) - the bar staff was very friendly and full of useful information. They even gave us vouchers for the full breakfast at the hotel the next morning ($35 each value) which was sooo nice and very appreciated.

Having spent 2 weeks prior in fantastic hotels on the west coast we were looking forward to staying at the Hyatt (which was about 3 times the price as any other hotel we'd been in). At first sight the Hyatt is impressive with a busy lobby full of christmas decorations however this luxury was not reflected in the rooms. Firstly, we arrived in the early hours of the morning due to a cancelled flight - I rang them to let them know that we would be this late. When we checked into our double room we found ourselves in a twin room - not so good for a honeymoon couple! I rang reception to ask if we could change to a room with a larger bed and were told they would ring us back - which they didn't. I went down to the lobby to ask and was told there was no further availability but to check again in the morning. When I went back to the room we realised we were also in a smoking room, despite all of our booking information requesting a non-smoking room. In the morning I requested a room change and was given another room - this time it was non-smoking but was still a twin. The rooms have minimal amenities (i.e. A TV, a closet, a safe, some toiletries) and there was mould in the bathroom, ingrained dirt in the tiny bath, and loose light fittings in the bedroom (see photos). We paid an awful lot of money to stay at this hotel (over \u00c2\u00a3300 per night) and, whilst I am aware a good proportion of that money was because it was New York and it was Christmastime, I still think that the price was extortionate for what amounted to a room which wouldn't look out of place in a cheap B&B (and there are a lot of hotels available in New York for the same price which would have been far better value for money). On the plus side, most of the staff were reasonably friendly and knowledgeable, the location is fairly good for shopping etc, and there is a shuttle bus which goes from a stop just outside Grand Central to JFK airport every 20 minutes. I think the Hyatt is in real need of a makeover and it would be nice if they spent as much attention on their rooms as they do on their lobby - having said that, the hotel was very busy so I guess they don't really feel like they need to make the effort.

The room was big, nicely appointed, and had a large walk in closet. As some have reported, the bathroom was a little small, but that was not a problem. One night the sink drain would not open up and we called housekeeping and someone came up immediately to fix it. I also asked for another bath towel and when we returned that night, we found additional towels on the bed. The lobby is beautiful, the elevators are fast, and the location can't be beat. This is our first time being so close to Grand Central and that was really nice as we could use the shuttle to Times Square and/or walk.

I'm happy to report that contacting him was not necessary. Our Deluxe King room (we had booked a regular guest room) was more than adequate -- lots of square footage for our luggage (and purchases!), and a huge walk-in closet with tons of hangers, and even an ironing board and iron! The bathroom was typical of an older hotel -- not the endless expanse of marble and granite that you may find in newer hotels, but certainly adequate -- and much larger than a cruise-ship bathroom, as one unhappy reviewer stated! I can only imagine that people who pay full price for this hotel may be disappointed. But with all the avenues available for finding a reduced rate, there's really no reason to pay full price. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays, we were warmly greeted at check-in (no lines!), and check-out via voice mail (just one of several options) couldn't have been simpler. Best of all, the location is absolutely unbeatable. Having its own underground entrance to Grand Central Terminal makes this hotel ideal for any traveler who intends to use the subway.

Once the weather cleared, we walked several times to Times Square, the Empire State Building, and even the Upper East Side.

As like a lot of reviewers I began to wonder if this place would be a mistake, but was very relieved to find it to be a great place to stay. The lobby is magnificent with a beautiful granite waterfall greeting you upon entering the hotel. Very upscale and perfectly decorated. Check-in was a breeze, even with our Trainee Desk Clerk, who was very polite and efficient. We stayed in a Lexington Suite which we booked directly on the hotel's website for $329 per night under the Senior Citizen Discount rate. Our room was 2550 and I would highly recommend requesting this room, or similar number, if you love a quiet room. This is it! During our four night stay we only hear noise two nights and those were sirens one evening and some type of beeping noise from a truck backing up on the street below. Other than that the windows did an excellent job soundproofing the room. We didn't hear street noise but as soon as the windows were openend you could really appreciate how quiet the room was with them shut. I really was amazed and had expected to be kept awake with street noise. Pleasant surprise! Lexington Suite has two seperate rooms. One sitting room which was on the small side, but held a loveseat sofa, table, desk with nice ergonomic desk chair, dresser, and flat screen TV. The closet was in this room as well. A small hall lead to the bedroom which was located far away enough from the room entrance that we heard absolutely no noise from the hall which was another plus. The bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable King size bed, two granite nightstands, a chair with ottoman, another dresser with a flat screen TV. The suite decor was very stylish and up-to-date. Carpet looked new as did the bedding and furniture. My only small complaint was the lighting as there really was no good reading light in the evening from the lamps in the room, other than lying in the bed. However, we came in late enough each evening that all we did was crawl into bed. As stated hundreds of times the bathroom is small. Smaller than any bathroom I've had on a cruise ship, and that's telling you something if you know what that's like. The shower was decent sized and tiled with trendy granite slabs. The sink was also granite. There is basically no room on the vanity, however, but there are wall mounted shelves to use. I just took all the toiletries off the wall shelves and then used the shelves for our toiletries instead which worked fine. Housekeeping could use a bit more training as the toilet wasn't cleaned two different days and I don't think the floor was ever mopped while we were there. One day the maid took all the supplied toiletries from the room and didn't replace them. If anything the bathrooms should always be cleaned completely every day as that tends to disgust me if not done. Otherwise the room itself was clean and comfortable. And like other reviewers I will say that the location is superb. Room service prices will make you laugh, if not from shock at the prices. Basic breakfast items priced well over $20. There are all kinds of small cafe type and deli type places to grab something to eat at a fraction of the cost. We found an excellent place called the Grand Cafe in a tunnel between 45th and 46th, between Vanderbilt and Lexington. Excellent made to order omelettes and other items, all priced under $4. You can't beat it and the food is terrific! Great coffee, too. Doormen were a big help getting cabs especially during rush hour. Just flash a couple of bucks and they'll work hard for you to get you on your way. Big tip - if you're going to a show reserve a restaurant near the venue. Trying to get a cab between 7 and 8 p.m. is impossible as everyone is heading to the theater. We found out the hard way our first night and almost missed our show. Eat by the venue and then you don't have to worry about cabbing it. Just walk! Bottom line is book on the hotel's website, use the Senior Discount if you can and spend a little extra for a Lexington Suite, prepare for the tiniest bathroom you could imagine and then you won't be disappointed.

We had two double beds which was fine for a family of four. The room was very clean and the bathroom was small yet functional - nice toileteries!!

We visited the ES firtst thing on our first morning - we arrived at 7.45 as it opened at 8 and were at the start of the queue. It was excellent!! Our first two days were taken up doing the uptown and downtown bus loops (red sightseeing buses) which I would highly recommend. We went to the theatre and saw Tarzan with tickets booked through the hotel theatre ticket booth. Breakfast in the hotel was expensive so we opted for the cafe Metro over the road (next door to Mc Donalds) which was excellent.

The hotel is expensive however, paying over $250 a night for what is an appalling hotel. I wouldn't want to stay in a regular Hyatt if their upscale property, Grand Hyatt, is anything to go by. The room, whilst relatively large, was poorly designed and did not use space efficiently, which resulted in an absolutely tiny bathroom. As some other reviewers have stated, you could barely move in there. Although there were two windows, due to the room looking over a courtyard/alley, there was very little natural light in the room, and the old, dull decor further assisted in making the room very dingy. The staff didn't respond to our numerous requests for maintenance assistance either. It is also a very loud hotel. We were woken up numerous times on several nights at 2/3am when groups of people returned to their rooms shouting loudly in the hall ways. But the creme de la creme has to be the $2 per bag charge when leaving your baggage with the (rude) concierge after checkout for a few hours - having just spent $1500 on your room bill, this is disgusting.

We came in from La Guardia after a flight from Denver,CO and grabbed a $21.00 round trip bus ride on a New York Airport Service (NYAS) bus which dropped us off across the street from the hotel. Note: you buy this ticket from a uniformed person standng by the sign advertising this service at the airport. After your direct ride, you walk through Grand Central Station and out the other side for the short walk to the hotel front entrance. We had a 24th floor room with 2 windows but no view except the alley and other tall buildings but it was so quiet and our bed was so comfy. We programmed the safe and left the other half of our airport ticket s in the safe. We used the express elevator to go back downstairs where we asked the Concierge (she used a Zagat guide) to help us find a \"bistro\" type restaurant for lunch on a Metro (subway) line. We walked out the front door and headed just a short walk back to Grand Central Station where we bought 7 day passes ($24.00) called the Metro Card. We were all over the city all week and when we stayed out a little too late to catch the Shuttle subway betwen Times Square and Grand Central (service ends at midnight for this line) a cab was easy to find and cheap ($5.00). A cab to the theater district was also only $10.00, we saw \"Wicked\" at the Gerschwin. Our only disappointment with the hotel was the Concierge service. The staff member was not at all friendly but merely perfunctionary . Play tickets and tours were handled by a separate company in the lobby. They only staffed one person and no-one while that person went to lunch. We did buy play tickets here and were glad that the tickets were capped at $199 as they were going for $250 on Ticketmaster. The red openair tour busses also pick passengers up across the street from the hotel. $50.00 bought a 48 hour pass on these busses. The tours are uptown, downtown, Brooklyn daytime and a nighttime downtown and Brooklyn loop. The daytime is hop on, hop off. Be advised to ride the tour and then do some hopping on and off or your may miss the sights as the day time touring was over at 5pm. As an additional note: we saw police and transit police all over the city and felt secure on our weeklong visit.

I read all the reviews on this site before making this my destination for a recent trip. The room was much bigger than I expected it to be (28th floor--king non-smoking). In addition to the bed and two nightstands inthe room, there was a desk with chair, an additional fabric covered chair and ottoman, a television atop a wooden bureau containing drawers, shelves, and a safe. The closet was long and narrow and the bathroom contained a tubwith shower, a single sink and wall shelving to hold makeup, lotions, etc. There was also a wall-mounted hair dryer in the bathroom. There were three or four elevators serving the floor and I rarely had to wait to go up or down. There was a single window in the room and it opened and had some sort of shading so that you could not see into the room from the other rooms making it possible to keep the shades up and the window open but still maintain privacy. The window ledge held an ice bucket and a large red vase. There were two phones--one by the bed and another on the desk--and a clock-radio CD player. The decor was khaki and white with black--very smoothing and certainly pleasant. I had room service on several occasions and found it very overly priced even for New York standards--$23 for pancakes that I could buy for less than $4 at the Grand Central Station food court. The room service menu lists a three-egg omelette for $23 and I ordered it for breakfast one day. I knew when I signed the bill that the total was much higher than I expected and I assumed I had mis-read the menu and there was a per charge fee for ingredients. I decided to check the menu and saw that there was no such fee so I decided to eat and then call to complain. That was when i realized they had sent up three omelettes and charged me for three!!! I called room service and told them that when i read \"three egg omelette\" off of the menu I was placing an order for a single omelette with three eggs not THREE OMELETTEs. They removed the charge and were very gracious about it. Another time they left the toast off of my order but they quicky sent it up when I complained. All in all while the price was very high, the food was good and it was worth the splurge on those days when i wanted to get ready to go out and yet do so in a leisurely fashion. I ordered a B and B one night and the person did not know what that was and asked me if I wanted a bread and butter plate. The girl who delivered the drink later told me that the guy who took my call did not drink and had never heard of a B and B, but that even the bartender said he had only had requests for two or three ever-- I did not expect the request to merit such discussion! When I returned each day the housekeeping staff did a great job of cleaning the room. In other visits when I have used the blanket kept in the closet or shelf of most hotel rooms the staff has returned it to the closet or shelf each evening requiring that I pull it out and re-do the bed, but at this hotel they made up the bed each day with the blanket--something I greatly appreciated and I had also removed the heavier bed covering which they left off of the bed as well. I appreciated this attention to detail. The hotel was quiet except for the last night when a large group of college students stayed on the floor and were up and down the halls. I could hear them each time they talked as they walked by my door, but never heard any noises from the adjoining rooms and very little street noise when i closed the window. There are vending machines on every floor--two dollar sodas. The great thing about this hotel is that you can get to the subway without going outside so it is very convenient to getting where you need to go. There is a great market in Grand Central station with lots of pre-made food so if you want to take it easy and eat in the room you can find every sort of take-out food from the market that is ready to eat. Likewise, there are great choices in the food court of the station. I found that most of the places there would prepare food for take-out as well. The concierge was great about locating movies and tickets and providing advice on the fastest most economical way to maneuver the city. The bell staff is less helpful. When I needed a taxi to leave they were so busy talkig to each other that I ended up hailing thre cab myself. When i arrived at the hotel no one moved to assist me with my bags. I would have gladly paid a tip to have assistance especially since upon entering the lobby one must go up an escalator or stairs to reach the registration desk.

I signed up for the Gold Passport and emailed my preferences per the PL website directly to Hyatt. I was told that PL customers were assigned rooms with one double bed. However, I was also told that they would enter my request. The Hyatt customer service agent who emailed me was courteous and helpful. The day of check in we were flying all day from the west coast so I called in the morning on 1-800 CHECKIN, asked if possible to request two beds. I was given my room number and when we checked in, it took all of three minutes to get the keys and find that indeed our request had been honored. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. We asked a maintenance man to point out where the walkway to Grand Central was and he physically walked us over there so we knew exactly where it was. The room was perfect. Two double beds, the most comfortable either my daughter or I had ever slept on in a hotel (and we travel ALOT!), gorgeous view of the Chrysler Building, and clean. This is New York people - rooms are SMALLLLL!!!!!!!!!! Bathrooms too! If you travel much to NY, you know this. Upon checking out, we stored our bags with the bell desk with no problems whatsoever.

If I had to find a negative, it would be that there was a tiny bit of mold on the ceiling in the bathroom. That's it. Otherwise, the experience for us was wonderful.

But in the nooks, crannies and behind the easy chair lots of fluff, dust and half-chewed childrens candy! Couldn't have been vacuumed for ages. Bathroom was good and clean - washstand is kind of small, but the towels were nice and fluffy. Plenty of hot water. Housekeeping was OK, but with a different lady on duty on alternate days. One was physically so small she wasn't able to reach the bathroom shelf to put new face cloths, so on her duty days we didn't get any! Bed-making techniques varied between the ladies, one gave us sheets so tightly tucked in it hurt your toes, the other made it so loose that everything rolled off the bed within minutes of getting in! Good size TV in the room with plenty of channels and pay movies. The room has a window that we could actually open and there is easy access to the room climate controller. Disappointingly there was no coffee/tea making facility or an in-room fridge (mini-bar). Two telephones. Don't know about internet access. The lobby was busy all the time we were there - several conferences and meetings on going. We had breakfast once in the restaurant - comprehensive buffet style but expensive (about $30 each). We bought our breakfasts from the Dining Concourse at Grand Central and brought them back to the room. At checkout the bill is slid under the door the night before. Checkout can be done via the TV or in the lobby at the desk or by computer terminal. Very efficient. For a limo to the airport see the Taxi Captain at the front door (the guy with the biggest hat!) - he fixed a price of $60 + tunnel toll + tip to JFK. You'll have to allow about hour-and-half minimum, longer after 3:30pm, to get there. Entrance to the hotel is on E42nd St next to Grand Central Terminus and very close to the Chrysler Building.

However, the past few times I have stayed here, I've had problems. In March '05 booked a double room, only to find four of us in 1 room with one king size bed. Managemetn sent in cots that crowded the room and were uncomfortable, even for my young children. Upon arrival I valet parked my car (less 2000 miles on it) w/the hotel attendant. When it was returned to me, the back quarter panel was smashed ($1300 damage.) The parking attendants insisted I brought the car in that way. I sought the hotel manager who told me the hotel wasn't responsible, parking is handled by an independent company. The company insisted we did the damage. No one was interested in this problem. We had a paid reciept showing THE GRAND HYATT NY was paid for this service, not another company. My husband wouldn't lie down and eventually (2 months later) the hotel reimbursed us the $1300. I felt they (albeit after a lot of phone calls and pushing) did o.k. by us. Went again Aug 05 and had no problems. The last visit we had the same issue with the bedding. Four of us arrived and we were given a king room. I insisted at the front desk and was told there were no doubles to be had. I ended up paying for a second room so we could sleep comfortably. This hotel doesn't guarantee bed type. It turned out this past weekend that all the double rooms had been booked in Oct for some dance recital/workshop. Why they continued to take reservations for a double room is beyond my understanding, but they did. The cost was pushed onto me and my family. They did nothing to help defer it. In fact, they suggested if cost and a double room was an issue, that I stay in Jersey City. Give me a break and give me a real solution!!! My final conclusion, after multiple stays in this hotel, is that they're tightening their belt, taking in all the cash they can and they've implemented some shady practices. As far as the room itself goes,it could have been cleaner but it was fine. I'm sorry that I didn't take a picture of the cot so I could post it here.

We purchased a package online and got a pretty good rate for our flight and hotel. Our flight from LAX was a red-eye, so we got to the hotel a little after 7AM. The doorman greeted us, took our bags, and directed us towards the front desk. He informed us that check in was at 3PM, but we could always try and see if there was anything available. Luckily, there was a clean + vacant room ready for us. We took our bags to the elevators and went up to the 16th floor (the 6th floor, actually-- floor numbers 1-13 are skipped and there are 3 levels of convention rooms before the guestroom floors). Our request for a king bed was accomodated, but our request for a view was not. Not a biggie, though. We were just happy to have a room at 8AM so we could nap. The room itself was big enough for the two of us-- there was a desk (with phone), a TV center (below the TV was a armoire with drawers and a small safe), a chaise, a closet, full bath (vanity/sink area was a little small), 2 nightstands (each with a lamp, one with a phone), and of course, the bed. I found the bed to be quite comfy-- my boyfriend thought it was too hard. The computerized wake-up calls were always on time and reliable. New York Times newspaper delievery is on weekdays only, so we only got one paper during our stay. Housekeeping was sufficient-- our room never lacked any toilettries, towels, etc. The AC/Heating system worked fine. We never had any technical problems with the room. My boyfriend ate breakfast in the hotel once (at the Sky Bar). If I remember correctly, the breakfast was a buffet with 3 price ranges: $15 for pastries, milk, juice, etc. $18 for the stuff previoulsy mentioned plus a little extra (continental breakfast). $25 for omelet station, cereal, oatmeal? Not sure on the details. I wasn't in the mood to spend $15 for a croissant and muffin, so I headed down to Grand Central Terminal's food court and grabbed a quick bite to eat there. Odd thing about the Sky Bar-- with a name like that, one would think that it would be on a high hotel floor and... be a bar, correct? Nope, it closed everyday at 2PM and was on the 2nd floor. I was looking forward to having a place to get a few drinks with a nice view-- unfortunately, the Sky Bar was not the place. We did get a few drinks in at the bar for Commodore Grill, the hotel's full service restaurant. Drinks were a little steep ($11 for Baileys on the rocks, $11 for vodka tonic [Absolut], and $8 for a pint of Guinness), but nothing out of the ordinary for a hotel bar. Our bartender was nice and we talked baseball for a bit (He was a Yankees fan, we rubbed in how the Angels kicked their butts). The hotel operators need to cheer up a bit-- or at least pretend that they don't hate their jobs when they take a call. No one would help us print out boarding passes for our flight (Concierge + the Business Center were closed, but alternatives were not given to us at all), the Mailroom wanted to charge me $0.49 to mail out ONE postcard... domestically! They claimed that there was a \"seasonal\" rate of $0.44/postcard... plus, since they had to \"run it through their machine\" a $0.05/postcard fee would be charged as well. I just walked to a nearby store, bought some stamps, applied them to my cards, and dropped them into a mailbox. The morning of check-out, we had a $353 charge for room service... something that we didn't order. Upon further investigation, the Front Desk adjusted off the fee. My boyfriend was charged $1/half-minute for internet services in the Business Center, but at least we got our boarding passes taken care of before we got to the airport. Overall, the hotel was OK.

We were going to New York with our 'not-so-young' children.... We looked at hundreds of hotels in NY and picked out four possibly suitable venues. Reading through the reviews with Trip Advisor we were impressed with what we read about the Grand Hyatt. I made contact with one of the Managers before our arrival and requested a high floor and large adjoining rooms. We were not disappointed... we were placed on the 28th floor and our rooms were really very spacious.[From what I read this is unusual for NY] We found the staff helpful, the lobby was beautifully dressed for the occasion and our Christmas dinner was as traditional as you wanted. It is perfectly situated with access to Central Station within the building, offering shopping and a wide variety of restaurants. 5th Ave and so much more is just a short stroll away. There were only two negative points; 1. We had requested two beds and a roll-out in the childrens room... there was a king bed there on arrival but they did provide a roll-out for our daughter on request and the king bed was big enough to accommodate the two boys. [The room was so large there was no problem adding the extra bed] 2. The Sky Bar, which they advertise in a big way was not open during our stay. We feel that these were minor problems and did not stop our enjoyment of our 'Christmas with a difference'. We had a wonderful holiday and would certainly return to the Grand Hyatt and all it has to offer.

Trains, Subway, Taxis, Airport shuttle, busses all terminate at the station. It's central geographic location in Midtown is perfect for Times Square, Empire State, Maceys, And the newly opened Top of the Rock at the Rockerfeller Centre. (Much better than the Empire State) Reception was excellent, however, despite the xmas decorations, the lobby looks dull and uninviting. Concierge was excellent and directed us to a superb pizza place. Bell hops were a bit up themselves and almost grabbed your bags and held them to ransome for a tip! I'm English and I did not like that! Stuff was going off over new year and one of the bars seemed to be closed for private partys for our entire stay. I thought that this was a bit off for a 5 star hotel and would have liked to have a drink overlooking 42nd street just once during my 4 day stay. A wedding on closed the bar again on new years eve, even though it seemed to be empty for the whole evening. we failed to get into Times Square and resorted to the back bar for a few drinks and had to suffer the lack of seats, dark environment and very high prices. OK for one drink but not good for 5 hours! Room was smallish, but excellent. We stayed on the 25th floor and it was very quiet. Nice bath/shower combo and marble tiles. HVAC was a pain, we had to set it at 40 degrees or it cooked you. We even had to open a window one night. Massive TV, good phone system, NY Times every morning. Everything was spotless, except the lobby toilets that really needed a clean, especially after new year. Did not eat in the hotel as the prices are steep! We reccommend the station next door for a cheap excellent breakfast, or the Pershing cafe accross the road for somthing a bit special in the breakfast department.

Very convenient to subway at Grand Central Station. Good selection of restaurants within easy walking distance including those in the terminal itself. Room: Very good. Spacious by NYC standards, clean, and comfortable. Wireless T-Mobile internet was a big plus for me. The bath was a reasonable size although counterspace was limited. We were on the 29th floor and there was no real view out the functional windows. Heat/Air worked fine - no complaints. Common areas/lobby: The lobby is large and attractive with waterfall and various seating areas. There are two bars, one of which was closed during most if not all of our trip. There is also a restaurant. We enjoyed our one meal there and frequented the bar on most evenings as well. They offer a good selection of draft beers but be prepared for NYC pricing here - $7 to $8 per beer. Service: No issues. We were checked in and out without difficulty or delay even considering that were we there during the week before Christmas and during the transit strike. Management offered daily updates on the strike with our complimentary copy of the NY Times. Overall: For the amount we were able to book this trip (major internet travel website), the hotel was an outstanding bargain. I have paid almost three times the amount and was less satisfied.

I do recommend getting that Passport before your stay. The deluxe king was very spacious and had a spacious bathroom. The rooms are well appointed with two windows. The TV is a flat screen with several channels to select. I was there during the Transit Strike and did appreciate their update memos they sent keeping us informed of the strike.

The room allocation also brought certain upgraded benefits which helped to make our trip very enjoyable. We ate ocassionally in the Hotel mainly light meals which were fine. On the occassions that we went to the bar it was difficult to get served and the staff here were a little indifferent. It appeared to be frequented by business types who hugged the bar making access for others very difficult.

To begin with, we had booked a package which included breakfast, and had requested a high non-smoking room with a view. Everything was fine so far.. we were given a room on the 21st floor (which I thought was high enough), but noticed the trip on the lift was rather short. It was then I realised the hotel had the Lobby, Conference Room, 16th floor, 17th... 21st. In the end.. we were no higher than the 10th floor. As we walked into the room, we found out the room stinked out to the scent of cigarettes, and that our view was.. well.. there was NO view. If we opened the curtains, we would see another guest. The concierge (Mr. Jason) was useless. We were about to leave the hotel. Next morning, we went to have our breakfast. Unfortunatelly, we found out the hotel had 80 seats for about 500 people trying to get breakfast (which was just OK). After waiting for about 35 minutes and answered what room we were staying at, we got a table, and enjoyed the breakfast. But as we were about to leave, we got haulted by hotel security for trying to leave without paying. As I tried to explain the maitre'd we had breakfast included, he kept yelling at me in front of almost 150 people... so it became a yelling contest. I won :) and got him call the front desk, and his apologies, which I rejected. I was asked to get the beakfast vouchers (2005, and they cannot use computers). At night, as we returned to the hotel, my finace'e went to the front desk to get the vouchers to avoid a scene the next day, as I got to our room. It was not after 15 minutes when she arrived at our room crying, as she was accused of \"taking advantage of the Hotel and claiming for more vouchers than you are (we were) supposed to have\", out loud (looks like hotel's policy to yell). This was the 2nd. time in 14 hours the hotel had accused us of thieves. I got dressed, got to the front desk, and asked for the manager. Guess what? THAT was the manager. I asked him to provide me with the name of the person who he alleged had given us the vouchers, and to show me the voucher numbers, my signature receiving them or any document. As he was making SUCH SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS, I would have guessed he would have had AT LEAST one proof. To your surprise, he did not. After about ten minutes, he said he would \"make an exception\" and give us the vouchers, to which I replied there was no exception to be made as this was the first time the vouchers were being handled to us; he would just be doing his job. In the end, we stayed at a lousy room, with no view, the service (or lack of it) of a $10 hotel, a totaly incompetent staff, and a flash light that came from the fire alarm that blinked every 4 hours (strong enough to wake you up). Two great things were the bed, and the location... but I'd much rather stay in many other hotels for the same price than returning here... no wonder they are ranked 167 in tripadvisor... PS: on our return, I wrote an email to the Hyatt Customer Affairs and Hyatt Quality, which was replied by the hotel's Assistant Rooms Executive who stated: \"we believe that there was no disrespect intended by any of our employees\".

After reading the reviews on here I was a little worried about my stay, but my fears were alleviated quickly. I was very satisfied with my entire stay at the Hyatt. First off, the location is second to none. You are adjacent to the Grand Central Terminal. So what, you say? Well, the 4, 5, 6, 7, and S subway lines are about a 5 minute walk from the hotel lobby through completely indoor corridors, bypassing a couple of coffee shops, bakeries, and newstands on the way for added convenience. Very nice to have, especially in the morning, and especially when its raining outside. From the hotel lobby, you can be in Times Square in 10 minutes, and in lower Manhattan in about 20 minutes. If you'd rather take a cab, there was always an employee ready to hail a cab for you right in front. I never waited more than 5 minutes for one. Another positive - the rooms had been recently renovated as the Hyatt website mentions. My room had a king size bed, large TV, trendy furnishings, and plenty of space considering it was a Manhattan hotel room. Unlike other reviewers have mentioned, housekeeping did a great job on my room - left it in great shape every afternoon when I returned from sight-seeing. Even though I booked the room through Priceline, I felt like I was treated like a Hyatt club member through my entire stay, right down to getting a copy of the New York Times every morning. The only negative I can think of is the lobby was always mobbed with people. This is a HUGE hotel and there were lots of conventions going on the weekend I was staying. However, on my floor (17th), it was very quiet and I never encountered a noise problem from the street, from the lobby, or from other patrons. Another negative is the hotel charges for internet use: 50 cents a minute. I guess I didn't get the most \"one-on-one\" service I've ever gotten in a hotel but in all honesty I never needed it because my stay was so great. This hotel deserves to be ranked MUCH higher than the #165 rating it has commanded on Tripadvisor. Top 100 for sure - possibly even the Top 50 when you consider some of the other hotels that are ranked there. Granted, I wouldn't pay Hyatt's normal room rate of $400/night to stay here. But $210/night rate through Priceline was a very reasonable for a stay in this type of hotel in NYC in peak season. I've read that off-season bids on Priceline for 4-star hotel can get you at the Grand Hyatt for even less than that.

Direct access to Grand Central Terminal puts the subway and trains just a few minutes away. This is important because catching a taxi on 42nd street is difficult because the street is gridlocked all hours of the day. We sat in our taxi on the way to the hotel for 15 minutes while just 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel. Go up the escalator from the lobby to the Lexington Street exit where the taxis are plentiful and actually move. We had a nice large corner room that was clean, quiet, and comfortable for the most part. We had a walk-in closet with enough hangars for both my wife and I to hang a week's worth of clothing. The lighting was not the best so I had to sit by the window to get sufficient light to read. The TV was fixed on a dresser--it did not swivel--so we couldn't watch TV from the bed, only from the one chair, plus a hard desk chair. The small bathroom lacked the usual amenities that a Hyatt typically offers and each day the housekeepers forgot to replenish at least one item: one day all three hand towels were missing, the next no new soap, no wash clothes, etc. All of these are small irritants but they do make you wonder about the place. Two other annoyances that bothered us: (1) There is a nice coffee kiosk in the lobby for those who want a quick cup and a pastry. We found out when talking with others that guests were given coupons when checking in for a free cup of coffee. We did not get any and marched down to the frontdesk to ask why. No reason was given, just a shrug of the shoulders, but two coupons were offered. (2) After a long day, we wanted to go to the lobby lounge and have a drink but found it closed for a private reception. This happened four out of the six nights we were at the hotel. We did go to their other lounge--at the Commodore Grill--which was fine, but our best find was the outdoor lounge of Michaels Jordan's restaurant at Grand Central Terminal which has half-price drinks for several hours. The food is pretty good too. The staff at the Hyatt are nice, but clearly harrassed.

Once fixed, housekeeping never cleaned the bathroom floor. Ran out of hot water on Saturday morning and had a lukewarm shower. My friend needed a pair of trousers cleaned.

There is direct internal access from the hotel right into Grand Central Station, to catch a train or to take the subway. We loved it!! The lobby is very nice, all marble and waterfalls. A standard room is somewhat small. No coffee maker in the room; however you are given free tokens for coffee or tea at a beverage stand in the lobby, which serves Starbucks. We didn't really use many of the hotel's amenities as we were always on the go.

We called down to the front desk and they said it was some valve. They offered no solutions (trust me after walking around NYC for a day - a shower is a necessity). They would not transfer us to another room, even though other floors had hot water. Finally, they said that we could come downstairs (22 stories), pick up a key to shower in another room and then return the key afterwards. Furthermore, then next morning, they wanted us to do the same procedure; rather than switching rooms or keeping the extra key. When we checked out that day at around noon - they offered us breakfast coupons at the hotel restaurant, even though breakfast was over and we were checking out. Finally, they gave us a $125 credit.

The room was very clean with one very large king-bed, a flatscreen TV, a desk and a big closet. Only the bathroom is a bit small and and I`m not sure, if the shower was also fully renovated. The bed was very convenient with a double-mattress and we slept very well after walking all day long through the streets of Manhattan. As some reviewer mentioned the fire alarm on 25.09. at 3.15 am: Yes there was an alarm and it wasn`t very nice to be woken up at that time. But in my opinion it`s better to once have an alarm where there`s no fire as no alarm when there`s one. Safety is extremly important, especially in such a large building. The direction of the hotel sent a letter of apology in the morning in every room. I would highly recommend the hotel. The rooms are very nice (the largest in our whole vacation) in some asian-style, the staff was very friendly and with the gold membership we could get a free coffee and newspaper each morning.

The mattress was lumpy and the sheets were hospital quality.They are renovating, and that should help, but for now, I will look for something else in the neighborhood.", "Date": "March 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as I expected!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1714705", "Content": "We got this room for a bid of $75 on Priceline for August 2. It was our anniversary weekend. While the hotel lobby was beautiful, after going down the hallways and into the rooms I sort of can understand everyone's complaints with this hotel. HOWEVER, I think that this place is fine to stay at, I just don't think it is worth the 4* rating. The halls were dingy, definitely needed some paint and re-hab. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room....nice size by NYC standards. The hotel was clean and staff was very pleasant. Location was great. I don't think that I would choose to stay here and pay the going rate, HOWEVER if I got this hotel again for a bid of $75.....I would absolutely be happy!!!", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wash Xing, PA", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at the Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1714474", "Content": "We stayed at the Hyatt last night, and what a dump. We requested a non-smoking room and received a smoking room, which reeked of smoke. When we asked the front desk to change our room they refused, saying that it was a non-smoking room, but they have ashtrays in case someone wants to smoke. That is the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard. The staff was rude and could care less about helping you.

We stayed between Dec 29 - Jan 2. I am used to wishy washy hotels and this one was very middle of the road. The room was okay. We upgraded to a king sized room and it was not much bigger than a large walk in closet. The rooms were clean but it looked well worn. The corners of the room were a dust mites' playground. The bathroom is EXTREMELY small. This is a small thing but it always annoys me if a shower does not have a shelf or somewhere to store your shampoo or shower gel, needless to say my shower gel remained on the floor. The staff was friendly, which made the experience a lot better. FOOD: Room service is outrageous. A bowl of cereal for $8!!!! I think the hotel has a deal with the local restaurants and they kept recommending a bar down the street, which was okay but you will have better luck finding food on your own. (Try the diner on 47th and Lexington...excellent breakfast all day. Also, RAFFLES on Lexington is good too!) It was not bad but it was not good either. I would try a different hotel the next time I am in New York.", "Date": "February 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "yate", "Title": "\u201c4 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "chrissy077", "ReviewID": "UR1624915", "Content": "I found the grand hyatt to be a very good hotel, the staff were all friendly and helpful should you need anything, the rooms a little basic but due to have a refit about now, but the lobby is gorgeous with eating breakfast with the waterfall by the saide of you was excellent. We went between christmas and new year and although one of the bars were closed due to quietness i presume there was more than enough places to eat and drink. Only thing i would mention about food is it was a bit pricey, i recommend unless you havent eaten all day try the kids menu cheaper and plenty of food.

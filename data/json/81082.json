These places do a good job at providing decent places to stay with minimal amenities. This one also offers a great location for San Francisco touring. Located at the West end of the Fisherman's Wharf area, it is close to a lot of great sites and sights. It is a part of Anchorage Square, a mostly empty shopping area that I hope is just under renovation. We had a room with a \"courtyard\" view, and it looked down the interior of Anchorage Square that was being fixed up and had people milling about. The noise level was OK - tended to quiet down by about 11 p.m. I asked for a room that was above the street, and was on the 3rd floor - out of 4 - so it was OK. Parking was an extravagant $41 a night with tax. I did use it since having the valet get it was helpful. Lots of places to walk to and great places to eat very near by. One in particular was the Beach Street Grill. We ate there for breakfast a couple of times and it was very good. Overall, it was a fine stay - nothing too special, but the location more than makes up for the fact that it's fairly basic.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evergreen, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat family spot- close to pier\u201d", "Author": "Uphill_from_Denver", "ReviewID": "UR127246976", "Content": "Big rooms, real queen sized beds.

The location was fantastic for it is close not only to Fisherman's Wharf, it was also close to a trolley station and cable car station where you have access to much of the city (check your map -- the trolley and the cable car takes you to two different parts of the city). There are also two car rental places pretty much on the premise (next door to the hotel). We rented at the Avis (the pother one is Hertz) and not only was the price reasonable ($34.00 a day), we were able to return it to the parking lot without any cost (parking can be up to $36.00 a day). There are also various tour companies nearby that can take you anywhere you want -- the concierge at the desk is helpful for these things, Although the hotel Bistro only serves breakfast (it's not bad, but it could be better),there are many places to eat within the hotel area. Breakfast was probably the best at the Denny's a block away located in the Holiday Inn. But as far as restaurants, there are plenty more nearby and it's also two blocks away from Ghirardelli where you can get chocolates and ice cream (as well as food).There are many shops nearby, including a Walgreens just a block away for basic needs (you can also buy souvineers there for a much cheaper price -- this advise was given by a front desk staff).

But i definitely could have done without hearing the screaming kids. The other bad part of this hotel was the shower. The water temperature was no where close to stable.

Only drawback to the location of the Courtyard, was the selection of restaurants that were close by. Most fell into the tourist trap category and did not get favorable reviews on the various foodie sites. Thus prices are high and food quality just so so.

I felt very safe in this neighborhood and didn't worry about walking around at night, or letting my boys have a little freedom looking at the shops. Plus, there is an \"In and Out Burger\" in the same complex which made for happy teenagers! There are really nice, free computers to use in the lobby so my boys could stay connected on Facebook easily. There is a cool \"touchboard\" , kind of like a huge ipad, in the lobby which was very fun to use. The staff was friendly and professional and the concierges very helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast place provided good, healthy food for a reasonable price which helped us make the early morning tours. The rooms are generic Courtyard rooms but I felt they were a little bigger than most which we appreciated with 4 of us in the room. The rooms were clean and the amenities just what we needed. I could not have asked for anything more. The public transporatation system for SF is excellent: easy to use, clean, timely and safe. We bought the $20 3 day Muni pass which allows for unlimited use of the electric busses and cable cars. It worked out to be a great deal, not just for the $, but just knowing we could hop on a bus along the wharf to get back to our hotel easily. We took the Extranomical City Tour with Alcatraz and the Muir Woods/Sausalito Tour. Both were great and well worth our time. I liked Extranomical because they picked us up at our hotel right on time, we travelled in small but roomy vans with 10 people total and the tour guides were very responsive to any requests we had. Just a word of warning-if you travel in August and want to go to Alcatraz (and who doesn't?) get your tour tickets AT LEAST 10 days in advance. There are limited visitors allowed on the island and many people were very disappointed to see the tour sold out for 10 days solid. I liked both tours and thought they provided that \"taste of\" the city/Muir Woods/Sausalito that we were looking for. Both of my teenagers thought they were just the right length of time to hold their attention but not be boring. My husband and son took in a Giants game at AT&T park and thought it was wonderful. It's a bit of walk even using the \"F\" line but the weather was cool and the excitement was high so they didn't mind at all. Vacationing with teenagers can be tricky, but this trip to SF was just perfect. We were busy and enjoyed experiencing a city together. We stayed 3 1/2 days and felt that was just right. I would have enjoyed a little more shopping but with 3 men, it was probably better to leave than listen to them whine about going into yet another shop. :)", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malden, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLocation location location!\u201d", "Author": "slowfatrunner", "ReviewID": "UR74643109", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel July 23rd-28th, was in town to run the San Francisco half marathon.

We pre-paid 3 rooms (2 rooms with 2 queens and 1 w/king) and received a reasonable rate in doing so. They were very accommodating and kept the rooms close together and even gave us connecting rooms for the queen rooms. Check-in was fast and we were in our rooms within minutes. The rooms were spacious and clean with nice amenities, including a fridge to hold a few cans of cold beer and bottles of water. The beds are very comfortable and they supplied plenty of pillows which is something my husband and I like because we are pillow hogs. The hotel is also very quiet and we did not hear any noise from outside or the hallways. The hotel is centrally located to the wharf and if you exit out the back, you'll be on the main street that takes you to the eateries and down to Pier 39. But you don't need to go far to find a quick bit to eat. In the courtyard you'll find Hooters and In and Out Burger. Across the street is pizza and in the side alley Subway. Just up the street is a Joanie's which is a great place for breakfast with killer pancakes! My husband's favorite, a beer store right beside the hotel so he never had to go far to restock:) A great spot to try for dinner is out the back doors and up the street to the left a couple blocks to Cioppino's which is an outstanding place to eat. (Check out my restaurant review on Cioppino's for more details). There is parking available for $34/day with in/out privileges which really isn't bad compared to other cities we've stayed in.

We chose the Courtyard because the rates were reasonable ($119) and they allowed up to 4 people in the room. Many other hotels in SF restrict it to 2 people and/or make you pay extra, so that is a benefit. The hotel itself is located in a very convenient location in the Fishermans Wharf area on Beach Street, just a street up from the main street, Jefferson, where all the action is. It's a basic hotel room, but clean and well appointed. The staff could not have been more friendly and nicer. You really can't go wrong. As far as getting there, we realized there isn't an easy way to reach Fishermans Wharf from either airport (Oakland or SFO), unless you don't mind dragging your luggage from BART to streetcar (and streetcars don't always run on schedule as we unfortunately learned on a rainy, cold day). We elected to take a taxi from SFO ($45), which with 4 people really made sense anyway, as it would have cost us nearly the same to buy BART and streetcar fares. The hotel breakfast option was probably the only aspect that wasn't great. Maybe it was just circumstance, but when we went down for breakfast one morning, there was a long line and the staff had difficulty keeping up with the orders. You order at the counter and some of the food was given immediately and some was delivered to the table about 10 minutes later...we enjoyed breakfast at two eateries which are located diagonally across the street on Columbus Street, Pergamino Coffee & Tea (really cute and quaint place with HUGE pancakes) and Happy Days Diner (good standard fare). The Boudin Bakery is also a nice option for lunch or light dinner. It's affordable and during the day you can watch them make bread which they shape into crabs and other sealife. Most restaurants in Fishermans Wharf are terribly overpriced and the menus all seem similar. Try McCormick and Kuletos happy hour that starts at 3pm, it's really reasonable. A wonderful find for dinner was Bocce Cafe in the Italian district at 478 Green Street. It's a brisk 15 minute walk from the hotel up Columbus Street, and well worth it. The food is good and reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great, with live music. Excellent. We will definitely go back. If you get tired of walking and taking public transportation, another nice option is that Avis and Hertz are located in the same block of the hotel. We went online and rented a car for the day and drove to areas we couldn't access easily like the Golden Gate Park, as well as driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and into Marin County.

I don't think the problem was the room or the building, the bath faucet and sink had great pressure. I know low-flow showerheads are supposed to save water, but that is negated when you have to spend twice as long in the shower. The showerhead was one of those detachable deals - you could really see the lack of pressure when it was pointed straight up - there was not even enough pressure for water to spray upwards.

Walk a few blocks toward the GG Bridge to a small beach and leave the Wharf craziness behind.

My original reservation was for 2 nights but I found myself needing to check in a night early, unexpectedly. The front desk manager was VERY helpful with this. I called in the afternoon on the date I needed to check in and although the hotel was close to being sold out he not only let me check in one night early, but he honored the low rate which I had for the rest of my reservation. This was awesome service!! The front desk agent at check-in was very courteous. There was one problem, though. I had lost my credit card so I not only had to pay for my room but leave a cash deposit. My deposit was not returned to me upon check-out but I had to wait to get it by mail. This was very dissapointing, as I know it is not the policy followed by the majority of hotels. Now, back to my stay... My room was decorated in a very modern, tasteful manner. Lately, I have noticed that a lot of Courtyard brand hotels are being redecorated in a manner that gives them a very modern feel which makes you feel as if you are staying in something better than your run of the mill budget brand. High Speed Internet (wired) was free which was awesome!! (I had to call the front desk in order to find out that it was free as their is no signage in the room specifying this.) There is a dining area where breakfast is served but I never had any. Parking is about $30.00 in an adjacent lot which isn't bad as I've paid as much as $60.00 per night for parking in other areas of San Francisco. The hotel is located in a pretty good location. The rear of the hotel leads out to the street directly across from Fisherman's Wharf. I've stayed in most San Francisco neighborhoods, at some point or another, and I really think that it doesn't really matter where you stay, as to me, San Francisco is way smaller than it actually looks. The rear of the hotel leads out to a shopping area that includes a Hooters, In and Out Burger,and just around the corner is a Wallgreens (to pick up any toiletry you might have forgotten.)

Since my last stay there have been a few improvements. The bath products are now \"Davies Gate\" brand, and are quite nice. There were 5 pillows on the bed to choose from. And the courtyard seems a bit more alive, but there are still some empty \"for lease\" storefronts. Front desk staff seems genuinely friendly and personable, not just \"put on.\" This time I stayed two nights, and I did notice the early morning dumpster noise coming from Beach Street (in front of the hotel), although it didn't bother me too much--I had the heater on, so the fan sound acted as a buffer. Double pane windows would greatly help with the noise issue. The windows are in need of replacement anyway, they are the one thing showing age in the room. Otherwise the room was clean, simple, tasteful, and in very good condition. Maid service did a great job of refreshing the room for my second night. I came by ferry and without a car this time, and it was easy to catch busses to everywhere I needed to go. I recommend walking over to see the fishing boats on the pier near Scoma's restaurant--it's a quiet escape, and a different world in comparison to the noisy din of the tourist area. I hope this hotel continues to improve.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hinsdale, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and great room\u201d", "Author": "Mimiannb", "ReviewID": "UR14394276", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights.

(2) This hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast cafe is a bit better than the average Courtyard Marriott cafe. Instead of putting out a scrambled-egg buffet to get hard and cold, a guy cooks you a fat, made-to-order omelet. PLUS they have the best little blueberry muffins I have ever tasted and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even like blueberries. They are made fresh every morning. One morning, when I showed up 10 min. after the cafe had closed, the omelet man (who had already put up his ingredients) insisted that he cook an omelet for me. And he did it with a smile! Bravo! CON: (1) The hotel is crammed into a high commercial area and there are no good views, but who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to stay in the room, right? (2) The concierge was WORTHLESS! When I asked about an open-air tour, he discouraged me and emphatically pushed an expensive 3.5 hour tour on an enclosed bus. I told him repeatedly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what I wanted, but he insisted that I did. I thought he must have a good friend who works with the tour company. I did some research on my own and found out he had given me some incorrect information and when I told him about it the next day, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even apologize. I noticed that some earlier reviews on this site said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not stop talking,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153annoying,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was so rude.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The concierge is supposed to be someone you have confidence in.

Based on previous reviews and the pictures I had seen I knew not to get my hopes up too much. I have to say the location COULD NOT be beat!!!! We were just a few blocks away in either direction from Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, the Cannery, and Ghiradelli Square (and a cable car stop). Just a few blocks up the road was the North Beach area of town though we didn't get to wander around this area as much as we would have liked. The check-in was quick and easy and we were given a room on the 2nd floor- which I believe was close to the breakfast area based on the morning noise and clanking dishes. One thing I was very pleased with was the cleanliness of the room and that housekeeping left us additional towels the next day. We had a very of the parking garage next door which wasn't a big deal since we weren't in the room very often. The bed was comfortable and the internet access was quick. The lobby had coffee available each morning which I really enjoyed for the convenience, though there is a Starbucks around the corner about a block up the road. If you plan on renting a car at any time Avis and Hertz are located next door in the parking garage which was extremely convenient as we took a day trip to Sonoma. The two things I didn't care much for with this hotel was that it was a fairly old hotel that could use some updating and the walls seem to be paper thin. I could hear everything at all times of the day from the neighbors next door to the clanking dishes in the restaurant and also the people and traffic outside.

We chose this hotel for its location and price. Pros: The room was clean and nicely furnished. The location is amazing - right on Fisherman's Wharf, with many conviences right nearby: Walgreen's, Starbucks, the trolleys, many restaurants. The concierge at the hotel is really nice and very helpful arranging a bus tour for us. The breafast great and the hostess was very pleasant. The bathrooms were clean and nice, with a large tub and nice toiletries. Cons: The views from many of the rooms will not be great. Our room's view was a blue parking garage about 10 feet away from the window. But, since we did not spend much time in the room, it was fine with us. Parking costs $22 a day, so if you are not going anywhere but San Fran, I recommend not renting a car since it costs so much to park. Hertz rent-a-car is right next door to the hotel in that blue garage, so if you change your mind you could alwyas get a car right there. Other recommendations: The motorized cable car tour offered by Gray Line Tours was fanstastic - I highly recommend it. Also, I recommend eating at Scoma's - great seafood. Skip the cable car at the west end of the wharf - you will wait in line forever and then be packed in it like a sardine - you can take the trolley that starts right in front of Walgreen's for way cheaper and it takes you to the same end point at the fancy cable car.

Thus we had to go down the street to the currently being remodeled Sheraton for 1 night. Room there was comped, but smelled of smoke. Anyway, the staff at the Courtyard understood our complaints. I had even called the hotel at 5 PM and told them of my anticipated late arrival. They knew I was coming with kids as I asked if there were any rollaways still available. On the second day of our stay they contacted me and said they did have our room available and there was a rollaway already in the room. They also provided buffet breakfast for the remainder of the 3 days. They stated that upper management overbooks the hotel in order to guarantee they will be full. This still does not make sense to me because if I don't show up, the room is still charged to my credit card. The hotel itself is reasonably clean. Rooms were standard Courtyard rooms.

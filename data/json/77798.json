For the price we paid it was a good deal. Beds were the standard and VERY comfortable. Hotel overall is an older hotel and it shows. We were \"upgraded\" to a corner room which had a great view. Unfortuantely it was right by the service elevator which we were told \"doesn't run after midnight\" So at 1 am it was still running. Hmmm. My big gripes relate to parking... NIGHTMARE would be a good term. For $28 you can park in a garage next to the hotel... it's really for the mall. The elevator system that serves that parking garage is by far one of the slowest I have ever seen. Plan to leave VERY early to allow time for the elevator (which also serves the Macy's department store?) When we checked out I had bell services take my luggage down and I drove over to get it... Valet was PACKED and just kept yelling at people \"don't stop\" with no real guidance on what they wanted you to do. Finally I pulled around the corner and went back to get my luggage... which was sitting unattended. I picked it up and loaded it myself. I didn't mind loading the luggage myself, but honestly ANYONE could have walked of with my stuff which included a computer bag. Not good IMHO!

I was traveling for work and needed a place that accepting the Government rate close to the location I would be working in Downtown Los Angeles. I knew when I booked this hotel was attached to the mall, I had no idea it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the mall. I was traveling solo and upon arriving to the hotel, there were three huge tour buses parked out front blocking the check in entrance. I was also aware that I would be parking in the mall parking structure after arrival as that is the parking lot the hotel uses. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bank on the fact I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to enter into the check-in entrance. I tried driving around the block and call the hotel to see what options I had since their entrance was blocked (mind you, downtown LA, you cannot park or pull over to the side of the road at any time as there are signs everywhere stating such. Not sure why three huge buses were the exception) the phone rang, with no exaggeration for at least three minutes before someone answers. Mind you I am driving, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull over anywhere, holding my phone and trying to maneuver through streets that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow right and/or left hand turns at certain times of the day, not to mention several one way streets. When someone finally answers the phone they ask immediately if I can please hold, of course my response was no I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I asked where I could go to check in since the entrance was still blocked. She told me to park in the parking garage next to the hotel and I could enter that way and it would be easy from the elevator. I do as suggested and pull into the parking garage, park near the elevators and think this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so bad the elevator will take me right there. When I get to the elevator with my luggage, purse and other items from my car, I realize there are no signs as to what floor to get off on. When I get in the elevator there is a button for the bottom floor that says Sheraton. Okay great, this works. As the elevator stops on other floors, there are shoppers, people dressed in gym clothes and I realize that we are stopping in the middle of Macys department store. Did I get on the wrong elevator? Nope, when I get to the bottom floor I get out in the middle of the mall. I get to drag my suitcase through the shopping mall, and as I continue to walk there is a sign as if I am going to a department store that says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at one of the entrances. Needless to say I am not happy by this point. I check in hiking to myself, just relax it will get better from here. I go to my room and its okay, nothing spectacular, but not too bad. You can definitely tell they tried their best to update the appearance while being in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel. It was clean and doable, but definitely been in better. I had picked this location, thinking it was next to the mall it would be safe for me to find places to eat, etc. I am so frustrated I go talk to the manager and nicely explain had it been one thing I could live with my check in issues, but I had real issues with not being able to pull in to check-in and not being able to give the bellman my luggage, having to pull my luggage through a parking garage, through the mall and lastly having them take so long to answer the phone to be told to hold. She graciously offered me dinner, which I was happy with and not expecting. I just wanted her to know tour buses should not be blocking the entrance AND they need to pick up the phone. Anyhow, I used it for dinner in the restaurant, which turned out to be just as horrible as check in. My $30 steak was overcooked, chewy and dry. The bread they served was as hard as a rock. I have had better steaks from Chilis Grill. Anyhow, when I checked out early in the morning a few days later, I had to take my suitcase and walk through the quiet and eerie mall and into the parking garage which just as eerie for that early in the morning. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that at all.

Self-parking actually uses the parking space of an adjacent mall. To go to the parking garage, you would have to go down to the ground level of the hotel, walk to the mall, and then take a mall elevator to the fourth floor parking space. Very inconvenient.

Oh my goodness, was that ever a horrible mistake. I barely slept that night. The thrumming, clanking, machinery noises switched on and off irregularly all night. Every time I got used to them, the pattern changed. The white noise machine was no help since the vibrations went right through the floors and wall, it wasn't just a noise you could block out.

I thought about getting up, repacking everything and moving rooms, but it was already so late and I had a big presentation the next day!

The next day when I went to switch rooms they didn't seem surprised at all. . . I don't know who could sleep in those suite rooms. A homeless person accustomed to sleeping under a noisy bridge? Someone taking Ambien who is thus completely drugged out of their mind? Someone who drank about 40 martinis and then passed out? If none of these descriptors apply to you, then avoid those suites.

Another good factor about this hotel is the free internet and printing services they have in the lobby, great for printing out my boarding pass.

I got a discounted rate, so I had to pay $12.95 for internet access, which is comparable to other hotels in the area. There is a gym the hotel uses, and guests get in free. There are treadmills, bikes, weights of all kinds (free and machine), and I do think they have yoga classes available. You didn't have to wait for the equipment, there is lots of it.

The first room we had was dirty and smelt of smoke (despite a leaflet saying you'll be fined for smoking in the room so they can professionally clean/febreeze it properly), this was a preferred guest room, so we went back to reception and got upgraded to a club room. The problem with this hotel is the rooms are dated and in need of a make-over. I can imagine that in the 70's this was a very nice hotel to stay in. When you walk into the room you are greeted by dirty ceiling tiles and a loud, dusty, overworked air-con. The bathroom is basic and what i'd expect from a motel, and though not dirty it didn't feel clean as it was old and shabby. Paint was chipped and wallpaper peeling from the walls. I didn't like to walk around on the carpet as it felt grubby. I didn't even un-pack in the hotel as I didn't feel comfortable or like I could relax. The club room was ok, but i've been in better, again it is in need of modernising. I can't really fault the staff as they were OK, I think they know how bad the rooms are as they didn't argue with me. My only complaint about them is that i've read other reviews about rooms that have been renovated. I didn't know this at the time of asking but I did specifically ask for a renovated room after the first one as there is nothing else really wrong with this hotel apart from the age of the rooms. If they invested some money in the rooms then I think my stay would have been very enjoyable, but as it stands I hated every second of my stay there and I think the fact I left early speaks volumes.

The Sheraton is inexpensive, (I booked my nights for only $159 a night and about $200 less then some of the other swanky hotels that don't come close to offering the warmth, charm, and value I found here at this property!) For those with access to it the Concierge Lounge was excellent! A perfect place to unwind and get some work done with free refreshments and scrumptious appetizers. The location is perfect! Close to everything! The property is clean and warm and very cheerful. Every staff member that I encountered was authentically concerned about our comfort and enjoyment. They really want to make sure your experience is memorable. We took advantage of ordering some room service and were completely satisfied. The food arrived hot and tasty! In under 20 minutes!!! The hotel was immaculate and felt very cozy. The beds were a dream! (pun intended) The rooms were clean as a whistle and the bathroom was luxurious! I have informed Daniel Kerzner as he is the Director of the Starwood Ambassador Program and He should know I recommend he send his VIP Guests to stay under your care. I have also shared my gratitude with Tanja at Starwood Corporate as she is my Personal Travel Ambassador and her Manager, Laurie McBeath. They ask me to provide details whenever I encounter a truly exceptional experience that goes above and beyond the normal high standards Starwood sets for it's guests and you are without question the example they had in mind. \u00c2\u00a0In the words of one of your most famous Govenors, \"I'll be back\"!

His name was Jason Reyes; he was one of the managers. I asked Jason, for a high floor with a complimentary upgrade, but as the previous staff member warned me over the phone of the hotel being sold out, Jason had confirmed at check in. I was not being picky at all, and took the room on the 17th floor, but what really surprised me was how Jason said to me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you would like, tomorrow when I come into work I can move your rooms to a higher floor with a corner room?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said to him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh no, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to put you through that trouble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but he was so kind and charming to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not at all, this will be my first priority to my shift tomorrow evening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Another gentleman I would like to point out is Larry at the bellman desk. He always had a smile on him and made me feel good with approaching him on questions about the area. Larry loved to chuckle, walk around and interact with others. Now about the amenities of the hotel. Parking is really, really expensive but there is a small lot across the street that charges you like $5 or $6 each time you leave, so I would recommend parking across the street and just taking the train to attractions in the area since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so close. If your looking to stay somewhere for fun and be near attractions, I recommend this hotel and the two staff members above. The hotel is near the Staples center and there are a lot of restaurants in the area, walking distance.

Self park is also $28 per day. Valet is also offered for $32. So, while that is a down side, especially with kids, the upside is all of the amenities the mall offers without having to go outdoors. There is a small supermarket where we bought fresh fruit. Another vendor sold smoothies for breakfast. There is a Carl's Jr. if you feel like a burger. So in this sense the Sheraton has more to offer than most other hotels if you count what is in the mall as hotel amenities. Room decor is Westin-esque with dark wood, white bedding, the usual heavenly stuff. Wireless and wired Internet worked well, offered through AT&T for a fee. We had an infant with us and requested a crib, and the hotel obliged. Housekeeping even made up the crib each day, which was a nice touch.

So I decamped to the much cheaper Sheraton Downtown. And what can I say? I really was very happy there. It's a mid tier Sheraton, not the newest but not the oldest either, and the area of downtown is actually pretty OK with Macys, Starbucks, Walgreens all very close. Everything you need. I also really liked Octopus (sushi restaurant opposite) which served pretty decent sushi that was also, like the hotel, great value. Top marks go the staff who were superbly friendly both on the front desk and around the hotel, exceptionally so in fact - it was them that made me decide to write this review. One negative is that the hotel does not have it's own gym - instead you sign into the Bally gym in the shopping arcade. The distance is not a problem but the gym is fairly horrible, a fairly old 1980s style place. So if you do like a nice private hotel gym, you'll miss that here.

I've left 2 messages to the hotel since my stay 1.5 weeks ago and they have failed to rectify the $4. The self parking is located 5 floors up then you have to take the mall elevator back to the ground floor and walk from one end of the mall to the other where the hotel is then go back up the hotel elevator. The hotel is old and tired. I wanted directions to the Staples Center and it was like pulling teeth from the bellboys who were too busy chatting with each other. The Staples Center is about the only place you can walk to as there is nothing else in the area. The location is definitely not for families as you get a homeless person asking you for changing every block and you're lucky if they leave you alone or follow you for a block or two trying hard for change.

It's not that the hotel is terrible - it's just that it's not very good. All of the things that you expect from a Sheraton - like across-the-board good service - just don't happen here. For example, the in-house internet. It is spotty, with frequent outages. But my call to guest services to resolve the problem merely resulted in the operator transfering the caller to an AT&T operators and a ten minute wait to talk to someone who couldn't resolve the problem. So, instead, I found myself waiting an additional twenty minutes for the network to come back on. And that's what happens, and how you resolve a problem, when a hotel decides to outsource a basic service. I must say, some of the employees are very good. And some are very bad and in need of training. For example, one night my key card was demagnetized and I asked the front desk to reprogram it. The fellow put it in the machine, claimed to re-program it, and then I returned to my room ... where it didn't open the door. I returned to the front desk, asked him to do it again, he did ... and it still didn't open the door. This happened twice more before he figured out how to do it. Not good.

Be forewarned that a continental breakfast does not include the hot items at the buffet -- we made that mistake the first day and had to pay extra. Another feature of this hotel is that it's pretty easy to get to USC. We decided not to rent a car for this trip and it paid off. There is easy bus transportation to USC from about 2 blocks away on bus 81. And a cab between USC and the hotel is only about $15, including tip. So it's much cheaper than renting a car.

It was a nice room with the typically comfortable bed, a chair I would never sit in in the corner, nice Phillips backlit flat screen TV, and a typical hotel bathroom (although I didn't like how the door opened onto the sink/basin). Service was good; at check in, I was waved over when standing at the end of a long line of travelers. Requested a \"quiet\" room, and received the corner room at the end of the hall--perfect! Room was very clean and lots of closet space. I could not get the wireless working, but the wired internet worked just fine and was as quick as it is at home. I also liked how there was a slight overhang over the head of the bed, so when you had the AC/fan on, it could run all night without blowing on you. I parked valet--a little hard to figure out at first, but they were relatively slow during my Fri night stay and very quick in getting my car. They never charged me for valet, and I inquired at checkout, and was told by the front desk clerk not to worry about it. NICE!

I asked the clerk at checkout if frequent guests tend to have an opinion between the Westin and here...he was very politically correct, and told me that the Westin was a \"convention hotel\", and Sheraton a \"business hotel\"...that answered my question, thus why I cancelled the Westin to try out the JW Live.

We didn't choose to stay here and if it were up to me I probably wouldn't choose to stay here. It definitely caters to the businessperson and I wouldn't recommend it for a family. The location is ok- Near a number of good restaurants and close to the LA convention center, LA Live, etc. Any touristy type activities required a car or a taxi. There is a Metro stop across the street, but I wasn't comfortable using it. I regularly use the subways in NYC without reservation, but for some reason the Metro here made me unsettled. So unless you have access to a car or feel like trying the Metro, plan on spending at least $20 each way to get to any tourist attractions. The \"mall\" that is connected to the hotel consists of a few stores such as Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret and Macy's-pretty slim pickings if you want to do some shopping. The closest shopping center is The Grove which is a $30 cab ride away. There isn't even a bookstore near by. Our first night here we had to call the front desk because of our neighbors. The wall are paper thin! There was a family staying next door and while I sympathize with having to deal with cranky and rambunctious children I don't want to spend the night listening to them. The front desk offered to move us. Staff was very friendly and even sympathetic when I looked myself out of our room. Although pricey, the food was pretty good for a hotel. I did have to call three times for WiFi connectivity issues. The provider stated that they were having some issues and I could go downstairs and use the computers in the lobby.

Recent renovation made it a clean and comfortable stay with good service (for the most part). ROOMS: We were upgraded to a deluxe room on the 21st floor with nice views of the surrounding areas. The room was spacious and included a large desk with surface plugs, a large plasma/LCD TV, and a large bathroom. Oddly, the standing shower was disproportionately small and reminded me of my first cruise experience. SERVICE: Despite the long line to check-in (about 20 minutes wait), the front desk and bellmen were all smiles and happy to assist throughout our stay. Unfortunately we had a sour experience with the guest services operator. When we called to ask for a late check-out, she said the hotel was sold out and could not extend my time. We informed her rooms were still being sold online, and she responded that those rooms were reserved for \"those websites\" but the hotel was still sold out. We immediately checked the Sheraton direct website and rooms were selling for only $129. We then walked to the front desk, who said the hotel was not sold out and gave me a late check-out time. We felt cheated by the guest services operator after she blatantly lied to us and made up a fake reason for not giving us a late check-out. AMENITIES: The renovation in 2008 really improved the appearance of this hotel. The hotel entrance is a dramatic two story design that is spacious and welcoming. There is a public business center in the lobby with four computer stations and free Internet access and printing. The hotel had a gift shop, coffee shop, a few restaurants, as well as complimentary access to Bally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gym located in the connected mall. The gym has more equipment than you could use during your stay, but there is no pool. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to the club lounge, unfortunately. LOCATION: We liked the downtown location and the hotel's proximity to the 7th Street Metro station. Since our stay was under 24 hours and isolated to only downtown, we decided to take the bus/metro from LAX. It only took 35 minutes to get to the hotel and we avoided the $32 valet parking charge on top of the rental car costs. The hotel is also attached to Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Plaza and all the mall shops without having to walk outside. CLEANLINESS: The public spaces were really clean and well kept. There weren't any noticeable issues with cleanliness in the rooms either, except for some mysterious brown stains on the bathroom ceiling. VALUE: We booked well in advance and got a great rate for new year's eve. At that price, the hotel's location, cleanliness, and room comfort were well worth the money.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia USA", "Title": "\u201cGood luck\u201d", "Author": "dragonflynda", "ReviewID": "UR52277052", "Content": "The rooms are not sound proof, you can hear everything in the next room, the hall, the stairs from the room.

Next day my internet doesn't work after I paid $25 so I call and yay someone answers but their answer is the internet only goes until 3pm the next day.

It also connects directly to the Macy's mall, which includes a Bally's Fitness Center. When we first checked in and got to our room about 1:00pm, we found it very warm inside the room. Even with the room-darkening shades on the windows, we could feel the sun's heat radiating from the windows. Maybe there is less heat from the windows on lower floors where other neighboring buildings help shade the windows. We turned up the air conditioner to its coldest setting and proceeded to unpack and relax a bit. An hour later, there had been no change in the room's temperature. I placed my hand in front of the A/C vent and felt barely cool area coming out a mere trickle. When I called the front desk to inquire about a room change, the very pleasant lady immediately agreed to check for another room, but stated it probably wouldn't be any different because the hotel had a central air conditioning system for the entire property, rather than individual units for each room or floor. She offered to have a fan or evaporative cooler brought to the room, and we readily accepted the fan. Her immediate explanation of the cooling system and the offer of the fan or cooler made me think it is a common problem. While we waited for the fan to arrive, I looked at the A/C system in the room a little closer. It appears that the control in the room simply allows more or less of the (barely) cooled air to come into the room. Even at its highest setting, the air will probably never be very cool, and the very low air flow was probably the result of lots of rooms having their vents wide open. After waiting nearly an hour for the fan to show up, we had to leave to head for a concert at the Staples Center. We hoped the staff would drop off the fan while we were gone. Upon returning from the concert at about 1:00am, we found no fan in our room, and the room was still as warm as when we had left, even though the sun had set quite a few hours ago. Another call to the front desk. About 20 minutes later, a very friendly gentleman brought us a basic box fan. It didn't make the air in the room any cooler, but the air blowing right at the bed at least made it tolerable. The rest of the room was okay. Nothing especially good or bad.

Have also stayed at nearby Marriott as Downtown area is a quick drive past the Staples Center on Figueroa St to get to the USC campus. Pre-paid $95 per night for three night stay. The hotel doesn't feel new. It's attached to a Macys with a few run-down looking stores and a 2nd-rate food court that I wouldn't want to eat in. Yes, it has a couple of well-known chain stores like Victoria's Secret, but it just feels like a mall from 25 years ago--all brick facade and boring. Liked: As others have noted, average looking hotel rooms, but comfortable beds, big desk, extra chair. Polite, efficient front desk. Quick housekeeping response when we requested extra towels--arrived within minutes. Very good wireless in room and as AT&T customers it was free instead of $12.95 per day. Lobby is small but it had very nice free internet station with 4 Dell XPS One systems set up for surfing, printing boarding passes, etc. Also had several stations where users could plug in their own systems to work. I thought this was a very nice thing to offer and better than the typical hotel business office. Disliked: Ridiculous price of $28 per night for valet, especially since after your initial check-in you have to drive the car down a ramp and through a gate, to bring the car to the valet station in the basement of the garage. I mean what am I paying for if I can't have curbside or front door service every time? Stayed in room 800. LOUD street noise for the 8th floor. No hot water in bathroom. Sometimes we had to let the water run about 10 minutes before it would warm up--no exaggeration! Another weird thing--There was HVAC ductwork over the bed with two giant air filters directly overhead as an intake for the HVAC duct system. You know the type of dust filter you have to change on your furnace every couple of months? Imagine having two huge ones directly over your pillow at night. I'm not a germaphobe, but it's gross. Why weren't these intakes on the wall or at least not directly over the bed? I'm still asking myself why I didn't request another room? We didn't eat in the hotel, but the Pannini Cafe at 9th st was very good for breakfast and lunch. Maria's Downtown Italian restaurant (615 S Flower) was enjoyable for dinner. Used the Bally's gym which is across the hall in the attached mall and is free for hotel guests. That's a nice amenity except for the fact that like the mall, this gym had a very run-down feeling to it. While my wife worked out on an eliptical trainer, I tried 4 machines before I could find one that worked right. Another 6 cardio machines had Out of Order signs. After some cardio work, went to the free weight area, which had a very good assortment of equipment. Unfortunately again, in various degrees of disrepair. So great to have a major gym versus the usual one little room most hotels have, but such a poor quality gym--I would never buy a membership if I lived here!

I called the lobby and asked for a different room, but of course they had none. I made due by stuffing towels under the door.

If you do eat at the hotel be careful with the older waiter as he seems to be having a heart attack. There are lots of resturants in the area, I prefered to Panini resturant two blocks away. Rite Aid is opposite to main enterance to small items. Ralphs the supermarket is also nearby for more substantial groceries. The Grand Central Market is worth going to for fresh cheap fruit this is only two stops on the Metro from the hotel. This was my first time in LA you intially get a shock at the size of people in the area as many are overweight. The hotel were keen to sell sightseeing tours from their reccomended companies but there are others available at cheaper rates. The main sites Universal and Disney are acessable by public transport so you just pay the entrance fee currently at $67 and $69. Some of the hotel staff were more helpful than others. If you want to shop then go to Glendale gallaria on bus 92, there are lots of resturants there. You can shop at Maceys which is in the Mall, ask for the 10% discount voucher from the hotel reception. Bally's gym is free to all hotel guests but does get busy at certain times especially from 6pm to 9pm. As with all cities LA downtown does suffer from the vagrants so be careful when going out at night time. The local authority really needs to tackle this issue. The fashion district has several shops with fake designer lables. Bus route Dash E takes you there for only 25 cents. The LA library is worth going.

The pluses: convenient to the 110 and 10 freeways with easy access to Hollywood and LAX; near Original Pantry, an awesome old-fashioned breakfast place/diner; right across the street from RiteAid for your late-night toiletry needs; shares the building with a small mall (although it's mostly closed at night) with a Bally's gym; has a small fitness center with a patio for freeweights; good customer service and clean, elegant rooms. The minuses: no air conditioning in our room (it didn't bother us too much since we're from the Bay Area and never use air conditioning); limited food choices at night in the area (unless you want to spend a lot of money or eat cheap diner food at IHOP, the Pantry or Denny's); and few amenities in the room (VERY basic cable, VERY expensive movies). Definitely designed for the business traveler, and not useful for other types of folks.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cYou are paying for downtown location\u201d", "Author": "food_nut", "ReviewID": "UR7618049", "Content": "The Sheraton has an elegant feel. Decor is a cut above your average motor lodge. However, I feel that the decor is not worth the price of the rooms. Mainly, you are paying for the downtown location, and, boy, do you pay. Not only does the room cost $75 more than a comparable room in a different part of LA, but also you pay an extra $22 for parking and there's no free breakfast. The fitness center is pretty poor; even the hot tub was closed. The parking is strange, forcing you to walk through the mall to get to the hotel. However, I did feel safe at all times even in downtown LA, and the beds were comfortable. The room AC was central as opposed to the noisy wall units you get at motor lodges, but we had trouble getting the room cool enough to suit us. We walked to IHOP for breakfast. Go out the Flowers St mall exit and turn to your left. For dinner we took the metro to Union Station ($2.50 roundtrip), and ate on historic Olvera Street.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201ca good hotel to stay at\u201d", "Author": "big_foooot", "ReviewID": "UR7591691", "Content": "o.k so it's not at the best location for hollywood and the beach but it's only 20 minutes away by metro which is directly outside the hotel, $3 for a day pass makes it easy on the pocket. the hotel itself is of a very good standard with the usual shop for bits and bobs but is lucky enough to be next to a mall which has a macys, bathworks, post office, carls' jr and robeks to name a few. the beds are a dream, plenty of pillows and comfortable to boot! the front desk are helpful and the concierge are good at their job, the bar is a hotel bar and the staff are not fully up to speed when it comes to service. there is a grill room which i used once and would advise against, there is a ihop and dennys round the corner that give better value. if you want peace and quiet rather than a bustling nightlife and are not bothered about jumping on the metro to get places this hotel is for you", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77798-Reviews-Sheraton_Los_Angeles_Downtown_Hotel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$166 - $346*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">711 South Hope Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90017</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "77798", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/fa/7c/fa7c3dc8d80d5cf77c5b159fce0aa3d96large.jpg"}}

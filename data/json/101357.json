But after staying here it was a pleasant experience. It was also about half the price of the more expensive neighbours who's resorts you can just wander into. We had a partial sea view from the Molokai wing which is the original building. There are no lifts so you have to carry your bag up the stairs. The room was comfortable but dated, beds were comfy and we had a nice view. Only downside to this wing was the noise from the showers. I think if anyone in the vacinity of our room had a shower you could hear the pipes. And people are up early for flghts or tours! Other than that apart from one set of very loud neighbours we didn't hear any others through the walls.. The grounds are lovely and you can lie under the trees or in the sun. The pool is small however the beach is great. You can walk down to Black Rock for swimming with the fish and turtles (if you are going early keep a beach towel from the day before as they don't open till 8). Breakfast buffet was ok, a little more variety would be nice. We also ate from the Tiki bar/hut a couple of times and the food was good. All the other hotels are in easy walking distance and after we had been through them all we actually did like our hotel a little more. The Westin has the wow factor but the Hyatt and Sheraton were quite bland and the Marriott is just timeshare hell! We caught the bus into Lahaina several times. Get the $2 day ticket rather than $1 each way and you can always go back in at night. The nightly music at the hotel was nice, we didn't go see the show but listened to the music from our lanai.

However, the grounds are really pretty. The pool is whale shaped and basic. No waterfalls. The beach is great and fairly large (by Maui standards). We saw whales from the beach and there is snorkeling right there. We did not see any sea turtles, but we heard they've been around. We had both a \"partial ocean view\" room and \"ocean view\" room. From the lanai the partial ocean view had a nice view of the pool, the gounds and a bit of the ocean. The beds were so-so. The shower/toilet/sink/in room coffee maker were all in the same room. The ocean view room we upgraded to upon our return was located in the building FARTHEST away from the water but we could see more of the ocean through the pretty trees on the lawn. Again, nice lanai. In this room the shower/toilet were separated from the room with the sink, and the coffee maker had its own little nook/space outside of the bathroom. The room itself was bigger and the beds were more comfortable. If you want to be able to sit on your lanai with an unobstructed view, make sure you request an \"ocean FRONT\". We had breakfast at the restaurant. The buffet was very good (@ $20 per person) and had a lot to offer. We did not eat dinner there and cannot comment on that or on the nightly show. They also have a deli where you can get food items and drinks to go (and coffee for $1). They also have a nice little gift shop. Most of the employee's were extremely friendly. I think the very best thing about the hotel was that it was within easy walking distance to many restaurants and (expensive) shopping at Whaler's Village. Other reviews have stated that it is alot cheaper than the Hyatt and Marriott, which is probably true.

Arrived at 11:30AM and our room was not ready and was not availble until 3:30PM. They said they would call us when it was ready, but they never did. We took our own bags to our room and were dismayed to find out that there were no elevators to our third floor room. Our room took our breath away, but not in a good way. It was in desparate need of updating, walls were paper thin, roaches in the bathroom and we believe the room's rug or AC made my wife ill during our stay. That night we had a pricey dinner for very mediocore food and had to wait 20 minutes and order twice for our first drinks. Service staff were not very attentive or particulary friendly--which was a theme of our stay. We were shocked by other TripAdvisor reviews of their Aloha spirit and their claim as \"The Most Hawaiian Hotel.\" If their claim is accurate, it is a sad statment about the Hawaiian people. We did meet others that seemed pleased with the hotel, but to us, these people would have been just as pleased at a tacky Las Vegas or Orlando hotel. As this was my wife's first trip to the Hawaiian islands, she was very pleased to learn and use the new words \"aloha\" and \"mahalo.\" Suprisingly, both these words were lacking from the staff. We read about the staff's education in Hawaiian culture and their community activities, but their Aloha Spirit seemed forced at best. They did not smile, greet others, or intiate helpfulness. A great representation of this was our 8AM \"goodbye\" ceremony in they lobby that we arrived at 3 minutes late. They woman leading the ceremony sang good by Karaoke-style and gave everyone, EXCEPT US, a kiki nut lei. She then asked everyone, EXCEPT US, where they were returning to. We waited around for awhile, while she got into a conversation with the last group and I said jokingly, \"You forgot about us.\" She flatly replied, \"I didn't forget about you, you were late.\" My wife left in tears. We will say the Aloha breakfast was nice and very informative. The story behind the canoe that the staff built themselves is touching. The nightly music and hula dancing were great. The drinks at the bar were potent and worth the price, which helped ease our disappointments. We would have been better off getting a condo and fending for ourselves or a more expensive hotel because we would have gotten more for our money.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rocky River, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNothing special but served it's purpose\u201d", "Author": "jendin25", "ReviewID": "UR125797219", "Content": "We got married in hawaii and stayed for our honeymoon. This hotel was decent. We must have been in the \"old \" wing because the bathroom had no tub just a shower stall. The room was clean and the beds and pillows were actually really soft and nice. Beach was nice...you have to pay for chairs and umbrellas so keep that in mind. We paid for the buffet breakfast when we booked the trip and it was nice to wake up and just go downstairs for breakfast but its the same food everyday. Eggs, cold potatoes, mystery meat and fish, cereal, fruit...not a huge selection. We were very sick of eating it by the end of the week and the servers (all they do is bring u a cup of coffee and water) expect you to leave a 20% tip for doing basically nothing. The staff was ok...nothing special. I am not sure why they call themselves the \"most hawaiian hotel\". There are shows at night but after seeing one its enough. Location is ok...you can walk to whalers village and there are 3 good restaurants there...we liked Hula Grill the best. You can also catch the bus there and get an all day pass for $2.There is really nothing else in walking distance and if you ask the staff where a good place to eat is they act like no one has ever asked them before. They are also awful at giving directions so be cautious. I would not recommend eating dinner at the hotel restaurant...expensive and not very good. The tiki bar to go food was decent tho. Another thing is that we were probably the youngest people staying at the hotel and we are both 30...it is a much older crowd. Everyone was older than my parents. All in all, the hotel served its purpose but I wish we would have stayed somewhere a little nicer for our honeymoon. I would probably stay somewhere else in the future if we were to go back and pay a little more money.

We have good friends who've been coming here with their families for many, many years because it's a great value and the hospitality is absolutely amazing. We first checked in and received a room in the oldest (read: original) wing of the hotel. Yikes. We were on a first floor, partial ocean view room. The room was dark, the paint peeling, The bathroom tiny with no tub, just a shower stall. Not what we expected or wanted with 2 young kids. We politely asked for a different room (we don't like 1st floor for security/safety reasons and we wanted a tub to bathe our 2 young kids). After the second request, they found a way to move us. The second room was great. It was in the newest wing. The lighting, paint, furniture, bathroom, were all very good. It was on the 4th floor so the view and light were great. If you stay here -- PLEASE ask for the new wing! The main restaurant was good for the breakfast buffet. Nothing outstanding, but reasonably god food at a reasonable price. Even better if you book a package rate with vouchers included. The Tiki Grill offers fine pub food and reasonably priced and potent drinks. The staff is truly amazing. As I said, they are polite, knowledgable, and genuine. They are open about sharing their culture and offer many ways for adults and kids alike to learn about it. They claim recognition for being the \"Most Hawaiian Hotel\" and from my dozen trips to Hawaii in 20 years, I would agree. Our kids loved the passport program where they got to collect stamps for learning and doing different things around the hotel. The pool is tiny but is fine for young kids' entertainment for an hour a day, but it's definitely not a fancy resort pool. I'll be honest that with kids 6 and 8, I kind of missed that. The beach is steps away and an activities shack for snokeling & scuba trips sits on-property. Convenient! Overall, I would recommend this hotel for couples and older (middle aged to senior singles) and young families on a budget.

The beds very clean and comfortable, and rooms and towels cleaned everyday. The only downside to this hotel was the use of the hotel phone. We bought a phone card to phone back home daily and when we checked out we found that the hotel had charged us 75c for every phone call, not a lot I know but over 5 days it adds up and the phone card says no charges - we had used the card at our other hotel and there was no charge.

We came here from the Four Seasons on Lanai which was beautiful and wonderful, so we had been spoiled. When we walked into the lobby of the Kannapali Beach Hotel, we were very disappointed. It is small, boring, and dated. They gave us a room in the Molokai wing even though I had requested one in the newly renovated Kauai wing, but they had upgraded us to a partial ocean view room. It was very dreary and depressing. The hallways were narrow with low ceilings, and the best word to describe it was dreary. The rooms were decorated in brown and beige with dark blue and white bedspread. Why in the world wouldn't you use \"pretty colors\" in Hawaii? We went over to the Kauai wing and the hallways were taller and wider and it looked alot better, alothough still not \"pretty\". When we checked in, they said that we could be moved to Kauai wing in 2 days. However, we decided to go back and press the issue. We told them we would like to be moved or we wanted to leave the next morning. They then found us a room in the Kauai room which was much better. They bill themselves as \"the most Hawaiian Hotel on Maui\", however, in reality, I think that is just trying to put a nice spin on the fact that the hotel needs a serious redo. In their defense, the rates were probably significantly cheaper than the other hotels on the Kannapali Beach strip, but after you spend all the money and time and effort to get there, you want a nice place to stay. The hotel we came from on Lanai was about $15.00 more per night and 20 times nicer. They charge for beach chairs, etc not so in Lanai. We ate 3 meals there and all 3 were average or below. My husband said he liked his meal okay the first night, however. And the prices were not cheap. We did the Sunday buffet brunch which was $39.00 each, and it was quanity over quality in my opinion. It was the most expensive meal we had on our trip but nowhere near the best. Plus, the service was terrible. I was having to get my own drinks, no one was checking on us to see if we needed refills, they were not clearing our used plates, etc. Yet, when the bill came, they were suggesting your tip which was over 20%. It was a buffet for pete's sake and the service was terrible. The people are nice but they don't know good service. On the pro side, the hotel is well located and our room ended up being convenient. The people at the concerige desk were nice. We had not been to Maui in 27 years and I could not believe how much more \"crowded\" it was and over built. They are turning paradise into a concrete jungle. I prefer less crowded beach areas. Lanai was alot nicer for about the same price, although Maui is still beautiful. Can't beat the sunsets on Kaanapali Beach. We did not have a car there, they were sold out, so we had to use the bus. Another good thing about this hotel is it is near Whaler's Village which has a bus stop. For 2 bucks, you can hop on and off all day and it worked okay. If we went back, I might just get a car for part of the days when we wanted to drive far away. This was a significant savings. We went on a whale watch with Pacific Whale Foundation. A piece of advice. Go early and join the foundation. You get a free admission and a free tee shirt plus priorirty boarding, etc., and it all totals about what you would pay for one admission. I didn't realize this until after we were already on the boat. If I went back to Kannapali Beach, I would try to stay at the Sheraton, the Hyatt or the Westin.

The staff at this hotel were incredibly nice, after a couple of days we developed friendships with the staff and found ourselves to be at-home. The grounds were meticulously maintained and a pleasure. The staff at the Tiki bar were, for the most part, pretty good. Dale is the bomb and a local legend on island. I noticed after a few days that the Tiki Bar is the most popular bar in the hotel area for locals which, to me, says something about the hotel and staff. The breakfest is average at best. If your not getting a package that includes it then I'd eat in Lahaina 5mins away for $15 bucks cheaper. The only complaints I have of the hotel are rather small and I'd imagine other hotels do the same thing. They charge .75 cents to use the telephone, even on local calls. The money wasn't the issue here, I just found this to be a bit petty on their part. However, I'm sure other hotels are doing the same. Another issue I had is they charge a $1.50 per day to use the safe. Of course, it's optional so we just informed the front desk we had no intentions on using it but charges like these could easily be wrapped up into the room charges. Charge people an extra $10 bucks and allow us to use the phone and safe without trying to nickel and dime us. It's convenient, clean, and the staff here are great.

This is a great hotel at a great location for the price. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not 5 stars but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean and well maintained. The place is comfortable in the common areas inside and out, not over-crowded or oversold. The grounds are landscaped nicely and kept up. Every day at the crack of dawn staff are out picking up anything that fell on the grounds over night and straightening the lounge chairs of which there were plenty. Our room was in good shape, clean, fresh, furnished well, nicely decorated with Hawaiian accents and not worn, everything worked, and had a mini-fridge and safe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not newly built or newly renovated so there will likely be small imperfections to be found but you have to look for them. Sure, there are some places that could use a spot of paint here and there but they do attend to these things. They were actually painting some railings in the parking garage on the day we left. Hotel is made up of three interconnected buildings and one remote building with no elevators. The center building has only ocean view (straight ahead through the grounds) rooms (except lower ocean facing floors) with exterior corridors. Other buildings have interior corridors with rooms on both sides, ocean views at an angle and ocean may not be visible from deep inside the rooms, rooms on the opposite side are probably lowest rates with views of adjacent properties. What really stands out it the way all of the staff goes out to make everyone feel welcome and at home, and yes with the Hawaiian flare. We found Christmas presents in our room on Christmas. This was a return trip and with that we got a confirmed no-charge room upgrade with our reservation. We also opted for a package that included rental car, breakfast buffet, local phone calls, and room safe. This package basically gave us the breakfast, phone calls, and safe (normally $1.50/day) for free (after pricing car options separately). In addition, we got a welcome gift on the first day (nice big fruit and cheese platter) and another gift on the 6th day. The hotel gives out a kukui nut lei to guest when they leave and all of the staff have them as well. The nuts are brown to start and the staff gets a white nut for each year of service. Returning guests are asked to bring back their leis on return trips to get a white nut on each return. The hotel treats the staff as family which is evident by how many have been there for so many years and treats the guests as family as well. If something isn't quite right they will make it right and you won't get the \"it's not my job response\". The breakfast buffet was mid-sized but nothing too fancy and drinks are included. Would not have paid extra for this, or used it if not for the package but it seemed fine for many people eating there. There is an option at additional charge (with the package) to order cooked to order items. Likewise did not opt for the even larger Sunday Champagne brunch on this trip for about $40 pp. Had dinner at the Tikki Terrace restaurant once. Food was good and presented well and only a little pricy compared to similar offerings and quality at the offsite restaurants nearby. Sandwiches and burgers at the Tikki Bar were mediocre; prices are high but typical for the Maui area. Some may find the nightly free Hawaiian hula show on the terrace a bit corny but they try to keep it authentic rather than just another tourist event.

Compared to those chain resorts that we went by for dinner and events, the Ka'anapali is definitely more laid back, more Hawaiian, and just more pleasant. The rate is far better. They don't make you wear uncomfortable ID wristbands. The public grounds are (unlike other hotels) quiet and un-congested. The atmosphere is Hawaiian, but not to the point where it becomes tacky. Our room was right on the water, so we just left the sliding balcony door open all day and night, listening to the methodic churn of the ocean. The room was spacious, bright, and well decorated. The view was impeccable, especially the sunsets. The service was impressive. We would walk into the bathroom and literally shake piles of sand out of our clothes. There wasn't a grain left after they cleaned. For better or for worse, it would probably be easier to break through the wall than the bulletproof front doors that would close with a tremendous boom. You get used to it after a while, but some foam padding may be in order. The internet was not free, and used an ethernet cable rather than WiFi. This made it unusable for my computer that doesn't have one. I was annoyed at first, but became kind of glad because it was one less gadget to worry about. Whaler's village is a short walk away, which is great. We were able to domost of our X-mas shopping there. The Tiki Terrace restaurant at the hotel was very good, but still not as good as some of the independent restaurants. They gave a free luau show every night, which was a very nice way to end the day. When we got up early one morning we saw tons of people at the Westin, Marriott, and Hyatt staking out their beach chair for later, because it would become such a mob scene. It was total mayhem around there later. The decor at those hotels was over the top, and not even Hawaiian at times, like the Penguin enclosure in the Hyatt. The rates at those places were around 700 dollars a night. The Ka'anapali is very much a local business that hires locally, has Hawaiian owners, and has a stake in Maui itself. I avoid the Hotel-opolis' in a place with a fragile ecosystem, because they have no real stake in the future of the environment, or the economy, in that place.

The rooms are average - there was an average king bed, a \"couch\" that could double as a twin bed if needed, a balcony facing a condo building with an average partial eastern ocean view, and an abysmal bathroom that suggested memories of my Motel 6 experiences of the past. They chintzed on the shampoo, no cream rinse and only one pack of coffee per day. As we stayed during Christmas break due to a family function, it was high season, and there are many babies, kids and early teeners along with your slew of oldsters camped outside the pool area. The only in house restaurant is the open air Tiki Terrace, where they serve average quality menu meals and a really bad overpriced breakfast buffet. Skip it and go to LuLu's 5 miles down the road - excellent and half the price. The other aggravation was the never-ending Hawaiian \"entertainment\" - bad singers wailing Hawaiian songs and pre-pubescent dance troupes gyrating traditional dances badly. It gave us the impetus to leave and seek dinner elsewhere as fast as we could get out. But this place markets themselves as \"Hawaii's most Hawaiian Hotel\" so I guess you asked for it. It just really gets old after day 2. That said, we came to Maui for the diving, whales and other activities. We would leave as early as 5:00 AM and return late with no hassles. The paved beach walk gave us access to many of the other hotels' eateries and a rental car gets you into Lahaina. The parking garage was a good addition and easy access from our room. So we never stayed in the hotel or beach very long unless we were cleaning up or sleeping. Take that in mind, and the hotel is a better bargain than the other resorts.

Also, be sure to look at the Banyan tree in old Lahaina, wow! Going to costco is okay but we ended up with too much of some stuff and Safeway is actually more practical with similar prices. Rent boogie boards and snorkel gear much cheaper than at the hotel down front street or next to cannery mall. If you need gifts get them at Longs and in Cannery Mall, where you can get t-shirts 4 for 20 bucks.There is also a cheap food court there. Also, next time I'd go to Molokini for a 2 hour 25 dollar snorkeling tour. The Royal Lahaina Luau is fantastic but there are cheaper ones that are probably also good.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cParadise\u201d", "Author": "RebeccaVancouver_BC", "ReviewID": "UR122070185", "Content": "Just returned from our second 10 day stay at KBH.

It was connected to the other hotels and the Whaler village with shops, restaurants and a food court via a narrow beachside boardwalk. This boardwalk did get pretty crowded in the mornings as the pedestrians had to share it with the joggers. The grounds were expansive and well manicured with plenty of plumeria trees. The pool area was a bit small for the hotel this size but the kids in our group all enjoyed it. A big hit with the kids was the giant checkerboard on the grounds. We mainly booked this hotel because friends from Oahu flew in to join us for the weekend and were able to get adjoining rooms with the Kaamaina or Hawaii resident rate. It was $50 less per night than their cheapest rate to the public. However, we all joked that they probably put all the residents who got this rate in their oldest rooms. We were in the Moloka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i building. Our room had a balcony and a partial ocean view. The rooms were circa 1970\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2s Hawaiian d\u00c3\u00a9cor and could use some major updates despite the flat screen TV in the room. They were renovating a few rooms down the hall from ours so hopefully they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re bringing it into this century. It was clean and very spacious though. The beds were comfortable. There was a mini-refrigerator and an in-room safe (charge of $1.50 for the entire stay). There was nightly entertainment which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the chance to sit and watch. We did see some children preparing for a hula show on a Friday night. During the day, there were craft sellers in the lobby. Unfortunately, we were out exploring Maui so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the chance to take advantage of their free classes ranging from hula lessons to lei making. We were able to obtain the Aloha Passport for kids even though they were only able to participate in note card making. The guest relations staff wrote their names and their equivalent Hawaiian names. As we were waiting to checkout, we were presented with kukui nut shells which represent being part of their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfamily/ohana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and to wear it when we come back for special privileges. There was a convenience store by the entrance and there were restaurants within the hotel though a little bit pricey. The tiki grill was also expensive with $8 small mai tai drinks. Self-parking was $9 and valet parking was $11 which was a pretty good deal and they were fairly prompt.

This hotel is the first (so oldest) of Kaanapali's resort hotels, but the beach is the best of any of the resort hotels at Kaanapali, plus close to Black Rock Point coral reef for some great snorkeling (including sea turtles, fish, & eels). The staff are super friendly and helpful - very \"ohana\" (a family) and proud of their long association with the hotel. They are also proud that the Kaanapali Beach Hotel is \"the most Hawaiian\" - and it's true. The big name resorts could be located anywhere in the world (they're always the same). This hotel is Hawaiian and offers Hawaiian activities so visitors can learn about Hawaiian culture. Our room was pleasant, clean, and comfortable (included a small fridge, too), not luxurious - but we came to spend our time outdoors. The rooms are no smoking and some of the buildings don't allow smoking on the balconies, either (thankfully). The garden grounds are lovely and beautifully maintained. The pool, tiki bar, snack hut, gift shop, etc were pleasant. There were plenty of chaise lounges at the pool, but if you require one at the beach, you have to rent it (also availble to rent are umbrellas & shade loungers - they give a discount for multiple day rentals). Towels for the pool & beach are provided at the hut (don't use your white room towels). The daily breakfast buffet is excellent (don't miss it) and we always chose to eat outside under the canopy (excellent choice). Skip the croissants & sweet rolls for their Hawaiian bread and their bread pudding which were like dessert. The pineapple & papya and scrambled eggs were fresh & delicious. Every evening had live music entertainment with dinner - we enjoyed dancing with each other and watching hula and other entertainers. We also enjoyed it from our balcony (lanai). The weekend also had live music at brunch. Go down to the beach at sunset - lovely. Sit on the beach after dark for some great star-gazing (we saw shooting/falling stars)! Go down to the beach for sunrise - look & enjoy both directions as the sunrise is actually behind the hotel & mountains beyond, but the clouds over the ocean also reflect the sunrise colors. The departure aloha ceremony is a nice touch - don't miss it (on the hour from 8-noon every morning). You won't have to buy yourself a bead lei in the souvenier shops, either.

In case you are wondering, this is the friendliest hotel on the planet! First, I would like to point out that this hotel has the best beach area of all the hotels on Ka'anapali Beach. As you go further down the beach gets smaller. And if you are a fan of snorkeling Black Rock (located right next store in front of the Sheraton)has excellent snorkeling. Go in the morning though because the waves get rougher as the day goes on. This hotel is perfect if all you are looking for is a clean place to shower and lay your head at night. If you are a \"hotel snob\" then you will hate it here. This place is simple, yet clean and the grounds are beautiful! The staff are among the friendliest people I have ever encountered. Our room attendant, Suzanne, was amazing! She talked to us everyday and always greeted us with a big smile! She always asked us how our day was and she was genuinely interested. I am a very practical person, and I would rather spend money elsewhere when I travel then on the hotel, where I spend very little time. This hotel was very reasonably priced for what you get. And you can't ask for a better location! I am not bothered if its is \"outdated.\" I am not buying the place, I am simply renting it for a short period of time. We paid for a garden view room and we actually got a partial ocean view room which was a nice surprise! The ONLY problem I had with this hotel was the bed was very uncomfortable. But, that wasn't really a problem because we were so tired from the day's activities that we both slept well. We did get the breakfast package and I thought it was really good! It was nice to get up and go right to breakfast everyday. We ate in the TikKi Terrace one night for dinner and the food was also very good. They do have entertainment every night, but we really didn't sit down and watch any of the shows. You are also very close to Whaler's Village, which is a shopping area with a few restaurants. You can walk there from the hotel. Also, Lahaina is very close. This is where a lot of the shops and restaurants are. It takes about five minutes by car from the hotel. We had a car the whole time as well which was nice because we drove everywhere! We didn't have to take any tours because we had a car. If you have a car, definitely wake up at 2am and go and see the sunrise at Haleakula. Amazing! The road to Hana was very pretty as well, but if you get motion sickness or car sickness do not do it! Its $9 per day to park the car (w/o valet), but all of the hotels charge for this. In short, if you are like me, a practical person, who just wants a clean and quiet place to stay where you are not on top of other guests and also appreciate great customer service and a great location, then stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel.

Regardless, when we make a return visit, we will definitely stay at KBH again.

Was originally going to stay at the Sheraton Hotel until I read reviews that you needed a packed lunch to get from your room to the pool and restaurant. We booked an oceanfront room with breakfast in the Kaua'i wing which had been renovated not that long ago. The room was more than adequate with 2 queen size beds on the 4th floor of 6 floors. The breakfast buffet was very good and the meals in the Tiki Terrace restaurant at night we exceptional. There was also free Hawaiian entertainment. We decided we should try a different restaurant at least once and went to the Cane and Taro at the Whaler's Village but found it not as good at the Tiki Terrace. In the foyer area in the mornings there was a small \"market\" set up with local people selling locally made souvenirs and clothes. The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is only a short stroll to a fantastic area for swimming and snorkelling. There is also a kiosk where you can hire all the snorkelling equipment. Another plus is that if you want to do a cruise the catamaran pulls up right at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. There is a free shuttle bus which connects all the hotels to the Whaler's Village shopping centre. However walking along the beach is a very pleasant experience and it only takes about 10 minutes tops to get to the shops. From the Whaler's Village you can catch the local bus for about $2.00 and this will take you to the historic town of Lahaina which is definitely worth a visit. We played golf on the Royal Ka'anapali Course after 1pm when the rate was discounted by 50%(also club hire 50% discount) The views were fabulous. Can recommend the Polynesie Cirque du Soleil which performs in the grounds of the Hyatt Hotel. the Hyatt Hotel's foyer is definitely worth a look.

We especially liked the show they hold on Tuesdays and Saturdays ... it was like a free luau and the performers were terrific. The Tiki Bar was my favorite bar on the Island. Dale, Chantel, Sue, the Tiki Bar bartenders, are so friendly and they make great drinks. The Tiki Terrace has an incredible Sunday Brunch that I recommend to all! Lastly, location of KBH is awesome. If you like to Snorkel, Black Rock is steps away up the beach. We saw tons of tropical fish, many turtles, and even some Spotted Ray's.

They also have a bar and a whale shaped pool.

I know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be used to it, but I still felt a bit sorry for him! One thing I really appreciated after having been travelling for over a week was that they had a coin operated laundry in that building. It has one washing machine and two dryers. The dryers were not super (we split up our one washing machine load between them to get our clothes dry), but still better than nothing. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to do the cultural activities, but they looked interesting. We did attend the lei farewell ceremony, which was really lovely but if you are from Australia be aware that you cannot bring your Kukui nut leis back home - quarantine will take them and destroy them. So you can still take you lei from the hotel if you like, but you will only get to enjoy it while in Hawa'i. Below is a list of pros & cons for the hotel. Pros: Good location (nice beach area). Friendly & attentive staff. Clean and neat rooms. Free live shows of an evening and cultural activities. Laundry facilities. Close to shops (Whalers Village). Lovely lei farewell ceremony (optional).

I loved the KBH bag! It came in very handy for our many shopping excursions! This resort is in a perfect location and the grounds are immaculate. The rooms were pretty decent size with a coffee maker and a frig to keep our soda and beer cold! My one and only complaint is that it was always quite late in the day before housekeeping would come. More times than not, the housekeeper would leave behind half full cups of water that were sitting on the night stand, or on the table on the patio. My friend and I are both smokers, so would empty the astray into a bag, so as not to stink up the room. That bag was left outside on the patio and not removed.

Having read reviews of this hotel before going we were expecting it to be smaller and the staff to be a lot friendlier, not just when it was time to pay a bill and they wanted a tip. The restaurant receipts have a tip calculator but for a buffet breakfast where the price is included in the room rate I resent being recommended to tip 17-23%, all the server did was bring a coffee pot to the table, clear 2 plates and bring the bill. I know tipping is different in the states to the UK but at a recommended minimum of $4.76/day (for 2 of us) this is big extra on the cost of a hotel. As this was a honeymoon we were informed by our travel agent that we would get a room upgrade and some kind of welcome gift (champagne or similar) but neither of these materialised and when we told any of the staff that it was our honeymoon we received glazed looks that assured us that we were no more special than the other hundreds of guests.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201c1 Week at Kaanapali Beach Hotel in Maui\u201d", "Author": "agabbymama11", "ReviewID": "UR120018236", "Content": "Three generations (myself, my daughter and my granddaughter) enjoyed a weeks stay on Maui, it was totally awesome. There was some construction going on next door at The Whaler, but KBH can't control that. My only complaint at all, was the food prices. It was terribly expensive to eat anywhere. McDonalds and Burger King were about the only economical places to eat. We did go to the grocery store for snacks and drinks in the room. There is a mini-refrigerator in the room that we made use of. We picked up all the magazines at the airport, with lots of 2 for 1 coupons, but most restaurants were located in Lahaina, so had to drive to them. And even with the coupons, it cost around $10 pp to eat. Our Garden View room had plenty of storage & closet space and was a good sized room for the three of us. Decor was typical Hawaiian. Clean and comfortable beds. And the grounds were clean. We didn't see one crawling insect in the room or on the grounds. There were gnats, flies and bees, but again KBH can't really control those. The staff was so warm and welcoming, always a smile and \"Aloha\". Guests ranged from newlyweds to families to older folks (like myself). The Hawaiian activities were a nice plus (lei making, hula dancing lessons, ukulele lessons, language lessons, weaving lessons, cultural walk, etc. They even had a Snuba demonstration in the pool (which Kayla loved). All free. They have a Children's Passport Program and if the child participates in all the free activities, they get a small gift for each and when their passport is full, they get a KBH t-shirt. And from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm they put on a Hula show every night free. You could order dinner or drinks or just sit and enjoy the show (Kayla danced the hula on-stage two different nights, she's really a ham). Every day from 8:00 am to 12:00 noon, they have local craft vendors in the lobby selling their wares. They have a free E-ticket kiosk for your boarding pass, and a small office area with two computers at 49 cents a minute for Internet access. They do have an activity desk, and they offer cabanas on the beach for a fee. A free Welcome Breakfast Buffet and a really nice \"Aloha\" Kukui nut lei Departure ceremony. They really make you feel wanted. And when you consider the neighboring hotels (Sheraton, Westin, Hyatt Regency) at $300+ per night for a garden view room, KBH at $149 was a real bargain. It's a 5 minute walk to Whaler's Village (lots of high end shops, Louis Vitton and Brighton as well as restaurants). And possibly the most beautiful beach right at the doorstep. Kaanapali Beach is a nice sandy strip of beach. We aren't much for the beach, prefer the pool (which was a nice size). No waterfalls or water slides, but Kayla loved it. She was always eager to go swimming the instant we returned to the hotel. Another thing I have to mention, that turns some folks off, but was a big plus for me, THEY ALLOW SMOKING. We had a ground floor room, with a lanai where I could smoke. And they have 4 smoking stations around the property, so I didn't feel like a leper.

Also, we went to the on-site restaurant the day we arrived. They had *only* a pre-fixed menu (for Valentines Day) AND they didn't tell us until 20 minutes after we had ordered that the non-red meat options were all sold out. Seriously!? I don't eat red meat; and they didn't have any vegetarian options or any chicken or seafood options. Only red meat left. And they waited a full 20 minutes after we had ordered to bother to tell me this. That was very disturbing. I had to ask for the manager and they came up with a meal option that was not on the menu....but it really took advocacy on my part to get them to offer that. The Beach location was great.

The rooms are nice, the staff is friendly, the beach is awesome. I love the kukui necklace that they give you upon your initial stay. When you stay with them again, they take your necklace and replace one of the brown kukui nuts with a white one. It's a simple little thing, but my wife and I always make sure that we pack our necklaces when we head to Maui. My only complaint is that when you go to there evening hula show and musical performance, they will not let you bring your own bottles of water. That's a bit ridiculous considering that we spend between $2500-3000 every time to stay at this hotel. My wife usually drinks water but I ALWAYS order a few mixed drinks, so they are getting money from us during the show. This is an outdoor show that many can watch from their balconies, yet if you are sitting in the serving area, they will not let you bring water (EVEN IF YOU PURCHASED THAT WATER AT THE HOTEL). That seems a bit ridiculous and petty. This hotel obviously treats there workers well, because there is very little turnover. We've been going to this hotel over the last 10 years and see many of the same workers that we saw our first time in 2001.

We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel and were really pleased with it. It has an intimate feel and it literally only takes you 5 minutes to walk out of your room and hit the beach. The room that we stayed in had a lanai (I think they all do) and you could sleep with the sliding door open and listen to the ocean and the breeze in the palms. We had family staying at the hotel as well and the 3 rooms varied slightly. My mom and sisters had a room in the same building but on the 1st floor and they said our pillows and mattress were much better. I think our room was 216. Ours was a \"pool view\" on the second floor of the Molokai section. We couldn't actually see the pool but that was fine for us. We spent most of our time on the beach or out in town. The hotel has a convenience store in the lobby area which sells beer and wine, a great alternative for people who don't want to buy a beer for $7. Rooms come with refrigerators as well so you can store your groceries. This hotel is a little outdated and if you are used to staying in mega-hotels, you will probably not like this one. I am the type of traveler who enjoys having a more authentic, close to the roots experience and KBH offers that in spades. After Maui, we went to Oahu and stayed at a 5 star hotel that was huge. It was just not as enjoyable to me and I felt like just another number rather than a valued guest. It took forever to get from our room, down the elevator, down the escalator, through the shopping area and finally out to the beach. One final aspect that was really nice is that our package came with a breakfast buffet everyday. That was great because you can pop down and get some of Hawaii's delicious fresh fruit as well as the typical buffet fare. The food isn't mind blowing but it's a real money and time saver and we really appreciated that.

But it was very convenient to the race start and finish at nearby Whaler's Village so we took a chance and booked a partial ocean view room with breakfast buffet. We were delighted with our 6th floor room that had a more generous ocean view than we expected, and discovered that our friends had referred us for a free upgrade. The hotel is located on the pretty beach, with a hedge between its grounds and the sand. Its gardens are stunning, but very natural (without the Disneyland quality of the nearby big-name chain hotels). Every day I selected a fallen plumeria bloom or two to tuck behind my ear. We enjoyed the nightly Hawaiian music, sometimes from our room's lanai, and took advantage of the on-site Tiki Bar and Tiki Terrace restaurant, where we sampled the traditional healthier Hawaiian Diet for dinner one evening. The breakfast buffet was generous and good, with fresh fruit, hot dishes (eggs, quiches, pancakes, delicious bread pudding, etc) and Japanese selections (miso soup, rice, etc). Many of the staff are very caring and down-to-earth people, some are local Hawaiians, who have been with the hotel for years.They are educated with the traditional culture of Hawaii and share their knowledge and experience with guests in complimentary classes and demonstrations. My husband signed up for an ukelele playing class and I took classes in lei making and lauhala weaving; all were excellent, small group experiences that contributed immensely to our visit. Finally, on our last morning we participated in the farewell ceremony when each guest receives a gift of a handmade kukui nut lei from staff member Malihini, who taught my lei classes. She explained how the ceremony was initiated after the 9/11 tragedy when guests were stranded there, and both staff and guests realized they are all part of one family.

Aswell as shops, bars and restaurants galore! We ate at kimos for my partners birthday, outside, it was lovely and great food!

The vibe here is quiet and chill, they have a gorgeous courtyard of grass and trees and a pool. We usually hung by the pool where there is both shade and sun and lots of little birds and plumeria, and walked the 50 feet to the ocean to play in the waves. The KBH is located near the end of a strip of about 5 hotels, and there is a boardwalk that you can walk up and down and visit the different restaurants and shopping and most of all jump in the other hotel pools ;). Everyone is generally really cool and happy and it was always great to walk back to the most chill of all hotels and hang by our pool.

Complimentary safe, parking was $9 per day self parking which was not bad for Hawaii. Internet was available but at a cost although you could print boarding passes up for free in the lobby. The guest services staff was exceptional! Loads of free activities with supplies provided, such as lei making, note card making, ukelele lessons, hula lessons, garden tour, and children had a special passport with activities for them as well. Free sunset hula show each evening with local talent...Exceptional!!!! Thank you to my lovely hula teacher and patient lei making teacher as well. :-) Every staff member treated you like special guests and made us feel right at home. Most beautiful beach with snorkeling right there. Towels available right near the beach. Beautiful sunsets at this spot!! Paved walkway along the beach to the Whalers Village with a free museum and lots of beautiful shops. This makes it possible for even wheelchair bound clients to enjoy strolling along the beach. Prices in hotel gift shop and lobby were reasonable. Non-Smoking property but plenty of safe areas for smokers that were not intrusive. Lawn and garden area is kept spotless! Staff come out and pick up all debris from trees and bushes each morning. The day you leave they hold a special farewell ceremony for you and present you with a beautiful kukui seed lei to keep and add to on each visit. We had a package that included breakfast buffet each day which saved us a lot on food. Lahaina (with the historical banyan tree in the Courthouse square filling the entire corner) wide is a short $1 ride away and well worth visiting. Many free parking spots in Lahaina and we always found one quickly. good restaurants at reasonable prices there too. The beach at this resort is one of the prettiest I have seen.

We had the most amazing view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was worth every penny.

We used Trilogy for our 2 sailing trips around the island. They are the company the hotel recommends and they have an office almost on the hotel grounds by the beach. We sailed to Monakini to snorkel and on the way home we visited turtle town and snorkeled there also (we snorkeled with major sea turtles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so cool) We also took a trip with them to Lanai (an island close to Maui) and had a very nice day.

I suggest getting a room facing the interior grounds otherwise you may be facing The Whaler next door with extensive remodeling going on which is loud.

You can grab a couple lounge chairs and find a shady spot to relax, read, etc. This is a nice feature and not sure if other hotels in the area allow you to do this.

This was our SEVENTH yearly stay at this hotel, and hopefully not our last. Most of the Trip Advisor reviews are quite positive about this hotel, but a few recent negative ones need a response. The general consensus from reviewers is that the rooms are not as fancy as one might find down the beach. Do we honestly care that the rooms look like they are out of the 1970's??? Not at all!!! They are always clean, have the necessary furniture, towels, running water, a/c, etc.. We could care less that toothbrushes are not provided. In fact, in all of our travels to various hotels in the past few years, we have never seen toothbrushes provided. If you need a shower cap, try calling the front desk to see if they stock extras, or go to the deli/market located on the premises and buy one. One of the appeals of this hotel is that it offers great value, so I would not expect them to duplicate what the Outrigger on Oahu offers. The staff is most pleasant at this place, and everyone from the handyman to the maid to the front desk staff is always saying \"aloha\". Hotel grounds are immaculate and the bushes, trees, and flowers are gorgeous. We had specific requests, too, like for a king bed and a non-smoking floor. They have always honored these requests, but we are told up front that as much as they will try, they cannot promise with 100% certainty. Anyone who runs a hotel understands that various factors prevent absolute guarantees such as these. Our breakfast was \"complimentary\", that is, we received daily coupons for the buffet. This was included in the price of our room, but you had to reserve a room with this option included. If you didn't, then of course you won't get a free breakfast! Just know what you are reserving ahead of time, and there won't be a problem at check-in. And finally, we found the front desk staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. During our entire stay, we felt we were treated royally. This hotel is a true gem in a perfect location. If you want a hotel with fancy everything and thousands of other guests, stay elsewhere. If you want a clean, safe, and secure environment, fewer crowds, and don't want to pay exorbitant prices for \"fluff\", then stay at this beautiful Hawaiian hotel.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maui, Hawai", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a relaxing getaway\u201d", "Author": "Maui Coconut", "ReviewID": "UR116881871", "Content": "Though we live on Maui, we decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by booking a weekend getaway to the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. It turned out to be so much more than we expected. We had a room in the Kauai wing that overlooked the courtyard and a bit of an ocean view. The room was large and it was nice to have a fridge/coffeemaker. The bathroom is pretty small but the tub/shower itself was roomy and everything was well maintained. Loved the fact that the room amenities (soaps/lotion etc) were all made in Hawaii. Best part is that the rooms are steps from the ocean, no need to take a long walk through a lobby, past a restaurant etc in order to get to the beach. The location of the hotel is fantastic as the swimming/snorkeling right off the beach is wonderful. The other plus is the fact that their courtyard area is peaceful and relaxing with sunny/shady options for lounging. Yep, there's no pool slide or water bridges but that also means no fighting for lounge chairs, no being elbow to elbow with other guests or inhaling someone elses sunscreen spray. You can actually find a lounge chair you like, take it to a perfect spot and take a nap or have a private conversation - a nice surprise! There is a giant checker board in the courtyard and a pingpong table that families seem to be enjoying. Though our kids weren't with us , we thought about how that would be a much better option than the pay-for-play TV video games we've seen at other hotels. Another surpise, the staff was so friendly - seems that everyone was saying \"hello\" as we walked by - even the gardener who was kneeling in the plants looked up as we walked by. After a long day at the beach we grabbed snacks from the Tiki Grill - they were fast and food was good. We were there on Friday/Saturday and found they have free entertainment on Friday evenings so we had dinner at the Tiki Terrace and hung around a while to watch the show. It was music/hula with a local flavor. It was like a luau show (minus the firedancer) without a luau price. Can't beat it - for free! There was a good crowd watching the show - seemed like some folks walked over from neighboring hotels. If you choose not to eat at the hotel - it is an easy walk to Whaler's Village or neighboring hotels. We had breakfast at Cane & Taro twice and a dinner at Westin's Tropica. While our dinner at the Westin was wonderful, as we walked around the Westin we decided our weekend \"home\" at Kaanapali Beach was much more comfortable. If you need brass, glass, marble, stuffy shirts and lots of \"things\" to make your vacation special - perhaps you aren't a good match for this hotel. However, if you're looking for somewhere to really connect with a spouse or your family - a place where you can truly relax among nice people in comfortable surroundings,I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself as much as we did.

Its not as modern as its surrounding hotels buts thats what we were looking for. Ask for a pool or sea view room though! The location is perfect. Right near everything you need. The next town is only $1 on the bus and theres plenty to do and see. I would recommend hiring a car and seeing all the waterfalls and swimming in them, its cheaper and more personal than doing excursions to see them with loads of people. The beach is amazing and i could not believe you can swim with giant sea turtles everyday right on our doorstep. They turn up around black rock around 4pm everyday to feed and are amazing to swim with. The food at the hotel is great at the tiki grill by the pool but we only ate at the main restaurant once as its not brilliant and there are plenty of others that are much better only a few minutes stroll away.

The rooms are well kept, and the food is great, .The free nightly show is better then the one I paid $150.00 at the the Hilton in Waikiki.

Also, this hotel has many things going for itincluding the grounds, pool, beach,and if you book an oceanfront room as I did, the roaring surf will lull you to sleep, and when morning comes, the views from the room are truly amazing. My complaint, and I hope management reads this as well as the other 45 negative reviews, is with the front desk management and check in. I did not find the Aloha spirit with neither the male manager, nor the woman who checked me in. My request for a king size bed was not honored, nor was the complimentary breakfast honored too. If you read the guest services book it clearly states breakfast and orientation is included free. Management did nothing to smooth over this incident. And now to the owner of the hotel... You cannot run a hotel as if it is going out of business. Cutting back on small details such as one coffee pod per day, not honoring the complimentary breakfast orientation, holding back on bathroom products, such as no toothbrush, no shower cap, etc,. Please take a hint from the Outrigger Hotel in Waikiki, and read about how people rave about having these things. And, as for dinner. The food is above excellent, yet for two people serving one roll for dinner, and no more, shows you are watching the bottom line, and cutting back too much. As for the rooms, I believe some or all the complaints from others are real, and perhaps you should think about upgrading.

The Hawaiian music and hula dancers, especially watching the children, were enjoyable. The night of our anniversary we went on a dinner cruise. The food was good, not exceptional, but the ride itself and watching the amazinng sunset was well worth it. We rented a car which is definitely needed on Maui and intended on driving the famous Road to Hana. After speaking with other people, they suggested going with a tour and I'm so glad we did. We were picked up at our hotel early in the morning and returned almost 11 hours later. The driver was well informed, made numerous stops along the way, lunch was included and we spent the day with very nice people from other states, from Paris andeven Australia. We are so glad we let someone else do the driving, there are a lot of uneven and winding roads. It's a great trip, you really get to see Maui with the beautiful waterfalls and flowers. We did drive ourselves to see the Haleakala sunrise. Driving in the middle of the night, up this winding mountain 10,000 feet definitely is an experience. It's quite cold up there, a jacket and a blanket from our room barely kept us warm but feeling like you are on top of the world, watching the sun to come up was amazing. Don't know if I would do it again, but glad I did. I got to also spend my birthday on Maui, going to the Old Lahaina Luau. Very authentic and very entertaining. It was a wonderful evening.

Property: You can tell that Ka'anapali is a privately owned hotel. They keep the property maintained, not too many frills, but it's Hawaii.... not many frills are needed! Only downfall is that I stayed in one of the older buildings on the 4rd floor without an elevator. I'm 30 and so is my husband, so it wasn't too big a deal for us to lug our suitcases up... but definitely would use the belldesk if needed. It can be a bit of a walk and climb to your room. Parking: $9/day... what a deal. Property all over Hawaii doesn't come by cheap, so when I heard parking was under $10 a day... I knew I was going to rent a car. Rates: You can't beat the rates at this place. For the location, quality and price, I was very pleased. Yes you can stay at resorts that cost more, but you're in Hawaii, I basically used my room as a place to store my belongings and sleep. Aside from that I was always out and about.

The hotel buildings were a lot less personal and inviting than we'd thought and are very much in need of a renovation.

We advice future travelers to save their money for the hotel breakfast and instead have breakfast either in Waling village which is just around the corner, or drive to Lahaina.

Our room was downstairs facing the outside rim of the property with a small patio and was private. There is another resort next door but there are trees and plantings separating the properties. We could simply walk out the back patio and then down several rooms to the beach. Like most resorts in Maui, you have to pay for beach lounges, which was somewhat annoying. But, no other fees around the resort. The pool area was nice for small kids but it was a simple, shallow pool. Bigger kids would probably want water slides and more exciting water activities. But there is the beach! The food at the restaurants was good and the magic show was very nicely done. We loved hanging out in the evening with live music and the kids danced their hearts out.

From the minute we got to the hotel I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore. It all started when the bellman got a ticked off by the amount of luggage he had to carry in. His exact quote was \"you guys come prepared don't you?\" Well if he was traveling 6000 miles for 2 weeks then he'd understand that whether you like it or not, you bring everything. When we got to the desk, they were pleasant enough and we did get our room right away (I guess that's my nice thing to say) BUT then we got to the room. Right away the musty smell overpowered us. We couldn't escape it. Then we noticed that about 15 years ago this was probably a decent hotel. It needs severe updating or at least new bedspreads. Some people would have complained (usually me) but after 13 hours on a plane, a 6 hour time difference and pure exhastion we figured hey, it's only for one night (we were moving to the Grand Wailea the next day but they had no rooms available for us that night) Then came the sheets...dingy and I hate to say this, they smelled like wet dog. Take that back: dirty wet dog. My dog smells like lavender after her bath. The next day, knowing we were leaving, my husband & daughter went to the pool while I packed up our dirty clothes, toiletries, etc. The smell was so overwhelming that I actually got sick (and no, I am no fragile flower, I'm from Jersey, need I say more?) I couldn't wait to get the heck out of there. I too am a firm believer in location, location, location but in this case location is the only thing this hotel has got going for it. And you shouldn't base your hotel on location alone. There are a lot \"dives\" in great locations. You want to know that when you get your room it's at least clean when you first walk in. What happens while you're occupying it is your business. So I honestly cannot give this hotel a good review, and to be honest with you, if you can avoid it, do so. If you are one these people that says \"oh, I'm only there to sleep and shower\" then maybe this is a good choice for you, especially if you like sleeping on a wet dog.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cEverything people have said is true, both good and bad.\u201d", "Author": "PiscesLosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR115873097", "Content": "We just got back from staying at KBH and I have to say I agree with all the reviews. I think for the price, this is one of the best places to stay. I like avoiding all the one-ups-manship that can happen in upscale hotels (get enough of that in Los Angeles). But there are some downers... The bad: -The facility is definitely a tired one (the bar/restaurant area is screaming for a rehab; it's very worn out and can be a bit of turn off to staying for the entertainment). -Parking garage is dirty, and tight, so drive carefully if you park yourself. -While not at the Motel 6 level, you definitely feel that you are on the downscale side of hotels. -The Mixed Plate Restaurant is listed on all the hotel info, but has been closed for two years according to the lady in the hotel's market. The good: -We were in two different rooms due to a loud child next door in our first room (not the child's fault, he was on mainland time, which translated to loud chatter at 3:00 in the morning). The front desk was extremely helpful in changing our room. The second room seemed to fresher than the first, so it's possible that there is some replacement of worn drapery etc. that happens. -The breakfast buffet was much more than adequate. The coffee was good, there were many choices in juices and fresh fruits, the hot foods were just fine. -The daily craft items for sale in the lobby were quite interesting and handy for souvenirs. The GREAT: -The staff was wonderful. Malahini was delightful (she does lovely hula dancing, and teaches you how to cut pineapples, string leis, hula dance); Michelle at the front desk was cheery and helpful. The concierge lady (sorry I don't know her name) was helpful with info. The restaurant was well run with constant service. The rooms are cleaned promptly and efficiently. -The beach was one of the best of all the hotels in Kaanapali Beach Resort area. The beach rental stand was very fairly priced, for snorkel equipment, boogie boards, cabanas, etc. -LOCATION! A short walk to all the other hotels and shopping at Whaler's Village. Check out the Sunset Cliff Diving ceremony at the Sheraton. It's a fun time to watch the torch bearer run through the bar area lighting torches and stopping for posed photos. Fun! Oh, and a short drive to Lahaina, with lots of shopping, restaurants, and historical sites. All in all, if you want to spend your money on luxurious settings, this is not the place for you.

Very good bed, plenty of pillows, great air conditioner, and featured a small but sufficient deck overlooking the pool area. (Package also included daily buffet breakfast which again, we found to be quite good. Fresh fruit platters, replenished every few minutes, mild and tasty bread pudding, crisp bacon, again replenished every few minutes, fresh juices, salmon, noodles, rice, pastries, etc. True, it's not Merriman's - but I'd give it a solid \"B\" for a daily buffet, and I'm pretty picky. The coffee was the only thing I'd complain about a little - it was a bit bitter. We ate a few times at the poolside grill, which for relatively inexpensive bar fare (hot dogs with grilled sweet Maui onions, a tasty sandwich of eggplant, grilled sweet red pepper/balsamic vinegar sauce on pita bread) was good. Here's the thing: this is not a place to go to feel \"pampered\", if to you that means granite countertops in the bathroom, marble entryways and a snotty staff. I only encountered one staff member who probably either needs coaching (you're here to help customers, not drink coffee) or to be let go. She seemed quite young, perhaps her first job? In any case, every other person I met smiled, was friendly, kind, generous and sincere (again - I notice these things). What you will find here is a large, grass-covered property, right on a lovely swimming beach, within walking distance to much of Ka'anapali. You'll enjoy an abundance of lounge chairs which you are free to drag anywhere on-site, to your own little shady, tree-encircled oasis. You'll find a campy little place called \"The Tiki Bar\". True, you won't find an acres-spanning pool, but listen: we walked to The Westin one morning, with its much-touted never-ending pool, and the place felt like a loud, crowded gymnasium: kids running everywhere (yes, even inside, in the lovely marble entryway halls), yelling, throwing fruit at the poor caged tropical birds, throwing balls across the pool passageways and loungechairs on the pool deck, gaaaa.

Decided on this hotel based on a friend's stay a couple of years ago. We basically showered and slept here and relaxed on the beach a couple of afternoons during our 6-night stay, so the proximity to the beach and pool from our ocean-view room was great. The pool was a bit small. The rooms and baths are a bit small for more than 2 people in a room so we were glad we had the 2 adjoining rooms. The rooms and bath were clean and linens were fresh. There was a slight 'beach musty' smell when we first walked in, but I didn't notice it after the first day. It was nice to open the patio door and sit on the lanai (small) early in the morning with coffee. A condo might have been a better option, but we had a good AAA rate which included breakfast, and there was a refrigerator in the room for chilling drinks and snacks. The location is also good as we could take the short walk to Whaler's Village for shopping or eating out. We mostly were on other parts of the island for lunch or dinner and only ate the buffet a few mornings. It was OK but became tiresome after a couple of days. Fruit was always good, and we don't feel we have to eat everything offered on the buffet just because it's there. My grand-daughter ordered a waffle and they happily made one for her. We could also order eggs cooked to order for a small extra charge. Like most everything else in Hawaii, things are expensive (self-parking, internet, etc) so you just have to be prepared for that. We are an active bunch and enjoyed snuba diving, the Haleakala sunrise and biking down the mountain, and zip lines among other things.

You could hear people in nearby rooms talking and using the toilet and showering at all times of the day and night. The resort has nice gardens and very close to the beach. The food at the snack bar wasn't great and the hot chips (fries) were absolutely horrible and I threw them in the bin. Breakfast here was buffet style and served in two different places. The variety wasn't too bad but the quality of the most of the food was highly undesirable. The quality could of been better and I am not usually that fussy but most of the food was so mass produced, so oily, fatty and just overall poor quality. Some of it was ok. The service at breakfast time was hit and miss depending on who you get. We had one waitress that asked us what we wanted to drink and when we ordered it we never got it even after requesting it 3 times. In the end we gave up and asked someone else.

The hotel was everything we had hoped for. We paid the lowest price and got a wonderful garden view. Next time we would pay a little more and get a pool or ocean view, but it really didn't matter because we just wanted to be outside all the time. We didn't use the pool because we love the ocean, but the kids there seemed to love it. The beds were very comfortable and the room clean and fresh every day. The staff was very welcoming and helpful whenever we had a question. The free (first morning only) breakfast was very delicious and the information time afterwards gave us lots of help on how to spend our week. Our favorite activity was snorkling out at the black rock, just steps away in front of the next hotel. We saw large turtles (everyday!!) and lots of colorful fish. We just couldn't get enough of it!! There were people of all ages going out to snorkle. One recommendation is that if you are not a good swimmer, a flotation devise is advised. My husband rescued a man that was drowning because he was too exhausted to make it to shore. We purchased cheap swimming \"noodles\" and felt like we could be out there all day if we wanted (and we consider ourselves strong swimmers). We also purchased cheap chairs and an umbrella from a store in Lahaniah. It was well worth the $ because then we did not have to pay a daily fee to rent. It was no problem to take them home with us on the airplane (just a small extra luggage fee). Bring your own beach towel from home. Because we did not stay in a condo, we had to buy all our meals which became quite expensive. If we would come back to Maui with our children, we would consider a condo property, just so that we would have the choice of eating in or out. But we would still try to be close to the Black Rock. As it turned out we bought muffins and fruit, juice and milk, pop and beer, crackers, cheese and snacks at a grocery store in Lahania. This really helped to cut some costs. Each room has a small fridge and coffee maker. It is very worth your while to rent a vehicle. We were so glad we did. We went back and forth from our hotel to Lahainah many times for eating and great shopping. And for travelling around the island site seeing. For free internet and a nice place to eat breakfast or a smaller meal, go to CJ's it is just up the hill from the hotel. The front desk can give directions. They also pack lunches in a cooler for you with a refundable deposite for the cooler. It was great! We went on a day trip and were so glad we had it along so that we could eat anywhere. The whalers village was a few hotels down the other way from the black rock. It was great for shopping (I bought all my gifts there!), having ice cream, restaurants for dinner, ABC store for those forgotton items and so much more. Our hotel had wonderful entertainment each night. Our favorite was when the group of girls ages 5 - 20 came out to the stage. They put on such a wonderful show of dancing and music. Each night there was lots of singing and dancing from sundown at 6:45 well into the evening. If that was the only evening entertainment that we did we would have been happy. We went out a few nights to other places and felt like we had missed out! We went through some of the more expensive properties along the beach, and we were still so very happy with the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel.

We have also traveled quite a lot and have experienced many levels of service. We were sorely disappointed with the service at this property, so much so that we changed hotels the night we checked in. I read the TA reviews of this hotel and based on the mostly positive responses decided to stay here. We hadn't stayed at Kaanapali for a number of years and this place has always intrigued me. I was very taken with the \"most Hawaiian hotel\" marketing. I was pleased to get a good AAA rate of $214/night including breakfast. We arrived about 12:30, 3 hours before check-in time. We were greeted by a bellman who asked if we were checking in when we pulled up to the lobby. No \"aloha\" or welcome. The lobby is 1960's chic;small with low ceilings and numerous people in various states of attire milling about. We stood in line behind a velvet rope to check in with the one person at the front desk. When it was our turn we were told by the poor overworked young woman that our room wasn't ready yet and we should go get lunch or wander around until we received a call. Fair enough as we were 3 hours early for check-in. We ate lunch, went shopping, talked with one of the concierges and 2 hours later our room still wasn't ready. By the way, the concierge told us that the whole beach was at 60% occupancy. So why wasn't there a room available for us? Maybe they didn't have enough staff? Finally, after checking at about 3:00 we were given a room. We dragged our wheelies over to the partial ocean view room and were unpleasantly surprised to find 2 beds, not a king as requested. We also found that we could see the ocean if we went out on the balcony (this was no lanai) and leaned over. Pretty steamed, I called the front desk and said this would not do. To make a painfully long story short, after being told the only king room available was on the 2nd floor (including any ocean view rooms which we were willing to upgrade to) we ended up asking to talk with the manager on duty. She told us that based on our room request (quiet, away from elevators and ice machine and a king bed) they decided that quiet was more important than the bed size (we had also told them this was our 35th anniversary)! We opted to try the 2nd floor room (which had the possibility of carrying in noise from the people walking by outside) but we had to wait for that to be inspected by whoever at housekeeping. The manager gave us some drink tickets so we sat at the outside bar with our suitcases waiting for the call to tell us the room was ready. We had the possibility of changing to a 4th floor room the next day if this room turned out to be too noisy for us. We finally got into the room sometime after 4:00 and unpacked. It was a basic motel room, nothing fancy with a balcony which actually had more of an ocean view that the 4th floor room. However, once we opened the doors we got to hear our neighbors shouting from the lawn to their roommates so it wasn't too pleasant. Also, the bare chested guy who leaned his gut against the front desk podium wasn't too appealing either. And did I mention that while we were waiting in the lobby I got up from a couch to find my butt was all wet because someone in a wet suit apparently sat there before me (I'm hoping!). Oh, and one of the concierge's cell phone went off while she wasn't near it and that made kind of a racket too. So, most Hawaiian hotel on Maui or whatever they claim? I don't think so. Relaxing? Not at all. Aloha spirit? Couldn't find it. That evening we stopped by the Napili Kai Beach Resort where we last stayed 10 or 11 years ago. We were warmly welcomed by the two front desk people and were told they could help us in just a few minutes while they finished checking in some folks. The mere act of acknowledging our presence was a refreshing difference between this property and the KPH. Because the rates were higher I didn't consider staying here when planning our trip. Luckily, they had available rooms and we ended up switching hotels that night. The rest of our vacation couldn't have been more relaxing.

It's very simple, shaped like a whale, not very big, not jacuzzi. Also, I think it's comparable with other hotels, but they hit you with hidden fees every chance they get. If you use the safe, it costs ~$2.5/day. We didn't know this until we got our bill at the end of the week. We explored the other hotels in this area, and next time we'll probably opt to spend a little more and stay at either the Sheraton or Westin. We ate at the restaurant once, only because the service was so terrible. The food was really good, but even though it wasn't crowded when we were there, dinner took around 2-2.5 hours.

We went the \"Welcome\" get together breakfast expecting to be pitched and it wasn't that all. They just gave us information and discounts that we would not have otherwise recieved. From this presentation we bought a couple of excrusions but the best part was getting discounted tickets for the Kupanaha Magic Show. We really enjoyed this and it was top notch. I've seen a lot of Vegas act Magic shows and this was as good if not better because you were closer to the action and Jody Baran is a fun and personable entertainer. The food was average but it was a bonus as the act alone was worth the money. The fact that you could walk to the Whaler's Village was a huge plus for us. It is so nice to walk the beach anyway but to have your desitination be such a great shopping and restaurant area was a plus. We used Trip Advisor to pick where we ate so we ate at Leilani's on the Beach twice in the lower Beachside Grill and loved it both times. It's less expensive, easier to get into and we saved our nice meal money for Mama's Fish House. Other things we liked was the close parking to our room. Don't need to valet park (we found that out after paying for it and when we told the front desk they gave us a refund). Easy to get the little mini-cabana lounge chairs. I went early as advised but on any day we saw extra chairs available. Tip your cabana boy (man). We loved hearing the Hawaiian music every night from their little stage area by the Tiki Terrance. Nice little shows from local musicians and dancers. So, stay here if you like Hawaiian atmosphere and a great beach location. But don't stay here if you like the quiet, smuggness of the Westin or the crowds and rat race of the Grand Wailea.

We would definitely stay there again. Here's the main reasons why: KBH is right on Kaanapali Beach. This is one of the nicer beaches in Maui - that means no rocks or stinging jelly fish - only bright white sand and blue water. This is probably the number one reason we'd stay again (that, and the price). The grounds are gorgeous and the pool is a good size. You can grab a beach lounger and pick a spot anywhere on the grounds - shady or sunny, near the beach or near the pool and relax. Compare this to the Whaler next door whose swimming pool is the size of a postage stamp and all the loungers are crammed in around it. The staff were very friendly. I didn't pass one without a smile and an \"Aloha\". Our room was comfortable and perfect for travelers who are there to see Maui and don't want to spend too much time in or money on a hotel. We didn't even pay for a room with a view (cheapest option) and even though the lanai directly faced the hotel next door, with just a quarter turn to the left you could see the ocean. I spent a lot of time on the lanai. Ample parking at $9 a day. The Whaler next door charged $11 and our friends staying there often had difficulty finding a spot because the owners on the condo side of the Whaler leave their cars there all year round. We didn't eat at the restaurants, but our friends ate at the Tikki Terrace and said the food was incredible. Expect to pay ~$25 an entree though. The other great thing is that it's just a short 5 minute walk to Whaler's Village. Shops and restaurants galore! Be sure to eat at Leilani's on the patio and try the double kobe burger. You could skip the barefoot bar at the restaurant next door though - the food wasn't great and even though it seems novel to eat in the sand with your shoes off, it's really more hassle than it's worth. Also - be sure to stop in at YogurtLand. We went there 3 times during our stay! There were a few things that didn't bother us, but that might bother others. We didn't have a tub in our room - only a stand up shower. They gave us 2 double beds - but may have switched us to a room with a queen if we had asked. Local calls were $.75 and they charged us to use the safe. Also, internet was ~$10.00 a day. We got around this by using WiFi hotspots around the area. The Molokai building does not have an elevator (not sure about the other buildings). Only 3 flights, but keep this in mind if you have mobility issues. Otherwise, if you are planning on going with the \"no view\" option, the Molokai building is probably the best way to get a partial view. Some of the other buildings overlook the parking lot. Oh yeah and there's entertainment every night. And they give you a free lei when you leave - one of the ones with the kukui nuts - so don't buy one as a souvenir.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay!\u201d", "Author": "snorkelgirl55", "ReviewID": "UR110290687", "Content": "My friends had been to Kaanapali Beach Hotel 20 years ago and wanted to go back.

The pool was large enough; plenty of beach chairs; towels; I was happy to find significant upgrades to rooms; breakfeast was fine and had variety (it was included in our package); LAHAINA is only 5-10 minutes away with its many shops and dining area (and all the tours you can book - even a ferry boat for a day trip to Lanai !). KBH is only 10 minuites from Kapalua Beach (a must see and great snorkeling), and Honoloa Bay also for snorkeling (but rocky). We recommend the trip up Haleakala but best to call ahead to ensure it is not too cloudy - for good views of the volcano valley). Also I recommend the visit to the Blow Hole just past Kapalua on the West/North area coast. It is not well advertised but ask - wear hiking shores and make your way doen the trail to the ocean - now at the Blow Hole there is also a heart carved right in the rock - great for pictures - ask for directions CONS: no jacuzz- -I'm not sure why KBH after so many years don't at least put in one large jacuzzi.

We had a great time and enjoyed the hotel despite a few annoyances. Even though the hotel wasn't perfect, we would stay here again because of the awesome location & price. We arrived at about 10:30pm and were hungry as we had not eaten dinner yet. We were disappointed to find that the hotel restaurant was closed, the hotel bar was no longer serving food, and the front desk clerk said he was unsure if we'd find any place open to eat at. We booked a room with a king sized bed, but were told that none were available. We were given a room with two twin sized beds for our first night. (How romantic for a honeymoon?) After we found our room we decided to wander down the beach to look for a place to eat. The hotel next door had a restaurant on the beach which was open and still serving food even though the desk clerk told us otherwise. They had us change rooms for the second day and offered no compensation for the inconvenience. The wing we stayed in did not have an elevator so we had to drag our luggage up the stairs. On the third day we found a fruit tray & champaign in our refrigerator which a family member had arranged to be sent to us upon arrival. It would have been nice to have this the first night. We were VERY pleased with the view from our room. When booking, we selected a \"garden view\" room which was the cheapest option, but we had a beautiful ocean view from our balcony. The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect. It is right on the beach with a beautiful view of the ocean. It is a short walk to Whaler's Village shopping center, which we visited every day. There is an ABC store there which was great for buying cheap snacks & souvenirs. I would highly recommend renting a car as the driving is very easy and relaxed. We also frequently drove to Lahaina town for shopping and dining. I HIGHLY recommend going to the welcome show!!! So much great info & yummy free breakfast! The magic show at the hotel was pretty neat. The magician gave us some great info about where the best shows & sites were. The hotel had live music every night and the tiki torches all lit up was very neat. The rooms were not bad at all. A bit outdated maybe but nothing that bothered me.

We'd been to the hotel nearly 20 years ago, and have since stayed at many other properties on Maui .. but I chose the KBH for specific reasons. You can basically get the ocean front room here for pretty much the same price as a room overlooking the parking lot at one of the more upscale resorts in Kaanapali. For us, there is nothing quite like falling asleep with the sliding doors open and the sound of the ocean waves hitting the shoreline. And waking up to the birds singing in the trees. I was OK with the fact that the bedspreads could be updated and the shower drained a little slowly. The room was clean. We all fell asleep listening to the ocean....it's hard to put a price on that! The grounds are spacious and lounge chairs are plentiful. We've been to high-end resorts with great pool areas, etc. .. but you have to rush to save a chair early in the day and then you're wedged in with hardly any room to move. At KBH .. you have this massive lawn area and you're free to pull a chair under a tree or wherever you want. It's lovely and perfectly relaxing. Our girls did the paddle surf lessons from the beach shack .. and loved it. They saw turtles, a monk seal, and many tropical fish right there at Black Rock. We walked over to Whaler's Village to eat a few times (Leilani's has their famous Hula Pie .. don't miss it!) and shop. Also walked down the foot path to the Hyatt Regency for their Drums of the Pacific Luau - - which was great. The valet parking was only $11.00 per day (unheard of for this area!) and the guys there were genuinely kind. The free classes (we did lei making, hula lessons, notecard making) are fun! The music each night ends by 9pm, hardly a nuisance. It's lovely!! The lobby area hasn't changed much in 20 years .. but who cares?! You walk through it occasionally, you're not sleeping in the lobby!

The hotel's location is good; easy walking distance to Whaler's Village with shopping and restaurants. Even the Hyatt - which is the last hotel to the south was not a particularly long walk. The hotel grounds are well maintained and there is a bar and a snack/grill place both located by the pool. The pool is adequate but nothing spectacular. When you stay at the KBH you are trading off hotel amenities for a lower room cost. So the pool is merely adequate; the restaurant is adequate; the hotel is clearly an older hotel but still maintained well. Parking for my rental car was $9/day with unlimited in and out. A surprise to me was that the hotel does not provide any chairs or lounges for use at the beach. Instead there is a 3rd party vendor there who charges a rental fee. During my stay the surf was breaking close in to shore, so no body surfing was possible. No wireless and a $10/day charge for internet access in the room via ethernet wire connection.

Overall we enjoyed our time there and you honestly cannot beat the price or the location, so I would recommend it for those reasons. However, if you are used to newer accommodations or higher-end items, this is not the place for you and you may be disappointed. The hotel prides itself on being Maui's most Hawaiian hotel, but I didn't feel that. It may be the most simple and down to earth one, but we met plenty of lovely folks from Maui at our other accommodation too. What we loved - the view and location!! We booked a pool view and had a gorgeous pool and ocean view to watch sunsets from - though every night standing by the pool or beach was typically where you'd want to be. Gorgeous sunsets. Easy walk to Whalers Wharf with restaurants and shops was a great plus - and they have a shuttle bus there for $1 that takes you into Lahaina - awesome deal! Cab fares are very expensive on the island. What we didn't like - I like newer feeling hotels. Everything was clean - it just felt very dated. Again, if you don't mind that, this is a great reasonable option. Also, I left a drawer full of clothes in our room. Totally my fault - when we moved to the next hotel later in the week I realized it immediately and called the KBH to have them check and just felt like it was more difficult than normal to do. I called Housekeeping - they said they hadn't found anything so I had to ask them to please go to the room and look in the drawer. Then I had to call back. Again, I would think they'd call me to say they found it. Again, my fault but higher end places would be going above and beyond to assist in my opinion. Sure enough they had it and put it in a bag for me which was nice (again, it was MY fault) - but then you compare that to excellent service (Ritz Kapalua) - who sent a driver at no cost down to the hotel to pick up my stuff for me and bring it back to my room.

On the hotel website, it advertises itself as Hawaii's Most Hawaiian Hotel. You will notice this fact the moment you walk into the lobby. There are many vendors selling Hawaiian goods like it was a bazaar or swap meet. It is a rather cheesy look and feel. We were put in a room in their Kauai building overlooking a construction site. I wasn't too concern about the view. The air conditioner didn't work because the sensors on the sliding door fell off. I wouldn't lean on the balcony railing because it was wobbly and seemed like it was ready to break off. The room was rather dark and just had a dirty feeling like a cheap motel. The Hawaiian quits they advertise on their beds appear very worn and needs replacement. There are old CRT tvs in the room. If you do not tell them you will NOT be using the safe in the room, they will automatically charge you a daily fee. You can use the safe at the front desk for free. Moreover, I had a room near the elevator so I could hear the elevator go up and down all night. The one good thing about how their property is setup is that we could always find parking and the parking structure is connected directly to the buildings so it was easy to walk to. The location is pretty good if you plan to stay on the west side of Maui. There is a beach walking path in front of the hotel. There is easy access to Black Rock (popular swimming/ snorkeling area) and a couple of strip malls for food, clothes and Hawaiian goods. Lahaina is about a 10 - 15 minute drive. Taxis are not easy to find so a car is essential if you plan to leave the area. The hotel is about 45 minutes from the airport. I hear it is about $100 taxi ride or a $50 shuttle fee but I am not sure since I rented a car. Overall, growing up on Oahu, I didn't enjoy the Ka'anapali Beach hotel at all.

We just returned from 5-day trip with our entire family. My husband and I along with 3 little kids booked our flight/hotel stay at KBH/rental car as a package through Costco Travel. We used Costco Travel for our honeymoon to Greece 6 years ago and were very pleased with all the accommodations and transportation arrangements made for the package. After reading mostly good reviews for KBH, we decided to buy the package. Meanwhile my parents and other family members booked condos at The Whaler next door. We were disappointed upon arrival to KBH. More disappointed when we saw our room. Then, after seeing the beautiful condos our relatives were staying at at The Whaler, we couldn't help but feel like we wasted our money on KBH. We can't believe Costco would put that out there. The KBH prides itself in being \"The most hawaiian hotel\" in kaanapali. Yes, it's lobby screams 1960's tiki hut with it's wood panelled walls and island furniture, in dire need of updating. Apparently, some of the rooms have been/are being updated, but it's just the luck of the draw which room you get. Unfortunately, we had an older room. Hard mattresses. Rough sheets that sounded like paper. One day, housekeeping did not get to our room and came by to apologize in the afternoon, \"Sorry we didin't clean your room, we got so busy with all the checkouts.\" Being a germaphobe, all I could think of was 'bedbugs'. I worried about my little ones playing on the beds, walking on the carpet, etc. It just wasn't homey enough or relaxing for our family with little ones. We've learned our lesson: that we're more comfortable in a condo with a small kitchen and a separate living space from the bedrooms. On the positive side, overall the staff was friendly and helpful. Guest services let us borrow a wheelchair for a few days without charge. The bartender at the pool bar was great and adored the kids. Our package stay came with free daily buffet breakfast for 2 at the restaurant. A nice perk, considering my husband and I didn't want to have to cook or do dishes while on vacation. The breakfast buffet spread varied daily but included a variety of fresh fruit, traditional American food (either pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage), traditional Hawaiian breakfast (either corned beef hash, sausage, grilled mahi mahi, pork), danishes, bread bar, cereal bar, and drinks--coffee, juices including tropical juices, milk, etc. Our kids have a ton of food allergies, and it was nice to have a variety of warm, hearty food that we could all eat and start our day off with. However, the breakfast does cost $14 per person, and we definitely would not have paid that on our own if we didn't have breakfast as part of the package. The location of KBH is amazing. We've stayed in northern Kaanapali and Kehei on past trips. This was the first time we stayed on this part of Kaanapali Beach and really loved it. Close to shopping, restaurants, beautiful beach, etc. Plus, our parents and relatives were just a walk away next door. They did use our pool because The Whaler did not have a kiddy pool for my nephew to use. So the kids did enjoy the KBH pool. You're also just a short drive to Lahaina, to grocery stores and other shopping, restaurants. Bottome line: it was an affordable travel package. but we got what we paid for.

Tikki Hut food - only tolerable and not a good value Parking - The parking spots in the garage are SO tiny, even a VW has a hard time parking without getting door dings. It's a nightmare every time to get into a spot. Fitness - There is no fitness facility at all, so if you do want to exercise, you have to pay to belong to the gym up the street. Keep that in mind as added expense. The Island Romance Package (or probably any package) - a complete ripoff. Be very careful on the fees and and the cost of the car.

A sign of this was when they had their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goodbye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ceremony. I think at one point this must have been a grand ceremony where the entire staff came out to sing goodbye to the guests and gave them leis\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it has been downgraded to one person singing along with a recording.

The buildings and d\u00c3\u00a9cor similar to what you would find in an average motel on the mainland. At no point during our stay did I feel like we were at a resort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just a place to sleep near the beach with a restaurant and live music. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we treated it as\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but at nearly $200 a night, I really did expect much, much more. My biggest complaint is about what happened to me and my wife during and after the Tsunami Warning of mid-march 2011. When the warning was issued at 10PM, the security staff very rudely entered our room with their master key and informed us that we have to evacuate the room immediately and that they would come in every hour until we did so. When I asked where we were supposed to go, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an answer for us. When we finally got an answer, it was not ideal. The only place they could evacuate us to was the outdoor 6th floor hallway and we would have to sleep on the floor until morning. My wife was sick, and I did not want to expose her to the elements. The staff there seemed very unsympathetic to our dilemma. Instead of risking pneumonia on the floor in an outdoor hallway, we chose to sleep in our car until morning. When I asked for a refund for the night we spent in the car instead of in the beds they were contractually obligated to provide for us, we received no reply. I understand that it was an unusual situation, but my complaint was that they offered no recourse other than to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deal with it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It seemed that when the warning was issued, they washed their hands of us and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care if we were comfortable\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just that we were out of harms way so that if by the remote chance something did happen, we couldn't sue. We entrusted this place with our hard-earned vacation time and money and expected to be treated better than the treatment we got both during and after the pseudo-crisis. I think this situation summed up what this hotel has become. The analogy would be an old crooner who thinks he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still relevant today and thinks that people should like him because he used to have talent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but in reality doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a lick about his audience and is only doing it for the money. And people still swoon because they remember how it USED to be\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open their eyes to the present reality.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Temple City, California", "Title": "\u201cPremium Maui at an affordable price.\u201d", "Author": "joanpierc", "ReviewID": "UR100928155", "Content": "There are no water slides for the kiddies, but it is situated on the beach next to the Whaler which is much pricier and just south of the Sheraton at black rock (great snorkeling area).

I really wanted to love KBH...folks always rave about the charm and aloha, and I was ready to experience it myself. I came away liking the hotel, not loving it, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to travelers looking for budget lodging in a really great location. Pros: room was exceptionally clean, nice sized lanai, fridge in the room, location really cannot be beat, Trilogy activities desk onsite was great and reasonably priced, live music nightly. Cons: room was very dated, had an electrical issue with the sconce (shot flames out of it...very scary but quickly tended to), thin walls, had to pay for parking, pool was just okay, and not fitness facilities, no wireless internet. Also, only the Molokai wing offers non-smoking rooms, and I believe those are the most outdated rooms. A note about the thin walls -- this actually was not an issue until one night when the electricity went off and I could hear the person next door to me snoring. Otherwise, I found that I was definitely younger than most of the guests at the hotel...which was both good and bad: good because there were no crazy loud nights or early mornings, but bad because I did feel a little out of place and did not really hang out at the Tiki Bar like I thought I might. I did not really interact with the staff, and that appears to be what typically garners this hotel such high reviews. I know it has a reputation for its true Hawaiian spirit and aloha, but frankly KBH did not have the same hold on me. What it did deliver, unquestionably, was a very clean room in a location that you really cannot beat. I loved being able to walk to Whalers Village in a matter of minutes, and the beach in front of the hotel is really nice (and the cabana rentals are very reasonable). I even enjoyed lying in the beach chairs at night to do a little star gazing. Come to this hotel if you're on a budget and you don't need a fancy, manicured resort to complete your Hawaiian vacation.

Three different kinds of lei making projects, pineapple cutting, weaving, and a tour and explanation of the medicinal properties of many of the native plants on the property. There was hula provided by students at the local hula schools each evening and music by locals who just like to play Hawaiian music. Lunch was available at the Tiki Grill and beverages at the Tiki Lounge. I was suprised to see there was no price gouging as I've seen at other places on Kaanapali. Usually there is a premium for poolside snacks and beverages - not here. There was a large grassy lawn with lots of sun and large trees. You could hang out in the sun for awhile and move to the shade when you'd had enough. They didn't care if the beach chairs were scattered all about. And of course, the beach was just a few steps away We had an ocean front room that was at most 50 yards from the beach. Which was fabulous until the tsunami warnings came. Then it was a little disconcerting. All was well and the waves never surpassed the beach.

Maui was our favorite island followed by Molokai. We returned this year to celebrate our retirement and chose to spend two weeks on Maui. We've stayed at the Royal Hawaiian on Oahu and the Sheraton on Ka'anapali Beach. If you want an ultra luxury hotel and plan to spend many hours on the hotel grounds, KBH may not be the best choice. On the other hand, if you want to enjoy the beaches of Maui and stay on the island as long as possible, KBH is an excellent choice. We had a beautiful view of the ocean from our ocean view room on the 5th floor. We enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and excellent service. KBH is conveniently located near Whaler's Village (shopping and restaurants) and getting to town involves a five minute bus ride ($2 for an all day bus pass). Unlike the Sheraton, KBH does not charge $26 per day in resort fees. The breakfast buffet at the Sheraton costs $35 compared to $14 at KBH. Whale watch and snorkeling trips pick you up on the beach right in front of KBH. We plan to return to Maui many times during our retirement and just hope the KBH is always open for business. We look forward to adding many white beads to our KBH lei. Ka'anaplai Beach does not need another ultra luxury hotel. KBH is a moderately priced hotel with nice amenities. We highly recommend it to all travelers.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bay Area, CA", "Title": "\u201cAll About the Location\u201d", "Author": "jasmine3407", "ReviewID": "UR97357032", "Content": "I stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for the first time in April 2010 with a pool view room, booked through Expedia. I have already booked my next stay here for this May 2011, also through Expedia. This hotel offers a \"Lei Aloha\" program, where repeat guests get some perks. But this only applies when you call for reservations (no third-party bookings, such as Expedia, and doesn't apply even to online reservations on their own website). Although the perks were enticing, the room rates were much more expensive when calling the hotel directly, than even from their website, so I declined to take advantage of this program for my next stay. I was impressed with the grounds, the gardens, the old Hawaiian artifacts, the lack of a resort fee, and the free activities (due to time constraints, I only participated in making a carnation lei, and in one ukulele lesson). I had been hearing from other travelers that the staff here was superb. There were about 4 staff members who I felt were consistently pleasant and went out of their way for me, but the majority of the staff members were just ordinary hotel works, and some were even rude (such as some of the valet drivers). I stayed in the newly renovated Kauai Wing, with great views of the pool, the ocean, and the West Maui Mountains from the 4th floor, and only a 30 second walk to the ocean. The first floor of the building was still being renovated during my stay, but construction noise was minimal. The room was nicely decorated and adequate for my needs, and housekeeping promptly took care of any issues I had (such as my coffeemaker not working or extra towels). The walls are paper thin, the elevators are older-looking, the pool is basic (although nice for kids, since it is whale-shaped), but I enjoyed my stay here, nonetheless. There are small touches everywhere that are charming, such as the ceiling fans shaped like whale tails, and even the cheesy Polynesian window stickers all over the place. The grounds were immaculate, with a variety of Plumeria trees and Hibiscus bushes. There were loungers and picnic tables in the gardens, so you can take advantage of the beautiful gardens, if you were tired of the beach. The restaurants here were expensive, as are most of the restaurants along the Beach Walk. I had a breakfast buffet at the Tiki Terrace once, and wasn't impressed at $22. I do hear the Terrace has good dinners, so I might dine there for dinner during my next stay. I did stop for drinks at the Tiki Bar Happy Hour many times, and loved the staff there. I also ate at the Tiki Grill once, and found it to be convenient for taking back to eat on my lanai, or taking onto the beach! There is another restaurant here, but I didn't eat there. Luckily, there is a mini-fridge in the room (in the closet), so I stocked it up with as many snacks, drinks, and deli items as it could hold, from Safeway. I visited the onsite convenience store for coffee every morning ($1 for a small cup), and browsed around the main gift shop once. There is also a jewelry store and salon on the grounds, but I didn't visit them. The Welcome Breakfast is a pretty nice overview of Maui, if you've never been to Maui. The Checking out Ceremony is beautiful and makes you want to book another stay right then and there. There is an Activities Desk there, to help you plan your stay, and I never felt pressured from them. The location and ambiance is what makes this place a winner, to me. Having only been to Oahu before this, this location was a great mixture of quiet and busy, that is hard to explain. Centrally located on Ka'anapali Beach, literally only steps away from Black Rock and Whaler's Village (I know, this sounds like it came from Maui Revealed, but it is true!). Parking is super cheap, compared to neighboring hotels along this beach ($9/day for garage, $11/day for valet...compared to $20 and over at other hotels). I chose valet, because I hate looking for parking, and I don't want to lug beach stuff through the garage to the main building. You can also check your account balance from the TV menu, as well as check-out from the TV. I was surprised that this hotel offered this. This place is also great for kids, if you have them. Big gardens to run around in, a free kids' program, a shallow pool. There is a Trilogy shack right on the beach of the hotel, where you can rent snorkel gear and sign up for snorkel tours (one leaves right from Ka'anapali beach, so you don't have to even drive to the harbor). And there is a lady who sells beautiful photography right next to the Trilogy shack! I would definitely stay here again if I were staying in West Maui. Great value that is also filled with great charm! Come here for the charm, not the frills (no room service, older looking buildings and rooms, despite the renovations). Don't come here if you usually stay at the Four Seasons!

I didn't have any major complaints. It's a not a lavish, high end, resort style hotel. It's more of a homey feeling. Average rooms, average pool-all a little out dated (no flat screen tv, etc). But the staff was great. I did have an issue with luke warm shower water during the day time. They offer multiple classes a day on different cultural aspects (lei making, dancing, etc). The bar was fair, but their prices for drinks were great. Their restaurant was also a pleasant surprise. The best thing about the hotel though is their prime beach location.

This time we really had to cut costs, but we still wanted to be in the same location on Ka'anapali Beach, so KBH was perfect. We got a deal through Costco that included a rental car and the buffet breakfast each morning for about $200 per night, for 7 nights. Compared to the best deal we could find at the Sheraton or Westin (outside of Priceline-type bidding, which I'm not comfortable with) we saved over $800 total on our hotel, which was very much worth it to us. If the savings had been closer to $300-400, we would have probably gone with one of the bigger resorts. We were in the Kauai wing, in the closest room to the beach that didn't actually face the beach. We looked out at the Whaler next door, but had a good view of the ocean to the side. The room was small and the bathroom was tiny- 2 people really couldn't be in there at the same time. I've had bigger hotel rooms in Europe, but generally it worked. The ceiling fan circulated air well, and we mostly slept with the lanai door open, until about 6:30 when the birds would get active outside. The room looked like it had been renovated, but still, the hotel is old and a bit dated so it isn't necessarily sparkling. It was cleaned nicely every day, and we never had a problem with dirt, insects, etc. We were a little annoying to be nickeled and dimed for some things- $1.50 per day for the safe? Really? The grounds are nice and expansive, and you are right next to the beach and just a short walk to Whaler's Village, so the location is fantastic. We occasionally stopped for a drink at the Tiki Bar, which was nice and the bartenders were friendly, and the drinks were a little cheaper than at other places. The Tiki Grill, however, didn't impress us. We were hoping for a healthy snack option, and tried to order a Thai chicken wrap but we were told they were out of the ingredients for that. Ended up with a dry chicken sandwich and some fried wontons. We don't eat a lot of fried food, so it was disappointing, but there are many options just a short walk away for a better snack so it didn't slow us down. The breakfast buffet was OK- food was good, but there wasn't enough variety to eat there every morning. Breakfast is important to me, especially on vacation- I love to sit, sip my coffee, and discuss the plans for the day. It certainly was a lovely location for that, but I got sick of pancakes and scrambled eggs every morning. The quiche was tasty, but not 7 mornings in a row. They really didn't change things out from day to day- the things they did change weren't really breakfast foods- stir-fried pork, potato wedges, fried rice, breaded fish, etc. My husband loved that stuff but I was dying for a waffle or even a piece of toast by the end of the week. To be fair, we were occasionally asked if we wanted to see a menu, so that could have been an option, I just never went that route, so I take some of the blame. They had many activities going on at the hotel- lei making class, ukelele class, hula show in the evening, but we really didn't take advantage of any of that. The people operating the activities seemed very patient and friendly. During the day they had several vendors set up in the lobby with their local arts and crafts, and I noticed that they did change from day to day so if you see something you want, buy it right way- we only saw the scented salts guy once. There are some displays set up around the hotel that describe how each staff member takes part in building or creating different cultural artifacts- one being a canoe. I think that is really cool that the staff immerses themselves in the culture like that. Does it necessarily make my stay at the hotel any more enriched? No. But still, I think it is very nice that they do that sort of thing. The pool was small, and we knew that before going, but it was a little disappointing. Many of the resorts in the area have large, sprawling pools with swim-up bars, waterfalls, etc. The KBH pool is a basic neighborhood pool in the shape of a whale. Yawn. Overall, we were happy with this hotel because of the location and the price. However, if we were going for a special occasion (like our wedding or honeymoon) We would have splurged for one of the other resorts.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel, the staff and the location.\u201d", "Author": "CariBea", "ReviewID": "UR95936898", "Content": "This was our first trip to Maui.

After 7 hours on a plane, standing around for like what seemed forever waiting for our luggage at the airport, being frustrated with Alamo and the rental car we received, and being over dressed on a hot humid day, we were far from relaxed. Within 10 minutes of experiencing one of Chantel's margaritas, we were instantly transported into relaxation/vacation mode!! We paid a few dollars more for the beach front room at the Ka'anapali on the 6th floor and it was worth every penny. The only thing between us and the beach was a walking path. The number of people who were dedicated to their morning jogging ritual along the pathway at 6:30 a.m., was something to rather marvel at. We didn't join them - it was a vacation! Our morning ritual included coffee on the lanai, watching the whales. It was spectacular. We met people from all over the world at this hotel. The Ka'anapali host a very friendly, intersting and nice clientele. Hi Mary and Susan from London, England if you're reading this!! We loved the different local bands who entertained every night from 6 - 9 pm on the outdoor stage. There was also authentic hula performances nightly as well. We never even bothered going to a luai and from the comments we received from others who did, really didn't miss a thing. Every morning, until noon, there were local artisans offering their products in the lobby and in the courtyard. It was so interesting to talk with these people and see their creations. We learned a lot about the history of Maui itself, from these very talented people. The hotel also offered lei making lessons, ukulele lessons, garden tours - all for free. You could rent beach cabanas, boogie boards, surf boards, etc. right on site. The food was a little expensive. We never included breakfast in our package, which we had the opportunity to do. They have a wonderful breakfast buffet that included hot items, cold items and an array of fresh fruit until 11 am and it often was our main meal of the day. It would have been much more economical to spend the few extra dollars when we booked our package, than what we paid daily for this buffet. The lei ceremony on our last day, was a perfect end to our vacation in paradise. We can hardly wait to go back. Before we travelled, we anticipated that we would get a condo for our second trip to Maui. Not the case anymore. This is the only place we can imagine coming back to.

The breakfast buffet was included in our room and was very good. We used our little fridge and bought a few groceries to keep in it so we only had to purchase one meal per day. We went to Safeway in Lahaina (be prepared for expensive tho!). We chose to rent a cabana on the beach 2 of the days we were there and it was so nice (cost $21 for 4 hours). The guys at the beach hut were very nice and helpful as well. We rented paddle boards one day as well and that was so very peaceful (once you got the hang of it, cost $25 for 1st hour). The snorkeling at black rock was just as good as the snorkeling tour we took. There were lots of sea turltes there as well as all the colorful fish. You could walk the beach path and end up at Whalers Village, which was basically an outdoor mall with some very good restaurants (Leilani's was excellent). I do have one complaint. The mattress was not comfy at all. I am used to sleeping on a beautiful plush pillow top mattress, so we didn't really get that great of sleeps. On a positive note it did make us get up early and enjoy the day! The internet would have cost us $10ish per day so we just passed on it, who needs to go on the internet when on vacation anyway? Some other costs are the parking at $9 per day and the safe at $1.50 per day, but just incorporate those into your budget and then relax and enjoy paradise.

Which bought us Helicopter Tours, Dive Trip's, Plantaition Tour, Aquarium Tour, Magic Show, Rental Car, Road to Hana, Crater Tour, Etc. Our room was very clean and the staff was very friendly. The bathroom was a bit smaller than I am use to, but all in all it worked out. The bed was fine. At home I sleep on a $3,000 bed and I was perfectly happy with the bed in our room. The grounds of the property were very clean and well cared for. I do not think I was ever on property without seeing a caretaker cleaning and or maintaining the landscaping. If I had to find something to be negative about was the elevators. They seemed a bit worn out. Looks wise not the operation of the elevator. This hotel must be 30 plus years old. When we first arived I must admit this is no Maui Westin. And I was second guessing my hotel pick. But after a 15 hour travel day I could have picked the Westin apart. After a day or two we settled in and all was just fine. I came to like the fact that I could move around a lounge chairs on the lawn any where I wanted to sun, shade, or pool. Try that at the major brand hotels. That lounge chair is not being moved. It was like my own back yard. The staff alway's made us feel welcome. The pool well, yes it is a pool. Nothing fancy, just a little better than basic. I must admit all the other major brand hotels have awsome looking pools. Again we paid half the price. And did activities we did not do on a prior trip because we paid $450.00 per night. The location is great with snorkeling at Black Rock a couple of time a day. It is just a short walk and like wise for the Whaler's Village. Our room was on the 5th floor so we could see Black Rock and the diver every evening at sunset. The hotel is quiet at 10:00 and they enforce it. If you want to spend $400.00 plus a night just go next door to the Shariton. I have paid that price in the past and did a whole lot less in activites. So ask your self. How much are you in the room any way? Would I stay at Kaanapali Beach Hotel again? In a heart beat I would. It is the same beach. Oh, by the way we purchased the breakfast package and we were pleased with the food. The wait staff is a bit confused it seamed. I think some of them need a bit more training.

As any traveler knows, some resort hotels charge $10 to $20 a night for WI-FI and the free service was appreciated. Yes, the bathroom is small but who cares-you don't live or sleep there and it was clean. There is a nice desk area for the computer and an extra chair. The only drawback was a tube TV with limited channels. Self park was plentiful and close to the room. A big plus is that Whaler's Village is a 5-10 minute walk and has at least two good restaurants-Leilani's and Hula Grill. The hotel is next to the ocean and a walkway that goes along the beach. I did not hang around the hotel or interact with staff so can't comment on the staff. The good-bye shell lei is a nice touch. I did catch some of the free hula show which was well done and similar to what you have to pay to see at a luau. The bottom line is that this hotel is very reasonably priced for a resort in Ka'aanapali on the ocean and well worth it. I would not hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Topeka, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cLoved it ~ not a national chain.

I knew that they had valet and self parking but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a ticket to go out. Anyway we just parked at the front while we dropped our bags at the front where the concierge and I tried to check in. We arrived pretty early like 11 or something so our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available which was fine but I just wanted to let them know we were here. After that, we went around to a shopping centre, lunch, then back to KBH. We did the self parking and just got a ticket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why I kept it but anyway. Went to the reception and got our cards and they advised us they moved us to the pool view room ground floor which was surprising. Ok so just went with flow and when we go to the room, we were glad we got upgraded. Because its just on the ground floor so easily can get there, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to get a lift. Our room was at the end so was close to the beach but in saying that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter where you were, its close to the beach anyway. We got a king size beach and it was nice. As you see from the photos, the room was pretty cool. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any faults about the room and was really satisfied. Breakfast was included and it was suffice. We made the error of\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well every Sunday they have this brunch so with the coupons you get, you get $12 discount and you pay the difference. Basically the brunch goes from morning to lunch I suppose and they open the room inside which has a lot of cool food. Anyway I asked the lady if breakfast was included inside and she said yes but there must\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a breakdown of communication because we were caught by another person saying no that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not included. Plus when he offered me champagne for breakfast I thought that was a bit funny and I declined. In the end we said we would upgrade since it was our only Sunday there because we were only there for 5 nights and was worth it. Lots of cool food, seafood & deserts yummy! Back to normal breakfast on a normal day. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like how I had to tip but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming from a stingy aussie but we tipped because its their way of life & customary too. The pool was small and would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been good if they had a bigger pool but was suffice. From the room, the pool is formed in the shape of a whale but from a ground view you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see it. The Tiki Bar and the tiki restaurant/takeaway was good though packed when it got busy. We would have a couple of hotels and food from there and the price wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too expensive. On the last day when you check out, one of the managers does a presentation because you are leaving and it was a nice Hawaiian feeling. It was funny though at the end how when he finished, he just walked away and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say, thanks and goodbye. So I side-lined him to ask for a photo of one of the backdrops in the hotel foyer. They also give a lei but we had that confiscated at Sydney International Airport because its wood & might carry something inside \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oh wells. After that, checked out and was on our way to our next accommodation in Maui. Cost? It was fortunate that when we booked it, they had some special \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcholo holo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 promo which brought the price $100-$200USD down depending on what package you booked. We purchased the Holo Holo Garden Brkfst Garden w/2 dbl beds which was $924.35 USD for 5 nights. So when we got upgraded to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPool/Courtyard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I was delighted as I knew it was a tad more expensive when you book this ($20USD extra per night?). Because the self parking was $12 each day and the additional cost from the brunch, we paid an extra $105 USD thus total price in the end was $1029 USD If you try and book a package now for Garden Brkfst Garden, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHolo holo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anymore unfortunately and when I look at the price now for 5 nights, the total amount $1156.85USD. So in the end you can see I save some money which was good J Overall: I would definitely come back again, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice Hawaiian atmosphere when you stay here. They also have activities that you can undertake but we were so busy checking out the beaches and stuff, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any time to do any of it lol. Only downside is pool size and you when you see the other resorts have bigger pools, then you might be a bit jealous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but hey, just go to the beach instead or just try to sneak into other resorts pool without them knowing lol", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SETX", "Title": "\u201cBelieve the Hype\u201d", "Author": "Texcoug", "ReviewID": "UR89294500", "Content": "This was our third trip to Maui, but the first with our children. We had previously stayed at the Marriott Ocean Club and Hyatt on Ka'anapali. We considered those plush locations for our family trip, but on a tip, booked the KBH instead. It was the best decision we have made in a long time. I must say I was concerned when we drove up -- just didn't seem that nice. The walk to our rooms was a little discouraging compared to the initial vibe you get from Hyatt or Marriott. But then, we opened the doors (they accommodated our adjoining rooms request) and were delighted in the setup of the rooms (with the step down). We were on the ground floor (loved it) and walked right out to the beach. Incredible! Rather than choke their grounds with shops and pools and the like customary of resorts, were were welcomed to lush, open lawns and instant access to the beach. We have a pool so were not paying the money to go to Maui to play in a pool. Our kids loved the beach. The staff were INCREDIBLE. Here is a breakdown: 1. You have heard about the amazing staff -- BELIEVE IT. The activities for kids were awesome. They entertained my 12 YO daughter all the way down to my 4 YO son. The kids loved the staff and looked for opportunities to go to the free Hawaiian culture classes. 2. The culture classes were A++. Our kids learned the Hula and teared up in story telling time. I have 5 kids -- girls 12 and 10 and boys 8, 6, and 4. The classes were a major hit with all my kids and the Passports were too. My 4 YO still requires that we call him by his Hawaiian name. 3. I loved the openness of the grounds. Very peaceful. 4. Beach location is A+++. Perfect area for swimming. Safe for kids. There is great sand that goes out a long way. The beaches in front of the Hyatt and Marriott lack that nicety -- no walking out there. In fact, lots of beaches lack that in Hawaii. The beach here is perfect -- great sand and soft. 5. Black rock is right next door and Lanaii in the distance. Great spot for water activities. Trilogy can accommodate any request. I would recommend picking up snorkeling gear near the Maui Ocean Center on your drive in -- you can rent it for the week for the cost of 1 day at Ka'anapali. 6. Food Ok at resort but Whaler's Village right next door with some tasty options. (We love both Longboards and its sister restaurant). 7. Parking is amazing. Believe it or not -- you actually self park and will be right by your rooms. 8. Did I mention the staff was amazing? I will absolutely return. I think this is a perfect place for families. If it were just my wife and I (like our first two trips), I would still return but may consider other options.

Initially, we selected the KBH for its ideal location (Northwest Shore in Ka'anapali, on the 2-3 mile boardwalk along the fabulous Pacific Ocean shoreline, with its own golf course). The hotel is also within walking distance to fine shopping and excellent food in every price range. We will go back to KBH again (and again) because of our Aloha Experience this year. We also learned more about Hawaiian culture during this trip than during many previous visits to numerous museums, plantations, parks and historic venues because we received history lessons and learned family lore that were combined with hula and lei-making classes, welcome and departure ceremonies, and other demonstrations and activities provided generously for KBH guests. The staff is so welcoming and accessible, you will be comfortable asking any questions as a guest or tourist interested in off-property entertainment, and confident that you will receive the correct answer the first time. We loved it. The KBH is an older property that is meticulously maintained. It is also very affordable.

The location of this hotel and the friendliness of the staff here makes it still a good choice for the traveler that wants to save a little money on hotel cost but stay in the best area on Kaanapali beach. We enjoyed watching and talking to (long Hawaiian name \"mr smith\") who did coconut palm weaving..and we loved the nightly hawaiian free show on the stage. The daily buffet breakfast was good and convenient. We got tired of the buffet and only on the last day discovered that the voucher for breakfast would go toward the regular menu for 9$. A waffle is 14.95 with fruit on the menu. As for the room number..the higher the number the closer you are to the oceanfront. Our room was a bit noisy from the lani because it was right above the walkway to the elevators. The room was very soundproof when the doors were closed. We could totally block out the music from the show by closing our sliding door. The hotel is used for tour groups and the lobby is crowded when the buses come in. The grounds of this hotel are extremely beautiful and well kept. The plumeria trees are everywhere! The beach is a short walk from your room anywhere at this hotel. You can relax on the grassy area, by the pool or on the beach. Overall a very relaxing vacation. We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat! If you like magic shows..don't go to the one on the premises of this hotel..instead go to Warren and Annebells..it is absolutely amazing experience. Our dining experience here was just ok. The prices were high and not a very extensive menu.The food at the Tiki Grill is convenient for a day of relaxing and not wanting to walk or drive anywhere but it is expensive for what you get. This is a middle class hotel in a upperclass area. Internet is 10$ a day. Beware of end of stay costs as one needs to plan on the cost of parking etc.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cThe friendliest hotel I have ever stayed at...\u201d", "Author": "WestEndVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR84928460", "Content": "We stayed and held our wedding at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel.

The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. We went to the welcome breakfast at the hotel - a great introduction, and one of the staff (Jody the magician) even took the time after the breakfast to point out points of interest on a map of the island. We enjoyed relaxing on the hotel grounds, which were much more pleasant with their grass, trees and flowers, than some nearby hotels which seemed to have a lot more concrete than greenery. The hotel's Tiki Bar and Grill was great (we made fast friends with the bartender) as was the beach hut where we borrowed towels and rented snorkel gear. We spent time on the beach in front of the hotel, swimming and sunbathing. We walked the five minutes or so to Black Rock for snorkeling a couple of times, and saw sea turtles, many different kinds fish, and even a sting ray. We rented a car so drove around the island and went on a few hikes (Twin Falls and Iao Valley). We also took surfing lessons, went to the hotel magic show (fantastic!) and enjoyed the nightly music and hula at the hotel (excellent Friday night hula show featuring local youth). I participated in lei making at the hotel with my mum and sister.

This hotel was the PERFECT place to celebrate our 30th anniversary. The room was so nice, the location was perfect, the grounds were beautiful, and the staff members were all so incredibly nice. I don't think we could have picked a more perfect place! The room... We had a garden view room in the Moloka'i building. The building is obviously not new, but certainly seemed to be well taken care of. The king size bed was very comfortable, we had a view of Black Rock from our lanai, everything was clean and worked properly... and a bonus was the excellent water pressure in the shower! The location... couldn't be more convenient - VERY close to Black Rock but also has views of Molokai and Lanai. VERY close to Whaler's Village ( we walked there sometimes 2 or 3 times a day ) where you can eat and/or shop for almost anything you can imagine, or you can take a bus to Lahaina from Whalers Village for only a dollar each way! The beach walk that connects all of the hotels along Kaanapali is a great place to get a little exercise and see the ocean. We also took the bus to Kapalua one day. And a Trilogy kiosk on site made it easy to book a sunset sail cruise and a snorkeling cruise... the boats leave from the beach at the hotel. (Both cruises were EXCELLENT, the food was fantastic, Captain Kevin and his ship mates were fun and so helpful, and we even tried SNUBA! It was great!) We also went to the Kupanaha magic show at the hotel, sat at the front row of tables, had a GREAT meal, and then were AMAZED by the magic. It was fantastic! The grounds... Well, the pictures online just don't do justice to the hotel grounds. There is such a variety of plants! The pool is much larger and deeper than we anticipated, but there are shallow parts, too, and the water temp was perfect. We ate at the Tiki Grill a couple of times, had mai tais (or the daily drink special) at the Tiki Bar almost every day, and watched the nightly hula show a few times. There is a real mix of people here. There were people of every age group, lots of couples, lots of families with kids, and lots of people who appeared to be single. It seemed that anyone would feel at home here. Another bonus - walking around the grounds after dark, listening to the Hawaiian music, and smelling the plumeria trees. It just doesn't get any better than that! The staff... Everyone (and I do mean EVERYONE ) was friendly, helpful, and attentive without being intrusive. It's obvious that they are proud of their hotel, and their connection to Hawaii and to the environment. We took several of the free classes that they offer, and we learned so much while having fun. The information we received at the free breakfast on our first day was very helpful and the food was great. And the ceremony on our final day was touching and very special. We spent 8 days here and enjoyed every minute of it. We did not rent a car, and we never felt that we needed one. The bus system will get you almost anywhere you need to go, and it's a quick walk to Whalers Village to catch the bus. We had our MOST AMAZING AND WONDERFUL anniversary dinner at Gerard's in Lahaina and used the bus to get there and back. Two great golf courses are just across the road. A couple of great boat tours with Trilogy leave from the hotel beach. Snorkel equipment can be rented there, too, and the snorkeling at Black Rock was GREAT... saw at least 5 big sea turtles and lots of other sea life there. We took the Hana Tour with Valley Isle Excursions - they picked us up at the hotel ON TIME and delivered us safely after the tour.

At first I was concerned about the dated looking lobby, but after spending time there I found it to be the most authentically Hawaiian resort I've seen. If you are looking for a overly manicured luxury resort with a fancy pool and flamingos & penguins, then this place is not for you. If you want to enjoy the beach and the sun in a relaxed, uniquely hawaiian environment, then this is where you want to be. Of all the resorts on Kaanapali Beach, this one has the best beach location. It is the only part of the beach that has a deep, sandy beach and a rock free ocean front. You can go swimming in the warm clear water without having to worry about a rocky surf or you can relax on the sandy beach. The grounds are spacious and well maintained, but not overly manicured, there is a cute pool with plenty of lounge chairs to relax in. There is a Tiki bar and Tiki Grill near the pool. You can place a beach chair anywhere on the spacious lawn, not only in designated areas around the pool. So if you want to read or relax without being bothered by hundred of people around a crowded pool, you can do that. Every night they have a Hula show on the stage near the tiki bar which is a nice way to end a relaxing day at the beach. The breakfast buffet was a good selection of eggs, meats (including fish), cereal, fruit and pastries. We started every day with a full stomach of wholesome food. We were touched by the goodbye ceremony before we left. Even though the KBH is the most affordable resort on Ka'anapali beach, I would highly recommend it at any price.

I really, really wanted to like the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. I even booked our final 3 nights in Maui there BECAUSE of TripAdvisor reviews. Unfortunately, my wife and I did not have a great time there. My wife and I had already stayed at the Marriott Maui Ocean Club the previous 7 nights, and maybe we were just used to higher quality... everything. When we first checked in, we were given a ground floor unit right at the corner of a walkway. So, basically anyone that walked by had a terrific, clear view of your unit - unless you shut all of the curtains, turning your room into a cave. I asked for a different room, as I was on my honeymoon, and the woman at the front desk quickly moved me to a 3rd floor unit with no hassle at all. The staff in general are very nice. The AC unit in our room made a 4' x 4' section of the carpet (and wall) very damp. So damp that housekeeping had to bring in a huge industrial fan and have it blowing 100mph for an entire afternoon to try and dry it out, which it never did. So, we learned to never walk around barefoot or with socks on. The TV's are still incredibly old, but that wasn't a huge deal to me. After all, we didn't book the room to watch TV. The fridge is tiny, so you can't put much in it at all, and the safe is more like a small metal locker than anything else - one that you pay a daily rate for. I needed to use my laptop to look up some things - restaurants, activities, etc. Well, they charge $10 for 24-hours of Internet usage here. Seriously! For me, that is absolutely ridiculous. I ended up just using my iPhone 4's internet to get everything that I needed, not wanting to put another dime into this hotel's bank. Dinner was very good, but they brought out a completely different meal than what my wife had ordered, so she had to wait for them to cook the correct meal and bring it back out; they did not take a few bucks off the bill for this, which I thought was pretty inconsiderate, since just about *any* other restaurant would have done the same. On our final day, I was in the middle of showering and packing to get ready to leave for the airport when the front desk called me telling me that I had to move my car so that the tree trimmers could get in. No advanced notice was given to anyone, nor were there any signs posted. This isn't a big a deal as the rest of my issues, but little things keep adding up here. I know I wasn't the only one inconvenienced by this, as I saw a few older ladies having to move their cars into the garage (which was pretty full at the time). To sum it up: PROS: -Conveniently located near Whaler's Village and Black Rock -The beach in front of the hotel is outstanding -Very friendly staff CONS: -Severely dated rooms (even in the newly-renovated rooms) -$9/day self-parking or $11/day valet -$10 for 24-hours of internet access -Uncomfortable beds and pillows.

Having read a lot of the reviews, the hotel was as I expected - the rooms are a little dated but fully functional and they contain everything you need for a beach holiday. The a/c wasn't up to much though and we relied heavily on the fan to sleep in a cool room at night. We booked a garden view room which I soon found out meant the cheapest room but actually the ones facing the pool and ocean were noisier than our room so we were very happy and slept perfectly all week! The location cannot be beaten - right on the beach, a wide stretch of sand (it's much narrower towards the Hyatt Hotel) and it's not even a 5 minute walk to Whalers Village which has a suprisingly good selection of restaurants and shops (some expensive, some cheap). The staff were friendly but we didn't take part in much of evening entertainment or hotel organised events and preferred to dine at a different restaurant every night. The only other point I would mention was that our cleaning wasn't very thorough - some days it seemed that none of the surfaces in the bedroom or bathroom were cleaned at all and all we could see that had been done was the bed been made.

Parking is an extra $9/day. Wifi is also extra. * You have to drive everywhere (true most places in Maui). * There are no cooking facilities, so you have to eat all your meals out and the restaurant offerings aren't great (food courts or really expensive places -- expensive even by Maui standards). * There's a band playing Hawaiian music and covers every night.

We also stayed at Kona Village on the big island for a few days (you can see my raving review of that place too). If I had it to do over, we would have spent all of our time there, and none of it at the Kaanapali. This place was packed. The service was mediocre at best. Complimentry is an unheard of word at this place. We got the \"romance package\" which among other things included bottled water, a picnic lunch, and a rental car for the duration of our stay. Parking was not included (free car, and $9 per day parking?) You had to go down to their convenince shop to get your bottled water, because I guess it's too inconvenient for them to bring it to your room? They had two ancient computers for general use that charged by the minute for use, seriously tacky. The place was kind of run down, and our room smelled funny. I'm not a snobby a person, but I don't know how to put this without sounding snobby; the bar...was kind of low class. The people all seemed really trashy. It made me think I was at a local dive bar, except there was a pool and we were a few hundred feet away from the beach. It was amost disturbing how trashy some of the people were, considering how much it costs to go on a Hawaiian vacation. The beach was beautiful, but packed. The snorkelling was good, but you would physically run into people because there were so many people snorkelling. The food was ok. Breakfast was a huge buffet. They offered you a menu as well, but if you had a 'free breakfast' package, the vouchers were only good for a certain dollar amount. Almost everything on the menu was more than the vouchers amount. They had no fine dinning option, so you had to go elseware if you wanted a decent meal. I highly suggest Sonz at Swan Court in the Hyatt Regency; considered one of the most romantic restaurants in the world. Don't walk though - it's about 25 minutes up the beach.

Why the management penalizes non-smokers in this way I do not understand. I guess because smokers can't climb stairs?? Why should we have to drag our beach equipment and a toddler up three flights to preserve basic health? According to the front desk, it is because many of the people who stay in this resort are smokers. I much prefer the smell of the ocean and the tropical flowers to the smell of cigarettes, and with a child with asthma, a smoking environment doesn't just stink, it is dangerous.

They have lot of hawaiian activities going on everyday, and i learned lei making from a very patient and sweet teacher.

This hotel is for those looking for a great location, comfy rooms, very friendly staff, affordable prices and an overall relaxing vacation. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. There is a nice sized patio on the partial ocean view rooms (worth the extra cost). There is minimal maintenance going on around the hotel, and they always do the work quietly during the day so as not to disturb you. The grounds are meticulously kept up and tended to every morning. The smell of fresh flowers and the ocean are everywhere! There is a grill and a bar located by the pool. The grill has some of the best turkey burgers and pizza around - all at affordable prices. The main reason to stay at this hotel is the location! It is is about a 30-45 min. drive from the Kahului airport to this hotel, depending on traffic (avoid rush hour when locals are finishing work). The hotel is right on the beach, so within 2 mins anywhere at the hotel you are on the beach. The water is crystal clear and not too crowded. The hotel also offers a free \"orientation\" breakfast. This was a great way to see what the hotel offers as far as activities. The TOP thing I recommend: take the surfing lessons!!! It is offered through Kaanapali but is run by the Westin - which is 2 hotels over (only a 5 min walk). The lessons were fantastic - great instructors - and it was our favorite thing to do! Can't recommend enough. There is also a magic show put on by the hotel, called Kupanaha. It was a great magic show! It's great for all ages, and isn't too \"childish\" or too \"adult\" either. The magician is really good - worth doing while you're at the hotel. There is a small group of shops and restaurants - called \"Whaler's Village\" - which is about 5-10 mins walking from the hotel. It has some great restaurants - try Leilani's (eat upstairs for fancier eating and downstairs for beach views and a casual menu). Also, go to Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina (a town about 10 min drive from hotel - to get there act as though you are driving back towards the airport and you'll see it within 5-10 mins) on the right hand side. It is a burger place (kind of like In & Out Burger) but with great views and delicious food. Finally, the staff were WONDERFUL at Kaanapali. Special kudos to Mikala for always being around and helping out, even on his days off! The hotel is touted as the \"most Hawaiian hotel\" and they offer free classes (ie: lei making, ukulele lessons, etc.) My favorite was the ukulele lessons - no experience needed! The classes may sound cheesy, but there's always a group of people doing it and it's a blast. I can't emphasize enough what a GREAT hotel this was.

We arrived about 45 minutes before the check-in time of 3:30pm and were told that our partial ocean view room in the Maui wing was not ready as it still needed to be \"inspected\". That did not seem unusual until we noticed that many others who arrived after us were being checked in immediately. At 3:30pm, I asked why so many other arriving guests were immediately checked in and what was the nature of this \"inspection\". What a suprise, our room was now available! Based on the previous reviews we inquired about any construction and we were told that the room had been remodeled. It was very typical of a motel quality room. The king size bed was covered with a well worn, faded, Hawaiian fabric printed bedspread. The other furniture was modest to say the least. The sheets were totally too small for the king size mattress and there was no fitted sheet. Every morning we woke up to the sheet off the mattress rolled in a wrinkled mess. Also, they use a blanket type mattress pad that also is not fitted, so it was very hot and bunched up with the ill fitting sheets. Two days before our check out there was a message on our phone that the pest control inspectors were going to be doing their \"ongoing\" inspection and they wanted access to our room. We had not seen any evidence of bugs or other pests and since we both suffer from allergies, we declined the inspection. The air conditioner broke down and could not be fixed until the next day as another message said that they needed parts that were not available on the island. The breakfast buffet was included in our package. There is a large selection and it was buffet quality food. One day I ordered off the menu as they allowed a $14.00 credit if you did not want the buffet. The ala carte prices are expensive so I ordered the waffle which cost my entire credit. It appeared fine but after one bite I realized there was something wrong. I sent it back and the server told me that she had the chef try it and he confirmed that the batter had gone sour. The buffet is at least fresh as it appeared that most guests had the breakfast vouchers and ate the buffet food. Anything else could be risky. The grounds are maintained by a crew that every morning trim and rake the fallen flowers. However, the area is in much need of repair with the cement cracked and well worn. The Tiki bar has a daily special. One day we went for a drink when the nightly entertainment was about to start. There were some \"regulars\" who asked the bartender to play rap music in a boombox. We decided to walk to one of the other hotels to enjoy a drink and entertainment. Don't be fooled by the \"most hawaiian\" hype. All of the hotels in the area have nightly free entertainment in a much more comfortable, relaxing setting. The staff did not seem overly friendly, nor were they unfriendly. Just like any other hotel, they all wear hawaiian print clothing and say aloha. The claim of \"Maui's most hawaiian\" is nothing more than a marketing strategy. It is an effort to create the illusion of Old Hawaii when the reality is that the KBH is in need of a major facelift. Although it is certainly cheaper than any other hotel in the area, we did not feel it was a value. Our experience is that we did not pay much but we certainly did not get much in terms of quality or comfort.

HOWEVER, On the positive side, though, this is the closest Hotel to the south side of Black Rock(except for the Sheraton which costs 2x as much), the PRIME location for staying overnight in West Maui, in my opinion. You are practically RIGHT at Black Rock and along the touted beach walk that fronts all of the hotels on this part of the beach. Also, the grounds were particularly nice w/ a more Hawaiian feel than the other hotels--this they like to brag about. The staff were all VERY nice and friendly and accomodating to boot--it felt genuine too. The atmosphere was really laid back here. I think everyone who stayed at this hotel was here to relax and have fun. I've stayed at some of the best hotels around the world--where basic rooms cost $600 or more in some cases. I felt just as comfortable here--like I could be myself and enjoy Hawaii and not have to put so much stock in my hotel. I think sometimes when you stay at a 5 star place, you feel like you should be at the hotel all of the time...this is a stupid reason to vacation in my opinion. Where I live there is a 5 star hotel I go to just to be pampered about once per quarter.... but I save the plane ticket. If you want to enjoy Hawaii and an absolutely fantastic location, this is it. If you're hung up on living a 5 star existence the entire time, book elsewhere. I'd recommend to anyone but rich people who were born with a silver spoon and those who want to pretend. P.S. the evening show featured some good musicians and interesting dancers.

The trip itself was so much fun, and made more so by our choosing to stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. What a lovely place! Our room was comfortable and immaculately clean, overlooking the central courtyard and pool. The grounds were beautiful - I wish I could grow such lovely plants here at home! The pool was refreshing, and we met not one staff member, no matter what their position, who neglected to say Aloha and/or had a smile on their face. Location was GREAT - within walking distance on the boardwalk of Whaler's Village for shopping and dining, walking distance to Black Rock, where we snorkeled with sea turtles right off our own beach. Driving wise it was easy in & out of the parking garage and not too far away from anything we chose to do. We had a delightful welcome breakfast on our second morning there where staff members performed a song/dance & hula, and we were presented with a kukui lei and parting song on our last morning. Each evening we were treated to music that we could choose to listen to in person at the Tiki bar, or, as we often did - listened while relaxing on our private balcony with cool drink in hand as we watched the sky turn blue & turquoise and fade into a star-strewn sky over the Pacific. We attended a wonderful cultural dance/hula/song presentation by local Maui kids on Friday evening. While there were tons of activities offered through the hotel, we were on the run a lot, but my husband did attend a Ukelele lesson one afternoon - which he got a total kick out of. I tried too, but opted to take pictures. Maybe someday we'll return to Maui, and if we do, we'll more than likey be staying at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel again - there's a reason why they tout themselves as Hawaii's most Hawaiian Hotel - and we know why!!", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bay area, ca", "Title": "\u201cLove this place\u201d", "Author": "liberrygal", "ReviewID": "UR63591918", "Content": "This is the second time we've stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel.

The level of service is topnotch. As other reviewers have noted: the staff here genuinely seem to like their jobs and the customer service is excellent. Staff always warmly greeted us as we passed them by in the hallway or grounds. KB is great for families. My family included 3 year old, 8 year old, myself and my hubby. The free classes were great; my niece signed up for a hula class, a few of the lei making classes. While we were at the pool, I overheard a couple guests talking about their experiences staying at nearby hotels. One gentleman said he's stayed at the Sheraton and Hyatt but he and his wife prefer KB over the others. They said the same thing too- that the staff at KB are all so pleasant and helpful. My only minor complaint (and this is very minor) was that we missed out on the farewell lei presentation. A nice man asked us if we were waiting for the ceremony. We said yes, so he gave our kids a couple children's leis and then instructed us to walk out front for the ceremony. We walked outside, waited for 10 minutes but no one brought over our leis. I have to admit, it was a crazy morning: the freeway was closed because of a brush fire so KB was short staffed and a lot of guests weren't sure if they would be able to get to the airport for their departure flights. It was a bit chaotic at the front desk. After waiting awhile, my family and I decided to go back to our room to retrieve our luggage and check out. I was just a bit disappointed because I've heard a lot of cool things about the farewell ceremony.

The staff were pleasant and accommodating and seemed to enjoy working there. We had paid extra for a beach front room which was certainly worth it for the view alone (see photo). It was such a joy watching the sun set after the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, our previous stopover. Our room was of reasonable size for three people, clean with extremely comfy queen size beds. Bathroom was well equipped, powerful shower and fresh towels daily. The gardens leading down to the beach are beautiful with picnic areas and benches if you want to sit and relax outside. It is a short walk from the hotel through the gardens to the beach which when we were there was not at all crowded - sandy beach but some coral/pebbles in the shallow water - swim shoes advised for children. The surf here was fine for adults and older children and possibly snorkeling - my son reckoned he could hear dolphins singing to each other! There is a whale shaped swimming pool in the grounds with sunloungers etc. Beach towels are available to borrow. It is also a short walk to Whalers Village - a shopping mall with restaurants based around newer hotels/timeshares. The nearest town is Lahaina where you can book tours for whale watching. The hotel offers hawaiian dancing every evening and craft activities during the day.It is also worthwhile taking up your first day complimentary breakfast as you will be given a lot of information about what you can do on the island (and what the hotel can arrange for you). Just a few things to bear in mind about this hotel regarding extra costs. Although beach towels are free, any other beach equipment has to be hired from a separate company located near the entrance to the beach - this includes chairs and sushades if you have not brought your own. Internet access costs just under $10 for 24 hours - with an 11 hour time difference with the UK this meant we were paying quite a lot for a limited window of use. There is a charge of $1.50 per day for the use of the safe and car park charge is $9.00 a day. The grill restaruant was closed when we were there, so the only option if eating in was the terrace restaurant which was quite expensive compared to other places in Lahaina, particularly for breakfast (buffet breakfast cost $17.99 per person). This can mount up if feeding hungry teenages! However there is a happy hour in the bar to take the edge off it! The hotel was apparently one of the first to be built in the area and it is showing its age a bit. However, as was described to us when we were leaving, they try to create a living room atmoshphere and in this I think they succeed, as it is cosy and welcoming and noone minds if you wear casual clothes all the time. We particulalry liked the leaving ceremony - first time visitors are given a kukui lei - a necklace of nuts which you are meant to bring back with you on your return visit whereupon you will be given a white nut to show you have returned. Some guests had a number of white nuts on their leis which shows how popular the hotel is! We wished we had spent more time at the hotel, and on the island of Maui in particular, and we certainly plan to return in the future.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane,WA", "Title": "\u201cJust got home, wishing we were there already-even with wind!\u201d", "Author": "GenaF", "ReviewID": "UR62274287", "Content": "We just returned from 6 nights at KBH. Unusually windy, sunny, cooler, less humidity than we remembered, dangerous surf advisory each day. The KBH grounds immaculate, beautiful, pool very clean. Did not snorkel, but another guest reported seeing giant turtle (described as 300# size), smaller turtles, some rays, and many colorful fish around Black Rock. They got their snorkel gear at Boss Frogs for $9 for the week. Trilogy on the beach walk at KBH also has gear, including the prescription snorkels but I didn't note the prices. Maui Dive shop in Whalers also has similar wkly deals. We didn't see as many various Dive shop coupon deals as last time. Trilogy did have a nice rental digital underwater camera that you could take as many pictures as you wanted, and they load to a CD for you. The beach has been eroded a bit since we were there two years ago, so there is a gentle drop of about 2 feet from the beach walk level to sand and then the surf. Still plenty of space to lay out in sun, play, and no one tripping over each other. With the wind and higher tide the surf was dramatic and beautiful, especially at sunset. Black Rock area calmer water and folks snorkeling despite the red flags out. The beach area there looked about the same as previously. Whales still visible and playing not too far off shore. We were returning for the second time and took advantage of the Lei Aloha program, which gave us a free room upgrade. Upon arrival we were given 5th floor Kauai wing \"ocean view\". This was supposed to have ocean view from room, but we had to stand on lanai and look to left to see ocean. We weren't satisfied with this as the web site clearly stated that the ocean view was to be from the room, the partial ocean view from the lanai. We talked with Holly at the front desk, who tried to help us and we looked at 2 other rooms. (An ocean front with two queens, which would have been $40 more a night-wonderful view in Kauai wing-but Hubby wanted king bed. One in Lanai wing, partial ocean view, but musty and not upgraded-was on the floor where folks could smoke on lanai and we started sneezing minute walked in.) We decided to stay in the original room, but I spoke with managers Salome and Kimberly, and they did give us appropriate rate. We ended up being ok with that in the end, as it was so windy we couldn't have sat on the lanai on the ocean front anyway, except for 2 days. We could hear the nightly hula show, which was nice, and see part of it from the lanai. Interestingly, we had to advocate for the \"free upgrade\" on our other trip as well. Hmm, lesson I learned is: speak up kindly. calmly, and firmly, asking for the manager right away if this is something of importance to you. There was also an offer to move to ocean view in a couple of days in the Maui wing, but we couldn't look at a similar unit. So far my experience there has taught me to view the room prior to moving luggage in. The renovations are nice in the Kauai wing. Hallway and room carpet new, new art. No funky BO hallway smell. This wing has interior corridors. The room ceilings are now all white, with a tray effect, recessed lights. We had king bed, and a day bed in our room plus the usual tables etc. The bathroom in our unit was updated, still a little mismatched surfaces, the counter and sink much lower than we are accustomed to, new carpet, new linens, new furniture-still \"island style\" and BEST of all a new mattress that was pillow top like and not hard as a board! The room had separate closet from bathroom area, where the fridge and safe are, had a door on it. No drain problems as reported by others. In the Lanai wing the closet/fridge area is open and across from the bathroom sink, with the toilet and tub/shower separate...at least room we had two years ago did. Plenty of space to put everything and then some. KBH Food:The Mixed Plate was closed. Tiki Terrace (where our breakfast vouchers were for) had a order menu and/or buffet. The buffet was a excellent variety of hot foods, fruit, pancakes, pastry assortment, cereals, yogurt, juices etc. I am now addicted to maui onion quiche, maui gold pineapple, and KBH pancakes with macadamias and coconut syrup! We used the voucher as a credit for their Sunday brunch ($20 off $36 per person). Oh my-what a spread! When we go again, if we do this, we will go closer to noon...there was so much variety and food I didn't even try some of everything. We ate at 9 AM and didn't eat the rest of the day, except some fruit in evening. We tried the mahi mahi sandwich at the Tiki Grill KBH, and it was great. The fish was fresh caught. Be aware of this while ordering at Maui restaurants...I found by asking which fish was local caught vs frozen and brought in from Japan and elsewhere. (The salmon, crab,shrimp at the KBH Sunday event very high quality, though). Be aware there are various coupons in the many brochures for the restaurants, venues, entertainment at the airport kiosk and all around. Some places have more than one coupon deal to choose from if you like. In the Whalers one there is a list of offers, not coupons (like 10% off of whole purchase at Crazy Shirt). You take in the little magazine to get the deal. They had vendors daily in the KBH lobby, and then on Tues/Weds had vendors on the lawn. Very good deals for soaps, jewelry, crafts, compared to the malls, and is same things. The craftspeople seemed willing to give \"aloha\" deal to you to encourage purchase. There was a t shirt booth that had nice quality and unique designs for $18-we didn't barter there though. FYI: there is a little borrowing library of books in the laundry area. We drove to the \"north\" up past the blowhole, clear to the one lane road. We didn't go the whole way around on it, many beautiful views and micro-climates to see. Went to Lahaina-much warmer there, no wind. Went to the Maui coffee company by the smokestack, had a little tour. Enjoyed Whalers museum more fully. Another day went down to La Perouse bay past Wailea/Makena to the lava fields, beautiful areas-supposed to be good snorkeling but very windy, high surf day we were there. Went to the winery area, upcountry sights, and followed that road pretty far...didn't meet up with the Hana road, but figure were pretty close. Winery tour good. At KBH, ask one of the staff, Sam especially, about the rock game in the lobby-fun. We really enjoyed our stay and relaxed, reconnected with each other, did something new each day from the last visit, and still have new things to try, see, experience for the next time we come. The staff, the grounds, amenities, location, warm, laid -back atmosphere, really make this place special. Visiting with other guests cool too. If you return don't forget your kukui nut lei!

It was truly a trip of a lifetime and hopefully not the last. We came all the way from New York City and were on a budget. It was our first trip ever to Hawaii and after reading many reviews we decided to go to Maui for our 4th year anniversary. We decided to book our vacation at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel due to its location (near Black Rock), price, and beach quality. Like many of you know, the hotel is located near Black Rock. This is a wonderful spot for snorkeling and spotting sea turtles (we saw 3 at a given time). Having a young child with us, snorkeling through a tour operator was not possible since most of them have an age limit for riding on the boat. This location gave my wife and I the freedom to snorkel while one of us stayed on the beach with the baby. The beach was beautiful and the quality of the sand was very nice (soft to the touch) our daughter loved the taste of it LOL. The sun was pretty intense in Maui so we recommend rash guards if your skin is sensitive. The hotel grounds are kept nice and clean. The 1st floor was undergoing renovations so you could see how outdated the place used to be . We were on the 4th floor which was already renovated. Our room had a partial ocean view (very good one at that). The bed was comfortable and large enough (king size) for the 3 of us. We did request a crib but decided not to use it since the mattress was too soft for our daughters comfort. She did not like it at all and neither did we. It was an old fashioned aluminum crib (outdated hospital style) which we used as a drying/towel rack. There was an extra twin size bed in the room which we didn't use. We did notice that the drain in the bathtub was slow, which we believed was from all the sand that had accumulated in the drain. These were minor issues to us and didn't matter at all. We ate at the Tiki Terrace and enjoyed the food and service. The price was reasonable compared to NYC standards. We had breakfast a couple times at the buffet. Once again the food was good and so was the service. We didn't get to see many shows/ activities since we were always out (car rental is a must in Maui). The housekeeper was very friendly and always cleaned the room when we got back from our daily activities. We do recommend you buy some drinks before heading back to your room since most of the vending machines were out of stock during our stay. There was also a laundry room in the hotel which came in handy for us. Parking was available at a cost ($9/day) and a few shops were available in the hotel grounds. The Whalers Village (shopping center) was a short walking distance away. There you can find restaurants and shops. Overall our trip was wonderful and worth every penny. We definitely recommend this hotel to future travelers on a budget who don't want to skip out on location. The hotel staff was very humble and friendly. They were genuine and didn't come off as people who just wanted a tip. We would definitely come back to this hotel. Other Notes: The weather was great! no rain at all since Maui is dry on that side of the island. We did the road to Hana, Haleakala crater, aquarium, Iao Valley, drove to various beaches, and also attended the Old Lahaina Luau for our anniversary. For those who have young children, it would be wise to locate some doctors who take your insurance , just in case your child gets sick. Our daughter had an ear infection and we found a pediatric facility in Lahaina just prior to our trip. We also recommend NOT to overpack! Toiletries and baby supplies are easily available at Costco, Walmart, and Kmart which are right by the airport. We recommend getting some food at Aloha mixed plate, Paia Fish Market (great fish sandwiches), Alexanders fish and chips in Kihei (great fish tacos) , Da Kitchen at the Wharf (in Front Street, Lahaina), Gazebo Restaurant in Napili (great breakfast and nice view) and for the best shaved ice go to Ululani shaved ice in Lahaina.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHawaiian soul\u201d", "Author": "travel2dive", "ReviewID": "UR61784399", "Content": "We had a great time in the most Hawaiian hotel in Maui.

This was our second time at KBH and I feel certain we will return. They upgraded us for free to a second floor with Part. ocean view and the room was comfie and simple .. similar to a holiday Inn. I don't usually like to return to a place we travel to .. I like new stuff so when I say I'll go back a third time ... it means I really like it. What I like about this hotel is ... it's cost, location, staff are very friendly, the extras (free lei, and free breakfast) and I really like they send me christmas cards every year. One of the main perks is the snorkeling ... It's really close to the best off shore snorkeling I've ever done(black rock at Ka'anapali beach and 15 minutes from Kapalua bay which is even better snorkeling. At black rock I snorkeled and saw lots of fish, huge sea turtles and this time I heard the whales sing to be every day. I will post pics and underwater video so you can hear the whales. I love to swim and snorkel but I don't like fighting the waves. The pool is not huge but it's has a deep end which is hard to find. They also give you a free breakfast everyday which is a huge bargain. We really enjoyed the path that was nice for a nightly stroll and walked alot to the restraunts and shops just 5 minute walk. when it comes to swimming in the ocean I like really tiny qentle waves and thats what we usually had there.

The food and view were great .. plus free nitely show with singer or hula .. it was fun. Negatives: There aren't many ... since I love it there. This is't the Ritz so don't expect dazzling luxury. It's small and simple but clean and comfortable.

We spent a week at this same hotel 2 years ago. You get an excellent value for what you spend at Kaanapali Beach Hotel (KBH). It is a 3 star hotel that is surrounded by hotels with higher star ratings, and with those higher star ratings typically comes with a higher cost. KBH is an older hotel, and while the hotel has been on a program of updating hotel rooms, it is hard to hide the age of the facility. What you will get is a comfortable room that is clean and for the most part quiet. It is great for a family on the go and where you plan on not spending a lot of time in your room - you are in Maui after all and you can always rest when you get back from vacation. The hotel staff make this a unique Hawaiin experience, we recognized many of the same employees from 2 years ago and many have been with the hotel for 10+ years. Some pointers if you are going to stay at KBH. Unless you positively have to be looking out at the ocean, don't book an ocean view room. You will spend most of your time looking at the ocean when you are on the beach and driving around. You can get a partial ocean view room by reserving a pool view room and then requesting a higher up floor. The room rate is cheaper and you can sit out on your lanai and see and hear the ocean just fine. You will have to pay for parking if you rent a car. There is a parking garage, but just north of the parking garage is a small ground level parking lot that has wider spaces and is right next to rooms and elevators and is more convenient. The spaces in the garage are very tight and we got door dinked on the first day. Lastly, on the last day, our plane left at 7 pm. Check out time is 11 am. We wanted to spend more time on the beach, and KBH offers a hospitality room that is available throughout the afternoon for free. It is a hotel room where you are allowed a half an hour to shower and get dressed - we took advantage of this and enjoyed an extra 4 hours on the beach. You need to sign up for it on the morning that you are checking out - the earlier the better.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe Give the KBH a Solid B+\u201d", "Author": "TomVancouverCanada", "ReviewID": "UR59971807", "Content": "Just got back from a 12 night stay at the KBH. We stayed in the 3 level low-rise building. Pro: -Beautiful spacious grounds -Plenty of lawn chairs available -Shade always available if needed -Right on the beach. Great views -Very friendly and helpful staff. The maids are terrific. -Tiki Bar is a nice place for a drink on a hot day. $4 pints and daily specials. - 10 minute bus ride to Lahaina -4 minute walk to Whalers Village Con: - The low-rise is an older wood building. Nice rooms but not very soundproof. If someone uses the shower in the floors above you...you will know it. Won't be able to hear the TV or converse easily. You can hear *everything* in the next door room. You could carry on a conversation with the people next door quite easily. -Security seems lax, especially on weekends. Groups of kids and vagrants freely wander onto the property and loiter. We didn't think it was that big of deal until I had my backpack stolen one day then rifled through the next day. The first time it was stolen it was done by a group of 4 teens. Two watched while two others grabbed the bag and passed it on to the others (as told to me by an elderly couple that watched). The bag was beside my girlfriend who had her head down (very brazen). After that I started observing the property and noticed a few times loiterers \"casing\" people to watch their lounging habits. Easily stopped if security made a few rounds and challenged people that were obviously not guests. -My only problem with the service was when I ordered a desert for takeout one night. They mentioned a service charge and I told them it wasn't for room service. They said all takeout gets a service charge ..room service or not. A little disappointing. -50 cents a minute to use the internet. I don't know what they charged for wireless. Overall a very nice place that I would visit again. One thing to mention, and everyone is probably aware of this when visiting Maui. It is not a cheap place. Usually we get a condo with a kitchen to lessen the cost.

First Floor is under construction. No distractions from it. Was surprised they charged $9 a day for parking and another buck and half for the safe. You also had to pay for a chair or lounge on the beach. $10 for so so lounge chair. $31/day for the cool wooden lounge chairs, with pads and little cabana covers. we splurged two days. it was worth it when it started to sprinkle.

Our room had not been updated in sometime and the toilet/shower portion of the washroom contained various colours of mold, yellowed caulking, peeling wallpaper and cracked drywall. There were pictures on tripadvisor of one of these washrooms but they seem to have been removed. The bed and the pillows (tiny) were not comfortable and I can sleep on anything. I went to the front desk upon arrival (Thursday) to see if we could be moved to a different room. I was told there would be nothing available until Sunday and to comeback then between 10 & 6. We were not around the hotel on the Sunday and I never heard back from the staff about a room change. I think they are used to complaints about this wing and just try to grin and bear it.

It is definitely the best value and the nicest location, It is nestled between two high priced hotels that can't hold a candle to Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is on 10 acres. Nobody ever has to go without a lounge chair. You are allowed to pull the chair anywere on the property and there is plenty of sun and shade locations. The adjoining properties only allow people to sit in a small area around their pools in close quarters. The rooms are excellent. The beds are extremely comfortable and provide for an awsome sleep. We stayed in the older wing, and chose to go for the cheapest room known as the Aloha rooms. We had a partial ocean view and had a large balcony. There is not a bad view in the place. The property is beautiful. The hotel is right on the beach. On the other side is a world class golf course and a great view of the mountains. The staff were amazing. I wanted to book an island flight to Oahu. I went to the guest services desk and was met by Malihini Keahi-Heath. She called the airport and within 5 minutes, the flight was booked at a great price. Thank you Malihini....you are awsome!! She was also very informative in all other questions. Our housekeeper, Florita was great too! She gave us excellent information on good places to check out and made sure our room was spotless every day. Thank you Florita!! All the staff members would go out of their way to help out. Everyone is very easy going at the resort. We were awoken early one morning and learned a tsunami was heading our way. There was no panic whatsover from the staff. We were informed every hour on the hour what was going on and were provided clear instructions on the evacuation plan. We were all instructed to go to the 6th floor of the tallest buiding for one hour prior to the tsunami hitting the beach. They brought up chairs and fed everyone lunch (including Maui Gold pineapple). Their calmness rubbed off on the tourists and nobody seemed to panic as a result. Thankfully, there was no damage and a few hours later, we were given the all clear to resume our vacation. Although it is not an all inclusive and it is a bit more expensive to stay there, people can do so on a budget. A refridgerator is provided in all the rooms free of charge. There is an excellent bus system. A bus stop is located 2 minutes from the hotel. For $1 you can get a 10 minute bus ride into Lahaina where you can get your groceries at Safeway. There are two malls there as well. The Whaler's Village is a small shopping mall in walking distance from the hotel. We bought fresh fruit and yogurt from the ABC store and had cheap breakfasts. The Cane and Taro is a restaurant located at Whaler's Village. On Tuesday and Wednesday's if you place your order between 5 and 6 p.m., all food is 50% off. Two of us ate gormet dinners, prawns/ steak etc and paid no more that $20 each and that included a heafty tip. Whaler's Village also has a food court with Mcdonalds, Chineese Food, a pizza place and a sub shop. Another way to dine on a budget. Another great place to eat is CJ's. A short walk up the hill behind the golf course leads to a strip mall. CJ's is like a roadhouse and had great prices. We also stumbled upon coupons from an information booth along the beach which gave us 50% the second entree. The food here is great. The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel also has excellent food but it is a bit more pricey. Probably due to the fact there is a word renowed chef working there. The Tiki Grill has hamburgs, hot dogs , onion rings etc for a reasonable price. The entertainment was fabulous. It is the only hotel that had free entertainment from 6-9 every night. There is music and some hula shows. During the day, the hotel offers numerous activites all geared to demonstrate the Hawaian culture. The beach is awsome. Lots of room for everyone. People were snorkeling by Black Rock while others were boogy boarding. We saw a huge turtle and lots of other marine life in the water right near the hotel. You don't have to pay big $$ to see any of it, its all right there. We also saw countless humpback whales right from the beach (good time to go for viewing whales is in February). Beware thought that the rip tides are very strong. If you are not a confident or strong swimmer, heed the warnings and your stay will be a safe one. The hotel will notify you everyday if there is any warnings or concerns. I do recommend the Atlantis sub. You go down to 130 ft and see a tremendous amount of marine life and a sunken ship. It was an amazing experience. You get on the sub in Lahaina. I don't recommend the taxi's though. Very expensive. You are much better off to rent a car for a few days or take the bus. We brought food and extra clothes but none of it was needed. They have washing machines and dryers available for the guests. Eveyone that stays there is considered family. Upon departing, everyone gets a special lei that is handmade by the staff. If you return to the hotel you bring your lei back and they will add a different nut to the lei.

The rooms I found to be very clean, as was the property outside. The maid service was good and the rooms cleaned as expected. The breakfast buffet was good, but the same food is served everyday with no variety or changes. The breakfast buffet was convenient and it was included in the price of my stay. The hotel offered Lei making lessons and hula lessons, among other free activities. My wife enjoyed these classes. The food in the restaurant at dinner was excellent and priced good, we ate there 4 days out of the 12 we stayed there. Overall, this is not a high class hotel. It's location is a plus and the staff is friendly. The beach is excellent and there are many activities available on the hotel site such as booking excursions. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends. Do not expect Ritz type service or first class food. This is an affordable hotel in a great location. One negative thing to say is that the noise from ajoining rooms can be disheartening. When I wake in the morning and can hear the person in the next room taking a shower it loses some appeal to the honeymoon. The plumbing is loud when your neighbor showers.

Being on the top floor, sometimes we can smell smoke inside the room if we leave the balcony door open. The staff is friendly but really not any friendlier than other hotel staff I've encountered outside of Hawaii. I didn't really get any of the Aloha warm fuzzies from them. Maybe because I was expecting more. But as I said, they are friendly and helpful. The Friday night Hula dance show is wonderful. My kids went to all the hula shows and really enjoyed them.

The hotel grounds were actually my favourite part about the hotel, large gardens where you could pull up a chair under a tree and read all day in peace if you wanted too.

The weather was very accomidating, we left our sliding door open every night and listened to the surf as we drifted off to sleep. The nightly entertainment was fun. the staff was great very polite and helpful. My wife and I are early risers, often getting up before sunrise.

It was mine and my friends first time to Hawaii! It was a great experience from the moment we checked in until the moment we departed! The room was great we were on the ground floor and looked and saw gardens, pool, bar, and a little bit of ocean! (we had aloha value). Ground floor was great to just walk out and do whatever. We had breakfast in the tiki terrace a couple of times. The 2 ladies that were always in the gift shop when I went in were great. There is a conveince store about a mile or so down the road and we stocked up on some lunch/breakfast items as well as drinks! Fridge was nice and cold! Didn't care for the magic show that much. Vendors in the lobby every morning, bought lots of stuff from the locals! The spa is awesome ladies!!!!!! Tiki bar and grill is kind of expensive but good food none the less portions are huge... Walked down to Whalers Village and they had some good restaurants (try Hula pie if restaurant offers it)... Didn't do any snorkeling at the rock, we had some bad surf a couple of days. Kept a lot of people out of the water, but it was great to see the local kids come out and take advantage of the waves! We did snorkel with the Hula Girl company they go to Honolua Bay (something like that) you can get there by car we later found out, so I would recommend the other place everyone goes to snorkel..... If you have a car when you get to the light for the entrace of all the Kanaapali hotels turn left, you are in for a real treat with all the beautiful views and scenery.... Also go to Iao Needle! That was fun our tour guide took us up there. Did a few of the classes and they were great, did Lei making the last day we left so it was a great farewell touch as well as the lei's they give you at the farewell ceremony.... The crater is cool I recommend going up there, didn't do the sunrise thing (too early) but do take a jacket it is chilly up there! Also we left at 10 pm the day we were going home so we checked out at 12 and then did road to Hana, came back down around sunset with a rainbow in the sky.. Great way to end trip!

We've considered purchasing a condo on Maui, but have decided that we'd never like it as much as simply staying at the hotel. It feels like we're coming home when we arrive in the lobby, always full of tropical flowers,see old friends on the staff, and see the view through the grass, pool and trees to the ocean as we walk to our room. We prefer ocean front, but have looked in many of the rooms and the views of the grassy area, pool and entertainment area would be equally nice. The unpretentious feel of the hotel, the graciousness of the staff, the the tropical flower gardens and mature trees and huge grassy lawn lend to a feeling of complete relaxation. My husband enjoys full sun on the beach loungers; I like a covered cabana on the beach or a simple beach lounger under a tree. It's also nice to be able to walk a very short distance to Black Rock to snorkle with sea turtles, a favorite activity. Most of the people working at the hotel are Hawaiian. There are many activities such as nightly music and Hawaiian dancing (no charge), educational walks, children's activities based around Hawaiian culture. We never fail to learn something else about the beautiful state of Hawaii and the Hawaiian people. The hotel seems to be equally pleasing to families with young children, honeymooners and couples or individuals of any age. Others have made the point that this is not a luxury hotel, but it's very well appointed with lovely carved Hawaiian furniture, beautiful artwork, nice linens, Hawaiian style quilt bedspreads, good lighting and every amenity one could want. Room maintenance is stellar. The only thing lacking for some might be room service, but it's such a short walk to the Tiki Bar and you can order food from your room and have it ready to pick up. It's so nice outside that I can't imagine wanting to eat in anyway. If you've had too much sun, there's a great selection of pay per view movies available. We always order a package including breakfast and a car; it's a very good price and their breakfasts buffets are full breakfasts with all anyone could want...and more. Having said all of this, I will tell you that prior to discovering the KBH, when my husband was in administration, we visited nearly every new luxury hotel on every island for conferences. If it was built over 10 years ago, I've been there. I've had my fill of marble bathrooms, Disneyesque courtyards with waterslides, dress codes in the lobby, etc. I'm still a bit of a hotel snob, won't stay in a chain hotel unless it's a Four Seasons, Oberoi, Aman or Fairmont. I like charming B &B's and boutique hotels, but in Maui I prefer the distinctive Hawaiian charm of the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, it's lovely staff and the \"flavor of Hawaii\". I'm already planning our next trip. We travel a lot, but have resolved to make it to Maui at least twice a year now. It's where we feel most at home. Enjoy!

Arriving at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel is always a pleasure. As always, we were warmly welcomed. The Kaanapali Beach Hotel makes you feel at home, the staff is friendly and most importantly it is organized and CLEAN! Walking into our room, you immediately notice the difference in the attention to detail, organization and cleanliness in comparison to the the Westin. The room was well organised, user friendly, clean and exactly what you need for Hawaii; a clean, organized space to dump all your stuff when you come back from the beach or pool all day. It's cleaned very well every day. The Tiki Terrace restaurant, located next to my favorite spot ( the very excellent Tiki bar & Grill) is very nice as well. We found the service and the food to be better than a comparable meal at Leilani's. An added bonus is live local Hawaian music and stories while you eat. I like that if I'm flying all the way to Hawaii, that's part of what I go for. The property is arched around an outdoor courtyard with a pool and you can basically throw a rock to the beach so you pretty much walk out of your room and you can see the beach. It's very kid friendly with lots of activities but balances it just fine for adults as well. If I want the flash, I'll go to Vegas. If I want a great room at a good price with a true local Hawaiian feel and without all the pretense I can get in the mainland US, count me in for the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. We are never disappointed. It's kind if like being in your own home, you just happen to be in Hawaii! As for the 2 nights spent at the Westin, although the Westin is considered a 4 star hotel, our room did not reflect that at all. There was mold of some sort near the a/c vent, the room was unorganized, had too much furniture for the space available and the TV was situated to the far right of the bed with a large armoir directly in front of the bed. Therefore only one person on the bed could really see the TV well. There was a table and two chairs in front of the desk the TV was on, so you couldn't really use the desk and the table also partially blocked the door to the balcony. You could see a dirty piping under the bathroom sink and the wall paper in the bathroom was starting to peel off in spots. They had a small refrigerator in the closet that had some folded up magazine paper under one side of it to keep it balanced. It was clear that interior decorating 101, attention to detail and general management oversight of the property was siginificantly lacking. To top it off, when our waiter handed us our menu at the restaurant, there was a cockroach on it. Seriously. It just din't, in anyway, match our expectations.

I wanted an authentic Hawaiian hotel that was in Lahaina area. This fit the bill. Yes, this hotel was on the older side, but the amount of effort and customer service that was provided cannot be matched. The staff try really hard to make you feel a part of the family and we were always greeted in a friendly manner. You get a welcome breakfast on the first or second day on your stay. The welcome breakfast wasn't all that great because it was just a buffet that consisted of scrambled eggs, potatoes, cereal, fruit, juice and coffee. It was however, a very nice gesture. They took this time to tell you about the activities around the island and which tour companies were available. The staff also provided information as to what to watch out for, example - if you were to add this option to your excursion, keep in mind it's not free and this is the price for it. (Insider tips I would tell my friends or family if I were to tell them about excursions I've been on) This was something that this hotel didn't have to do, but they chose to do so and I found it thoughtful. The rooms are decent size and I was fine with it. There isn't much to do at the hotel in terms of nightlife though. There is a show performed at night, but no one ever hung around their bar, so my husband and I just went to sleep around 9PM every night. That actually worked out since it forced us to wake up early every morning. The pool wasn't very big, but it was cute since it was in the shape of a whale. The best part of the hotel was the location. I enjoyed the beach quite a bit and was barely ever at the pool. My husband jogged on the beach every morning and he loved it. There was no room service and parking is $9.00 a day. Laundry and internet aren't free either. We stayed at another hotel in Maui and all this was free, except the room service of course, but I'm not sure if that's the norm. It sure made the trip more relaxing knowing that you didn't have to shell out more money though. There is only one thing I absolutely hated in this hotel are the pillows. I had a hard time sleeping since the pillows had no support and it was worst than sleeping on a bag of marshmellows. Other than that, I thought the service was fantastic in this hotel.

Room spacious but not luxorius (comparable to best western or similar). We stayed in room 146 which I would recommend due to closeness to parking garage, pool, ice machine and house cleaning (where you get beach towels). My family enjoyed the magic dinner show held at the hotel. My 7 and 5 year old boys got bored of the pool fairly quickly; the water was cold and no slides or anything exciting. The Sheraton next door has a much nicer pool for kids IMO. Count on spending additonal $9.00 a day for parking or $11.00 if you choose valet. Some of the negatives I experienced included no pool side drink service. The pool is right next to the Tiki bar so I expected to be able to lounge poolside and have a server come by to take drink orders. The \"happy hour\" was lame IMO.

Our check in was smooth, the staff are friendly, the valet parking boys are especially helpfull with some tips on what to do, Our room was a 1 King size bed on the 4th floor, was nice and spacious, air cond, good size bathroom, fridge, iron, TV, etc. we were given a gift bottle of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon, nice touch KBH Mahalo! when you check in you get an invite to a free breakfast and orientation of the hotel which we did and was good, the concierge is nice and friendly who hosted the brekkie and we were treated to a hello hula and songs from the staff, and a brief magic show by the in house magician which was great, worth your time. you learn you can do free Hawaiian activites during the day and what happens where in the hotel grounds. They recommend Trilogy to do your tours/activities outside the hotel while on maui and have a Trilogy info/rentals shop outside the hotel on the beach. We didnt use them. I will cover them further down. there was renovations during our stay but it wasnt a problem.In the evenings there is a live Hawaiian band that play 6-9pm every night and do try to catch a show they are amazing. Have a drink from the Tikki bar'n'grill and a snack while you enjoy the music. On the whole its a great hotel for your money. now some do's and donts! Go to black rock on dusk to see the cliff diver light the torches and say a prayer every evening, once the sun has gone down walk along the beach and look for the luminescant lights in the sand right on the shore line, trust me ive never heard of it or seen any reviews on this but theres something magical in the sand right on dark there. Go to Black rock and snorkell... you WILL see turtles every day right there 5 minutes from your hotel. walk around the hotel grounds, the flowers and gardens are beautiful, the shops in the lobby arent dear for a momento of your stay. Do the Aloha ceremony before you leave. but if your from Australia dont take your lei home customs will bin them, keep them at the hotel for your next visit where they will add another seed for every visit.(we did). And some Donts... Dont expect Maui to be as cheap as Oahu... Dont expect your parking to be free... $9.00 a night or $11 plus tips for valet which is a bit steep. dont bother with the resturant there, we tried a small breakfast and it was over $40!! before the tip (which they expect atleast 17% tips and the service by the resturant/bar staff wasnt 17% good) dinner menu is dearer but we gave it a miss. But the breakfast was nice. Dont expect your room safe to be free.. they will charge you and its not even a pin code safe ( but you do get an option to use it or not which is good). Dont expect free internet, $3.oo minimum and 50 cents a minute and 50 cents a page, we were not impressed. and the ATM was out of order for 2 days. If you go to the beach you have the option to hire everything you might need but its not cheap, the shady beach chairs are a good idea but they'll cost ya! we didnt bother, sunblock works just fine but for families maybe worth doing. we made some enquiries at the Trilogy desk for activities/ beach hire, but thet are way too expensive eg, parasail for 10 minutes $75.00 each!! dont bother with the Whalers village shops close by, unless your going to the ABC shop there, waste of time.

Breakfast buffets were good with varieties; the rental from the hotel were on average 15% cheaper than those from Sheraton (e.g. Cabana was $32 per day here, and $40 over the Sheraton). We had such a great time, and I was so sad when I had to leave. I also regreted that I didn't have time to attend a few of the Hotel's complimentary classes.

The swimming pool isn't very exciting. So if you are more of a pool person than beach person, you may want to check out the other bigger hotels on the Ka'anapoli beach, such as Westin. I will avoid any of those Aloha rooms facing the parking lot; they are very close to the pakade, and could be noisy. Also, I didn't find any fitness facilities except a pingpong table in a cornor.

I guess I will no longer rely solely on Tripadvisor. Stayed for 6 nights. When you arrive at the KBH, you get a cheesy/motel like feel. I am wondering if this is what everyone keeps referring to as the \"Most Hawaiian Hotel\". I think the word \"hotel\" is misleading. You have to walk outside to your room, which to me feels like \"motel\". The rooms are small and functional. The lanai is tiny but adequate for sitting outside for a bit. Rooms are kept clean but I do have to note that the shower head looked like it had never seen a sponge. Kind of gross. The bed was plain awful. We kept talking about missing our chiropractor on vacation. Not a good sign. Sleeping on a slab of concrete would have been more comfortable. Parking is expensive. We chose to self park since valet used the same garage and there was plenty of spots. You have to get pool/beach towels at housekeeping or at a shack on the beach. The towels are no bigger than the bath towels and they make you sign a slip as if you are going to steal them. Our package included breakfast. The Sunday brunch was fabulous and I highly recommend it. I do not recommend the Mixed Plate near the lobby. The food tasted like cafeteria food and the place needs to be remodeled badly. We ate at the Tiki Terrace and we should have gone there every morning. The pool--shaped like a whale but small. Lots of kids floating around and sandy by the end of the day. Never saw anyone cleaning it. The beach--very nice but that shack that gives you towels rips you off by charging you for loungechairs/cabanas. There is a fixed price so if you are not out there all day until 4:30, you get the same price. The lounge chairs at the pool were \"free to use\". The staff was always smiling, friendly and happy. We never made it to the Welcome Breakfast. Went on a few tours and were given wrong information by the tour desk. Note: It is cold on the sunrise tour to Haleakala--a beach towel will not suffice!! Take 2 blankets from the room. And how can I forget--our wakeup call for Haleakala was 10 minutes late, giving us 10 minutes to get ready for our 2:20 pick up time. Imagine if we missed the tour that we woke up for in the middle of the night. We were also given wrong info about the Road To Hana. Roads were closed, there were delays but nothing major. The location is ideal--within walking distance to stores and restaurants at Whalers Village. Spent most evenings on Front St. Recommend Kimo's--fresh fish, great service, great view. Ate there two nights in a row. Also recommend Aloha Mixed Plate for Hawaiiain food and relief from the exorbitant prices everywhere else. Went to the Westin for spa services. The salon located at KBH looked scary. After walking through the Westin, we were so jealous and kept talking about how comfy we would have been in their Heavenly Beds. We realized that we know what we like and we need to stick to it. We missed the activities at the hotel as we were out exploring on our own. The farewell is a nice touch and we were given a kukui nut lei to wear. I now understand why the KBH is a 3 star but am still perplexed as to how it is so high on the list.

We truly enjoyed our stay and the staff was very friendly. In fact, they went out of their way to help us regardless of if it's their job or not. As an example, we attended the complimentary welcome breakfast buffet -- staff from all depts presented and gave the \"ohana\" feeling. There was no pressure to sign up to any of the events they presented. We won a free dinner coupon, which we used for lunch at the Mixed Plate restaurant. When we were there, the cashier was not available but the lady from cust service dept was getting her lunch and noticed that we were waiting to pay. She stopped what she was doing to help us. Talk about customer service! This is not a Hyatt or Prince Hotel -- It's \"old\" hawaii and gives you a sense of \"ohana\" (family) feeling. The staff is wonderful and we even talked to Keiki and his wife -- they have a table presenting hand-made HI weapons and jewelry. Get to know them -- attend the presentation and you'll have a better understanding of the real Hawaii and it's traditions, culture, history, etc. Location is awesome! The hotel is only a few steps away from Hula Grill and Leilani restaurant as well as shopping center. There's a running/walking path. Watch the sun set behind the Black Rock. It's a great place to be! Every night, they left cookies on our bed. Everyday, there's a voice mail to let us know of hotel events. There's also washer/dryer, which is convenient since we went to Kauai the next week. Since it's our anniversary, they even welcomed us with a bottle of champagne. Also, instead of welcoming each guest with a lei, they do it when you leave. Unfortunately, due to our early flight to Kauaia, we missed this event. If you want to be a tourist and expect to be a \"diva\" don't stay here....if you want to be a local, and learn about HI's culture and tradition, then this is a great place to be. p.s. we filled out the comment card before we left. We gave credit to the staff who've helped made our stay memorable. We rec'd a letter from the manager letting us know that our comments would be shared w/ their staff.

The pool is a little crowded with families and the bar scene was a little cheesy, although the beer and drinks were very fairly priced as compared to other spots we visited. Worth noting, they have a couple of restaurants with descent food, nothing great. And, no room service. They also have a hut on the beach where you can rent any thing you want for the water, and charge it to your room. Again, the beach was just wonderful. You can also walk along the beach or walkway to other places to eat and shop, like Whaler's Village. All in all, this was a clean, friendly place with a beautiful beach.

A couple overheard us planning our Hawaii trip and moseyed over to our table to ask if we would like to know of a great place to stay on Maui. Well, they could not say enough good about the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel, its location, its staff and its style of hospitality. Not to mention, it was more cost competitive than many hotels in the Lahaina area. This couple returns annually and stays for a few weeks, they told us. Wonderful hospitality and sharing of Hawaiian culture and history. We stayed for five nights at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel - Feb 15 to Feb 19 - and this was a major enjoyment during our total three week stay in Hawaii. Everything about the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel made us happy to be there. Things that impressed us included: welcome buffet breakfast and songs by staff; daily buffet breakfasts; really good advice on how to get around on Maui; the convenient parking garage; our room and its lanai; the Tiki Bar and the nightly musicians; whale tails visible from the beach; the beach itself and the beach walking path; how we were treated by phone when making reservations; our greeting upon arrival and our special departure with kokui nut leis. The leis hang in our library to remind us of this very special place on Planet Earth and in our hearts. We hope to stay at this hotel again- sooner than later. The hotel lacks the very things that we do not enjoy such as - hundreds of deck chairs and loungers all lined up for the tourist; giant, exotic swimming pool with attractions for kids; overly fancy retaurant with fancy prices; fru fru decor. If you seek that style hotel, then Ka'anapali Beach is not the place for you. On the other hand, we loved the large, park-like courtyard with its many trees and small swimming pool. This hotel does not need a fancy pool and play area because it is right on a superb, wide, sandy beach with a great view and ease of access from your room. Some of those fancy, modernistic hotels do not have much beach at all. The long, beachwalk passes close to the hotel and you can stroll along the beach all the way to the shops and the other hotels. The best thing about Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is the Staff. We cannot extoll them enough. The staff has deep roots in Hawaii and each person could share many things with us involving places to see, meaning of Hawaiian words, history of Hawaii, art of Hawaii and much more. For example, we debated whether or not to make a drive to a village where the map indicated the road might be very hard to travel. Well, one of the staff lives in that very village and we were given helpful information and enjoyed our drive and the peope we met while there. Each night, we enjoyed the three piece Hawaiian band on the outdoor stage, the drinks, the conviviality. Morning breakfast buffets were a great value and we would be full enough so that our next meal might be late afternoon. We stayed in the older Moloka'i Wing, first floor with doors to our lanai and a small view of the beach which was just a few steps away. There was a small guest laundry on the floor which we used. Anything we needed was easy to get from the staff. And, the staff m ade us feel at home. It felt like we were staying with people and not with a corporation. Highly recommended.

The hotel offered complimentary classes on hula dancing, ukelele,sand art, lei making, notecard, story telling, and garden walks. Not only were the activities fun my family and I were given detailed information on the culture and how the activities relate to their history. Malihini,staff member, taught most of our classes and her pride in sharing her wealth of knowledge embraced us all.

We stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and it was perfect. It's known as the most authentic hotel in Kaanapali. The price was extremely reasonable (especially when comparing to the Westin, Hyatt, etc.). And, you are in the middle of all the hotels. You can head out to the beach from the hotel, walk to Whalers Village, or just hang out by the pool (good size, just needs to be a little updated when you compare it to the pool at the Westin with a water slide for kids). We stayed for 5 days and had plenty to do. Definitely rent a car to explore the island. We spent one day driving the Road to Hana. It's an extremely windy road with one lane bridges and beautiful lush scenery. Pass the town of Hana and head to the Waimoku waterfall and the seven sacred pools to take dip. You can take a 4 mile hike (even my 6 and 9 year old came along, no complaints) and pass through this amazing bamboo forest to reach the waterfall. On another day we took Captain Steve's rafting trip to Lanai. Although it was a little pricey, it was SO worth it! They serve you breakfast and lunch on the boat and take you to see tons of dolphins and great snorkeling spots. We also took a day to just do very little, relax by the pool..go to the beach...rent surfboards to surf (you can rent these near the Westin). We had a blast!! Maui never disappoints and we can't wait to go back!

We tried out all three restaurants on the premise and found the food delicious and reasonable. We also went to some of the free classes they offer and loved the fact that we were just footsteps to the beach and to the Trilogy Shack where you can get towels and rent cabanas, fins, snorkel, etc. They also offer great scuba, snuba and snorkel trips.

This was our first trip to Maui & was a late honeymoon/ 40th B-day for me. Instead of just reviewing this Hotel, I'm going to review my whole trip, so bare with me. Hopefully, you can find some helpful info. in all this. We booked the trip trough Expedia which seemed to be on par price wise with the other on-line travel agencies. Some of the features I liked while booking was the option to upgrade cars, rooms, non-stop flight etc. Travel Guides: We took \"Maui Revealed\". A lot of great info. Also, all over the Island are travel guides with maps. These are filled with discount coupons for different food and attractions. Flight: We took a non-stop flight on United. If your tall, pay for the $50 upgrade to Economy plus. You'll appreciate the extra leg room. Also, the emergency exits have the most leg room, but you must be willing to help out in an emergency. When you check-in with your flight prior to departure, you may be able to get these emergency exit seats without having to pay the upgrade (we did on the flight over). Packing: Pack light. United charges $125 for over 50 pounds. But I found they didn't really pay too close attention to this. They also charge for each booked bag (cheaper if paid before hand on-line). We brought more than we needed. I had no need for slack or a coloered shirt. If you do an activity at a hight altitude, it can get cold. So take that into consideration. But there's no reason not to bring back a nice Maui sweatshirt you bought. If you plan on buying shirts or other clothing in Maui, just wear it while your there. This will allow plenty of room in your suitcase for those souvenir bring backs. The flight offered only free drinks and everything else you had to pay for (although head sets are now free and the jack will work with your ipod head phones). They offfered food for purchase, but if you want to save money, bring your own snacks or sandwiches (TSA will make you ditch your drinks). Car rental: If your going to drive most the Island and spend time in the car, make sure your car is big enough and comfortable. Also beware of upgrades they'll offer you. Know what your insurance or credit card will cover before you go, or you may end-up paying for extra not needed coverage. We were offered a convertible upgrade, but with temps in the high 80's, I wanted air conditioning. I also didn't feel at a loss without a convertible, but it's a personal preference. Food and items to bring to the hotel: There's a Costco and Wal-mart on the way to the hotel. We stopped at Wal-mart and picked-up some snacks. We also picked-up a case of water to leave in the car & a case to leave in the room. The rooms have mini-friges, but no Microwave. Don't forget utensils (paper plate, towels, bowls, spoons, knife, etc,). We also picked-up some rollout sand mats for just under two bucks. These we just left behind. Cheap towels may also be a good idea if you plan to checkout different beachs. The hotel offers free towels to use for the beach, but they're the same as the shower towels in the rooms. And if you didn't bring your own snorkel gear, this may be the time to pick some up. Sets sell for $30 to $50. Rental's I saw where $8.00 for two hours. And don't forget sunblock , hats and watershirts to swim/snorkel in that are SPF rated. The sun will eat you up. The Hotel: Staff was friendly, and the room was clean. But this is an older hotel. If you like a new hotel that's more upscale, this isn't it. It worked fine for our needs. Our bacony room was on the top floor (6th) and faced the pool. You had to stand on the balcony to see the ocean (I think they consider this a ocean view). We spent ever morning out there feeding the birds and mapping out our day. We also sat out there at night enjoying the music from the band that plays every night. No major problems, but they were doing construction upgrades to the wing next to ours. And one of the two elevators wasn't working for about 4 days. The grounds here are larger than any of the other hotels I saw. A ton of grass area complete with chairs. Also, several trees to lay under if you want out of the sun. They have a nice activities rental hut right at the boardwalk. This is were you get your towels for the beach. Or can rent snorkel gear, booging boards, etc. And there's a shower to rinse off sand right near the hut on the boardwalk. The beach in this area is nice and big compared to the beach area in front of some of the newer hotels. The waves are just small shorebreak. Further down the beach are some nice surfing waves. But as you drive Hwy 30 into Kaanapali, you'll see other nice beaches with surfing waves. The other end of the beach takes you to Black Rock. This has some excellent snorkeling. We even saw sea turtles here. The Hotel offers you a free buffet breakfast. They give some great info. at this breakfast on activivites around the island and a few other things. And there's a ton of different free activities offered at the hotel you can sign-up for. They also give you a checkout lay. Parking is $9.00 a day, but my room safe was free. And since it was our honeymoon, they gave us some free champagne, chocolates & cookies with bed turndown service. Very nice touches. The prices at the hotel gift shop were on par with everywhere else. Internet is available in the lobby (at a cost) if you just need to check your e-mail. Food: The hotel offers a few different buffet choices. They also have a mixed plate restaurant, but we never made it inside. There's plenty of places to eat for $20 to $40, but if you look around, you'll find cheaper places. Subway and Round table pizza are only five minutes away. The tiki grill at the hotel isn't a bad deal. $10 burgers and 3 chicken or beef skewers for $8. And the bar offerers drink specials. Avoid the food court at Whalers village (the Mc Donalds is probably ok), but the rest tasted or looked horrible. There's also plent y of outdoor farmer markets to check out. There's a real nice one on Lower Honopali'ilani Rd towards Napili. Complete with free tasting. Choose between 10 different jams or dips. Also plenty of fresh fruit or breads to buy. Check out Mama's Fish House on your way to or coming back from Hana. Excellent food, view, and atmosphere. It really isn't that expensive when you compare it to what they're charging at the hotel restaurants. And for breakfast, try Pineapple bananna pancakes w/ macadania nuts and coconut syrup at the Gazebo. Park in the Napili Shores parking lot and follow the signs. Other Hotels: You can walk the boardwalk all the way down to the last resort in this area. This is where you'll see the newer hotels in the area. Some are definetly more kid friendly with beautiful pools. But I noticed there wasn't much area to hangout in and this included the beach in front of these hotels. So I guess the trade off is newer/nicer rooms, but more kids and crowds. We booked several adventures: Make sure you know the location of the outfit you booked with in correlation to the hotel. No sense driving two hours away to do something they offer 5 minutes form the hotel (we did this with Ziplining). We drove two hours to the Skyline Eco-Adventure at Haleakala, when it's offered by the same outfit 10 minutes away in Kaanapali. I was very pleased with this Zip line company. We also took the Pacific Whale Foundation boat to Molokini & Turtle Arches for snorkeling. I recommend joining the Pacific Whale Foundation, as the savings on this trip by being a member, pays for the membership. And you get a free shirt. This seemed like a very professional outfit, and I would use them again. Lu'au: We did the Old Lahaina Lu'au, which is just off Front St. in Lahaina right next to the Aloha mixed plated (our waiter at Aloha mixed plate was also a dancer at the lu'au). Everyone we talked to recommended this Lu'au, and we weren't disapointed. There's also the Feast at Lele, that offers dancing and food from Hawai'i, Tonga, Tahiti, and Samoa. The Old Lahaina being just Hawaiian. If you go during the fourth of July: There's a fireworks display in Old Lahaina. And fireworks are permitted on the beach and can be purchased at Wal-mart (wish i had known ahead of time). Road to Hana: Your choice. We just went to mile marker 2. Walked a mile inland to the waterfall there. Wife swam in the pond. If you want that jungle feel but don't want to do the road to Hana, we found an area about 15 minutes from Kaanapali. The parking area to Honolua bay (excellent snorkeling) is like a jungle. This is just past Napili. You have to walk through this thick jungle vegetation on a trail just to get to the bay. Complete with wild roosters (which seem to be all over the Island). Sunday Service: The hotel offers a non-denominational service. I also noticed several of the other hotels setting-up services. Westside Calvary Chapel is only 5 minutes up the road. Early service is in their new building & the late service is held down the road on one of the small beaches off Hwy 30. Overall this is a nice Hotel and I wouldn't hesitate in staying here again. After driving around most of the Island, I felt Kaanapali was the best place to stay on the whole Island. I hope this info. helps with your trip.

I give the hotel alot of credit for investing in their employees (they attend Hawaiian culture classes), and it is evident that they are treated well.

It departs from a kiosk right on the Kaanapali property.

The hills that you climb to get to the zip lines are quite dusty and the dirt is red, and doesn't wash out of clothes. I made the mistake of wearing newly purchased clothes.

There was some remodeling of the 5th floor being done, but I can't say that it bothered us as they started mid-morning and we were always on our way out for breakfast and to do things. We both thought the food was great at the Tiki Terrace, The Tiki Grill, and at the Kaanapali Mixed plate. The Sunday Champagne Brunch was absolutely to die for, though, and was probably the best food extravaganza I've ever experienced. They had table after table of various foods set up in a room and it was amazing (and all you could eat and drink of champagne or other nonalcoholic beverages if you choose)! It included steamed seafood (and raw oysters!), various meats, including ones that can be carved right off the bone, salads galore, and various fruit that you can dip in the flowing chocolate fountain if you want. If you stay here, don't miss it! Food at the hotel isn't cheap, particularly at the Tiki Terrace, although the Kaanapali Mixed Plate was quite affordable compared to many restaurants we ate at in Lahaina, but it is buffet dining, and both my husband and I thought the food was very good. I would consider the hotel more casual in nature overall, which suited our style. There is no exercise room or fancy amenities, although we did get fresh exotic flowers put in our room during our stay. The pool is small by some people standards, but I really didn't see alot of people using it so it wasn't crowded. You do have to pay a parking fee of $9/day, $1.50/day for use of the keyed safe in the room, and for internet usage ( we didn't use it so I don't have the cost). Again, I can't say enough about the friendliness of all of the staff, and our maid service was excellent (thank you Lina).

They empasize that this hotel is the \"most Hawaiian hotel,\" and i agree with them; during my stay I felt that I have learned a lot about the cultural aspect of the Hawaiian traditions. There is an 'Ohana Fun center and guest services where the hotel provides complimentary Hawaiian activities for no cost (activities such as lei making, hula lessons...).

The view showed the beautiful garden in the court yard, a glimps of the beach as well as the pool (we were able to see whether or not the pool was busy or not). The view east of the hotel room was spectacular---with many beautiful valleys and the garden around the hotel. The first day we arrived, a rainbow was displayed on the east :) Cons: I would say that security in this hotel is not the best. I feel this way because the entire hotel is not connected to each other. So, in order to get to the lobby you would have to walk outside to get there. And anyone from outside can access the elevators. Another negative aspect is the \"complimentary\" internet access they said they would provided. I thought that the Wi-Fi would be \"complimentary\" in the lobby, but I was wrong. There is internet access-- if you pay $9.95 per day or use the computers in the lobby and pay per minute.

We read reviews here and though most were generally positive, there were a few negative ones that made us a little unsure of what to expect. I think your perspective of this hotel depends on your what you plan to do while in Maui. If you are interested in getting an authentic Hawaiian feel, learning about the culture, exploring the island, or doing outdoor activities, this hotel would be one for you. However, if you are looking for a place where you can spend most of your time hanging out and lounging around the hotel, a more resort-type experience, like room service, spa, fancy restaurants, etc, this probably would not be the best fit. The pros of the hotel: The staff/guest service employees are all very helpful, kind, and friendly. They extend the warmth of the Hawaiian culture while providing quality service. The complimentary activities such as the activities/information desk, lei-making, pineapple cutting demo, nightly music/entertainment, informative welcome breakfast buffet (not pushing any certain companies, just helpful hints to customize your time and enjoyment to what you want) and other Hawaiian cultural activities are great as well. The grounds of the hotel are nicely maintained and there is quite a bit of shade from the trees-great for those who want to relax outside but not broil in the sun (I noticed other resorts didn't have a lot of trees or shade on the grounds). The pool is not large and extravagant, but it wasn't crowded. The lanai was spacious and comfortable. The Tiki Bar had a great atmosphere. Didn't try the other restaurants-the Deli Corner at the hotel had a decent selection snacks/drinks. The macadamia nut cookies they left on your pillow in the evening were delicious! The location of the hotel is great. The beach is very nice, soft sand, gorgeous clear water (not rocky at the bottom). You can see Black Rock from the beach front. Close to lots of activities, shopping (we walked down to Whaler's Village frequently-less than 5 minutes), water sports, and dining. Parking ($9) is very close to the hotel. The rooms are not huge, but comfortable enough for our needs. The style/decor is fine (not a big deal for us). The cons of the hotel: We stayed in the Moloka'i wing, which I believe has not been updated. They are updating the hotel (we never heard any noise though), so the other wings may be improved. The beds were a little small-not queen size. The toilet/shower area is a little tight and could use a little update (the sink/counter outside of the toilet/shower were a good size and fine). Not a fancy or ultra-modern hotel. We would definitely stay again. Made us feel like family.

It was thanks to the tripadvisor reviewers that we chose to stay here - thank you all who have posted. It's important to be aware upfront, that this is the \"grand daddy\" of the hotels on this strip. It might need a lick of paint here or there but for comfort, value, location, service, facilities and the most beautiful team of people you'll ever come across, then this is the place to stay. This hotel would be a hit for all groups - families, honeymooners and those who want a bit of a tipple, there is a great cocktail bar for you just next to the pool. The hotel is a U shape so that the pool, Tiki Bar, Tiki Restaurant, sunbathing areas, chess area (giant chess with coconuts as markers) among others, are all facing on to the beach. This makes you feel that no matter where you are staying, you are very close to the beach - which you are anyway as it's absolute beach front. We chose one of the cheaper options of accommodation and were thrilled. We received room # 269 of the Kaui wing which although wasn't directly facing the ocean, we certainly enjoyed easily looking right for beautiful views of the ocean from our room. The room was quite a large size. The bathroom was great although it has a slight design flaw with the door - but if you keep the door shut when you're in it there's no problems, we just happen to shower with the door open. We really loved our cocktails at the Tiki Bar and we also had dinner one night at the Tiki Restaurant. There is also a magic show dinner if you want - we had a preview and it looked pretty good. If we'd had more time we'd have gone. The absolute highlight of this beautiful hotel was the staff, particularly the Guest Relations staff. A strikingly beautiful Hawaiian lady (sorry, I couldn't remember her name) has gorgeous long hair and you will see do a hula dance on stage at the evening show, i think at 6pm. She is also the host of the farewell ceremony which is significant in it's meaning but she makes it a spiritual event to experience. She was a beautiful warm person and we loved meeting her. There is also a welcome breakfast that you'll be invited to. Yes it's a free cooked breaky but the stage show is informative and fun and the host is hilaroious. If you can pronounce his name at reception the rumour is you'll receive big discounts! 5 minutes walk down the beach to the left is Whaler's Village. Here are a heap of shops and restaurants - and also a food court. We had a few meals here for dinner (chinese or pizza etc) and for breaky although there was a mcdonalds we went to Nick's in the same group of shops - he makes fantastic hot cooked breakfasts for about $7 and breaky next door in the same group of shops for smoothies. It's very inexpensive and you eat so much you'll be fine til dinner! We will be returning to Maui and instead of staying at Paia (convenient for my windsurfer hubby) we will stay here because it is just so good. The sunsets on the beach in front of the hotel can't be beat, Whaler's Village is close, Tiki bar's cocktails are delicous, the hotel is lovely and comfortable - but the happy and lovely staff take such pride in their jobs that there is such a good feeling about them and staying there.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAuthentic Hawaiian Experience\u201d", "Author": "ohana00", "ReviewID": "UR32181667", "Content": "Absolutely a tremendous hotel to experience the authentic Hawaiian experience..from the amazing knowledgeable friendly staff to the excellent location on Kaapanali Beach, this hotel offers everything for you to enjoy.

That was our first trip to Maui but since then we have been back to the Hawaiian Islands four more times. We always visit two islands each trip but we always include Maui as one because it is our favorite. May 18th we went back and spent six days on Oahu and seven on Maui. As usual while planning our trip we checked the reviews of hotels and did a lot of research. We have stayed in the Kaanapali area on each of our visits but never at the same hotel. After much research this time we decided to try the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and now we never again need to spend the time reading reviews. Most of the other hotels we stayed at were much larger and had more \"glitz\", but none (in our opinion) could hold a candle to this one. We had a partial ocean view, which was exceptional. Our room was clean and very nice and included a small refrigerator which more than suited our needs. The beach was excellent although most of our stay we had red beach flags and did not spend a lot of time in the ocean. The pool (which we did use a lot) was small but was not crowded and was very nice. Our stay included breakfast each morning, which was very good and was varied. I guess you could say the hotel had all of the things you would expect. What sets this hotel apart is the atmosphere. All of the hotel staff, maids, grounds keepers, bartenders, front desk workers, valets, gift shop workers, everyone, were the greatest people you could ask for. There is no way our stay could have been any better and the staff of this hotel, along with the small (REAL) Hawaiian atmosphere of the grounds is what made the difference. We will be going back almost every year and we have found our hotel. There is no longer any reason to spend hours going over reviews. I just hope nothing changes. There was remodeling going on in two of the wings while we were there.

And the following features helped me look past small annoyances: - excellent beachfront location - fun regional touches - free sunset hula shows - Hawaiian activities - Hawaiian meals - performances of Hawaiian songs and dances by the staff This property is a throwback to Old Hawaii. It offers a real change of pace. That it's close to golf, tennis, shopping and all of Kaanapali's attractions is icing on the cake. The landscaping and outdoor facilites aren't amazing, but the courtyard with a large lawn and a whale-shaped pool facing the placid beach is nice. The terrace restaurant roasts a spitted pig every Friday as part of its luau ritual. Again, it's not fantastic, but it's above average and the atmosphere is solid. The tiki bar in the courtyard showcases Hawaiian music and torch-lighting ceremonies We highly recommend splurging for an oceanfront unit in the Molokai Wing. The views are amazing and compared to other similar vistas, the rates are relatively low.

The good news was two things, in the room, it did not have this odor and we left the patio door open anytime we were in the room and we could not smell it - so the only time we could smell it was when the room door opened - such as to get towels etc. The smell was awful enough though that I immediately found a second entrance closer to my hotel room just so that I did not have to expose the family to the smell. So the room itself was nice enough. I never found it dirty and I am a bit freaked out by all those 20/20 hotel expose's but it did seem to be clean enough to not have me feeling scared to touch things. The pool is wonderful - especially if you have small children. About 50% of the pool is between 2-3 feet deep so the little one's can learn to walk in the water and enjoy it, like a giant bathtub for them (but not as hot and filled with chlorine). The Chlorine is needed however because the bathrooms for the pool appear to be in the hotel lobby and I did not see people (children) getting out to use the bathrooms. Needless to say, it is heavily chlorinated but very enjoyable. (yes - gross I know but all public pools have kids peeing in them - so what are you going to do?). The beach is very enjoyable at the hotel and there is a nice boardwalk that is just before the beach which makes for a nice night walk.

There were tiny bugs, no bath, old safe (which btw we had to pay to use as well as the car park) sticky furniture, the list goes on. I have spent days in travel lodges that were cleaner! We got moved to another room which was a bit better however our view was of the contruction yard. After two days we moved to the Sheraton, 100 times better! I wouldn't be so angry if I payed alot cheaper to stay in Ka'anapali beach hotel but i didn't, the rates were only a few dollars cheaper than the 4 star hotels nearby. If your young, modern etc don't stay here, pls! I understand it is a family, traditional hotel, that doesn't mean cash in the profit and don't update the hotel since the 70s.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cA great place and value\u201d", "Author": "wownewjersey", "ReviewID": "UR28432219", "Content": "The location of this hotel is awesome..near Black Rock for snorkeling, whalers village,,excellent beach, & trilogy is located on site.

We didn't know how family-friendly it would be since we had only visited there as twenty-somethings. We had a wonderful time in 1998 and a wonderful time in 2009. The children's passport program was one of the highlights of our visit. The kids loved learning their Hawaiian names, collecting stamps and getting little \"happys\" along the way, such as water bottles, beach backpacks, little radio flashlights, rubber bracelets, etc. The gift for completing the passport was great. We loved making leis and taking hula lessons. Seeing my husband concentrate so hard while doing hula was priceless! All of the staff members were so nice. My husband said they acted like they'd been to Disney school even though they hadn't. They're just nice because they're happy to be living in paradise and they seem to love the people who come visit them. One of the staff members cried on our last day. I felt like it was the last day of camp! We loved the wonderful breakfast buffets, the nightly hula show, and the great cabanas on the beach. The rooms were big. 2 double beds and a twin daybed. Very comfortable for a family of 5. The rooms were nice but not fancy. I'm picky about staying in a nice room and this was nice. Pretty furniture, thick carpet, super-clean. We stayed on the first floor which I loved. We just walked right out our back door to the pool, the beach, the tiki bar, or to the stage where something fun was always going on. There were Macadamia cookies on our bed every night. One day there was a fresh fruit platter in our fridge. Another day we got a box of chocolate covered macadamias. It seemed like we were constantly showered with gifts. We were made to feel so special all throughout our stay. KBH is known as the most Hawaiian hotel. It's so true.

I set it up on the cabinet so the cookies wouldn't be so hard to eat later when I came back. Before I made my way out I discovered mold...yes...MOLD!

We were there from the end of October through the first of November on a spontaneous trip with airfare only $406 from Oklahoma. We celebrated Halloween in Lahaina which was fun. My husband found this room for $150 night and since our airfare was such a good deal we decided to splurge. It was by far the most expensive place we had stayed having very recently stayed on Oahu, Kauai and in the Virgin Islands for just under $100. The grounds had a lot of tiki theme which, being into exotica and tiki fans was fun. The parking garage, lobby and the gift shop were very nice. Our room was o.k. Had a mini-fridge and little balcony and king-size bed. They had a bottle of champagne (albiet $7 we saw it at the store in town) waiting for us for our anniversary. The shower was stand-up only and a little small but big enough to do the job. The main complaint was that our room was on the 2nd floor next to the stairwell and many, many people including bell hops dragged their wheeled carts and baggage up and down the stairs rather than picking them up (there was no elevator in our buiding). This was HORRIBLE. The noise began and 4:30 a.m. and continued all day but of course the worst was while we were trying to sleep at night. Our first full day began very early so we left hoping it was a fluke. Night two, more of the same. On day 3 I reported it to the front desk who tried to assure me their people would not do that and definitely not early in the morning. However, we climbed out of bed and ran to the hall to look and see what inconsiderate people were causing so much noise. We saw uniformed hotel staff doing it just as much as guests. Note: if you are too weak, too old or unable to carry your bags, you should request a first floor room. It is very, very inconsiderate to hotel guests trying to relax or sleep to hear ka-clunk, ka-clunk, ka-clunk up and down 3 flights of stairs at all hours of the day or night. I might expect this at Motel 6, but not at a $150 night resort. At any rate, the noise continued. We were only there for 5 nights or we would have moved but by day 4 realizing it was a constant problem, we didn't want to move all of our stuff for 1 night. So for $150 I had to wear ear plugs to bed every night and my husband slept with his head under a pillow. We both work up with pounding headaches 3 of the mornings. The tiki bar on the grounds was pretty cool, but the first time I approached the bartender to inquire about where we might find the pool towels, he was very rude. I was even extra nice knowing he probably hated answering questions from guests. A couple of days later when we consumed a couple of drinks at the bar and left a tip he was much nicer. Hmmm. We ate at the buffet restaurant one night. Big mistake. There were 4-6 hotel guests only and a big local family with a bunch of kids that were running all around the restaurant and jumping on the booths. There were dirty tables. The staff knew who they were too and no one said anything. The buffet was gross and at $18 each, was an outrage. (have you ever been to CiCi's pizza on a Friday night?) We were both very sick by the middle of the night. Now, the snack shack near the bar served great food and good service. We ate their about 3 times for late night munching. The grounds ARE beautiful and right on the beach and next to great snorkeling. You can walk the sidewalk along the beach which connects several of the resorts and the shopping area. But, basically every day we were up early and on the road exploring so we didn't hang at the hotel much, but did use the pool one morning after snorkeling. Kaanapalii was not our favorite area. Probably the best thing was being close to Don the Beachcomber's just a 10-12 minute walk away. The Polynesian music and dancing show in the evenings was great and free and non-hotel guests even came. If we ever went back, we'd stay on the south east side, less snooty and more down-to-Earth. We had to get on the road and were going to miss the checking out ceremony. They allow you to still pick up a lei at check-out if you cannot attend the farewell lei ceremony. We were told to go out front to the parking attendant. I approached and said good morning and explained that we had to leave early but were told inside to stop to pick up our leis. WELL, let me tell you, you would have thought she had hand-made them herself and was offended we were leaving early. She didn't even speak. She reached down, grabbed two under the desk, flipped them over the counter and said \"here\". It was the rudest treatment of all by any of their employees. I smiled and thanked her and told her to have a nice day. When my husband pulled up with our car, I told him how she reacted which was not all the Mahalo we were expecting. We certainly expected more than we got. So to re-cap, don't get a room near the stairwell, don't ask the bartender any questions when you aren't paying for drinks, don't eat at the buffet restaurant, and be sure to attend the lei farewell ceremony and you should be just fine.

This was our 12th visit over 30 years, and the hotel keeps getting better. Our room was beautiful, the courtyard gardens a paradise of Hawaiian flowers, and we did not want to leave after 3 weeks. Our daily routine of a wonderful hot buffet breakfast at the Tiki Terrace restaurant, a mile walk on the beachwalk watching for whales, collecting shells on the beach, and snorkeling with beautiful tropical fish and huge green turtles right down the beach, was pure relaxation with no hassle or driving. We could watch whales breeching in the ocean from our balcony. Our housekeeper made sure everything was perfect for us. We felt like royalty. The hotel had so many Hawaiian cultural activities, and the gardens are so beautiful, especially the plumeria trees. Local artists display their crafts in the lobby several days a week. Each night, Hawaiian bands and hula shows entertained for free in the court yard, we have so many wonderful pictures and videos of them. Many nights we had dessert and coffee at the Tiki Terrace while watching the shows. You can walk down the beach to all the beautiful shops and restaurants at Whaler's Village. There is no better place to stay on Kaanapali Beach. This is the best value, and the best hotel, because it is smaller and can take much better care of you than the big resorts there. It is our favorite hotel in Hawaii. We always visit one or two other islands for several days, but book the majority of our time at the Kannapali Beach Hotel. Even three weeks this year was not enough. I met many people staying there for several weeks, and they were all sad to leave. I always told them \" planning your return visit to KBH takes the sting out of leaving.\" Many were already repeat visitors. We will be back next year - it is where we go to refresh our souls from everyday life.

On Maui I have stayed at a private condo on Ka'anapali Beach (the Mahana), The Marriott Ka'anapali Beach, Kapalua Bay Hotel (since demolished), Ritz Carlton Kapalua, Renaissance Wailea and Four Seasons Wailea. This was my first stay at KBH. This trip my wife and I were accompanied by my mother in law, an 82 year old lady who was experiencing Hawaii for the first time. After a five day stay on Oahu to take in Pearl Harbour and the Iolani Palace, Maui seemed like the right place for the remaining 8 days of our trip; nice beach, good golfing for my wife and myself, a little history (historic Lahaina), and restaurants all within walking distance. My biggest concern was that while my wife and I were golfing (early morning every day), I wanmed to be sure that my mother in law would not be bored stiff. I also wanted to show her as much of the Aloha spirit as I could. I had always heard that the most Hawaiian hotel was KBH, so I booked there. I could not have made a better choice. While other hotels are definitely fancier and the staff may be more fawning over guests and the restaurants more spectacular, KBH is the hotel that I would say can truly show a new visitor why Hawaii becomes a favourite, perhaps almost obsessive, destination for many. Other posts here are fairly accurate in their descriptions of the hotel and its amenities so I will not dwell on repeating them. I will make some observations based on extensive travel to the islands. The price of KBH is easily half of almost all other nearby properties. The beach at KBH is identical to all others - spectacular. The breakfast at the Tiki Grill is better that the Mixed Plate. The free daily activities are terrific for those not looking to sit on the beach all day. My mother in law made her own lei, loved the walking tours, attended and appreciated the historical discussions and lectures and made her way over to the Whalers Village shops every day for a coffee and a browse. Restaurants not to miss if staying at or near Ka'anapali: Chez Paul - French, small and you must reserve, even in these economic times. Gerard's at the Plantaion Inn - also French.- if staying at KBH you get a coupon for $50 off your meal. Longhi's - still a great table in Lahaina. For golfers, try out the Kahili golf course about 30 minute drive, less expensive than Kapalua, but a great track. Kahili is the old Sandalwood, but it's been improved. We never saw a bug in any of the rooms at KBH, although it is Hawaii and bugs are there. The rooms were very well maintained. The staff at KBH are more like family than employees. They are not fawning, they are friendly. They say \"aloha\" like they know what it means. At the farewell kekui lei ceremony, my mother in law had tears in her eyes and so did my wife and I. I would rather go out for a beer with one of the bell desk staff at KBH than at the Ritz. If you ask the staff at KBH for their opinion or help, you will get it, honestly and earnestly.

What 1 person may love, another may hate. I will try to be objective here. The travel agent selected this hotel for us. It is the oldest hotel in the area and in need of major renovation. There is peeling wallpaper and the carpet dated back to the 1970's. A rule of thumb for me is you can generally (but not always) tell the quality of a hotel from the condition and decor of the lobby. My expectations were low from the onset of walking in the door at this hotel. Our room was oceanfront on the top floor at the corner. The room had a light switch not fully attached to the wall and no bathtub (just a standup shower); a 20+ yr old tv and just plain aweful. We are an early 40's professional couple and used to staying in luxury hotels. I was not expecting the Fairmont or Four Seasons but I was also not expecting such a dump. I would equate this hotel in quality to a Super-8 or Econolodge hotel - very poor quality. The breakfast buffet was worse than something you would find at Shoneys both in terms of variety and quality. The pool is small and simply unattractive. The property is advertised as Hawaii's \"Most Hawaiian Hotel\" but I'm not sure why. The grounds are simply plain and the service staff is not as outgoing as at other hotels (again, if you keep your expectations to a Super-8 or Econolodge, you will not be disappointed). The people staying here seem to be split into 2 equal groups from what we observed - those over 65 and those who appreciate budwiser and body art and seem to talk quite loudly. Neither of those groups describe us so the hotel just wasn't for us. As previously stated, reviews are subjective and this hotel seemed to work well for at least two specific categories of people (just not us). The location is outstanding (right next to the Sheraton on Black Rock). The beach is fantastic (it's all public access everywhere here). So, if you're looking for a ratty hotel in a great location - this is your place. After one night, we could not stomach this place any longer. The travel agent said there was nothing they could (more like would) do to help us move and said since we prepaid, all money would be lost and any move would be at our cost. So, the next morning I went to the hotel manager and requested to immediately depart and get a refund of the unused nights. The 1st response from the manager was that she would not issue any refund as the economy was tight and they basically needed the money. She was sorry that the hotel was not a 5-star property but they never advertised themselves as such. After much discussion, the manger agreed to let us check out and issue us a refund for the unused 3 nights. (We moved next door to the Sheraton where the hotel and grounds are incredible).

This hotel creates a uniquely hawaiian experience from the moment you enter the hotel grounds. Unlike other hotels on the island, this one is a bit more simple. If you are going to Hawaii to stay in a resort with an indoor pool, an exercise room and the likes then this is not your place to stay. But, if you are going to Hawaii to really experience a different culture then this IS your place to stay. I mean seriously....an indoor gym? You have the entire island to hike, swim and just have fun on. I really don't get those people that 'visit Hawaii' and just spend time ordering room service and watching tv. Ok, back to the hotel. The rooms are simple and Hawaiian. Our room consisted of two double beds, desk, armoire with tv (that was not once turned on in eight days), a balcony with a table and chairs to enjoy the sunset. It couldnt get better. And the hotel grounds were impeccable. There were plenty of lawn chairs to lay out or read on (and an amazing book exchange room....to give and take). The plants, trees and abundance of birds were just amazing and somewhat calming. And the hotel has plenty of things to do......there is the nightly hula show with live music (free), morning and afternoon classes where you can learn to make leis, hula, play the ukelele and more (also free), a swimming pool, a huge checker board with red and black coconuts as pieces, the tiki bar, etc. So much to do. And did I mention that you are right on the beach? Absolutely amazing! Now onto the staff, they are probably the biggest incentive to come to this hotel. You actually feel like a part of their family. They are helpful in any and every part of your vacation. I had them help me book a zipline tour and just help me with things that would be fun to do. They suggested many locations and trips, and gave me maps and directions to get to each location. Upon leaving you are greeted by the staff where they sing a song and extend their gratitude for your visit. You are then given a kakui nut necklace...with a special story. Last of all, price. Our room ended up being around 200 dollars a night (and an additonal 9 dollars a day for parking). Neighboring hotels on the same beach were more than twice the same amount and those rooms didnt have an ocean view! You would pay roughly three times the amount for the same view. So, if you don't need an indoor gym and the likes I would check this place out....and maybe you will see me on your visit.

When I booked our trip, I specifically asked for this hotel and would not accept any substitute. I read a lot of reviews and opinions about this hotel and fell in love with the place even before I got there. We arrived the first week of November. There were 3 girls with more suitcases and bags you could even imagine. Without hesitation, comments or anything, they gladly helped us with the luggage and brought it to our room. We asked for another chair for the balcony along with addtional towels-we had them in an instant. The view from our room in the Kaui wing was the most beautiful you could ever imagine. The hotel was going through some renovation, but it never interferred or interrupted our stay. The nightly shows, the staff that made you feel like family, the convenient location, the beach, everything about this hotel will fill all your dreams of a Hawaiian vacation. I would most definitely return to this hotel. The special treatment while we were there was outstanding and something we did not find while we were in Oahu and the big island.

She wanted to review the property since more Canadians are visiting Maui than ever. We are both very experienced travelers and not especially demanding. Firstly, I'm baffled by some reviewers who have given this hotel such a high ranking. It makes me wonder where else they've been staying. For the money, there are much better values on Maui. On the plus side, the room was clean, the cleaning staff very polite and the grounds well maintained. The hotel was nowhere near as crowded as the other hotels. If that's all you are looking for, you'll be ok. Now the negative side. The service at the front desk over the weekend was at best indifferent. To be fair, it was a different person on Monday and she was very friendly and helpful. We were put in a room with a lanai for smokers and when we asked to change (my spouse has very bad asthma), we were told we were lucky to get what we had and not to complain. I don't think the hotel was full so I suspect the desk person couldn't be bothered for some reason. Needless to say, my spouse couldn't go outside since the neighbours to our right were heavy smokers and a first attempt sit on the the lanai resulted in a cloud of smoke coming our way and lots of coughing on my part and hers. There was no mention of the construction that starts at 8 a.m. when we booked. For reasons unknown, we were not given the 20 dollar breakfast coupon that supposedly came with our room or any of the advertised features that came with the room usually. Not part of our package we were told. Why? No one could say. Again, this was never mentioned to us when we checked in or when we booked on the phone. Who wants to spend 36 dollars per person on breakfast? They did advertise breakfast for 14 dollars but the person at the restaurant said we needed the 20 dollar coupon. Huh? We found the restaurant overpriced and not very good. I would suggest the Hula Grill in the property next door instead or the restaurants in Whaler's Village. There are no beach towels and to rent a lounge chair will cost you anywhere from 10 dollars to 30 dollars. The beach staff pack up things at around 5 p.m or so. The beach is not really suitable for swimming so you might be better off at the pool if you have kids or you're a senior. Both computers at the business centre were not working and, on further inquiry, we found out that someone had removed the \"out of order\" signs on each for some reason. Despite putting a sign out at the door of our room asking not to be disturbed, the cleaning staff came in anyway much to our dismay. At night, we noticed that the back door of the building near the main walkway is left wide open and there is no security in sight. Anyone can walk in without a problem. There were other problems as well but I think the point is made.

There is plenty to do if you like a more active holiday; the hotel will arrange trips around the island but one of the things I really liked were the activities provided by the hotel. There were lots of sessions throughout the week where you could learn to Hula, make leis, learn about the garden and the medicinal plants and lots more, and all free!! Or you could just chill on the loungers (plenty of them too) in the garden and relax. The beach is quite literally right next to the hotel garden with just a path in between.

As a return guest, we were treated to many extra amenities under their Lei Aloha program. Yes, the resort is showing it's age (they are currently doing some upgrading to rooms in the Kauai Wing and exterior painting to the Lanai Wing), however you will not find another hotel on Maui that exemplifies the Hawaiian spirit of Aloha and Ohana like the KBH. Housekeepers, servers, valet and guest services individuals will all treat you as part of their family. There are numerous complimentary Hawaiian activities that you can choose from on a daily basis, from lei making to weaving, to garden walks. This is not a five star resort with waterfalls, hot tubs and room service, but if you truly want to experience Hawaii this is the place to stay. We spoke to people who had just come from the Westin (a few hotels down the beach) and they were required to wear wrist bands to get their pool towels! Who wants to be treated like that, unless you are a child at a waterpark. (And contrary to a previous reviewer, towels were plentiful and free at the beach services hut in the courtyard). Our room was serviced daily with fresh towels, linens and toiletries by a wonderful housekeeper named Minan. We spent the extra money for an oceanview room (6th floor) and it was well worth it. If you don't care about your view (or lack thereof) get the cheapest Aloha Value room, but keep in mind you may be looking at another hotel when you sit on your lanai. Or upgrade to at least a pool view, part ocean, or ocean view and marvel at the beautifully immaculate grounds, whale pool and deep blue ocean. Parking is $9.00 a day, but parking charges are standard in Hawaii. The KBH is on the best beach with the nicest grounds, you'll pay way more at the other resorts in Kaanapali and wll receive way less for your money. Plenty of choices for meals, a buffet only restaurant that is indoors, a menu restaurant facing the courtyard with free entertainment each evening, and a pool side grill for even more casual dining. Be sure to catch the evening entertainment at least a couple of nights. It runs from 6pm to 9pm with different groups rotating performances. All were excellent. From about 6:30 to 7:30 they have hula dancers too. Although the entertainment is adjacent to the Tiki Terrace Restaurant and Tiki Bar, there is no purchase of food or drink required to attend. You will not find a better hotel on Maui than the KBH. Check out their web site and book direct, they have some fantastic deals and packages.

At the Tiki Restaurant you can have eggs and pancakes prepared just the way you like them along with a full buffet. The food choices at the Mixed Plate are about the same, but it's an indoor restaurant while the Tiki has its tables outside overlooking a nice garden area of the hotel. If you have a tourist activity the hotel will prepare a box lunch, which is gteat for hiking or downhill biking. Can't comment on dinner as we were out doing things and generally didn't get back until later. The hotel is only a short walk from the shops at Whaler Village and is nice in the morning since you are right on the beach. The pool is nice and great for an evening swim. The hotel has a small outdoor bar that is always busy. Our drinks were fine. The staff is really helpful with anything you need as far as activities and questions. Check-in is never long no matter what hour your long flight gets in. Be sure to participate in the lei ceremony before you head home. You get a Kukui nut Lei and the story about it with nice music.

The hotel makes a point of welcoming returning guests as well as people there on special occasions. Last summer booking a room and car package direct at the hotel website worked out well.

The lounge chairs were crowded together in full sun. If you want the pool with the slides and a bunch of screaming kids running around, go there. If you want peace and quiet, go to KBH.

We booked in February 2008 and stayed at KBH from 7/30-8/9. Just returned home yesterday, but I felt compelled to write a review on this hotel. Actually first time I have ever written a review or felt I needed to do so. While on Maui we visited the Sheraton, Weston (we stayed at the Hyatt on Maui 12 years ago), Marriott and even swam in the pool at the Ritz-Carlton (with permission from the hotel to see the property - not sure if could afford even a day there but it is very nice) in Kapula one day. All of these hotels are very nice, and their pools are far better than KBH which has a small pool. But we wentfor the ocean, island itself, food, etc and not because the hotel had a great pool with a slide. So here is what I found at the KBH. The rooms are 'normal' (not great nor horrible), the breakfast was good at both resturants, the spot on Ka'anapali Beach is perfect for sun bathing, swimming, snorkeling, etc. Short walk to the Whalers village for supper and shopping. Staff was excellent and very helpful (we have 2 daughters and the kids program is great). We had the breakfast meal deal in the morning, lunch in the room (we are not rich so had a budget to keep) and then dinner out in Lahania, Kapula or at the Whalers Village. We went to Kapalua beach (Ritz Carlton Pool and to the Kapalua Beach) one day, Trilogy for a trip to Lana'i, daughter took a surfing lesson, snorkeled off of Black Rock (even jumped off myself), Old Lahania Luau and just had a great time. In closing I just want to say that we really hope to go back to Maui again and we will definitely stay (and only stay so long as the rates stay where they are in relation to the other hotels - most resonable price I could find after months of looking) at the KBH. As far as the negative reviews on this hotel I have come to figure out that some people just have an unhappy life, can't be pleased and are just in general negative people. Hopefully these negative people will stay at another hotel because I really do not wish to be around them. But if you are a 'normal' traveler I hope you have as good a time as my family and get to experience the Hawaiian Culture on display at KBH.

We booked a garden view room via United vacations, but when we arrived, we were given a double upgrade to a partial ocean view room. Partial = magnificent. The staff were always friendly and helpful, and we liked the little touches, such as the welcoming letter, the nightly biscuits, and the fact that somebody prepared our room by drawing the curtains and turning over the top cover of the bed every night. There was even somebody watering the hot sand when we walked on to the beach. At reception, we were given breakfast vouchers for either the hotel restaurant or the buffet just outside the hotel. We tried the buffet first morning, but there was a long line, and people walking around looking for empty tables, so for the rest of our stay we dined in the hotel and paid the little bit extra for breakfast. We booked an airplane trip via the hotel, and when it was cancelled, they quickly managed to arrange an alternative helicopter trip to Molokei -- and that was well worth the money. We didn't have evening meals in the hotel, instead we just wandered along the concrete path and ate in the restaurants there, but be advised, make sure you book in advance because all of them were packed.

We were also able to book other activities off-site (a luau and surfing lessons) right from our hotel where the staff not only booked the events for us but also offered great advice about when to get there and what to bring.

Too modern without a lot of personality plus there were tons of kids there which I didn't want on my honeymoon so the KBH was perfect for us. There were a few older kids but that was it. We had the \"Island Romance\" package which included the car, daily breakfast, a dinner at the Tiki Terrace, a picnic lunch is a backpack that you keep which is awesome. It came with plates, silverware, glasses, napkins, table cloth, cheese knife, cutting board, bottle of wine with an opener & all the food inside. We took it on our road to Hana trip & it really came in handy. We also got 2 bottles of water every day & an excursion. We chose the Luau at the Hyatt & that's the only thing I would have done differently. It just wasn't our speed. Too much waiting in lines & the food wasn't that great.

It was our honeymoon and I spent hours reading all of the reviews and still was very hesitant about staying there. I did not want to fall into the same situation as some of the other writers who got a non-updated room or got stuck in a gloomy part of the hotel being this was a once in a life time trip to Hawaii. So I thought it would be a no-brainer to get the Ocean Front room, as it was the most expensive one at 345 a night, which was the cost of a Garden View room next door at the Sheraton. For sure, these 54 rooms would have to be updated first compared to the 300 something other rooms in the hotel. I called many months in advance and reminded them that it was my honeymoon and I would really prefer an updated room. For nine months I would call every other month and re-confirm this information; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High Floor, non-smoking, up-dated room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They did inform me that the sixth floor was updated and that smoking was allowed on the Lanai, but I clearly told them that the sixth floor would be fine as long as the room did not stink of smoke like some of the other reviewers wrote. They assured me that smoking was allowed only on the lanai. Well,,,, the day finally came and my worst nightmare came true. They put us on the fourth floor which was one of only two other floors that was not remodeled yet. Plus, there were two other floors being worked on and totally unavailable in our wing. When you walked through the hallway you got that depressing feeling that people wrote about and there was a toxic like smell in the hallway of cleaner overuse. When we arrived to the room the description of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Motel Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that was used by other writers was perfect. The sink was being held up by one of those old flimsy aluminum type bars, that we had to adjust a couple of times ourselves. The tub would not drain properly and the SCREEN DOOR WOULD NOT SHUT ALL THE WAY ALLOWING THERE TO BE A 3 INCH HOLE AT THE TOP OF OUR SCREEN WHICH THE FLYS and MOSQUITOS FOUND. The carpet was old and the bathroom floor had that Motel look to it. When we walked out onto the lanai, YES it was ocean front, but only 2/3, as there was a big yellow wall that came out to the right about ten feet and our view of the long stretch of beach in front of the Sheraton and Black Rock was obstructed, actually you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even see it if you leaned over. As you may or may not know, Black rock is one of the areas main attractions. At night we had to shut the glass door because of the damaged screen which was a shame and a real buzz killer because the sound of the crashing waves outside was so soothing and nice, but the glass door had to be shut because the bugs would have a field day with us coming in through the damaged screen. (My wife had three mosquito bites after the first night) When you walked to the other properties you could see the difference and it only added to my frustration. Plus, all the other hotels are just as Hawaiian, they have the Aloha spirit, local employees and all the cultural activities that KBH had. Yes, I clearly understand that these hotels cost 100 to 150 more a night for ocean front, but after this stay and the great experience we had the week after in Kauai at the Sheraton, I would have preferred an updated Garden View room somewhere else, compared to the one we had. I would like to conclude by saying I clearly understand that you get what you pay for and this is what we got for not staying next door. But then again, we were in one of the only rooms of the hotel that was not re-done and it was the highest priced room. This hotel is perfect for families or people visiting on a budget, but absolutely not for honeymooners. Even if you get an updated room there is no romantic feeling to this hotel what so ever. Every time you return back to the property from your day or night out you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Motel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd look and feel. I am one of those people who like to make the best of every situation and am one of those romantic Italian guys who can make something out of nothing, but I feel compelled to give notice to all other honeymooners. If you are going to stay here you have to mentally prepare yourself to do so. Do not listen to the hype that the hotel markets and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your money on Ocean front as the Ocean view rooms on the 4th, 5th and 6th have views that are just as good. I did ask for an updated room after we checked in but the hotel informed me that it would not be possible until the 3rd night and they tried to use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-smoking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd request as an excuse for giving me the room, but I made it clear to them many weeks in advance that an updated room on the sixth floor would have been fine since smoking was only permitted out on the lanai.

The hotel prides itself on promoting Hawaiian culture, and I think they're doing a wonderful job. We enjoyed the free welcome breakfast buffet -- it was interesting and informative, without taking too long (and they even gave away some great prizes). We also looked forward to the nightly cookies also! Both of my daughters joined the Aloha Kids Club and eagerly attended the activities -- I'm not sure they even realized how much they were learning about Hawaiian history as they enjoyed themselves. The program is for kids and their families, and while I did not look forward to attending the kid's club activities (I have enjoyed drop-off kid's club programs in the past), I found all of the activities to be interesting and enjoyed spending the extra time with my children and seeing learn new things. The hotel, I feel, has one of the best locations on the beach and is within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. And as a bonus, we actually saw a whale frolicking in the water one morning while sitting on the beach. The pool isn't large, but was the perfect size for our family (and was not crowded). There is nightly entertainment that can be enjoyed (for free!!), and a Tiki Bar that serves great tropical drinks. The KBH has two restaurants which are both good, we ate breakfast at both and were happy with the food choices (as were our kids). We also enjoyed a great dinner at the Tiki Terrace. The Guest Services department helped us enjoy our stay, and they seemed to enjoy their interaction with guests.

There was never a problem of getting a chair even around the pool as was evident at the other higher end hotels nearby. The fragrance of the plumeria trees in bloom in the courtyard was amazing. We had an oceanfront room with 2 double beds even though we had requested a king size bed. We were disappointed upon entering the room and found this however we were on the 3rd floor of the Molokai Wing which was the top floor and the view of the beach was amazing. When I called the front desk and asked them about a king size bed, they said they did not have any available with an ocean front room. They said to check the next day for any cancellations if we wanted to. We decided to stay where we were and didn't bother inquiring. My husband enjoyed watching 3 young dolphins at play one early morning from our balcony! Our room was a little tired looking but on the whole not bad and for the location of the hotel and price compared to the others, it was well worth it. The meals weren't bad at the hotel. We bought the Romance Package and it included a buffet breakfast at The Mixed Plate Restaurant or your coupon could be used toward your meal at The Tiki Grill but then you had to pay the extra and really, there wasn't a great difference in the quality of the food there from the other restaurant. Our package also included our rental car and an insulated picnic bag to keep along with a picnic lunch which included enough food for a couple of lunches for the 2 of us so we were pleased that we had purchased that particular package with our travel agent.

The room was very spacious and frankly, we didn't spend a lot of time there anyway - the real value of this hotel is in the beautiful location and the activities you can participate in. They post the activities and you have to register for them beforehand (don't just show up because there is preperation that goes into each of the activities) and the ones that we did were awesome - we learned how to play the ukulele, made leis and took a hula class - all really fun! My four year old son took the lei making class with us and actually did great. You have to take the initiative to participate in the activities - it would be easy to miss if you weren't aware of them! (Also, it was nice to go to a welcome breakfast where they didn't try to arm wrestle you into buying a condo) Our kids just loved the passport program, and I didn't feel pressured to buy anything - they were just thrilled that they got a stamp and a gift at each location throughout the resort and totally got into the whole program - my daughter wore her passport even when we weren't in the hotel. She was very proud and told every kid she saw about it. The shows in the evening were nice, we could sit and have a cocktail and the kids danced to the music, so relaxing! If it's luxury you're after or you're on your honeymoon, I probably wouldn't stay there, but with family it was perfect - check rates and you'll see that it's a great value for that part of Maui.

We felt very welcome and very comfortable and would definitely go back. We had a free night at the Marriott Wailea which was really awesome - they have an incredible pool (hey - weren't we on one of the best beaches in the world? why were we at the pool?) And the rooms were first class, the buffet breakfast was absolutely first class but it definitely didn't have a relaxed family feel, the beach wasn't directly in front of the hotel (if you stay in Wailea be aware that they have a pretty small beach compared to Kaanapali and all the hotels share it - in Kaanapali most of the hotels have their own beachfront) not to mention the going rate was nearly 3x that of Kaanapali Beach Hotel, we couldn't have swung a whole trip there but it was nice to have a little luxury at the end of our trip.

There was lawn chess and ping pong, and a water sports activity hut. You can even sign up for free lessons in Hawaiian activities such as lei making. My only complaint was that the resort really could have used a hot tub or two in the courtyard. That is the only thing that would make this place any better.

The hotel is really average, not worth paying the price. I have not noticed any friendliness, or people trying to be helpful.

The Whaler Village with lots of shopping and a food court is just 5 minutes down the boardwalk. My son likes the snorkelling at Black Rock next door at the Sheraton. My daughter and I went on a Trilogy whale watch cruise. They pick you up right there at the beach. She also took surfing lessons which was a 15 minute walk down the boardwalk. The hotel offers daily activities for the kids (and adults too) like lei making, hula lessons and sand images. They have a huge checker board using coconuts for the game pieces on the grounds. They also offer a ping pong table for everyone's use. They even have washers and dryers. They have entertainment in the courtyard every evening until 9:00PM. There is the most wonderful magician who performs most nights. It is amazing the things he does. I won't spoil it for you but you will not be disappointed and you get a discount for staying in the hotel. The best part about our stay was the staff. We had been there previously and they still remembered us. The same people have been working there for years so they make you feel like family. On the day we left they had a ceremony to wish us a safe trip home and gave everyone a necklace made with kukui nuts. Everytime you visit them they replace one of the brown nuts with a white one.

The rest of the week we were at a condo so we were really looking forward to the luxury of a hotel. Our room package came with the free rental car, so we dropped our previous rental off & picked up the free one. It was a really cute Dodge Cailber - so much nicer than the crappy Cavalier we drove the rest of the week. Like a ditzy teenager, I mistakenly left my purse at a restaurant near the airport and didn't realize until we were getting our bags out of the car with the valet. The valet was super nice to help me make sure it wasn't in the car or with my bags and the concierge helped me locate the phone number to the restaurant. The drive back to get my purse sucked b/c Kaanapali is not close to the airport at all and it was \"rush hour\" on the one & only road to the airport. Our room was oceanfront and really nice - there was a card & champagne waiting for us (plastic flutes, but still nice.) This hotel is not swanky by any means & luxurious it isn't. But it's a great deal for budget conscious people. One bank of elevators was broken the whole time we were visiting, so getting back up to the room was a chore. We also had trouble getting a concierge to help us book a luau. It seemed like she was on lunch everytime we went down there. We eventually booked, though, and had a great time. Each night, we had turn-down service where they left an orchid & macadamia nut cookie on your pillow. I thought it was a cute touch. When you leave, you have the option of attending a farewell ceremony where you get a kakui nut lei that you are supposed to bring back every visit. They will then trade out the nuts on your lei for different nuts. They really try to make you feel like your are \"ohana\" - \"family\". The pool is nice but nit near as cool as some of the other pools down the strip. Our package included free breakfast at the Blue Plate every morning - really good buffet - and one free dinner at the on-site restaurant. It was probably the best meal we had all week.

It had good reviews so we spent 5 nights here. It was ok, but it was not worth the price in our view. We stayed on the ground floor in a one bed room (Lana'i Wing). Here are our thoughts: The Good -Big room (it was a bit musty and old - but ok - i'd consider it 3 stars though for appearance). -Friendly staff. The cleaners would always say smile and say hello, and the staff at the desk were very nice. -Helpful tour desk (helped book us a car and cruise - very efficient). -Very Nice Breakfasts (the actual food) - not the rooms (see below)! -The Beach - so close and so beautiful (one of the best beaches in Maui / Hawaii). The Sheraton is next door (where Black rock is) and yes you can access black rock and snorkle (recommend!). Walk through the Sheraton and look at the big gold fish! They are amazing. -Close to Whalers Village (2 minute walk - and catch $1 bus to Lahaina). Plan your trip. -Ice Machines available at every wing. Convenient -The Grounds are Maintained Beautifully (Very green, and healthy gardens). -When we left, the bag guy offered to drive us to our next hotel (Royal Lahaina). Of course you feel obliged to tip, i just gave him $5 as thats probably what the Taxi would have cost. -Housekeeping came in every day to tidy up as expected. -Bottle of wine on arrival and occassional biscuits left on our bed for being honeymooners. -Bar at the pool is good. But would be better if it was a swim up bar.(you have to get out of the water for this one). The Bad -Fuzzy TV reception. -Shower Curtains (never like these as they can touch you when you shower). -Bathroom was very old, bathtub didn't look very good, water pressure was hopeless (although think thats a hawaiian drought thing). -Musty feel. Room was dated felt 1980's. Needs some paint and freshening up. Furniture dates also. -The ground floor room we had opened up to the common area facing the pool. Wasn't very private (everyone sees you if your curtains are open on the ground floor). -Very old construction maybe 60's? - could here neighbours on either side and above us (footsteps!!). Soundproofing was not good maybe not there. -Pool was ok, but something that should be improved. The whale shape did not excite me, i thought the pool was a bit too small for the number of rooms at the site. Beach is better than the pool anyway. -Air conditioning system was not very good. Probably as old as the building. The Ugly -The Diner & Breakfast venue - very crusty and creates a cheap feel. I think they need to renovate and buy new chairs and tables (felt like a staff room at a constuction site). -Exteremely noisy plumbing from surrounding rooms. This was annoying in the middle of the night if another toilet was used or someone was having a middle of the night shower. -We left a heap of alcohol in the fridge also (forgot about it) and I think a courtesy call would have been appropriate. Apart from Breakfast (buffet) we did not eat at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. So we cannot comment on the restaurant or food (apart from Breakfast which was yummy - a decent selection). I guess it was a very nice place at the end of the day, nothing really special though and not what we expected for the price paid (I should have demanded a renovated room!). When we checked in we were excited and that quickly turned to slightly dissapointing. But then we just got used to it - we've stayed in worse places. We didn't develop an emotional connection to the place - we were glad to leave. I can't say the selling point \"the most Hawaiian Hotel\" really did it for us as well. In our view it wasn't that much different to any other hotel we stayed at in hawaii (2 others). Perhaps on our part we should have done more research and expected that it was going to be $$$ being Maui. But We stayed at the Royal Lahaina (in the tower) which was cheaper and for us much better value. Kaanapali Beach Hotel might suit families more. Honeymooners, maybe not. Having said that it appears that many American's come back here regulary as staff seemed to keep saying \"see you next year\" and knew their names. So some people must love it - maybe they get it much cheaper because they are regulars (or timeshare?). Book this one only once you do your homework, perhaps book if they guarantee you a renovated room and as others suggest, get a good deal because we found this overpriced. The Price was probably the biggest let down for us. Price sets the expectations, and when expectations are not met, naturally one will focus on the negatives.

They told us when we checked in that there was a little something waiting for us in our room. I was expecting maybe matching bath robes or rose petals on the bed (something romantic maybe).

The KBH is definitely not a place to stay to celebrate this kind of occasion. We requested a newly renovated room and stayed on the 6th floor in the Lanai wing. Our view was the garden, whale pool, and part ocean view. The pool was always very crowded and very difficult to find a place to sit. KBH is a hotel to book for a family vacation. It is definitely a \"kid friendly\" hotel. They provide ample activities for children to take part in. However, despite its lack of modernization, the hotel is very clean, staff are very friendly and catering. Word of advice if you are making a reservation make sure to request a renovated ocean view room! The breakfast at the Mixed Plate was tasty (but nothing to brag about). The food at the Tiki Terrace ( restaurant on the premises) was excellent. Their pina coladas are pretty good. They have a musical performance daily for a few hours, but it's literally the same performance daily so that can get boring. You'll hear the same songs each night.

We were on our anniversary trip and the hotel knew this and gave us a upgrade from the garden view we booked to a partial ocean view as well as a bottle of champagne in the room! Now the view was quite nice - but only accessible by going out on the balcony and then only on one side of the balcony, the rest of the time the view was of the Whaler next door (not a very exciting view). The bed was much firmer than my liking but not unbearable, the pillows are extremely soft but there were extras in the room so between the two of us we had six pillows in use and made it work. We were in the Kaua'i wing which as far as I can tell is not yet renovated, however we did see the entire second floor appeared to be under renovation (rooms were stripped) so perhaps it is being done now. The room was nothing fancy but appeared to be clean did not stink or any of the other complaints I read about before going. All of the hotel staff we encountered were extremely friendly especially Jenny at the front counter when we checked in - we were already kind of bummed as our flight was late, Dollar rent a car took forever to give us our car and traffic was horrendous because of the Halloween party in Lahaina - so it was nice to see a smiling happy face. As for the food onsite, we ate at the mixed plate restaurant and really wish we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it was not very good in our opinion at all. However there were other people there eating and they seemed to enjoy it so maybe its personal preference. We also ate at the Tiki Terrace for the Sunday champagne brunch - that was absolutely wonderful and I would recommend that to everyone to try, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit pricey but based on the sheer number of food options they provide its totally worth it, add to it that if you enjoy champagne you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed, they never let my glass get 1/4 empty. The only other meal we had onsite other than the welcome breakfast was going to the magic show. The meal was good and the mai tais were great! The show was worth seeing but definitely paying a premium for front row seating - but again we thought it was worth it. I wish I could report more on the snorkeling at Blackrock, but out of a 6 day trip I only got to snorkel one time, but I did see a large sea turtle and several schools of fish including tangs, triggers etc. The snorkeling area does get extremely crowded and if there are any kids who decide to jump off Blackrock then it gets worse as you have people jumping in the area you would typically snorkel. The rest of the trip the surf became too high (the hotel alerted us with voicemail on our phone about the surf warnings) and one day it rained the entire day. That was very disappointing since I love to snorkel but of course nothing the hotel can do about the weather! All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone as long as they are not expecting pampering/luxury etc as this is not what you get at KBH, you will however get a nice well taken care of hotel with extremely friendly staff and a good bargain for being on one of the nicest beaches in Maui.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, NC", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding value\u201d", "Author": "lewisgang", "ReviewID": "UR10375781", "Content": "This was our second stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, and we absolutely love it.

I had booked this place on the recommendation of my cousin, but it turns out she was in a renovated building- I was not!! As honeymooners, I was hoping for a room upgrade, which we did not get.....so I was glad that I at least had reserved a ocean view room. Well I don't know how they can consider that ocean view!! We were on the top floor (6th) in the Kuaui building, the only way to see the ocean was if you went to the far right side of the lanai (balcony), and we weren't too comfortable doing that since the balcony railing seemed loose! If we do go back to Maui, we'd probably try to stay at the Sheraton next door. We snuck over there on our last day to check out Black Rock- we went to the top floor and it was just amazing over there!! I guess it made it worse for us b/c we had just stayed at the Westin Moana Surfrider in Oahu which was an amazingly beautiful hotel!! So the only positive things about KBH were the free breakfast at the Mixed Plate (was actually pretty good) and its on the best stretch of the beach. Some of the other resorts further down pretty much have zero beachfront (they're on the beach, but there's no room to even put a towel down on the sand, the water is right there by the boardwalk area- I'm referring to the Hyatt, and I think the Marriott was the same way). The Whaler also seemed like a good option as its all condo units, perhaps the next time we'll go to Hawaii will be with our future kids, I'm sure the kitchen in the condo's would come in handy! As for friendly service, I had very little interaction with the staff other than check in/out......there was only one night that the music by the bar seemed to be good and it was the night we went to the luau, so we only caught the end of it (all entertainment is over by 9PM).

My first experience was making the reservation on the phone. The lady who answered was very friendly. I really appreciated that. But I was not thrilled that I had to make a 2-nights deposit on the hotel room to reserve it. This was a bit unusual for me. I also found out that parking was additional, as well as the breakfast. We did book the adult breakfasts with the package. We later found that this was a mistake. Upon arriving at the Kaanapali Beach hotel, we were immediately descended upon by valet parking people. Valet parking is optional, and thus costs more, so I opted out. That did not make them happy, which also meant that we could not use the luggage carriers, which are normally available to guests at no charge at other hotels that we have stayed at. So we had to haul our luggage from our rental car in the parking deck to our hotel room. This was a bit of a hassle, but we have managed before. Our biggest surprise came when we found that our 3-story building had no elevator! We had a 2nd floor room, and it was a hassle hauling that luggage up the stair case. It would have been much worse for the 3rd floor guests. I still cannot believe that they did not have an elevator. Here, I really feel sorry for those with physical disabilities. They have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd music show at the hotel, in the courtyard, which was touted in their ads. But when we sat down at a table to watch the show, we were descended upon by a cocktail waitress, who asked what we were ordering. We said that we did not drink [alcohol], and were just there to watch the show. She said that these tables were for bar customers, and if we were not going to order anything, that we would have to move. Now that was not communicated to us in any of the brochures, or upon check-in! We were not happy with that, but we moved to some seating in the far back of the area, and not at a table. Our 1st full day at the hotel, on Maui, a Saturday, we took an all-day tour on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Road to Hana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that we had booked prior to arriving in Hawaii. So we had to get up very early and arrived back in the evening. Since it was late, we had dinner at the hotel. The food was ok, but the service was not very good. They had a special person to pour water, but he did not come back to our table after the initial sitting. When we asked the waitress, she had to get after him to come back. The young man was definitely foreign, and did not seem to speak English well, but I think he was just being lazy since he was sitting around most of the time. The 2nd day at the hotel, a Sunday, we were up for doing the Hawaiian cultural activities that the hotel is so famous for. This was in the afternoon, after attending outdoor church services down the road at a beach park. To our suprise, we found out that we were supposed to sign up for the activities in advance, and that they only take 10 people per activity! Now we were never told about this sign-up, and we think it is ridiculous that they only take 10 people per activity for a hotel that houses hundreds of people. Mind you that there are only a handful of activities per day, and there is not always someone at the activity desk to arrange those. After some time, we finally were able to get on the waiting list for some of the activities. I was so glad that our children were able to participate in all, but one of the activities, as it was one of their vacation highlights. It was especially nice that children get a prize at every activity and location at the hotel, including a backpack, t-shirt, frisbee, ball and coloring book. The lady who did the activities was also very nice, and was probably the only really nice person who we dealt with at this hotel. She was a local person, and had been working at the hotel for many years. On the 3rd day at the hotel, we were able to attend a welcome breakfast. Overall, it was very nice, and something that we never experienced at any other hotel that we have stayed at. We could not attend on our first day due to the early departure of our day tour. Then we could not attend the 2nd day because they do not have a welcome breakfast on Sundays. After attending the welcome breakfast, which is available to all guests, we found out 2 things that would have helped us earlier. First we found out about how the activities worked, and how you had to sign up for them in advance. This was not told to us upon check-in or when making reservations. The other thing that we found out was that we actually lost out on a free breakfast for my wife and I because we had ordered the breakfast package with our hotel reservation, and it was not refundable. Anyone who did not order the breakfast package got a free breakfast that day, but not us! Besides the problems that we encountered, that I listed above, we did have a good time for the most part. We did get some good snorkeling in on the beach, just a short walk north of the hotel. There is a whale shaped swimming pool on the property, as well as a giant checker board on the lawn. The kids enjoyed those! We also met some nice guests. The other thing that was really nice was the departure ceremony. This was a compliment to the welcoming breakfast. We gathered with other guests in the lobby. The same nice lady, who did the cultural activities with us, was there to see us off with a nice macadamia nut shell lei and a kiss on the cheek, thanking us for staying at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. She said to bring back the lei on following visits, and the lei will be modified with more additions. She said that this is to show that we are not only guests, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ohana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which means family. That meant a lot to us. In the end, we were glad that we stayed at the hotel, but with the problems that we incurred, including no elevator and the unfriendliness of much of the staff, we are not sure if we would stay at this hotel again. I would say that if you stay at this hotel, schedule it so that you can attend the welcome breakfast on the very first full day. This will help you understand the hotel and area much better! You may also want to use the valet service if you end up on a higher floor with no elevator.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA different experience than others...\u201d", "Author": "jenhip", "ReviewID": "UR8853189", "Content": "We are just returning from our honeymoon, and the last leg of our HM was a 5 night stay on Maui, particularly Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. We spent a lot of time deciding where to stay on each of the three islands we were visiting, and decided on KBH for its value and good reviews received from various sites - including this site. So, as I read them after returning from there, I am surprised at the difference between ours and others' experiences there. First, we arrive and check in. We are a little concerned with the dated look of the lobby, as we had just finished up in Kauai in a gorgeous resort. That said, we knew we had to put our prejudices aside and keep an open mind. To compare the two places is wrong. I had read about some parts of the hotel being more updated than others, so when we were checking in, I asked about this, and the lady at check-in advised that we would be staying in one of the wings that were renovated, but that this renovation was not recent. We requested to have a safe in the room, so they had to change us out of our original room and put us into another that had a safe. Although some guests may not use the safe, why not just put a safe into all of the rooms? Not to mention there is a $1.50 a day safe usage fee. Not a lot, but come on... So the hotel is motel style and we are in the Lana'i section on the 4th floor. Our view from our front door is a view of the dumpsters and the overbearing smell of laundry detergent. Yes, laundry detergent is not a bad smell, but it was strong and it clashed with our view of the dumpsters. I read another review that this place will undergo multimillion renovations, which is great...while taking the elevator with another guest, he said that in his area, the elevator was making funny noises and he didn't want to risk getting stuck in such an old elevator. Our ocean view from our lanai was limited. We had stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki with a supersaver rate with limited ocean view and that view was better than the view we \"paid\" for at the KBH. And yes, it is truly a Hawaiian hotel, and maybe it doesn't have the funds to upgrade the pool at this time, but how can it be referred to as a resort when the only pool on the property is in the shape of a whale? It is great for families and those with kids, but for us as honeymooners, laying out on grass near a whale shaped pool just didn't cut it. The staff for the most part was super friendly and all smiles. This made us feel a little sad bc they were so nice and we were just not enjoying the experience. When we were in the room, we tried to call the front desk and was immediately put on hold for awhile. My husband was the one on hold and he memorized their theme song from being put on hold for so long. We finally just hung up. We called guest services to ask about towel service and lounge chair service for the beach, and she didn't know much about it. (In their defense, it might have been that particular employee just being lazy, as the following morning we went in person to ask and the person there was helpful and pleasant.) Also, a few weeks prior to leaving for the honeymoon, I had sent an email inquiring about their safes in rooms and I never even received an email back from them. The rooms were clean. No way were they updated in any way, but they were clean. However, the safe area had a mildewy smell when we opened the door. We loved the lady who was stopping by to turn down the bed - but we didn't get macadamia nut cookies like others mention in their reviews...we got Hershey Kisses... Now don't get me wrong - we are no way snobs, but we also wanted to enjoy the last days of our honeymoon. Staying here meant counting down the days until it was time to leave. We called our travel agent to arrange to finish the rest of our visit at another hotel. We gave this place a night to see how we felt...but it was just not for us. Many things that other reviewers seem to be raving about - albeit little things, but little things that \"make\" a stay that much better - we did not receiver. No warm welcome greeting with leis, no glass champagne flutes for champagne ( tho we did receive champagne), no native treat at bed turndown time, not one stinking upgrade from what we had selected even though we were staying there for five nights and we did choose and ocean view, no nice little surprises at all. Not saying that our love could have been bought, but we would have felt a little more welcomed. But I guess it was all for the best, as it made it that much easier for us to make the move out of there after the first night.

We drove that road a lot during our stay and never grew tired of it. Our check-in was effortless. The people kind. Our room was good and we left the door open to our balconey every night. We were rewarded with the sound of the waves to go to sleep with at night and each morning by little birds in our room. Hint: pick up some birdseed and you will have them too! We had no trouble with mosquitoes in our room. The doves were always the first birds we heard. They were numerous around thehotel and into the other areas. Very soothing.

On one day the hotel packed us a picnic basket(came with our package) for one of our day excursions. There was enough food for 3 days!! They included a bottle of wine and also there were real plates, eine glasses and utensiles. NO PLASTIC forks!! We went on the trip line excursion (ok if you have never done. We have done in Jamacia already), a submarine trip to check out the fish life, the road to Hana, a helicopter trip around Maui (highly recommend) took in a show in Lahana called Ulalena (highly recommend), a Luau, Haleakala, a winery, and whale watching (highly recommend), went to see Neil Sedaka in concert (was really nice) and lots of other things too mumerous to mention. The whale watching was the highlight of the trip. We went out 3 times and the whales came right up tot he boat! Breakfast buffet which was included was generic. However the pineapple and the fresh juices were really really good. We never grew tired of them. There are other hotels that might be a little more upscale.

The location of this hotel couldn't get any better. Snorkeling was a five minute walk down the beach to the serene underwater world near Black Rock.

It was great to see familiar faces upon our arrival. When Mikala, from guest services saw us, he remembered our names and said \"welcome home\". I know I wouldn't get that personal service from one of the big, corporate owned hotels on the beach. We love the spacious grounds. For having 300+ rooms, the grounds never seemed crowded, even with beach chairs spread around. During our week there, we never saw a lawnmower, leaf blower or hedge trimmer, yet the grounds were always well maintained. I liked that the plants were what you would expect to see in Hawaii: hibiscus, ginger, plumeria, kukui nut, banana trees and even a small taro patch. Our kids loved the Hawaiian activities: hula lessons, lei making, lau printing and more, and this year ukelele lessons. There are a lot of classes, almost like a cruise, yet you don't feel over scheduled. We liked the Tiki Terrace. If you get free breakfast vouchers from the Mixed Plate, you can redeem them at the Tiki Terrace for $13.50 a person. My husband, our seven year old and I would have full breakfasts (or breakfast buffet) for a total of $5-- the cheapest meal around. (Five and under eat free). Plus, they have local breakfasts, like taro pancakes or spam and eggs. Also, at night you can watch the hula show from the Tiki Terrace while you eat. The hula show has different songs or a different trio of dancers each night so you don't see the same show twice. One night after the hula show, we got our Tiki Terrace dinners to go and ate on our lanai so we could listen to the live music. This year we stayed in the Lana'i wing and the rooms looked like they were recently renovated. I've read the reviews about mold and mildew but have never saw/smelled evidence of that in any of our stays. The rooms have always been clean and comfortable. We had a room facing the courtyard which had an ocean view from the lanai. They keep upgrading us each time we stay there. One day our daughter was in The Maui News. Malihini, who works in Guest Services, called her husband and he brought us three copies of the newspaper to take home. That's the kind of personal service you get at KBH.

When we think of the number of people that pass through the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the KBH, for the staff to remember us from a year ago, and after a while to call us by name, was truly special and we must admit, unfortunately, so very unique in the world today. Each of us had a tear in our eyes when we hugged and said our good-byes this year and you don't expect, and certainly would not get, that feeling leaving an impersonal name brand chain hotel. It was this special treatment and feeling of being \"home\" that all of the staff at KBH demonstrated, that made leaving so hard - and the desire to return so strong. During our stay we had the opportunity to walk along the boardwalk in front of the KBH and to visit the other hotels along the Kaanapali Beach waterfront. While others have larger pools and more elegant buildings, none has the charm or green space that the KBH has. We stayed in the Molokai wing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the older section which was quaint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and visited the newer wings (Maui and Lanai) which may appeal to those looking for more modern accommodation. The location of the hotel is convenient to all of the amenities of Kaanapali \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Black Rock for snorkeling, Whalers Village for shopping and restaurants, and two golf courses only minutes away! However, the real selling point of KBH, and we must admit the one feature that can only be understood by those who have stayed there, is the hospitality and warmth you get from the people there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the time you check-in at the front desk or while you dine at one of the many eating establishments on-site (all casual, relaxed and very family friendly); at the guest services desk, where new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friends\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are always there to help you maximize your Hawaiian experience during your stay; and finally to the housekeeping staff, who ensure that your room is made up during the day, and that your bed is turned down at night, with your Macadamian cookie treat waiting for you on your pillow. Our family is looking forward to staying at the KBH next year and for all our return trips to Maui. We treasure the opportunity to reconnect with many of the staff there who have become very special people in our lives, in particular with Malihini of guest services, who has become a treasured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Auntie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to our ten-year old daughter. If you are planning a trip to Maui and are looking for a place to combine the convenience of location and reasonable price with a hotel experience that is something other than a cold and corporate place to stay, where your are always made to feel like a treasured guest, then our family encourages you to choose the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for your stay. To use the language of the Islands, it is more of an \"Ohana\" (family) feeling when you stay at the KBH! We would highly recommend the KBH to our Ohana and friends alike, or to anyone else who is looking for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touch of home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd combined with the culture and adventure that a stay in Hawaii, and especially Maui and Kaanapali in particular, has to offer!

After booking the hotel I read some not so great reviews about it so I was a little worried as to what I should expect.... I had one complaint, the shower/toliet room was rather small! The hotel buildings themselves are a bit dated as are the rooms and corridors but when you book into the oldest hotel in Maui this should really be expected! The beds were comfy and the rooms were cleaned everyday which is all I really ask for when I'm only sleeping somewhere! The Hotel prides itself as being the 'Most Hawai'ian Hotel' and it really is, the staff are the friendliest I have met and go above and beyond to make sure you have a truely Hawai'ian experience. The pool is quite small but its rarely crowded given that the hotel is located right on the beach. A must if your staying in this hotel or in the surrounding area is a meal at the Restaurant on the terrace (I forget the exact name) but its the hotels a la carte restaurant! It was the best meal I had on Maui and excellent value for money, I recommend the steak and shrimp combo, delish! The Tikki Bar is also recommended for snacks and light meals. When staying in Ka'anapali Beach, you must also visit Whalers Resort, its great for shops and restaurants, another recommendation for here is the Rusty Harpoon (Happy Hour 2 - 6!) Overall, I would give this hotel 9 out of 10 and Ka'anapali/Maui a 10, a must see island!

It's located in a great place (very close to Lahaina) and the staff is so incredibly helpful and friendly! The first morning after you arrive, attend the welcome breakfast where the staff first sings and dances some hula for you and then they take over an hour to get you acquainted with the island and show you all of the extra-curricular things you can do on the island. If you are interested in any of these trips, you may either book them yourself, or you can go to the guest service booth in the lobby and they will do it for you AT NO EXTRA CHARGE. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and were greeted with champagne in our room and a wonderful view (although it was not an ocean-front we still had a view of the ocean through some trees). This hotel provides nightly entertainment at no charge and it is very very Hawaiian in nature. The hotel also offers free classes like Hula dancing and lei making (sign up for these in advance). The boardwalk right behind the hotel follows the beach and you are within walking distance to Whaler's Village and other resorts. The water on the beach has a very strong undercurrent. My husband and I swam in it, but enjoyed the beach at the Big Island much better. In my opinion, it was too strong for children. It was pulling me out to sea and I'm a strong swimmer. But the pool is great. The kids love it because it's whale-shaped. Adults can drink alcoholic beverages at the pool but not on the beach, so we split our time between the two. There were a lot of families and small children, so if you don't like kids, don't come here. My husband and I didn't mind as we still had our privacy and it was still very romantic. This is truly THE most Hawaiian hotel. When you leave, the staff has a lei ceremony and you receive a free lei (the nut kind) and an invitation to come back anytime. I highly recommend this hotel. My husband jumped over to a nearby chain resort to use a computer (there is no business center here but you can hook up your laptop in your room) and he said that the other hotel just seemed so \"sterile\" compared to the this one. If you stay here, take the short drive to Lahaina because it is a very cute little town with great shopping and cool restaurants. Try the hula pie at Kimo's if you have a sweet tooth!

We did a Triology snorkel cruise to Molokini Crater and while it was great - we saw the same fish and tons of turtles 2 minutes from our hotel. Everyone at the hotel were always smiling and most accomodating. We asked for additional pillows, got em, asked for a fan (because we are all used to sleeping with the \"noise\" at home), got it no problem! The kids went in the pool a couple of times but preferred just playing in the waves, boogie and skim boarding. One note though - if you are picky about your pillow you really need to bring it. Their pillow were very very soft. Dont miss the magic show at the hotel. It was sooooo good!! The dancers were a highlight - almost like a luau with the magic show. The boys loved it too.

We were celebrating our delayed honeymoon/1 year wedding anniversary. We booked online with the Romance package. I had to fax over my credit card, and received written confirmation soon after. (I tried to book through AAA, but they said it they had no availability, so glad I did it on my own!). We arrived at the airport and got our rental car (included in the pkg). It was about a 45 minute drive to hotel, but boy was it gorgeous! Mountains on one side and the ocean on the other! Check in was quick, and we received a welcome basket and all our coupons (for the pkg items). After parking the car in the parking garage (have to pay $9 a day to park here, use room key, gets charged to room). We parked on the top deck, 3rd floor, and took the elevator to our room, 549. This room was very nice! We had tile floor in bathroom, fridge in closet, a bench of marble in the tub/shower, and a big balcony overlooking the gardens/pool/ocean. We used the in-room safe ($1 a day added to room bill) to lock up our cameras, etc. The king bed was huge, and they gave us 4 pillows! There was a standard TV with cable, 4 dresser drawers and 2 night stands along with a couch/twin bed and a large luggage holder. We were very pleased with the room! Only note, they conserve water on the island so sheets are washed every-other day. The hotel keeps its ground immaculate! Upon waking around 7:30am, my husband and I would sit on the balcony and watch the employees. They meticulously arrange the lounge chairs in rows, clean the pool, hose down the sidewalks, and rake the leaves and landscaping. They work hard! We attended the welcome breakfast, and got a great buffet with entertainment. They did a power point presentation of all their recommendations to see and do on the island. They rush through, so its a good idea to do your HW ahead of time! Besides, they didn't recommend an activity we did, but very much enjoyed! Speaking about breakfast, we ate at the Mixed Plate daily (included in our pkg). It has fruit, cereal, eggs, oatmeal, cornbread, lunch meat, and it rotates serving waffles, pancakes, cr\u00c3\u00aapes, or French toast. There is plenty to drink including coffee, tea, hot chocolate, cappuccino, juices and soda. The hotel offers free Hawaiian activities like lei making, hula lessons, pineapple cutting, etc. SIGN UP EARLY for these activities with Guest Services! I tried all week to get in to lei making, and was put on a wait list. I got in, and it was very fun! The hotel has a nice pool with the Tiki Grill nearby. This grill is popular lunch spot! You can order burgers, hot dogs (1 foot!), salads, chicken nuggets, fries onion rings, etc. It is a little pricey, but can be put on your room so you don't have to bring cash down poolside. Next to the Grille is the Tiki Bar. I ordered a Pina Colada and since it was \"close enough\" to the daily special (Mango Colada) I got the discount price of $6.00. The other hotel restaurant is the Tiki Terrace. We got a free nights dinner (in our pkg). It was amazing! The salad was small, and reminded me of rabbit food. But I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered fancy! I got BBQ ribs and my husband got steak. We also got masked potatoes with veggies. For dessert he got NY Cheesecake and I got Tiramisu. Our bill was about $70. All we ended up paying was our tip! Included in our package was a picnic lunch. This picnic came in a backpack loaded with real plates, silverware, cloth napkins and tablecloth, wine glasses and a bottle of wine! The lunch was cheese & crackers, sandwich meat, pasta salad, and fruit salad with chips and soda. There was so much food we ate it for 2 days! The beach in front of the hotel is the widest on the strip. We walked down to Whalers Village and past to the Hyatt, and the beach becomes non-existent. I can't imagine staying at a hotel on the ocean and not being able to lay on the beach! I loved ours, and the sand was so soft, but does get hot so wear for flip flops! The water does \"drop off\" so you will only be like 7 feet from the sand but up to your neck in water! The waves crash in and can be very strong under tow. For these two reasons, not many children swim in the ocean. Another down fall to the beach is the sand. Everyday between 1-4 the trade winds blow and the sand blows with it. You have to shut your mouth and eyes, and hold on to things like floats and empty Styrofoam coolers! Lastly, I want to mention the spa. We got a great massage (included in pkg). Also, the hotel has a convenience store which has everything from medications to postcards. There is also a jewelry store with great items like pearl earings! What else can I say about this hotel? The Romance Package we choose was perfect for us and exceeded our expectations! It was the closest thing to a Hawaii all-inclusive. Everything I was nervous about (the hotel being booked, the rental car, etc) was fine! The hotel was clean, friendly, and the best value. We liked the little things like turn down service with cookies, champagne and a welcome note, and an invitation to the goodbye ceremony on the pillow. Those little surprises make you smile.

The room also has a refrigerator (which is great for sodas, water, snacks), a safe, cable TV, iron & ironing board, coffee maker with free coffee and tea, and free soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. Plus, every night they turn down your bed and give you 4 coconut macadamia nut cookies! The grounds are large and full of grass, plants, palm and plumaria trees. Their pool is shaped like a whale (very Maui) - not big and fancy like some of the resorts, but it keeps you cool and it's cute! There's also a giant checkerboard that you play with coconuts as the pieces! Lots of lounges are all over the grass area so you can lay in the sun or shade and just relax. They have a couple of large \"huts\" that have beautiful wood tables and chairs that are great for a picnic lunch or dinner. The Tiki Grill, which serves yummy burgers and hot snacks, and the Tiki Bar, which is their only bar, are both located outdoors and are convenient to everyone. The Tiki Terrace restaurant is located outdoors on a covered lanai and has a delicious breakfast buffet with fruit, pastries, juice, toast, quiche, omelets, macadamia nut pancakes, bacon, sausage, hash, potatos, and a few other items. The dinners were excellent and a great value with a lot of the dinners in the $25 range. The lobby has several bamboo couches and chairs with glass coffee tables boasting beautiful tropical flower arrangements. If you have a laptop computer, there is free internet access in there (and around the grounds nearby) if you have a WiFi connection. The hotel also has a lot of activities. They have a keiki club (for kids) and other activities for the whole family. We did the hula and lei making lessons last time. This time, we learned how to play the ukulele and did the lei making again! They also have local artisans show their crafts in the lobby from 8am-12pm on Sun, Mon, Wed, and Fri. We found a lot of fun gifts to bring back for family and friends. Most importantly, the staff make you feel as if you are family. They are the most friendly and helpful people! They really go the extra mile. The hotel may not have a spa or be a resort, but that's what makes this hotel so charming and wonderful. It's half the price of the hotels surrounding it for the same views and beach - and the service and staff make it a perfect place to spend a vacation.

However, we had a great experience and would stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel again in a heartbeat. We made sure to request one of the newly renovated rooms when making our reservation. The staff was very accommodating and we got the exactly what we requested. We checked in early and they even gave us a call on our cell phone when our room was ready, so that we did not have to sit around waiting for it. We stayed in a partial ocean view room in the Lanai wing. Our room was clean, well maintained, and surprisingly big. We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony and listening to the nightly music. We even received a complimentary bottle of champagne since we were celebrating our honeymoon. The breakfast at the Mixed Plate grill was pretty good, nothing gourmet. They always had fruit, cereal, potatoes, rice, eggs, toast, pancakes or waffles, and some sort of meat. Some of the other resorts nearby were definitely more luxurious and had nicer pool areas. However, we thought that our hotel was not as crowded or noisy as some of the others nearby (and it was much cheaper!). I think the best part of the KBH is the huge stretch of beach in front of the hotel and its proximity to great snorkeling at black rock and the Whaler's Village shopping area. Down towards the south part of Ka'anapali Beach the beach starts to narrow and it seems to be widest in front of the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel.

Upon checking in, I couldn't have been more pleased. We were in the Kaui wing and had NO complaints. The room was spacious, clean and we had a partial ocean view while also overlooking the lawn and part of the pool area. The beach was great and we NEVER had to worry about getting a chair by the pool or spreading out. We walked the lovely boardwalk to the Sheraton, Westin etc. and they were SOOO crowded. I actually talked to a few people at the KBH pool who felt the exact same way. I'd personally never pay more money to stay at a more crowded hotel. Their poolside was literally chair to chair. The pools were much bigger at other hotels, but KBH was a decent size and perfect for getting in to cool off and float. Breakfast was included in our package and we went there every morning except when we did the volcano bike ride. Fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, toast, etc etc were on the daily buffett - what more would you need? I'm used to cereal and something healthy/simple at home so this was nice.

The hallway is enclosed and smelled a bit musty so I was happy we weren't staying in that section. The hotel could use some updating but we still had a great time. It has the BEST BEACH in Kaanapali although you need to rent the cabanas & umbrellas. We rented a cabana twice and it is so worth it if you want to hang out on the beach all day comfortably.

The drinks are good but expensive unless you drink the special of the day choice. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast using the hotel food voucher. I thought it was expensive since we still wound up spending another 20 bucks each morning beyond our voucher ?!? Luckily the food was good.

If you are looking for a place to stay in Kaanapali that's lower cost, w/ a great location on the beach, and has a slow paced, relaxing vibe, this is a property to consider. Almost everyone that's reviewed this place has indicated its location on the beach is one of its strongest attributes. and I agree w/ this. The beach behind the hotel is wide and the walk down to Black Rock and some wonderful snorkerling is very short. We actually found the snorkeling at Black Rock to be a little better than Molokini (we saw sea turtles on a couple different days at Black Rock). Regarding the rooms, we stayed in the Maui wing of the hotel and found the room to be very clean, comfortable, and spacious. Having spent the last night of our vacation at the Westin, I can tell you that our room at the KBH was just as nice, if not larger, than our room at the Westin (and much, much cheaper). Rooms w/in the Maui wing have been renovated and I think they are classified as 'partial oceanview' (although you have to peer through many a tree to see the ocean). We were originally slotted for a garden view room but were upgraded as it was our anniversary. Not sure what condition the rooms w/in the Kaui and Molokai wings are, but it seems like some of the more negative comments regarding this place have come from folks staying in these areas. If this concerns you, it may be best to reserve a room w/in the Maui or Lanai wings as it will insure you a renovated room w/ at least a really nice view of the courtyard - and, this will still be considerably less expensive than a stay at the higher end hotels (although, one should really think about how much time you're going to spend in your room as we were only there to sleep, shower, and change clothes - our room at the Westin was oceanfront w/ a really great view of the ocean and we spent no more time in that room or out on the patio than at the KBH). The pool area of the hotel is satisfactory. It's a no frills pool in the shape of a whale. You can't compare this pool w/ the spectacular one at the Westin which has waterfalls and waterslides; however, the kids in our party had fun swimming in it and it was never crowded during our stay - no need to endlessly search for chairs or strain to keep track of your kids because of the sheer size of the pool complex or the mobs of people (see an afternoon at the Westin pool area for this). Lastly, I'd just like to say that the feel and tone of this place was just what we were looking for....Very relaxing...Very slow paced....I think some people think their slogan of being the 'most Hawaiian hotel' is cheesy and such; however, having also stayed at the Westin during our vacation, I can say our experience at the KBH was more in line w/ how we expected to feel while in Maui. Additionally, their nightly Hula and music show was very entertaining and contributed to this feeling. A nice touch and perfect way to end a fun filled day in paradise..... With that said, I think any return trip to paradise for us will include a stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY City", "Title": "\u201cNo thanks\u201d", "Author": "NYCityTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7870473", "Content": "Locked in the 60s.

I was really dissapointed that the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel was not a better hotel. Good Points: 1) The front desk staff was friendly. 2) People seemed to be enjoying themselves out in the courtyard playing with the giant checker board Bad Points: 1) Mildew / Unhealthy Room Odor: The first room we were given had a heavy mildew smell. The mold/mildew smell was so overwhelming that it triggered my mother's asthma. I was supprised that the hotel would actually try to put a guest in that room. That room should have been closed off and bleached down. It was uninhabitable. To the hotel's credit they gave us a room in another building. Unfortunately this room also had a mildew smell. The smell was no where near as bad as the original room, but there was definately a strong odor of mildew. My mother tried to tolerate the smell, but the previous room had already triggered her asthma and she needed fresh air. She could not tolerate the mildew/mold odor and we had to leave the hotel. 2) Poor functioning Room keys: This was just an annoyance. We had a difficult time getting the room keycard to work. In fact, another guest came by to try to help us open our room. She said that her room keycard also had the annoying habit of not working from time to time. 3) No Internet Acess: This as also an annoyance. I guess I never realized just how much I like having an available internet connection. It comes in especially handy when you need to search for a new hotel. 4) Profit Grabbing: The front desk staff smiled and told us in a very friendly way that we would have to pay for one night's stay at the hotel despite their rooms having a strong Mildew odor. I explained to the front desk staff that my mother has asthma and that the Mildew smell in both of the rooms was triggering her asthma. However, they refused to give us a full refund. They charged me for one nights stay. Does it seem fair to charge a customer for a night's hotel stay when the air in the room is so full of mildew that it is triggering an asthma attack?

Our room was located on the ground floor of the Maui wing and included breakfast each morning and a car from Dollar Rent a Car for $240/night. The room was quite large and had a separate sunken sitting area connected to an outdoor patio area overlooking the hotel's gardens and the ocean about 150 yds beyond, but our entry door looked out on the parking garage. The furnishings and the decor are beginning to show their age, not broken, just worn and dated. As a whole the hotel felt dated and in need of a facelift. The Mixed Plate offered a basic ,blah tasting breakfast buffet with the ambiance of Burger King. Because of this we didn't try the other restaurants in the hotel. The staff was helpful in all regards and recommended the luau at the Hyatt. It is a 15 minute walk down the boardwalk. We sprung for the VIP access to the luau which gave us front row seats, a drink waiter, and first access to the buffet dinner. The show was quite entertaining and the food was decent, not great.

I had booked a partial ocean view room for my then-fiance and myself, as well as three rooms for our wedding party. My fiance and I arrived and were sent to a room that absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke - I didn't even make it over the threshold. Reminding the front desk that we had requested a non-smoking room, we were told that since we'd arrived late in the day (um, 4pm?) they were full and we could either pay up for the next room class or take a smoking room. ?!?!?! We ended up in a room that they claimed was a suite, and that boasted a view of the side of the next building over. How romantic. I was told the manager would call our room to discuss options, and shocker that call never came, even when I reminded them I was still waiting for it. Our wedding party's rooms were to the booked specifications, but were located down an enclosed, carpeted hallway that smelled strongly of mildew and looked generally unclean. I was completely embarrassed that my friends had to stay there (although they were staying for free, so they weren't about to complain!). The front desk and restaurant staffs were surly and I don't understand where this \"most Hawaiian\" reputation comes from... unless most Hawaiian means most bitter toward tourists. However, the maids, bartenders, and beach staff were extremely friendly. The beach is lovely and the location really is tough to beat, but I would give up a lot of location to get something better than Motel 6. The better bet (for a better price) is the Mauian in Napili.

This was our first time to Hawaii, 4/12 -4/17, and was encouraged to stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel by Costco Travel. For four months, I frequently reviewed Trip Advisor's reviews, to make sure it was the right hotel for us. We wanted a nice, clean hotel with all the amenities a higher-rated class hotel would have, but at a cheaper price. Most of the reviews were very good. But, I began to get skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews. The room we stayed in was in the Lanai building on the 6th floor, and it had an amazing ocean view. You won't find granite countertops or marble floors, but you will find a standard, very clean room with nice Hawaiian touches. The bed, table with 2 chairs, and TV armoire were made with rattan and possibly bamboo - just what I'd wanted in a Hawaiian hotel. The island pictures also added a nice touch. The air conditioning worked just fine, as well as the refrigerator. The bathtub even had a sitting ledge, which was nice to shave my legs. Since it was our anniversary, the hotel provided us a bottle of champaigne - what a nice surprise! The nightly turn-down servie with a flower and cookies were great too. The expansive grounds on the property provided privacy for everyone. The plumeria trees, habiscus plants, and other native plants/trees on the property were just beautiful. The chairs and loungechairs were scattered throughout the property for privacy. The pool is not an enormous lagoon pool, but just the right size and in the shape of a whale. We had tickets for free daily breakfast which was very good. Although it was not a huge buffet, they had scrambled eggs, sausages, potatoes, several varieties of fruit and cereals, pancakes/waffles, crepes, and breads. We did not eat at the Tiki Terrace, but others said it was very good. The Tiki grill by the pool had good burgers and fries. The also have a beach bar which we attended to several times. The entertainment with Rudy and his band provides great entertainment. This hotel is just a short walk to Whalers Village, on the beach boardwalk. There are many stores to shop for souvenirs, jewelry, artwork and clothing. A few are high-end, but there a many shops that provide lesser price items. There you will also find The Hula Grill which has fantastic food and nightly entertainment, right on the beach. We took a stroll to see the Hyatt and the Sheraton and were very glad we chose the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. The Hyatt's pool area was not as grand as others I've been to, and they were swarming with people. They had absolutely no room to spread out. The beach area was also extremely small. The Sheraton's lagoon pool was nice, but they also don't have room for privacy. We found some of our best souvenir deals in the town of Lahaina, a few miles south of the hotel. The General Store there has all the souvenirs at great prices. I would by-pass the Cannery mall - there are just a few shops open in there. The hotel also has a few shops in there as well. Every day, at the hotel lobby, we would find locals selling crafts and wooden tiki items. The farewell ceremony by Malihini was very touching and made me think I was part of their family. They provide everyone with a Kukui nut lei. As you can tell, I was thoroughly happy with this hotel.

Special thanks to Mikala for his amazing recommendations of activities and beaches. The Trilogy snorkel adventure \"Discover Ka'anapali\" was fantastic! Excellent snorkeling is just down the beach a few steps at Black Rock - we enjoyed it every morning (earlier is best.) Ultimately, if you are looking for a high-end, luxury hotel with room service and miles of pools, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a true Hawaiian experience in a comfortable hotel, on a beautiful beach --I highly recommend the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel.

We paid extra for an ocean front room and it was worth every penny. The view was outstanding from our floor (the 5th). Sometimes we just wanted to go nowhere/sit on our balcony. The furnishings were average but clean. We did kill a bug in the bathroom the first day but none after that so that was not too bad. Breakfast that was included not very good so next time we would probably book a package that did not include the breakfast. Champagne brunch on Sunday was worth the price - we were full the rest of the day. Next time we stay here we will most likely not rent a car. We did the Old Lahaina Luau (worth it do this once-need to book months ahead). We did the Road to Hana (a waste of a beautiful day) so the only other thing we would need a car for when we go back is to go up to the top of Crater. You can take a bus for $1 each way to Lahaina. The only problem is the last bus comes back around 8:00 p.m. We spent a lot of time on the beautiful beach in front of the hotel and when it was time to dinner went a couple of times to the Hula Grill and a couple of times to Leilani's on the Beach. If you eat on the outside patio the food is reasonable and the view of the sunset is outstanding. Also ate at Ruth Chris Steak House in Lahaina - excellent food and prices about the same as the mainland. Cheeseburger in Paradise was fun, but the food there was average. We did a timeshare presentation at 8:30 a.m. one morning. It was worth the 1 hour time. We got a \"buy one, get one free\" whale watching cruise (the Safari boat-excellent) and $29 for me and my husband to take a sunset dinner cruise (awful). We look forward to staying at the KBH again.

Will give you the pros and cons of that decision. On the plus side, the hotel is in a good location with a very great beach running along the front and right next door to the Black rock by the Sheraton. You can snorkel off the beach right there at Black Rock and you can walk the pathway along other hotels and to Whalers Village which has lots of shops and eateries. That said, the hotel itself is very dated. The original room we were given and the building it was in needs renovating desperately. It was very rundown looking from the hallways, to the rickety elevator, to the room itself. Didn't feel or smell clean to me. Viewwise, our room provided a view of the parking lot & small shrubbery path not well kept. This was advertised as the garden view. After a few days I realized that we were in the oldest section and that others had been updated more recently. With the hotel seeming not that full on guests, I asked for a less run down room, which they accommodated right away. Second room was certainly an improvement. Newer carpet, appeared cleaner, and some general updates. Smelled much cleaner too. Balcony view was much better, faced inner court . Must say the staff was always very friendly and helpful to us, Staying here I felt I was at an outdated tourist hotel. The entertainment was not bad but a little too old style entertainment for us although we are not young by any means. If you are looking for good location, don't care about the amentiies or ambiance, just a good location then perhaps this might work for you if you have one of the newer rooms. In fairness the food was not too bad. This is not the hotel you will rave about to your friends or cherish the memories of the luxuriousness of your stay. It is more the econo hotel you will say that you stayed at because it was more affordable in comparison to others, you didn't need anything upscale and don't care about esthetics and you just want a good beach, convenient location and nothing else matters.

The last time we were in Maui, we stayed at the Sheraton but we both decided we liked the Kaanapali Beach Hotel better. The Sheraton is high class and about twice the price. Parking was much easier at the KBH with a parking ramp and close to the hotel, versus a lot. The beach and elevators were close also. It seemed that the Sheraton was a lot more walking to get anywhere and the grounds seem smaller and more crowded in the public areas. The KBH has many return customers because of the atmosphere. The hotel seems genuine and is very relaxed and enjoyable. The KBH is an older hotel and some areas could use remodeling and the walls seemed a bit thin but our room was very clean and the bed was comfortable.

The location and beach are perfect and this hotel really had everything we were looking for in a tropical, relaxing vacation. Our room was clean, as were the meticulously kept grounds. The view, even from the \"partial ocean view\" room was picture perfect. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place, perfect location and a \"family feel\" to their vacation. There are much fancier places to stay along Kaanapali Beach with a much bigger price- we loved the KBH and enjoyed spending the savings on a convertible rental car and lots of good food and drink.

It was our first time staying in Maui and we had been told by our daughter who had spent a week of her honeymoon at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel in 2005 to not think of staying anywhere else. Our travel agent also agreed. We are delighted that we chose to follow their advise! I can not imagine staying in a better managed property. From the moment of our arrival right through till we had to reluctantly return to winter's reality we found the accomodations to be well equipped, comfortable, clean and well maintained. The grounds and the views from our rooms were spectacular and the hotel staff were the friendliest and most helpful that we have ever experienced. Delicious food was available in casual as well as more formal locations and menues ranged from simple to gourmet. Daily entertainment was offered for both children and adults and we delighted in dancing under the stars after an ellaborate dinner in the Tiki Terrace Restaurant. In addition to a lovely whale-shaped pool, the hotel has a fantastic stretch of gorgeous and easily swimmable beach for anyone who chooses a salt water swim. There are lots of excellent attractions and restaurants off-property as well and many are within walking distance from the hotel. A farewell ceremony is conducted for all guests who are checking out and everyone is presented a Kukui Nut Lei to bring home to help preserve the memories.

Overall I can't complain too much since I paid $125 a night for the room. Room: The room was cleaned daily and decent size. Mine had a king size bed and a sofa and didn't feel cramped. We hardly stayed in our rooms (Road to Hana, Haleakala crater, Whale watching cruise, snorkeling, Olivine pools and Nakele blow hole, dinner at Mama's fishhouse) so getting luxurious accommodations wasn't a priority. But for your \"hotel/resort snobs\" here are some negatives: There was a musty odor (like wet dog) which resolved by running the fan and AC. The TV had cable but was a \"regular\" set (not flat screen let alone flat panel). The furniture had some chips here and there. The bedding was motel qualitly. The shower door didn't have any sort of latch and there was some rust stains on the edges. My \"view\" was of the Sheraton's fence. So of course this was no 4 or 5 star room, but hey, I got a great deal on the room. Service: Friendly staff. My wife had a hole in her bathing suit that needed to be sewn and the staff brought up a sewing kit in 5 minutes (and didn't accept my tip). Check in and check out was straightforward. Hotel/Resort: Only thing really missing is a gym. Otherwise they had everything else on site if staying in the resort was all you wanted to do (restaurants, gift shop, spa/salon, activities, pool, bar, etc). Also the grounds are well landscaped with palm trees and banana trees, etc. The pool is a decent break from the sand and salt water, but with Kaanapali beach and Black Rock at your foot steps, I didn't spend much time at the pool. Restaurant: My wife and I had breakfast at the Tiki Terrace (taro bread french toast, papaya juice, eggs, taro hash browns, portugese sausage, coffee) which came out to $40. The food was good quality but obviously there are cheaper options out there (Moose McGullicutty in Lahaina for example). Didn't try any other on site options since we dined out the rest of the time. Location: Couldn't be better. Walked to Black Rock to snorkel my last 2 days (and swam with a sea turtle on one day). Walked to the Whaler's village mall to rent my snorkel gear at Maui dive shops (waaay cheaper than the on site vendor and better quality gear). 5 minutes to Lahaina for more dining and shopping options. Other notes: Eventhough I got the Aloha value, it still included one free \"orientation\" breakfast (which I didn't partake in since I already had my activities planned out which required leaving the hotel by 6 or 7 AM 3 out of the 4 days I was there). Parking is an extra $8/day. The in room safe is $1.50/day. The farewell \"ceremony\" is a nice touch. It takes literally 5 minutes and you get the farewell lei. Overall, I would stay here again owing to its great location, plus I'm not a \"hotel snob\". However if you care about the thread count on your sheets, having marble in the bathroom, ordering room service and champagne, pools with waterfalls and slides, etc, you will NOT be happy here.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turlock, Ca", "Title": "\u201cFamily Tradition\u201d", "Author": "kramsugs", "ReviewID": "UR6589524", "Content": "This was our 4th visit to KBH.

I was traveling with my husband, daughter and son in law. It was our 43rd anniversary. We have all traveled together in the past and looked forward to this trip. I always use trip advisor before I make my choice. Let me just say, this hotel was our favorite. The hotel was so Hawaiian and romantic. We had a first floor room looking out at the garden. Every morning we went out and picked flowers off the ground for our room. The smell was incredible. On the beach is a walkway that takes you to outdoor/indoor dinning, shopping etc. A beautiful night stroll. Every evening there is entertainment in the garden. Dinning while you are listening to wonderful Hawaiin music. The staff is delightful, and you are surrounded by wonderful hotels and condos. Our room was huge! We had two double beds, and a step down to a level with table and 4 chairs plus a big day bed. Walk out to patio and garden. Facing pool and ocean. The dressing area and bath were out of the way, so we never, ever felt crowed. I really did not see other wings, or rooms, so I can only tell you how delighted we were with this hotel. After leaving a Hilton, and after the next Hilton, we all, and I mean all of us, would have preferred this room over all others. Our stay at the Hilton on Kauai was a nightmare of roach's. But that is another story for another island. If other's have found fault with this hotel, I cannot say why. I wish I were 43, instead of 63!!! I would go back every year.

Malihini and Mikala in Guest Services were wonderful. The entire staff made us feel at home.

We could go on and on with how much we enjoyed our stay. About the Beach, I can honestly say that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a perfect beach with no waves, you will be disappointed. But in comparison to all of the other hotels nearby, this was the best beach. One aspect I did have complaints about was the fact that you had to pay for lounge chairs on the beach, I believe $30 day, and couldn't take any regular chairs on the beach either. You had to rent them from Trilogy on the beach=werent the friendliest of guys either. For all you single people out there, this is a family place, mostly married people. Its a great place to come if you wanna be alone. But, the positives definetly outweigh the negative with KBH. Also, if you are looking for a ritzy hotel, this is not for you. In that case, go to the Hyatt, but then youre NOT going to have a great beach and you're going to be spending a ton of money. I'm recommending KBH to everyone I know and more than likely will return.

The housekeeping staff is really friendly and helpful crew. The grounds keeps are also friendly, and work very hard. There is also a bartender at the Tiki Bar named Dale that really makes people want to come back. The location of the property is very convenient. Oh and my bed was extremely comfortable. I have read reviews where guests complained about the rooms not being updated and requesting newer upgraded ones. We booked a full ocean view room, ground floor. We did not want to take the chance of having to move. So paying full price here, really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth it, the room was no where near updated. The drawers needed serious WD40. The patio door was stuck for the 9 days we stayed there. It was obvious this room was in line for a serious shove into the update department. But, I lived with it. That was the good, and this is what turned the whole experience off for us. On the third day of my 9 day trip, I went out in front of our expensive ocean front view room to relax in a lounge chair to read a book, where upon my ankle found a rather large, and grass covered hole. It was about 9 inches deep. My ankle snapped. I heard a *pop* and down I went. On their impeccably well groomed landscape, which they tend to each morning without fail, raking, mowing, and collecting debris (I was up at 6am each day. I saw it) they simply ignored two huge holes. The drainage pipe I was told had collapsed the ground in two places. The grounds crew immediately covered the 'one' hole. I was privileged to view an orange cone for the rest of my stay. I immediately iced my own ankle but it was clear that by 6pm ice was not the answer. I sent my brother to the front desk for an ace bandage. He returned with 2 security members. One told me I had torn a tendon. The other said if I wanted to see a doctor he would have someone come check on me in the morning and see how I was. No one came. We had to seek them out. I did go to the clinic, spent almost 3 hours there, and received a pair of crutches, Ibruprophan, an ankle brace, ace bandage, AND upper respiratory infection. I guess that was the bonus. For the balance of our stay, not once did anyone inquire of my condition. We basically felt as though we were purposely being ignored. We had to cancel several activities, dinners, and a trip to Hana and the Aquarium. My remaining days were spent hobbling around a hotel I felt could care less that my vacation was ruined because they choose to ignore their own part in all this. By the time we were ready to leave we decided the good-bye ceremony was simply too contrite for us. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the stomach to face a group of people that made me feel so unwelcome. I was grateful to be going home. Although I will probably never go back, I will say this. I think for anyone who visits the island for the first time, this is a fine hotel to stay in. The small details that make a vacation nice, the turn-down service with cookies and flowers at night is lovely. The goodbye ceremony I am sure is very sweet. They try to be helpful, when they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you require too much. I would defiantly recommend this hotel. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get hurt there. Hints are this. Avoid the Mixed Plate Diner for your free breakfast. We ate once and decided to use our $12.50 coupon toward the breakfast at the Tiki Terrace. It was excellent. Also, if the special on the menu at the Tiki Terrace happens to be All you Can eat crab legs, avoid it. They do not provide small shellfish forks. Trying to dig out crab meat from those legs is not only an exercise in futility, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also dangerous. My brother ended up with crab pickers throughout his finger. More ended up on the floor than in his mouth and the $29.00 Item was not removed from the bill. They would rather you be unsatisfied than lose a dime on a meal you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fight. Or bring your own fork! And one last thing, there is a Longs drugstore just passed the Front Street exit, in the Lahaina Cannery Mall.

For our honeymoon we had requested a non-smoking king room but upon check-in were told that no non-smoking king rooms existed and that we had to take a non-smoking room with double beds in the Kauai wing. The room wasn't awful but was far from nice- the furniture was worn, the stained wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the lighting was bad and a musty smell permeated the place. As for the \"partial ocean view\", we had to go out on the balcony and look through a row of trees to see the sand and water since the room directly faced a huge condo tower. We went to the lobby to complain to the front desk about the room and they were more than understanding, as if they knew that the room was bad (I overheard another front desk conversation later on where the guy was telling someone that some rooms in the hotel were due to be remodeled- I'm hoping that is the case). We were shown another room on the other side of the property that was much nicer. We took it, although it still wasn't a non-smoking king room (I never understood that generic hotel policy- if someone requests a specific type of room, why would a hotel rent that room to someone else if they know someone else already reserved it, or offer it in the first place?) Our new room had a beautiful view of the courtyard and the beach. While the bathroom was very small, everything else was nice. The furniture was fairly new, there was a big ceiling fan in the middle of the room and everything had a tropical look. It was so much better than the depressing first room we had! The KBH advertises itself as Maui's Most Hawaiian Hotel and I have a feeling they are right. Everything about the place screams Hawaiian culture. The lobby is very well done and the courtyard area is a small tropical paradise on its own. There are immaculate gardens, tons of lounge chairs, a Tiki Bar, a Tiki Grill for a quick meal, the Tiki Terrace restaurant for more elaborate food offerings and an outdoor stage where there was always something going on. The hotel's resident performer, Rudy Akino, performed there six nights a week and was a pleasure to watch. While he and his band were great at performing Hawaiian tunes, they had no problem taking other types of music and giving it a Hawaiian feel. Rudy always made the audience feel welcome and he is one of the things we missed most when we had to leave. What really makes the KBH so great is the staff, which is as close to flawless as they come. The front desk was very friendly and accomodating when we wanted to switch rooms and that \"guest first\" mentality was shared by everyone we encountered. Every staff member we came across was more than eager to offer help or just smile and say \"Aloha\" as we passed. All hotels should send their staffs to the KBH for training because they are THAT good. The farewell song and lei distribution almost brought tears to my eyes because by the time our stay was done, we really did feel like family. At first we didn't want to stay but when it came time to go, it was like everyone had to be dragged out kicking and screaming because they loved the place so much, ourselves included. Complaints are few. The breakfast buffet in the Mixed Plate restaurant was a little lackluster- the food offerings were average at best, as was the quality of the food. The convenience store was pretty lousy- there were more souveniers and hard liquor than stuff that you go to a convenience store to buy. And there is that problem with some of the hotel rooms being pretty lousy... But as long as you get a good room, the KBH is a wonderful place.

The teenagers LOVED the close proximity to the mall (Whalers' Village). It was handy, there is a little food court there that has a McDonalds to fill them up with reasonably priced food.

Only bad point to note is that the hire of beach cabanas, umbrellas and sun loungers is not free for hotel guests - would of been nice to get them as perks of being guests - think other hotels along the beach got them free.

Book anywhere else and you'll get a better place. When we arrived, we found the hallways dark, dirty and the walls stained. The rooms were no better. The carpets were disgusting, furniture falling apart and the bathroom was dirty. I was not about to spend our hard earned vacation time and money in that room. I told the front of the situation and they were non responsive, they just didn't care. I promptly called another hotel and made arrangements, even though I would have to pay full price there. I would have saved myself a lot of money had I booked with the other hotel instead 6 months ago. I paid the price for taking a chance with the KBH.

Normally I stay in Marriotts, Hiltons, Hyatts, etc. for business and can be a bit of a hotel snob, but I did not want to pay a lot of money for a room I would basically be sleeping in, so my decision for this hotel was primarily based on price, and secondarily on location - I wanted to be on Kaanapali south of the Sheraton and Black Rock. Overall the hotel was not as bad as I was expecting - I was expecting it to be very run down. I had requested to be in one of the newer wings and stayed in both the Lanai and the Maui - our requested king was not available when we checked in around 10PM but we were moved as soon as one was available. The Maui wing was definitely the nicer of the two in my opinion. The hotel lobby is a bit run down and the rooms are not the Four Seasons, but for the price and location it was great and I have no complaints. I did not smell any of the mustiness that we heard about. The bellman are willing to bring your bags to your room, so if you are in a wing without elevators I would have them brought to your room, probably worth the tip. Originally my plan had been to \"sneak\" into the pools at the other hotels but ended up using only the KBH hotel and beach - in the grand scheme of things a lawn chair is a lawn chair, and the other pools were quite crowded and had more children. The beach in front of the KBH is amazing - the widest stretch - if you are at the Marriott or the Hyatt you cannot even really lay on the beach - at high tide the water was going up to the plants at the top of it, and the Hyatt's beach was very rocky on top of that. The Hyatt had the best lobby of the hotels on the beach, I had expected to be sorry I was not at the Marriott as I had stayed there before, but it is looking run down and I was happy to be at the KBH instead. The cabanas on the beach at all of the hotels are rented out by the various resorts and associated travel groups, and were well worth the price (about $20 for half the day). There were no problems getting lawn chairs at the pool at any times of the day and the water was a great temperature. The grounds of the hotel were beautifully maintained and while they may not have been as elaborate as the other hotels, it was still nice to look at. We had garden rooms in both wings but since they overlook the pool area, we did have some ocean view way in the distance (at least in the buildings we were in, the doors into the room faced the back of the hotel). The bathrooms were small but were ok for the two of us (a couple), and maid service brought us extra towels when we needed them. The staff was friendly but not overly so. We went for the valet parking since it was only $2 a day more than regular parking and I also think that was worth it - made things easy on us. We did not eat at the hotel restaurants aside from the Tiki Bar and Grill at the pool - the burgers were excellent as were the blue hawaii's. I had the best steak of my life at the Westin's outdoor restaurant. As far as things to do - this hotel is close enough to Black Rock that you can walk to snorkeling, to Whalers Village for meals and shopping, and scuba, etc. is offered (for additional fees). Originally I had wanted to stay at the Westin and their grounds were beautiful, but I think when I return to Maui I would stay at the KBH again, with perhaps one or two nights at the Westin to splurge. Now, if you are looking for the frills of room service, in-room internet, and being catered to the way the Intercontinental, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, etc. do, I would recommend the Westin or perhaps the Hyatt (if you don't want beach. If you are looking to explore the island, enjoy the beach and pool, be on a great stretch of beach, and are ok with a basic hotel room, this is honestly the place to be. I don't think you'll be sorry, and if you are horrified with your room, it does seem that the management will move you and try to accomodate your requests.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel\u201d", "Author": "aajj00", "ReviewID": "UR5920466", "Content": "What a truly memorable experience that will last a lifetime! Every moment of our stay at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel was fantastic.

The hotel is located on absolutely the best part of Ka'anapali Beach if not all of Maui: wide stretches of soft-golden sand, black rock with terrific snorkeling opportunities and the nightly tiki torch lighting ceremony. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast orientation which was valuable to learn more about the hotel and staff in an entertaining fashion. The nightly shows were a feature we could not live without especially since the other hotels do not offer such Hawaiian-style performances: nice music, talented hula dancers, and funny jokes. Matter of fact, guests from other hotels ended up at KBH! We loved the breakfasts and dinners that were served at The Mixed Plate. It was such a great variety every day at a reasonable price, we did not think of going to dinner at any other place. We generally like to explore and try different local restaurants during our travels, but this is the first for us to stick to The Mixed Plate every evening. The most rewarding part about staying at KBH was interacting with the friendly staff while participating in many of the daily cultural activities. The staff made it so interesting to learn about the different native arts!

It was not a super-plush, super perfect, super expensive place like many of the hotels in that area. It was a bit older, not quite as modern and one could see areas of design that would probably be redone today if they could. We had a corner room overlooking the ocean. We thought it was quite fine and were very happy with it. The deal we had with breakfast included at the mix plate, or substantial discounts at the Tiki Terrace, were well-suited to our family with two young girls who liked picking from the buffet for their breakfasts On to the magic show... Included was a breakfast on one of our first two days, The breakfast was even better than the Tiki Terrace or the Mixed Plate I thought. The purpose was for the concierge to let you know what things you might consider doing while you were on Maui. Very useful I thought. The last part of this was to let Jody the Magician come on stage and give a taste of the show he put on every night. My girls had never seen magic before and I was unsure of the effect on them. I quizzed them later and they were ambivalent about it. I had thought that if they showed amazement or keen interest I would take them to the show even though it would be nearly $200 for our family. (It does include a very nice dinner, some drinks, and dessert.) Jody had a habit of hanging out in the hotel lobby afterwards as it turned out. I approached him and he was very friendly and affable. We talked about this and he encouraged me to see the show. His show was quite good I thought. But what made it really special was the way he got everyone involved. And I think he gets all of the kids in the audience up on stage at one point or another. He seems to really enjoy it. And that helps us enjoy it. But getting to see our kids up in front of everyone and helping him perform magic tricks was worth the price of admission. I wish we had had a camera at that moment. At the end our youngest was given a lei of about 20 animal balloons. She was told in front of everyone that these were magic balloons and if she put them under her pillow and one of them popped that she would receive $1 for each popped balloon. And then I was given a big wink. The girls were quite excited by the whole thing and very happy. We bought a magic set on the way out and we have been very happy with that as well.

The reviews on Trip Advisor were mixed, but we decided to take a chance on the KBH. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad that we did\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe were not disappointed. We paid $200 for a partial ocean-view room with a king bed and complimentary breakfast in the Mixed Plate restaurant. If you do some research you will find that other hotels on this magnificent beach start at over $300 for a mountain or garden view room. We were hoping for a free upgrade as this is promised to honeymooners if space is available; however at this time the hotel was full\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtake note of this if you are hoping for a free upgrade. We were glad that we booked the partial ocean room rather then the garden view room. After reading trip advisor reviews when I booked through our travel agent I requested a room in the Maui or Lanai wings. When we arrived at KBH they had noted this and we were placed in a first floor room in the Lanai wing. Our room was very big and spacious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause we were on the first floor we gained some extra space because the 2nd floor lanais were above our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which included a table and day bed. Additionally, we had a lanai outside our room that looked onto the courtyard (and we could see the beach!). Every night the housekeeping staff did a turn-down service and left a flower on the bed with 2 packages of coconut-macadamia nut cookies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were very good (apparently at the Marriott you have to request turn-down service). In terms of meals at KBH on your first day you are invited to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where the hotel staff explain some of the fun things to do in the area. It was a buffet breakfast and it was very good. We had complimentary meal tickets for the Mixed Plate restaurant for the rest of our stay. We used 1 set to order a boxed lunch for our trip to the Road to Hana\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe were actually surprised by how good the lunch was\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit hit the spot! We used another set to go to the Tiki Terrace Restaurant for the Sunday Champagne Brunch. The tickets count for a $12.50 credit towards the cost of the buffet ($31.50)\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddefinitely worth it! The buffet was VERY expansive and included a variety of foods. We went at 10:00 a.m.; however I would suggest going a bit later as there are many delicious lunch foods (roast beef, egg rolls, stir fry etc.) and great desserts! You definitely won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need lunch and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only want a small dinner. The Tiki Grill was great for a quick meal or snack. The beach outside the hotel is amazing. It is the widest stretch of beach along the Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach (those staying at the Hyatt and Marriott have just a sliver!). It is also only a 3 minute walk from Black Rock\u00e2\u20ac\u201da great snorkelling spot. The waves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t 10-12 feet high as another reviewer suggested; however they are powerful and you do need to be careful. If you are going snorkelling I would suggest using a noodle or life jacket in combination with flippers to make the swim easier. Some additional charges you should be aware of: $8 a day for self-parking or $10 for valet parking (plus tip of course) and $1.25 a day for the safe (all of the hotels we stayed at in Hawaii charged for the safe and this was the cheapest.. you can also store your valuables at the front desk for free; however it is nice to have your money etc. in the room for easy access). The KBH is within driving distance of the Road to Hana and Mt. Haleakala. Both are well-worth the drive and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be missed. The concierge at KBC recommended that we leave at 6 a.m. for the Road to Hana and we are glad that we took her advice as we were in front of the tour buses which made the ride more enjoyable. We also went up Mt. Haleakala to see the sunrise. The concierge at KBC recommended that we leave no later then 3 a.m. This was the perfect time to leave as we got to the top of the mountain just before the crowds arrived so we got a front row spot to watch the sunrise\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6remember to take jackets/sweaters and wear pants as it is cold (45 degrees in mid August!). We were worried that the drive up 10,000 feet would be difficult; however it is well-marked and easy for a good driver. It is said that the KBH hotel is Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most Hawaiian Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter staying there we believe this claim. The staff are almost entirely of Hawaiian descent and there really is a Hawaiian feel to the hotel. We found the staff to be VERY friendly and helpful and very sincere. The closing ceremony where they present you with leis etc. is heart-warming and the icing on the cake. In closing, if you are used to staying at the Ritz this may not be the place for you to stay; however if you are looking for a clean, safe place to stay at an affordable price I would highly recommend the KBH. If you are planning on spending a lot of your time at the hotel then you might like to pay the higher prices at the Westin, Marriott, or Hyatt for their beautiful grounds, pools with caves etc. ; however if you are a couple that likes to travel you will spend minimal time at your hotel so you will appreciate paying less for a place to sleep and leave your bags. Overall, a great choice that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret.

We went to Waikiki first and then flew onto Maui for some relaxation. When we arrived, we were told by the manager that our ocean front room would not be available until the next day because they had double booked. Obviously we were very disappointed, but we didn't cause a fuss because the manager was very apologetic, friendly and very accomodating. He told us he would be putting us in an ocean view room on the top floor for one night and would then arrange for our things to be moved the next day to an ocean front room. He refunded us the difference between the ocean view and the ocean front and gave us a voucher for a complementary dinner in the Tiki restaurant for all of us. The ocean view room was ample big enough for all of us (2 adults and one 4 year old) and the view was amazing. The next day we moved to our ocean front room. The swimming pool was great, it had a lovely shallow end for our daughter to play in. The beach was also great, but be careful of the waves - while we were there, they were about 8-10 foot high and very powerful. There are signs everywhere saying don't swin in the sea (but everyone did) and there were a number of people walking around with broken shoulders / arms and ankles as they had been caught out by the stength of the sea. Reception even left a message on everyones phone one day warning of high waves and advising not to go in the sea. If you have small children, don't leave them on their own, the tide will quite easily pull them and then knock them flying. Needless to say, our daughter only paddled, we didn't allow her to go in. As I said before, the rooms are big, comfortable and very clean. We had no complaints. The food at the Tiki restaurant was great, and it even had a kids menu. The food at the Tiki Grill was also good, although a lot of fried food. Having said that, the cheese burgers were delicious. We had a great time and basically were a bit lazy in that we mainly spent our days either by the pool or walking along the beach and the nights trying out various restarants. Had we been there for longer, we would probably have hired a car, but we had to take into account our 4 year old, who was already exhausted from all the activities and travelling we did in Waikiki, Oahu.

The hotel was a bit dated but very authentically Hawaiian. Rooms were large with huge windows and a patio. 2. Almost all of the hotel rooms get treated to a great ocean view so that was also a bonus. 3. It was one of those hotels that really gave great bang for the buck. They even gave you cookies every night before bed. Plus you get free nightly entertainment which was pretty nice. 4. Room was clean. 5. We don't have kids but it would be a good place to bring kids to. They had a lot for them to do. 6. There is a fridge in the room so you can buy your own food or alchol. 7. Good location. A lot of hotels and shopping in the area within walking distance. Bad Things: 1. Rude staff. This is the number one reason I would think long and hard about going back there. I'm generally not a complainer and as a person who has worked in the service industry for a while I usually forgive peoples rudeness as we all have busy or bad days. But it was bad enough at this hotel that if I hadn't paid up front I would have left. For example, we tipped the bellman for bringing up our bags. We had just gotten off the plane so we didn't have much small cash with us. I tipped him with a few dollar bills and gave him 4 quarters to try and add on another dollar. When he left he put the coins on our door lock so they fell everywhere when we opened the door again as almost to embarrass us for giving him change. I felt insulted that he did that so rudely as I was only trying to make up an extra dollar for him. The man who checked us in was also rude. When we asked him a question while checking in he replied maybe I could answer you if the damn phone would stop ringing and then answered and assisted several phone inquiries in the middle of helping us which in turn meant it took us about 20 minutes to check us in. 2. There are not enough check in/out staff and we found they were disorganized. 3. After 9:00PM there is nothing to do. Everyone goes to bed. This might be a plus or a minus depending on the type of person you are. 4. This really has nothing to do with the actual hotel but the traffic to get to Ka'anapali Beach can be quite horrible.

The welcome breakfast my husband wanted to skip but I am so glad we did it, the whole staff housekeeping included gets up on stage to sing a hawaiin song/welcome. The place is not fancy like upscale high rise glass and chrome places but has a homey atmosphere. The tiki bar is outside and fun to sit and relax, watch the show, watch the sunset. The Tiki restaurant is outside and we ate there every morning for breakfast the food is great, but not cheap. I think you are paying for eating outside. But we loved it. Plus that area the sidewalk runs along the beach and lots of of other hotels restaurants to eat and explore. We ate a Lelainis the first night at the nice restaurant not bar and grill food was good, $40-range. Again you can eat outside which we loved. The Hula Bar and Grill was ok too we started at the bar and then ate outside when we got a table, the entertainment was a little more \"hip\" than the KBH. Nice change. All in all Maui is great - don't miss the Volcano drive and we ate in Paia at Charleys where Wille Nelson stops in - he is right there breakfast is great!", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel, but not our room June 13 - June 20 2006\u201d", "Author": "disneyfan05", "ReviewID": "UR5374866", "Content": "I had to write a review as soon as I got back to help those who were a little nervous about the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. First off I am not a whiner or a complainer just giving you hints and tips. Okay The KBH is a great resort for those who like a slower pace. The photos of the hotel grounds do not do it justice. I was absolutely amazed at the beauty of the trees and other plants in the middle area of the hotel and everywhere around the hotel. Very comfortable atmosphere. There were literally a hundred different lounge chairs around the grounds. After a day at the beach it was so nice to grab a lounge chair and lay under a tree and relax. The pool is heated. Not a bad size either. But mainly for the little toddlers. Everyone I noticed seemed to be having a wonderful time. This is an older hotel. There are cracks in the sidewalks and such but none of that mattered to us. The feeling in the air was so relaxing and comfortable and made us very glad to be in MAUI. If you are one of the many who need a perfect resort where everything is more brand new, that isn't a problem - stay in the Sheraton next door, Kaanapali Ali, Westin etc. They were very nice and had more of a posh feeling with waterfalls, koi ponds and people who will wait on you hand and foot. You can still come and sit on a lounge chair under a tree at the KBH resort. They are welcoming. No one will even notice if you borrow a chair and relax. Very friendly. Okay here goes some complaining... DO NOT STAY IN THE MOLOKAI WING if you have a problem with your back or do not like a very OLD room. We booked late and could not avoid staying in this wing. We were in room 125 bottom floor with a walk out garden area and patio which was a little blessing. The bad news is the mattresses were so bad and very uncomfortable in our room. Also double beds. They must have been at least 25+ yrs. old. Very bad for those like me with bad backs. Also our dresser/entertainment center had three drawers and all THREE drawers were broken. The furniture was outdated and run down, but we didn't notice that so much. The room was VERY CLEAN though. The maids are so wonderful. Very nice, eager to please. The room had a little smell but I planned ahead thanks to previous reviews and brought two vanilla scented glad plug ins and that did the trick. The smell is not their fault. Maui is more humid. They try very hard to make everything perfect for you. Really they do. Also the bathroom was so funny! there is a little 3 1/2 X 6 1/2 foot area with a sliding door where the toilet is and a shower stall. No way two people could fit in that area at the same time. I forgot to take a picture. Outside of that area is the closet (good size) and long vanity area with sink. The refrigerator worked great and we were able to stuff a lot of water bottles, and tons of food in there. We stuck it out and it did not ruin our trip we did not have a bad stay. Just will make sure to get the Maui or Lanai Wing (but I will get to that in a minute) The good news was that I actually liked our garden area and could hear the ocean from our room, which helped relax us and slept better. We could walk straight out and up the back of the wing to the beach. You did have to see the back of the Sheraton but believe it or not I really didn't mind that. Between the breeze, the palms, the little birds it really wasn't bad. However the garden room patios in the Kauai wing were not as good they were more enclosed, you couldn't walk out and view of an old fence and the Whaler is pretty close on that side. The patio furniture in all of the rooms is old and used. But think about it. They are outside in the elements they won't be brand new. But again we didn't mind. We put our towels (you get them from the Triology place by the beach free and clean each day) on the chairs and didn't mind at all. We were close to the laundry area which was extremely helpful and we didn't have to climb stairs because there isn't an elevator. I did talk to three different people who were in the same wing, in the ocean view or partial view rooms and they said their rooms were outdated but they were very happy with them. So that is good news. And the air conditioner worked with a great ceiling fan. Okay more good news for people who demand to stay in the Maui or Lanai Wings. I saw those rooms VERY nice. Nicer new furniture. Big bathroom with tub and shower. The beds are King or Queen. Soft comfortable beds. Everyone seemed to love their rooms. The Kauai Wing is a heck of a lot better than the Molokai Wing but not as new as the other Maui or Lanai wings but still more recently remodeled. We borrowed the hospitality suite before we left on our last day and we were in the Kauai Wing room #159. The room was 100 times better than the Molokai room. Queen soft comfortable beds. No ceiling fan though and the air conditioner switch didn't work. Older furniture but at least there were SEVEN usable drawers with a little cabinet too. Also tub and shower in a huge bathroom. But try not to stay in that room because there was a lot of mold in the corners, etc. The food at the Terrace room was terribly overpriced for what they served. There are many places down the little path like the Hula Grill and many others that for the same price had a better atmosphere and better food. We didn't like the Mixed Plate either. It is okay if you are just too tired to find another place, but if you just take a short 2 min. drive heading north on Hwy 30 - take the Lower Honoapilani Road to the left and at the first right is the Honokowai Marketplace - go down the strip mall until you find Soup Nutz & Java Jazz toward the end (right acrossed from the Maui Dive Shop). This place is sooo good. Omlettes, pancakes, breakfast burritos, bagels, etc. $10.00 and under. Great for lunch and dinner too. In that same strip mall there is Subway, Gyros, Pizza, Mexican food, etc. Our very favorite place to eat though was the Lahaina Fish Company. They take reservations and you will get an ocean side table. Great food. We ate there twice and between the four of us we tried just about everything and it was excellent. Good kids menu. My most expensive dinner there was $23.00 (for me) and it was worth every bite. We liked the Hard Rock Cafe, especially if you are lucky enough to have Phred as our waiter. Yes that is Fred with a PHred. Very funny guy. Also loved Giovani's right at the front of the Kaanapali Parkway entrance on left. And had a wonderful breakfast right acrossed the street at the Mango Bar and Grill. The Tiki Grill at the hotel in the main area next to the pool was great for little lunch items. The Tiki Bar was packed all of the time. Everyone is so helpful and nice. Yes they did have a sweet little singing time every night and those of you who are picky will make fun. But it grows on you and I loved it by the end of our stay. Also on our last day we found this great Beach Market place at the Westin for those with a more expensive taste. They have Starbucks coffee (not a regular Starbucks) and tons of fruit, yogurt parfaits, etc. I wish we would have found that sooner. There is another Market like that on Lower Honoapilani Road right by Boss Frogs and they are a god send for natural foods, etc. For those of us who love Starbucks you will find one at the Lahaina Cannery Mall and one downtown Lahaina on Papalaua St. next to Foodland and McDonalds. Old Lahaina Market place. I am sure there are others but not at the Kaanapali Resorts. Stop at Costco which is right on your way out of Kahului. On Dairy Road (which turns into 380) on the left side of the road passed the fire department and just to the left of Home Depot is Wal-Mart. It is completely hidden from the road so you can't see it from the road. One more thing... We used Pride Charters to do to Molokini they were all about the money and not really into helping you at all. Would not recommend them. I chose them because they had the biggest boat. Unfortunately I still got sick. I would try Pacific Whale Foundation or for those who love smaller rides there are plenty of others. Ask Boss Frog's they are very helpful. On our trip to Molokini no one on our boat saw very many fish. You are way out in the middle of the channel so not really a reef place for fish. But even though I was sick I enjoyed the boat ride and it was pretty cool swimming around the crater. Then we went to \"Turtle Town\" which is basically anywhere they think there is turtles closer to Wailea. There were about four turtles and some were lucky enough to see them. You are out in a unprotected area so keep an eye on little ones. If you just have to go to Molokini you need to keep an open mind and not be obsessed with seeing fish or turtles, because frankly you might not see any and just enjoy the ride. My husband and 14 yr. old daughter had a great time with Maui Mountain Cruisers with Jim on biking down the crater, etc. Only use that outfit as you are extremely protected the whole time and Jim is a very experienced bike rider. They loved it. I have tons of more information and would love to help anyone with planning. Just email me.

Don't be swayed by all the reviews about how nice the staff are. They are just as freindly at the other hotels as well.

We left KBH to go on to the Big Island where we stayed at the 5 star Hilton and I have to say both my husband and I agree that the KBH was overall a much better place and much better location despite it being smaller and older. At the KBH we felt like we were in Hawaii, where as at the Hilton we felt we were in any resort that could have been in the middle of the desert. The incredibley genuine staff at KBH can't be beat. The rooms in the Kuai defintiely need updating and hate to say it but i saw a roach which totally creeped me out.

This hotel is definitely one of the most family-friendly hotels in all of Maui.

It may not be a luxurious resort catering to the rich and famous, but they have all the amenities the vacationing tourist needs. We arrived very late (10:00pm) the first night after three long airplane rides. As we drove up, the valet walked to the rental car and opened the door. He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello, we have been waiting for you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if he said that to everyone, or even if he knew who we were, but it made us feel welcome. He also said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Go check in and go to your room, we will take care of your bags and the car.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wow! That was just what we needed as we were exhausted from traveling all day. The room was clean and spacious, with a small lanai. It overlooked the ocean and the hotel grounds. When we checked in, we were given an envelope that contained breakfast vouchers for every day of our stay at their Mixed Plate Restaurant. We were also invited to attend a Welcome Breakfast Buffet, which we did go to. This welcome breakfast featured live entertainment, along with a monologue given by one of most humorous hotel employees. This employee gave very amusing travel tips on what attractions to see (and what not to see) while in Maui. As we have small children, each child was issued a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Passport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the hotel. The purpose of this passport was to have the child visit an area in the hotel and/or participate in one of the many free activities to get their passport stamped. As each area in the book was stamped, the children received a gift from the hotel such as a keychain, a back pack, a t-shirt, free French fries, a flower lei, etc. The pool at the hotel was not very large, but it was clean and unique. It was in the shape of a giant whale. The tail of the whale was the shallow end for the Keiki to play in. The grounds were large, grassy and had many fragrant plumeria trees to provide shade in the hot sun. There were an abundance of lawn chairs and one did not have to stake out a chair in the early hours of the morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were plenty to go around. The lawn featured a giant checkers game board with painted coconuts as markers. The walk to the beach was short, as was the walk from the room to the pool. This hotel had a small outdoor bar called the Tiki Bar. It served reasonably priced drinks. There was also an outdoor grill for ordering lunch and snacks. The prices and quality of food were good. Some of the menu items were cheeseburgers, onion rings, French fries, and the like. The hotel offers a free hula show each evening outdoors by the Tiki bar.

On the negative side, the room (we had a family suite which had a main/living room plus a small, separate bedroom) was definitely dated, and the small bathroom looked like something you would expect to find at a Super 8 Motel. Several other reviewers had mentioned this, but some pointed out that part of the hotel has been updated, so apparently this is not a universal problem there. All in all, I felt that what we received for $425 a night, including breakfast, was a good deal since we don't require a ritzy hotel, and having the suite was mandatory for the 5 of us- getting a suite elsewhere, or 2 rooms, would have been far more expensive.

Of all the hotels on Kaanapli Beach (and we saw them all while walking along the beach), the Kaanalpi Beach Hotel is the over-all best value. The area: Kaanapali Beach is a beauitful stretch of sandy beach lined by resorts/hotels. It's definitely a resort area. In the center is a little shopping area called Whaler's village with everything from super high-end stores to little tourist shops. At one end of the beach is Black Rock, which is great for snorkeling. The hotel: Kaanapli Beach hotel is one or two hotels down from Whaler's village, and a very short walk from Black Rock. It's not a high-rise. In fact, unlike all of the other large hotels, you can hardly see it from the water---instead you see all of the lush gardens. It is right on the beach, and even though there are fewer rooms than some of the other hotels, it has one of the larger plots of land, a lot of which is taken up by the huge courtyard/pool/garden area. The pool is kind of small, a little cold, and nothing super fancy but very clean and nice. There is a great Tiki Bar in the courtyard with the best Mai Tai's I had in Maui, and they have a super-cute nightly hula show and live music. The whole hotel is just very laid-back. It's advertised as the most Hawaiian Hotel, which I thought was a little silly at first, but by the end of the week I totally agreed. Every single staff person I encountered was friendly and helpful. The rooms: The Maui and Lanai wings are updated so the rooms seem more modern and a lot nicer. Also, I highly recomend getting a first floor room in one of these wings (that's what we had) because they are bigger than the regular rooms. There is a little sitting area you step down into (this is the deck in the rooms above) and then you walk out onto a patio that is still bigger than the decks! So it's like getting 30% more space. The bathroom is basic but nice in these updated rooms, and you get the additional space of the seperate toilet/shower and vanity (unlike the older rooms). None of these are \"ocean front\" but even from our \"partial ocean view\" room, we could see and hear the ocean. The extras: You get welcome gifts upon arrival (a box of chocolates) and turn-down service every night (cookies and an orchid on your pillow)! There were also gifts and cards delivered before we left. It's really cute because they are the sort of extras I didn't expect at a less-expensive hotel. There is a hut on the beach where you can arrange lots of activities (although we didn't use it for this so I can say much about that) and you get free towels for the beach and pool---very convenient and again, something I didn't expect for the price. Hint: If you do a package with breakfast, you get coupons to use in the \"Mixed Plate\" resturant. It's not open air or ocean front, and the food isn't great---although the fruit is. Anyway, we found out on our last day, that you can use those coupons ($11.75 value) towards breakfast in the hotel terrace resturant, which is open-air in the courtyard and the food is MUCH better. That definitely makes the breakfasts more worthwhile. This hotel was a great value (it's not a luxury hotel but the price really is remarkable for the location and what you get), and made for a wonderful temporary home in Maui.

This was our third trip to Ka'anapali in the last three years, having previously stayed at the Westin and then at the Whaler. We booked the KBH and our flights together through Travelocity (and as explained below, I'll NEVER use Travelocity again). Let me say that my husband and I did not expect a 5 star experience at KBH, and we're very low maintenance--as long as a place is clean, has a good location, and we don't have any \"logistical\" issues, we'll be happy. We're not into over-the-top, elitist service, and I don't think I've ever complained about a hotel room (other than when I've received a smoking room). I had reserved a king, non-smoking, partial ocean view room. Travelocity called KBH directly to make these arrangements for this wedding anniversary trip for me. The Travelocity rep even told me we would probably receive a room upgrade at the time of check-in. KBH knew it was our anniversary because we received a split of champagne and a note. We arrived Thanksgiving day around 4:00 and were not greeted with a whole lot of aloha, despite reports to the contrary from others. We were then told that the only room available was a first floor room with two double beds--not at all what we reserved. I asked if anything with a king--or even queen--was available, and was told no (after the gentleman scanned all reservations and determined he would not break up groups traveling together in order to find us the type of room we reserved). We then asked if we could be moved when one opened up, and he told us he could move us on 11/26 and then would have to move us again on 11/28---so we would have to change rooms every two nights. Not being happy with this, I called Travelocity--you know, the company who advertises that all you have to do is call them and they'll make it \"right\" (see, e.g., its ads in USA Today, in which it uses \"right\" in every sentence). After 1 hour, 9 minutes, and 21 seconds of talking to a series of 3 Travelocity reps who told me it would cost Travelocity too much money to resolve the problem, and who seemed bothered to have to even speak to me, I ended the call (with a very elevated blood pressure). The rep called me back during what was to be a relaxing dinner on the beach to tell me that I could be moved every two days--exactly the pathetic solution that the front desk had offered me hours earlier. Travelocity may have good rates, but don't go with them--I got a very strong impression that those rates are based upon receiving the bargain basement, leftover rooms--which probably also explained why KBH had no interest in helping us out. Travelocity was no help, and certainly didn't make it \"right.\" Its money would be better spent improving customer service than on \"clever\" advertising ploys. Our room, room 124, was dark, the bathroom was ridiculously small--you nearly had to stand on the toilet to get the shower door open (a bit scary, with some mildew, etc., throughout), the carpet was dirty, the ceiling tiles were stained, and although I've stayed in many oceanfront hotels and condos all over the country, this was truly a laughable \"partial ocean view\"--if you pressed your face up against the glass sliding door, you could sort of make out a sliver of ocean . . . . The room was in serious need of an upgrade. In any event, I decided we would just take our chances with the offered room moves, and get on with enjoying our vacation. The next morning, 11/25, we went to breakfast at the Mixed Plate (decent, but not great, and it's the same food every day, which gets old). When we got back to our room, our key card didn't work. My husband went to the front desk, and they reactivated it. He walked back to the room, tried it again, and it still didn't work. He walked back to the front desk, where he was given a new key. He walked back, tried the new key, and it didn't work. We went back to the front desk and explained it again, and they said security would be called. We walked back to the room and security arrived a few minutes later with the \"master\" key. He informed us that housekeeping had called about the door the prior day and reported that it didn't work---but apparently they decided to place us in the room despite the key entry system not working properly!! He also tried to explain that this was a new key system, and that they were having some problems. He said they would have to call an engineer, and that they would have to enter our room to examine the door. I told him that was fine, that we were leaving to run some errands (this was early--about 8 AM) and if it could be fixed by the time we came back, that would be great. We drove down to Lahaina and picked up some things at Safeway, Long's, etc., and returned. We lugged our purchases up to our room, only to find that our key still didn't work! We went to the front desk, they called security, and he told us that they hadn't been able to enter our room because the \"kapu\" (i.e., do not disturb sign) was on our door. I reminded him of our conversation, but he said that's their rule--they don't enter rooms when the sign is displayed. So he called the engineer and he and the engineer were in our room for about 30 minutes fixing the door (which was not exactly conducive to changing for the beach, etc.). They finally fixed the door. During this whole key fiasco, a gentleman at the front desk told my husband that we were moving to a new room that day, 11/25--which was contrary to what we had been told, 11/26. I went up and asked a woman, who told me that my husband was clearly mistaken, it was 11/26. When I told her that a man had told my husband that, she said it was the manager, and he was simply mistaken when he told my husband that--she said she had heard the manager say that and wondered why. I asked to speak to the manager; she went into the back room, and without any introduction, apology, etc., the man/manager came out and bluntly said \"It's not today, it's tomorrow.\" I was a little taken back by his lack of, well, tact and customer service, and explained that we had not exactly had a great experience since we'd arrived. He just sort of looked at me, told me we would be moved on 11/26, and would not have to move again (also contrary to what we had previously been told), and as I walked away he sort of mumbled \"sorry.\" We did move on 11/26, to room 214. The room was just as shabby, but being on the second floor was a nice change, and we were slightly closer to the ocean . . . so if we walked out onto the balcony and leaned forward around the floor-to-ceiling privacy fence, we could see the water (!). The rest of our stay was fairly uneventful, but a few more items pretty much sum up our experience: *We received some sort of broadcast voice message from the hotel staff nearly every morning--warning about dangerous ocean currents, etc. One morning there was a message notifying us that they would be entering rooms that day to spray for insects, and to call if we didn't want them to do so in our room. I called and asked that they not spray in our room, and the woman seemed quite put off. I know that properties have to keep up with this type of maintenance, especially in tropical climates, but it should be their responsibility to do so during room turnover--not on my time with my personal belongings and toiletry items in the room. *On our last full day there, we had (just like every other day) left the do not disturb sign on the door. When we returned from our activities for the day, we were surprised to find the sign removed, our bed made, and a note on our bed. Apparently, despite their \"rule\" about not entering rooms with the privacy sign displayed, they saw fit to enter the room and ensure that we knew the name of our housekeeper (presumably so we'd know who to tip). Unbelievable--guess the rule re: not entering rooms is only followed when convenient for them. *On the one rainy morning we had, we stopped by the concierge desk on our way out to see if they could provide any weather info. I know they had probably been asked a million times, but that is their job . . . The man at the desk sort of looked at us and then said \"It's gonna be like this all day, honeybuns\" and then went about another task. I'm really very laid back and not at all conservative, but #1--honeybuns?? And #2, he didn't even make an attempt to give us weather info---it cleared up mid afternoon and was beautiful the remainder of the day. Not too interested in helping us with the weather, obviously (but they seemed very willing to help folks who wanted to arrange for paid tours, etc.). As others have said, the KBH has a great location. It is cheaper than surrounding properties (Sheraton, Whaler, Westin, Hyatt), but for the money, you are far better off staying somewhere else. I did like the live music, etc. every evening, but you don't have to be a guest to wander in and enjoy it--so stay elsewhere and stop by for entertainment if you like. KBH does take what appears to be a genuine interest in the Hawaiian culture and educating others about it--which I greatly commend--but perhaps it's time for its owners to start putting some money back into the property so that it doesn't fall into total disrepair and disfavor. The current state of the property is a shame. I know I will return to Maui--and probably Ka'anapali many times; but unless I see substantial improvement, I will not again stay at KBH (particularly not at the current prices). By the way, I know we're not the only ones who had a bad experience at KBH last week--I'd love to hear from some of the large group of University of Wisconsin football fans who were staying in our building and were none too happy about their shabby rooms and their \"garden\" view (i.e., staring at a fence) rooms.", "Date": "December 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel was Charming\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4159125", "Content": "I am 20 years old and stayed in this hotel with my mom and brother (16) over the week of Thanksgiving.

Yes, there is a shorebreak and a bit of an undertow. Our kids are excellent swimmers, so if yours aren't it could be an issue. The beach was huge and never crowded. Yes, everything is expensive, but that's Hawaii. It is possible to spend less if you try eating at fast food places and buy breakfast stuff for the room. The road to Hana was great, but we did get tons of misquito bites( our fault for not wearing repellant).

I have read some reviews about rooms that needed to be remodeled. The room I was in was clean and was probably remolded recently. No bugs and the bathroom was a very good size (seems to be a theme on these review boards). The Tiki Restaurant is a little over priced but there is the Tiki grill in the courtyard a few feet away that is located next to the outdoor bar. Both are located next to the pool. The beach is very nice and wasn't crowded at all. Very small waves. Whalers Village is located 2-3 hotel\\condominimums down. The Rusty Harpoon is nice and outdoors along with two other outdoor restaurants. The village has some nice shops along with some touristy shops and an ABC store in the back section (away from the beach). There are nicer hotels in the area with the Hyatt being the best in my opinion. As far as activities is concerned I drive the Road to Hana. It was nice but overated and a little dangerous. Get going early say by 7 am to avoid the traffic. I made it to the Charles Lindbergh's gravesite. As long as you are able to you must do the Haleakala bike ride from the summit to the ocean by decling 10,000 ft in 38 miles. It is awesome.

Having stayed at several other resorts, this gave us a good barometer for what to expect. Basically for the price and location you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat this place! First off, the location does not get any better for Kaanapali beach. This hotel really shares the nicest portion of the Kaanapali Beach with the neighboring Sheraton. The swimming and snorkeling is simply awesome. We booked a sunset catamaran cocktail cruise that picked us up (with others) one block away right on the beach. Plus there is a beachside path that runs along Kaanapali beach so you can walk and see all the resorts and restaurants without having to drive. The landscaping of KBH is really gorgeous as well. Sure it is not as grand (or stale) as some of the Ritzier resorts, but it has character and a genuine Hawaiian feel that many of them lack. The KBH really has a more inviting feel than many of the mega-resorts that dot the beach. The poolside Tiki-bar (cheap food) was also great with very friendly waitresses who were responsive and kept the drinks coming. The breakfast buffets could not be beaten for coming with the room charge. My wife and I were suckered into $25 breakfast buffets at other resorts that were of the same if not worse quality. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about you, but spending $50 on breakfast is a rip, vacation or not. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest getting the buffet with your room. One of our favorite memories of the KBH was the nightly outdoor music entertainment with Rudy. What a great show his band and dancers put on each night. Plus we did not meet a nicer or more genuine person on the island than him. The KBH is labeled as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most Hawaiian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resort and it really lives up to that billing with free nightly performers as these. We were also lucky enough to be there for the national junior hula competition. During the open-mike portion of Rudy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show, numerous Hawaiians who had come from all over and were staying at the KBH for the competitions performed various music and native dance that was simply beautiful to watch and hear. My wife and I were truly lucky to see all of this free of charge. Other reviewers who left less than flattering reviews of the band must be the most cynical of the bunch not to appreciate these talented and warm performers. The only minor let-down was the room view. We had booked an Ocean view that could have been better. However, it did not smell and was very clean. Next time we will either splurge for the ocean-front or just get a partial view. But we were hardly even in our room except to change, shower and sleep. Obviously we spent more time in our room when we stayed at Ritzier Resorts, but I felt wrong sitting in a resort room with so much to see and do around me. Upon our departure there was a ceremony for leaving guests that my wife really enjoyed. The staff are super friendly and embraces the Hawaiian culture with all their guests. If you are looking for an over-expensive ritzy 5-star resort with tiny beaches, go hit Wailea.

They are genuine, informative, pleasant, and among the nicest hotel staff I have ever encountered, from the manager to the maid. The cookies (YUM) and turn-down service was a great touch. They had champagne for us, as it was a trip for our one-year anniversary. The location. Best beach of ALL the hotels, including the ritzy ones. Huge stretches of sand (the beach by the Hyatt was non-existant), not as crowded as neighboring Sheraton, and a stones throw from Black Rock. Close to good restaurants and shopping, but not in the noisy zone. The grounds. While it doesn't have a jazzy pool, waterfalls, or a water slide, it does have tons of grassy space to stretch out in and sun yourself, sit in the shade or catch a breeze. IMO, this is a welcome relief to the sardine packed pool areas of the other hotels. The bad: Our room looked like something out of The Brady Bunch Hawaii episode. Old, outdated, musty, horrible lighting, poor air-conditioning, and subpar bathroom fixtures. It was clean though. The hallway reminded me of my college dormatory. It was bearable, but I consider my self to have a pretty high tolerance for things. After all, it's Maui, right? We had three bugs in our room while we were there. One was a roach. And last and certainly least, we had an unfortunate plumbing incident that culminated on our last day there. It affected all the -82 rooms (1-6), and it had to do with the age of the hotel.

We were there for almost 3 weeks in July and Aug. This was one of our least favorite hotels - we stayed in 6 others of comparable price. We noticed that they tried to put everyone in the absolutely awful wing facing the Whaler condos. It's the only wing in the building with rooms that don't face the interior and the ocean. It was so gross, I didn't even shower in there. After 4 trips to the front desk and a call to my travel agent, we were finally moved to a room that cost the same. It was in the Maui/Lana'i wing. It was a ton better - updated in the last 10 years. The other one hasn't been touched in what looked like 30 years. The lobby of this place is down right dreary - low ceilings, dark walls, dirty. This was the only place that made us pay for lounge chairs on the beach - $10 a day! I'm not taking about the fancy, umbrella cabanas. I'm talking about the plain old plastic lounge chairs. $6 a day to park. $1.50 a day to use the safe. $5.00 for a children's hot dog at the grill - and that doesn't even include chips or a drink. No way should this be advertised as a family resort. Yes, the beach is beautiful. If you like to snorkel it's right next door the the Sheraton's Black Rock, which is great. But I snorkeled all over the island and found tons of other wonderful spots. The slope of the land on the Ka'anapali coast is really steep. Which means when the waves come onto shore they give a beautiful splash, but that splash soon turns into a strong undertoe. Children could really only use about 10 feet of shore before the 2 foot slope. The bays just 10 minutes north of Ka'anapali are much more children friendly - and they had great snorkeling up there too. Once it got dark this place shut down. They only lit a couple of torches around the bar and left the rest of the resort dark. Other resorts are all lit up, people are gathering around, and the very warm pools still have people swimming in them. This resort only had the bar area. When we were booking our trip we couldn't get accomodations here for all 6 nights and were disappointed that we had to start our trip for the first 2 nights up the road and the Aston Ka'anapali Shores, which cost about the same.

I put a lot of research into hotels for this trip, including the wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. We were looking for a mid-range hotel on Maui that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like your average mega-resort. After much contemplation, we decided on this hotel based on the majority of good reviews it received. The hotel however, did not meet our expectations. The bulk of our problems came in the first two days, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll touch upon in a second. Check-in went smoothly and the room was ready a half hour before check-in time which is always nice. We received the requested king bed and partial ocean view, we did not receive a non-smoking room like we requested though. Because of this, the first few days the room had a stale smoke odor that eventually lessened after the lanai doors were left open. The bellman who took our luggage was very friendly, however we had to ask for assistance when we pulled up as he was chatting with a couple other workers. He did apologize for not noticing us though. He also walked us through our room and explained some of the services which was helpful. The room itself felt very dated, and we were in the Lana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i wing which was supposedly updated compared to the Molokai and Kauai wings. If it was updated, I was hard pressed to see where it had been. Everything felt old and generally dirty, this may have come from the smoke smell though. The bed was a little below average and we found it to be uncomfortable. Being a honeymoon couple we received a free bottle of champagne in our room. I had called ahead and requested this be replaced with a bottle of sparkling grape juice or some other beverage as my wife does not drink alcohol. I was told this wasn't a problem and it would be taken care of. Needless to say, there was champagne in the room instead of another beverage. The first unpleasant experience was after my wife took a shower that night. She had wrapped one of the towels around her and then noticed a large brown stain across the towel. Given the size, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how housekeeping could have missed it. Needless to say, the rest of the stay we looked over every towel before use. The first morning there is what really ruined the feel of the hotel for us. I went to use the shower around 7am and the handle snapped off in my hand. We called maintenance and explained the problem and they said they would send someone right up. A half hour later a man showed up, acceptable turn around time in my book. He worked on it for about 10 minutes before saying he would have to order a part and it could take up to a couple days. He said he would check with his manager to see about having use moved to another room which was also acceptable. A half hour later, we have heard nothing. At this point we wanted to be out of the hotel shortly to start our day, after all we are in Maui. We call the front desk and they say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll look into it and get back to us. Another half hour goes by before they call. Their response at this point is we can use a hospitality room to shower until it gets fixed, even if it takes 3 days. This is completely unacceptable to us. They want us to stay in a room with no shower for who knows how long. We say this is unacceptable and we would like to be moved but are told there are no rooms available. I continue to try to find alternatives with the lady and at this point she is getting very snippy and short with me. Had I been that way towards her I could understand but at no point up to then had I been. At this point we called our travel agent to see about other accommodations. Our travel agent called the hotel and amazingly after that happened, a worker showed up with the correct part and fixed it. Wasted time, 3 hours. While this is an unplanned problem, the responses and attitude we received were completely unacceptable. Telling guest that there is nothing they can do does not meet the standards of this quality of hotel. We were going to be paying for a room without a shower and would have had to reserve a hospitality room and use a shower when it became available. If they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a part, they could have easily sent a worker to a hardware store and purchased a replacement fixture. It was an easy fix if they had just put the effort into it. This problem is not one future travelers are likely to experience, but I shared it because it speaks volumes about their customer service. Our stay did improve the rest of the week though. The grounds of the hotel are beautifully manicured. I could spend hours laying in a lawn chair. They have plenty available so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a need to rush and get one in the morning. The pool is small but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking for a large pool it is plenty. The location on the beach is superb with fast access to snorkeling at black rock and shopping and dining at Whalers Village, both a short walk. The area is very touristy so if you are looking for something more laid back, avoid Kaanapali beach in general. The lobby itself seems cramped and I was a bit disappointed regarding the open air feeling it was supposed to have. We stayed at two other hotels on our trip that had open air lobbies and this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even compare to them. The activities desk was helpful when it came to our questions and there is a small general store for snacks, drinks, etc. We received a free breakfast buffet for every day of our stay at the Kaanapali Mixed Plate. Even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free, save your time and go elsewhere. Definitely do NOT pay for food there. The best I can compare it to is a college dining hall. The food was awful and the seating areas dirty. The Tiki Grill was your average hamburger and hot dog stand. I felt the food was good for the price (try the onion rings, excellent and great value!) Service was slow though, they could use a third person for the volume they do. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like leaving the hotel to eat this is a good lunch option. Never ate at the Tiki Terrace so I cannot comment. The nightly hula show is entertaining the first time, but it is generally the same show every night so there is no need to return. If you are celebrating a honeymoon, anniversary or birthday, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t volunteer that information if you are shy. The bar makes a great mai-tai so be sure to get one. There is a complimentary turndown service every night and they leave a flower and macadamia nut cookies on your bed. Very nice touch, although they missed a couple nights of our stay so it is a spotty service. Temperature control was good in our room. The lanai is large but had cheap and dirty furniture. The doors to the lanai create a large opening which is nice. There is a room safe and they charge you $1.50 per day to use it. Our last day there, we discovered that you can leave valuables in a safe deposit box at the front desk for free. We were never informed of this upon check-in though and we would have utilized this as there was only two times we needed to lock up valuables. Parking is $6 per day and we never had trouble finding a spot. If you are staying in the Lana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i, Maui or Molokai wings don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your money on valet parking as you end up with a shorter walk to your room if you just park yourself. Another minor annoyance is they were working on expanding the sidewalks during our stay so the construction was a little loud. I understand they need to do these things, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why they do it during high season. They called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153emergency sidewalk repair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but it was nothing but sidewalk expansion. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t label it something it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not, the guests aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fooled. There is a Trilogy building on the grounds where you can book tours which I saw many people take advantage of. They also rent snorkel gear but you can get a much better price at one of the dive shops in Whalers village or Lahaina. This is also where you get towels for the beach, free to all guests. There is also a departure ceremony that was a little cheesy and some of the staff seemed disinterested, but the nut lei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you receive are wonderful, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave without one. Overall, we ended up having a pleasant stay at this hotel. The annoyances of the first couple days and the complete lack of customer service was a major sticking point though. If it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for those issues, I would rate this hotel as 4 stars (for its class), but I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel I can give it more then 3 stars based on our problems. If you are looking for a decent priced hotel on Kaanapali beach then this may be a good option for you. I believe the people who leave glowing reviews about this hotel, as the service seemed spotty to me and they probably received the good service that I saw. Others may receive the poor service though as I felt we did. This is also not a Hyatt or Westin so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reserve it if that is what you are looking for.

Let me also preface this by saying that I am certainly not a pre-Madonna or an overly pampered traveler. I am 26 years old, and I have stayed in virtually all classes of hotels in my life, from 1-2 star Microtel, Motel 6, Days Inns and Best Westerns to Westin, Omni and Marriott resorts. We arrived at the KBH and checked in only to find out that they had oversold the hotel and we did not have a room. However, they did send us to the Hyatt Regency on Kaanapali for the first night While this was an nconvenience, we looked at the positive of getting to spend one night a the nicest hotel on Kaanapali (the Hyatt was amazing, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another story). I was assured that our room at the KBH would be ready for us when we returned the next day at noon. It was not. Once we actually received access to the room, we found it to be dated (I was expecting this) and slightly musty. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garden view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room actually was a view of the Whaler hotel next door rather than what we were expecting and had been advertised, a view of the nice garden and courtyard of the KBH. The rest of our stay was relatively uneventful until the day of checkout. Even though checkout is listed as 11am, we received a knock on the door from housekeeping at 8:15am that morning. As someone who has worked in customer service previously, I wonder what kind of message that is sending to your guests that you want them out of the room ASAP on the morning of checkout. In addition, when we made the initial reservation, we were told that they would have a courtesy room available for our use since our flight did not depart until 10pm. However, when we checked in, we found out we were only allowed 30 minutes. This, coupled with the fact that the room was located at the absolute furthest point from the hotel lobby (meaning a 5 minute walk each way) meant we only had about 20 minutes for two persons to shower and change. When we finally arrived at the courtesy room, we found the bathtub full of water and only one clean towel to be found. As I mentioned earlier, there were positive aspects to the hotel. The location on Kaanapali is excellent. There courtyard is pleasant and the pool (while very small) doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel at all crowded.

Many of the staff are native Hawaiian and an effort is made to honor Hawaiian traditions. Our room overlooked a large park-like garden with a smallish traditional swimming pool (no fake waterfalls, no concrete lazy river, no swim-up bar...this hotel is into real trees and flowers, if you want plastic and concrete, keep looking elsewhere). Our non-smoking room was slightly musty, but clean and in good repair (no cigarette burns or cracked fixtures). The public areas were exceptionally clean particularly considering this is a beachfront property. My wife visited the shopping area of a nearby high-end hotel and observed that the floors were full of sand tracked in from the beach. . We attended an optional first-day orientation where a wide variety of activities were offered from helicopter tours (air), to sailboat cruises (sea) and van excursions (land). (We had made reservations before leaving home.) The breakfast bar was casual but very good. A variety of traditional breakfast foods was offered. I enjoyed the bread pudding too much. The evening entertainment was modest but personal and of good quality (if you are looking for a Vegas production this is not Vegas...go to Vegas and don't bother me). . The clientele was a mix of honeymooners, families with small children, and 50-somethings, many on their first escape since the kids left home. The beach is large and has natural sand with a beautiful view of neighboring islands. This is the dry side of Maui, the clouds backed up against the volcanic mountains and dropped their moisture on the up-wind side of the island. The sun is intense...did I say the sun is intense? The sun is intense. . This property is quiet, laid-back, and respectful (we wanted it that way, I hope it stays that way). While not necessarily a place for active teens, there is a \"hopping\" shopping and dining center a short walk down a cement sidewalk that runs along the beach. (The small town of Lahaina is a couple miles to the south. There is a shuttle bus that runs among the hotels and Lahaina. The main street of Lahaina is a three-quarter-mile long mix of tour/fishing boats, bars/restaurants, and shops where offerings range from tacky dashboard bobble heads to elegant art and Coach purses.) . Our best activity was the Trilogy sailboat cruise to Lanai, which, from the morning cinnamon rolls to the evening return under sail, was everything as advertised. The crew was young, clean and freshfaced. The only negatives were a broken toilet, snorkeling at the beach not from the boat (no lockers for valuables), and bored/unruly small children on the way back. (Hawaii is not Disney World-bored teens and unsupervised/unruly children were a constant irritation.) (Our required pilgrimage, van excursion, to Hana was disappointing. The waterfalls were pitiful. We ate lunch at a poorly maintained state park in a cloud of flies, the name of which park in Hawaiian means the rolling pig slough...we were supposed to eat at Hana where there is a pleasant beach with an open pavilion and, to the far left, a small cluster of tables near an attractive rock formation...if the brochure says eat at the Hana beach, then eat at the Hana beach, do not eat at the rolling pig slough unless you want the experience of a rolling pig eating in a swarm of flies.) . Our best dining experience was in Lahaina at Kimo's. (Mama's Fish House was OK but overpriced.) (At Kimo's sister location we had an unpleasant experience where a mystery charge was added to each of our bills.) (The Old Lahaina Luau was good, except for the dessert, which looked like a tray from the Cosco bakery...I suppose there's nothing wrong with Cosco, it's just not what we expected). . Undiscovered activity where we needed more time: On our last day we visited Iao Park while killing time waiting for our airplane. We were cautioned about leaving our car and luggage unattended so we were unable to venture down the paths to explore the park. On the road to the park, there is a beautiful oriental garden by a pleasant stream. We were also unable to explore the north shore of the West volcano. . We hope to return to Hawaii in a few years and plan to stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel once again. I hope that no hotel chain will buy the property and that no fake waterfalls will profane the natural grounds.", "Date": "July 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3623452", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in May and had two adjoining rooms, directly ocean front.

This was our first time to Maui and we were so happy with the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. Upon check-in, we were a bit disappointed that they had overbooked the oceanfront rooms (which we had booked on Expedia.) The guy checking in next to us was in the same boat. They offered us an ocean view room and a credit, so we took it. We were in room 554 in the Lanai wing and had a great view of the ocean and Black Rock. The grounds are well maintained and there's plenty of lawn chairs available. The pool is a little small, but we are beach hounds so it didn't matter to us. We spent alot of time at the Tiki Bar and the Mai Tai's are great, good happy hour from 3 to 6pm everyday. The hotel has the second best location on Kaanapali Beach (Sheraton is best.) The beach in front of the hotel is smooth and clean. There is a very short walk up to Black Rock where there is excellent snorkeling. Warning, it gets extremely crowded during the day, so I recommend early morning. We saw turtles everytime we snorkeled. You'll see more turtles if you snorkel around the point. You can rent gear at Maui Dive Shop in Whaler's Village for reasonable prices. You can rent cabana's on the beach in front of KBH. Kind of pricey, we only did this once. 4 hours for $21 and all day for $30. We walked the path from Sheraton down to Hyatt several mornings. It's about a mile one way. The beach deteriorates the further south you go. The hotels get fancier and have elaborate pools to make up for the rocky beach (its worst in front of Hyatt.) KBH is about a 3 minute walk to Whaler's Village. Good restaurants there, Rusty Harpoon, Hula Grill and Leilani's. Also some fast food if you want to grab something quick. Recommend the Kapalua Kai for a snorkel sail which you can board in front of Whaler's Village. This catamaran usually goes up to Honolua Bay which has great snorkeling, however, the day we were supposed to go, the bay was closed due to sharks. The alternate site was pretty good (and Honolua Bay has since re-opened). Recommend sea-bands for anyone prone to motion sickness though! We also did a snorkel sail on the Paragon to Lanai. Highly recommend this trip. This boat goes out of Lahaina harbor and is about a 7 hour trip. The boat goes to Manele Bay which is amazing! We saw lots of dolphins on this trip. Great crew as well. Watch out if you are on the nets on the way back though. Captain Ted soaked us good a couple of times! For luau's, we only did one (Old Lahaina Luau.) This is a very classy act. The food was terrific, all the drinks you want. Setting was beautiful and performance was very authentic. Also a must see is Warren and Annabelle's magic show in Lahaina. Can't say too much about this without giving secrets away... You'll just have to see it for yourself. We did not have a rental car and in hindsight, we would probably get one. There is a shuttle bus that runs every hour that you can catch in front of the hotel. Cost's a $1 each way. Only drawback is that it doesn't stay out very late. Last pickup in Lahaina is 9:30 at the wharf. Cab ride into Lahaina is about $12. Overall, a great trip and stay at the KBH. We would definitely go back.

We had a 180 degree view of the beach and watched the sunset from our balcony. The bathroom was huge and the room was well kept. A big kudos to the housekeeping staff!! Our room was always immaculate no matter how much sand we seemed to track in. We had a few lei's laying around the room from luau's and our wedding. We came back in the room after going to the beach and while cleaning the room they put our leis on the lamps and headboard, and my wife's bouquet standing in a champagne glass to decorate. Every night we had two orchids on our pillows and two mac nut cookies along with our bed being turned down. Little touch but it touched us that they took the time to do it. The staff was friendly and courteous the entire time there. Apparently the maids notified the staff that it looked like we got married, because when we called in a wakeup call the day after they congradulated us and everything from then on was addressed to my last name or my last then ohana (family). The only real negative to the stay was were supposed to be booked for a nonsmoking room but due to the late flight all they had left was smoking. We were obviously mad but I will say we would have never known it was smoking had they not told us. The room had no smell or discolored wallpaper and as I said we would have never known. The parking was $6.00 a day for self park and the room safe was $1.50 a day plus tax. Local calls are .75 cents a piece, so bring your cell. Although they don't mention it in on their website, they do explain these charges before hand. This all said it is a GREAT hotel to stay at and we plan to go back. It is an older hotel but they are working on it. Every day early we saw groundskeepers picking up leaves on the lawn that had fallen overnight. Thats dedication.

PROS + Great service from hotel staff + Room had GREAT view, was VERY clean and NO BUGS (Room 584 - Kauai Wing - Ocean Front) + FANTASTIC Beach Location + 1-2 Minute Walk to Whaler's Village CONS - Parking was a little tight for a mid-size car - Sunday Champagne Brunch ($30 a piece is just too much!) - Bathrooms could use some renovating We arrived at the KBH and walked through the lobby pleasantly surprised. The lobby was clean and well decorated with items that gave the place a very Hawaiian feel. I made sure to look very carefully at the walls behind the front desk for the paint peeling off the walls that others have seen, but did not see anything of the sort. We were given room 584 in the Kauai Wing (we had ocean front rooms) that was non-smoking, but had 2 double beds. We had asked for a king size bed, but that ended up being fine with us since my wife and I are both on the slim side. Our room was great. It was very clean and had a great view of the beach and ocean. I looked all over the place for the bugs and roaches that others have seen, but did not see a single one. Because our room was a corner room, we also had a view of the courtyard from a smaller, second window that was in the room. The last item I wanted to comment on were the breakfasts. The Sunday Champagne Brunch can be skipped, unless you like eating seafood for breakfast. There was TONS of food there and they let the champagne flow freely, but at $30 each it was bit pricey for us.

She called the airlines and set us all up with a roundtrip flight and rental car on the main island. She even tried a few different airlines to get the best price. We were hoping for a better pool area, but in the end it was adequate. The tikibar (and snack bar) were a wonderful treat while relaxing poolside. The location was wonderful as well. Walking distance to almost everything. I saw a kids club that looked wonderful for a family trip in a few years.

We got a great rate which included free breakfast and a compact rental car ($225 per day), which was a cheaper rate than the original booking price ($235). If you can, avoid the Kauai wing unless you are facing the courtyard and don't really mind not having an updated room. We got a room facing another condo community along with their junk pile (this view is not on their website!). If I really wanted to go back down and complain, I probably could have and even been upgraded. My husband didn't think it was worth it. The only other complaint I have with this hotel is when I booked our room online, it asked if this was for a special occasion, e.g. honeymoon, anniversary, etc. and they would upgrade the room (if available) with a bottle of champagne. We were celebrating our anniversay. We got to the room and noticed it couldn't have been one of the nicest rooms...very outdated with age really showing...and no champagne. Well, we don't really drink, so the champagne not being there wasn't a big deal. We also \"assumed\" they were booked full. Again, my husband didn't think it was so important to go all the way down to get upgraded. We didn't spend a great deal of time on the property anyway, we were out exploring Hawaii. For this reason, I wasn't as upset about being put into a room with a horrible view and one that had not yet been updated. The only reason I mention it is for others to make sure you speak up. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. If we get back to Maui, I'm sure we would look into this hotel again, but definitely speak up about a good room...not the Kauai wing! I think the Molokai wing looked even more outdated from the outside than the Kauai wing, so beware. We thought the lei ceremony was very touching, even though we originally thought it was going to be cheesy. Also, I'm not sure if this is typical with hotels in Hawaii or not, but at KBH Maui, you have to pay for even local calls. I had thought most hotels let you call locally for free. I had to make a few calls and just ended up using my cell phone. And one other thing, I was suprised that they didn't have the weather channel.

I can actually say the room was not that bad. It was nicely decorated and had a mini fridge that came in handy. I can tell you that the staff treats you like you are part of the family! The kids passport program was terrific. My daughter experienced and learned many things about the Hawaiian culture. The food was wonderful and the Tiki Grill was great for our teenager...the best buger, fries and onion rings on the island he says! Every night there was a hula show and music that kept us entertained When we were too tired to be out anymore, we left our lanai door open and listened to the music which soothed us to sleep. The beach was fantastic! We rented a cabana for half the day and left our belonging on it when we went in the water...very safe! Gregg does a great job over seeing the cabana operation. Snorkeling next to Black Rock was great in the morning. We were fortuate enough to see a large see turtle one morning. It was unbelievable. When it was time to depart, we were invited down for the departing lei ceremony in which we were given a kukui nut lei. This was very moving and touching and none of us wanted to leave. Ok...here is the only drawback of our vacation...the bathroom had no vent or fan. So when one family member took a shower, the bathroom was steamy and not ventilated.

We went on February 26, 2005 for a week. It was a birthday gift from my husband. He booked through Signature Vacations and the package came with flight, hotel, breakfast and transfers. When we arrived in Maui at 11pm, we thought there would have been someone from Signature to direct us to the transportation (or Transfer promised in our package) but there was no such person. We ended up taking a $US65 cab ride to the hotel. I guess we expected the same kind of treatment like when we went to Mexico last year where a tour rep met you and guided you to the ground transportation which took you to your hotel for free! So we got to the hotel and checked into a room in the older part of the hotel. We had requested a King non-smoking room but got 2 double beds. The front desk attendant said that we could check the next day to see if a King room became available. One did become available in the Maui wing and it was very nice. The weather in Maui was wonderful all week. Sunny and in the 80's everyday. One thing we didn't know was that if you wanted a cabana on the beach, it would cost you $US30 a day. So we did that for a couple of days as I couldn't lie directly in the sun so didn't have much choice. You do have to get there early though if you want one as they run out quickly. One of the neat things was the whales. You could actually see humpback whales spouting and beaching from the beach! We also drove the Road to Hana. Gotta get up early to beat the rush. We got on the road by 6am, stopped in at Charley's Restaurant in Paia which is at the start of the Hana Highway. Charley's is a great place for breakfast and apparently Willie Nelson hangs out there! I had a huge delicious macadamia nut pancake with coconut syrup. Delicious! My husband had a breakfast burritto which was huge and yummy. Charley's was featured on the Food Network Show \"$40 a Day\" so I had to try it out! It opens at 7am. The drive to Hana takes all day. We didn't get back to our hotel until after 5pm. Saw some amazing sights along the way like waterfalls, lush tropical forests, black sand beaches, etc. Very pretty, but the road is very curvey and dangerous so you have to be extra cautious. The locals take the curves fairly fast! And there are lots of one lane bridges. Maui is expensive so be prepared to open your wallet for lots of things. Even the drinks at our resort were $8 each so we stuck to Happy Hour at $5 each. It's different than a Mexican All Inclusive, but the difference is you can explore the island in a rental car and feel safe.

I had expected a non-smoking room with a queen size bed. Instead it was smoking with two double beds. Because the room smelled clean and free of smoke, we decided not to complain and just keep the room. The small bed was cozy. Still would have like the queen, but we made do.

The main thing holding me back from giving it a higher rating is that several of the other hotels along that strip appeared more luxurious and impressive. That said, KBH was more reasonably priced than the others. Pros: (1) great location -- five minute walk to the Whaler's Village shopping area and its fun outdoor bars/restaurants; could also easily walk to several other hotels; (2) great beach -- along with the Sheraton next door, it appeared to be one of the best beach locations in Ka'anapali, with wide beaches and safe swimming; (3) room placement -- it appeared that every room has at least a marginal view of the ocean; we stayed in a \"partial ocean view\" room on the third floor in the Maui wing, and we had a very niceview of the pool and ocean; (4) nightly entertainment -- although we never made the nightly hotel entertainment our main event, it was very nice that every evening, while we had cocktails on our balcony and got ready to go out to dinner, there was a live band playing Hawaiian music; (5) pretty big room -- not huge and nothing fancy, but plenty of room to spread out; also, large shower/bath; (6) easy and close parking -- no need for valet; (7) decent bar and grill outside, which was nice and convenient for beach days; (8) room was pretty clean. Cons: (1) not fancy; we had a little bit of \"hotel envy\" towards some of the neighboring hotels like the Sheraton, Westin, Marriott, and Ka'anapali Alli; (2) pool is weak (although we went more for the beach, so it didn't bother us too much); (3) we did not find the staff to be as exceptionally friendly as their reputation on these boards and in some travel guides; that said, they were not bad either; but, with a few exceptions, we generally did not find the staff overly nice or accommodating, especially compared to the place we stayed next in Kauai; in particular, the people at the towel station outside were relatively unhelpful and unfriendly; (4) \"free\" breakfast at the Mixed Plate restaurant was pretty bad and basically felt like a school/dorm cafeteria; if you can, skip the room w/ breakfast deal and find yourself a cheaper, better, and less gross breakfast somewhere off-grounds; (5) bus into nearby town of Lahaina only ran once an hour and stopped running at 9:20 pm; however, this may be a common issue for every hotel in Ka'anapali unless other hotels/condos have their own shuttles into Lahaina, which most don't seem to.

We were on the 4th floor (out of 6) which was great for the view. The free breakfast served at the Mixed Plate each morning was wonderful - a very good variety of food with lots of fruit, eggs, sausage, cereal, pastries, etc. The show out in the courtyard each night from 6:30 till 9:00 was delightful. For the first hour of so Rudy and his small band played Island music with hula dancers to entertain you and then after a break the band came back to play regular music for the crowd to dance to. My husband went fishing one on the days and brought back some Ahi he caught. The chef at the Tiki Terrace outdoor restaurant agreed to fix it for us and it was absolutely delicious! Meals at all Maui restaurants are very expensive so we were happy they only charge us $19 a plate for the incredible ahi meal. There is no better beach in all of Maui. It is huge and was never crowded. A short two minute walk away is Black Rock which had the best snorkeling we experienced, and that includes a boat trip out to Molokini Crater. The snorkeling was the best in the early morning hours. You do have to pay $6/day for parking but another thing about the Maui wing is that is connects directly to the parking garage so was very convienient. It is also just a short walk over to Whalers Village with some good shopping and places to eat. One of the best meals we had was at Leilannis - we ate inside upstairs and watched an incredible sunset over the ocean. The staff at the KBH was very nice - the going home ceremony held the morning you leave was touching. I should say that the KBH is NOT the Sheraton next door as far as being super fancy if that's what you want. Instead it is a comfortable, fun, and relaxing atmosphere with no pretense of high class ritz. Every day they offer free classes (be sure to sign up ahead of time).

It was stated that those who have written good reviews on the K Beach Hotel are either owners or tourists who don't know any better. Well I'm sure not an owner, but I am a tourist who does know better! And I also do my research before I travel. I have been to Hawaii three times. The last time was Feb. 04, and my husband and I stayed at the KBH. I did a lot of research on this hotel before booking it. I found that some of the bldgs were renovated and some not. I then requested a room in one of the re-done wings. Our room was perfect, and very updated. No smell either. The ocean was a bit rough during our stay, but it isn't always like that. A lot depends on the time of year that you are there. Sometimes it is worth strolling a bit north or south on that stretch of beach to check out other swimming possibilities. The boardwalk that runs in that area is great for walking and exploring. In my trips to Hawaii, I have never had a bad experience with any hotel. And we never use a travel agent. I can do more research than a travel agent would ever care to, or have the time to do. My sister-in-law is an agent, and I'd never dream of letting her plan my trips. The KBH is in a great location. Their grounds are nice and kept up. They aren't a Hyatt but don't have Hyatt prices either. I knew before we stayed there that it wasn't a five star hotel, but I checked out everything about it. I went to their website and even printed out a map/diagram of the property which was color coded with the types of rooms, wing(bldg) names, proximity to the pool and beach.

We just got back from our second stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. The first time was in 1999, and this time was from Jan. 7 - 15 for our 25th wedding anniversary. We loved it just as much this time as the last time. We stayed in the Moloka'i wing in an ocean front room both times. It was pure paradise. We took a walk over to another wing just to see if there were any differences. We did not notice any smells in the halls or in the rooms. We spent time on the beach every day, renting cabanas each time. On certain days of our stay, the surf was much higher due to the time of year, but it affected all the hotels on our strip and on all of Maui, not just the KBH. As the hotel employees and the visitor channel stated, the red flag and signs are always up - just to show the dangers of the ocean. Most days the surf was perfect and fun. We snorkeled, rode the waves, and enjoyed the laughter of others experiencing the same thing. Saw whales breaching right from shore on two different days - it was amazing! Bottom line: If you want to relax on the most beautiful beach in the world during the day, go out to a nice dinner at night, and come back to dance in the courtyard to Hawaiian music with the one you love each night - stay at the KBH.

When we pulled up, I was thrilled with the location, which, as many here have previously mentioned, is on a beautiful beach with relatively calm waters and always warm waters year-round. In the winter months, you can see whales right from the beach, and there is wonderful snorkling (sea turtles abound) and scuba diving at Black Rock right down the beach, a couple hundred yards away. In the other direction, again, about 100 yards, is the fabulous Whaler's Village, with the usual upscale shops, but also some unique Hawaiian craft stores and some good restaurants. KBH prides itself on being \"Hawaii's Most Hawaiian Hotel,\" and they really are. They tell you all kinds of folk stories at the first day \"orientation breakfast.\" They also give you a kukui nut lei when you depart. They are friendly, and go out of their way to help, and I have to admit, I would be very likely to stay there again, despite my inital concerns when I read some of the comments here about the wicker furniture and the like. The rooms are average hotel rooms, but have room to stretch out, and you cannot hear anything through the walls or from the floors above you, which was a relief.

We just called down to the bell desk when we were getting ready to leave and they'd have the car ready for us, cleaned out from the day before, the top down and ready to go! We ate at the Tiki Terrace one night and had the traditional Hawaiian meal. The bamboo salad, roasted banana and pineapple, and steamed fish were excellent, but the poi, OY! And the desserts were heavenly. Food from the Tiki Bar was good, for bar food. The welcome breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about. Our package included free breakfast everyday. Again, it was just ok. I would try to work another deal out with the hotel other than the free breakfast - and then just pay for breakfast in the restaurant (which looked very good). The Mixed Plate Grill was closed for renovation while we were there, so I don't know what it's like. Also, you have to REQUEST the nightly turn down service in order for them to turn your covers down and put the Hawaiian cookies on your pillow. They don't just do that automatically. The only thing we were disappointed with at the KBH was our farewell ceremony. The night before our departure, we received an invitation to the farewell ceremony that takes place in the lobby between 8 and 12 at every hour on the hour. We went down at 11:45 and waited. At 12:05 when no one approached us, we were told that since there were only two of us, we could just get our leis from the bell desk out front...no ceremony! NOTE: I did write the KBH after our return home to let them know of our disappointment and they sent us a sincere apology and some chocolate covered macadamia nuts. While on Maui, you do not under any circumstances need a 4WD vehicle. We drove completely around the island (on both sides) and never needed one. The drive North of Kaanapali onto the Northern coast and around to central Maui was breathtaking. It wasn't dangerous at all (as the maps suggest). There were many other tourists checking the area out (altho it wasn't crowded). One of the best sights is the blowhole. You'll know you're there when you see a bunch of cars parked near boulders with rocks stacked on top of them. Just walk down a little bit (or all the way) and you'll see the blowhole. It's amazing! We also drove the road to Hana all the way around and didn't have any trouble. The road is dirt in some parts, but I never felt scared or in danger. In fact, the back side of Maui was simply breathtaking....especially around 4 pm when the sun casts wonderful shadows on the back side of Haleakula.

We didn't eat at the resort at all...not sure why, except we purchased a book about hidden restaurants in Maui and we chose to do those kinds of things.

This was our first time to Hawaii and we had an awsome time. I picked the KBH for its price, value, and beachfront location. We got stuck in the Lanai building and I believe that this is one of the older buildings in the complex. When we arrived we were not greeted as I had had imagined. We checked in and our room was not ready yet. I asked for a free upgrade (as I have read here) but was nicely denied. They finally gave us a room. We got to our room and it had a bottle of champagne, two cheap plastic wine glasses and a letter addressed to a different couple. Obviously this room was meant for some one else. About an hour or so later a bell boy came up and said he was to pick up something but didn't know what. We assumed correctly that it was the champagne. He took the items and off he went, no sorries or apologies. I was starting to get the feeling that no one knew exactly what was going on at this place. A few days later they did send up to us our own set of cheap plastic wine glasses and Korbel champagne. Our room was decent for the price. It definately wasn't four or five star quality but it sufficed. The closet door stuck alot and you had to pay a riduculous $1.50 per day fee to use their small safe. Our TV went out twice and had to be replaced. Their service was prompt though. Be advised: There is no room service at this hotel, also no spa or any of those luxury amenities. Our room opened to the center court area of the hotel. The lanai was spacious and we could see part of the ocean from it. The hotel has only one pool and it is quite small for a hotel this size I thought. One of the benefits of KBH is their complimentary breakfast. It has all the goodies but got old after a few days. Probably the best thing this hotel has going for it is that it is right on Kaanapali Beach with the \"big boy\" hotels. The beach was litterally 100 feet from our lanai. With the slider open, we could hear the waves crashing ashore at night. I'm glad I did not book in Kehei. This beach is completely awesome. The water is perfect and the sand is very soft. So in conclusion if you are looking for a decent hotel without spending a million dollars, stay here, but if you want the four star treatment look else where. In the end, I was satisfied with KBH, no more and no less.

Let me say straight out, if you want silk sheets, a giant pool, and to go to the bathroom on gilded gold plate, then go elsewhere. Elsewhere also includes ridiculous prices, tons of people and kids, and an automaton corporate staff. The facilities at the KBH are nice, clean, and extremely comfortable. We had an ocean front room and the view and access to the beach were incredible. The hotel is about 500 yards south of black rock, some of the best snorkeling on the island. We snorkeled straight out from our room and saw rays, turtles, and a rainbow of fish. The KBH has the best stretch of beach on Kaanapali. All the other hotels, both spartan and luxury had very small and very crowded beaches. At medium to high tide, most people south of the KBH have to sit on the grass of the hotel because there is no more sand. Not at KBH they have the widest, cleanest, least crowded beach in the whole area. My wife and I ran into several people who walked up or down from the \"luxury places\" to enjoy our beach. The grounds of the hotel are impeccable. Grass, exotic flowers, bushes, all well manicured and clean. Dozens of coconut and bannana trees surround the inner garden area. These trees really have bunches of coconuts and bannanas hanging from them, looked really cool. You've heard all the stories, some may think they are cliches, about the \"most Hawaiin\" hotel on Maui. Well, there true. Everyone we met or interacted with were great. Always quick with a smile and an \"Aloha\". The housekeeping was timely and we never wanted for towels, pillows, etc...The entire staff seemed as if they really cared not only about the guests, but also about their job, and most importantly, their culture. Make time to take some of the classes offered by the staff, they are well worth it. The food and drinks at the Tiki Terrace were always great. The food from the Tiki Bar and Grill always hit the spot. Quite convenient to order and carry stuff down to the beach. Don't miss the show from 6-9 nightly next to the Tiki Bar. Great authentic Hawaiin music, dancing, and great stories. We returned to the show about 4 different nights, and enjoyed it in a new way everytime. Definetly rent a car. Maui is pretty easy to explore in its entirety in about 7 days , if you have a car. Parking at the KBH was easy, in a covered lot, and only 6$ a day. My wife and I were celebrating our 10th Aniv. and the trip was FANTASTIC. The hotel, staff, food, and location only enhanced our pleasure and enjoyment. I read many reviews on this site for many months. I'll admit, I was a bit leary of the KBH. Now that I have been there, let me tell you, don't cheat yourself, make your own decision. If you are really experiencing your travel partner, and the Island, and the culture, and the beauty, how can you possibly complain about old fixtures, smoke smell, bad traffic, wind, prices etc...???

At night, the sun would set in the distance, the courtyard tiki torches would be glowing and we would be serenaded by the nightly Hawaiian hula and music show at the Tiki Bar. If you walk up and down the beach, you will see many hotels with fancy pools and a sea of lounge chairs and a small strip of sand. At the KBH, there's a small pool and a very large courtyard and easy access to a large beach area. The green space creates a great setting. We had dinner at the Tiki Terrace restaurant and it may have been the best meal we had in Hawaii. We took advantage of the free Hawaiian activities, including lei making, sandprints and pineapple cutting. It's rare to stay at a hotel and have them greet you and call you by name as you walk through. There was an orientation breakfast that was enjoyable and funny as much as it was informative. I recommend making sure to go to it. The staff makes sure the Hawaiian heritage comes through in everything. At the end of the stay, there's a farewell ceremony when they present you with a lei and a hug. You're welcomed back as extended Ohana (family) and you feel that way. We saw many hotels on Maui, including the ones up and down Ka'anapali Beach, and this one doesn't have the flash, but it has the class. When we left, both my son and daughter remarked that they would never want to stay at another place. That's high praise from a couple of teenagers!!!

We initially had every intention of staying at one of the big name resorts like the Sheraton, Grand Wialea, Fairmont or the Ritz-Carlton -Kapalua, but as we saw out budget shrink we reluctantly agreed on the KBH. They say everything happens for a reason and this was certainly an example as we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at the KBH. The KBH was SO comfortable....we visited the other resorts and while they were more visually striking than the KBH they didn't have that intangible quality that the KBH had in spades. As you've read in previous reviews of the KBH, the staff is great and the atmosphere is wonderful. The rooms were nice, clean and well kept and they did the little things too...a bottle of champagne was in the in-room fridge when we arrived, macadamia nut cookies were left on the bed after it was turned down each night and even a bag tag was left for us on our last night. At other resorts you may have to contend with the \"See and be seen\" or \"look but don't touch\" atmosphere, at the KBH you can be yourself and enjoy! It's on the best stretch of beach on Kaanapali, the grounds are well kept, the pool gets the job done (although I never have understood why people go to a BEACH resort, then spend all their time at the pool....go to Arizona for that!) the Tiki Terrace restaurant is great, the Tiki Bar has the best tropical drinks in Kaanapali and the Tiki Grill is there for lunch or a quick bite whenever you want. We loved hanging out on our lanai each night, sipping a cocktail and listening to the live Hawaiian music while we watched the sunset over the Pacific and neighbor islands. The nightly hula show is good hokey fun...I half expected to see the Brady Bunch sitting out there while we watched, it's a must see if you are around the hotel for sunset. My only advice- skip the Ohana Welcome breakfast if possible...I suppose the info they gave on activities on the island is useful if you're starting from square 1, but if you've even glanced thru a travel book or websites on Maui you'll already know all the info they are telling you. We looked at the KBH as a comprimise, now we feel like it's the best place on the island. If you are looking to pay $500 a night and share the beach with Britney Spears and her new fiance then go to the Fairmont or the Ritz.

There were plenty of amenities in the room, including a refridgerator, iron, hair dryer, etc. The point which stands out most about this hotel is the laid-back, family atmoshpere. If you have children or are just young at heart, there is a pool, a ping pong table and an oversized checker board for your entertainment. The grounds are large with beautiful old trees bearing sweet smelling blossoms. The hotel encourages its guests to pull out a lawn chair and just relax under the cool shade of one of these trees while you watch the sunset over the ocean. While you are relaxing in your lawn chair, don't forget to grab a Lava Flow cocktail at the Tiki Bar and some great tasting munchies (hamburgers, fries, spring rolls...) at the Tiki Grill located by the pool.

The music was nice and really made you feel like you were in Hawaii. The only complaint we had about the hotel is that the food at the Mixed Plate is really not good. The waffles there are made of plastic. Don't even waste your money going there.

The best thing to do after you get over the fact that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying 250.00 for something that would be 59.99 back on the mainland is get out of your airplane clothes and into something more Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u201dflip flops plus anything breezy will do. Next go and stand on your lanai (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patio, Hawaiian style). Now breathe. When\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last time that felt so good? Next float out of your room and down to what I believe to be the heart of the Kaanapali Beach Hotel: the outdoor Tiki Bar, where the aforementioned open air show is performed nightly by Rudy Aquino and his band La Hau Nui. Mr. Aquino used to play with Don Ho back in the day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, Tiny Bubble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Don Ho, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much more authentic than that. His ukulele skills and vibe prowess will transform you to another time, and that Lava Flow you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re downing doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt matters any. The show is honest and easy going \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wait, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that how the Midwest is described?\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcomplete with one of Rudy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughters performing the hula. Keep an eye out for Smiles, the stone-faced bass player with shoulder length hair, brilliant. When you get back to your room hours later the fact that the sliding screen door falls off its track if you look at it sideways or that the shower sprays water everywhere but on your body won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother you nearly as much as it did when you arrived. Sleep to the sounds of the crashing waves and awaken to a symphony of overly expressive birds the next morning. Pull back your industrial strength drapes and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll realize you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re definitely not in Kansas (or Chicago as the case may be) anymore. One of the nice things about the grounds at KBH is the organic laid back feel they have, no topiaries or showy stone statues here, just a carpet of green, green grass, gorgeous flowering trees, seductive palms, and a fun oversized checkerboard complete with red and black painted coconuts for game pieces. On a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendation my sweetheart and I purchased beach chairs at the Wal-Mart near the airport thereby avoiding the 30.00 dollar a day charge for a private cabana\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough it has always been a dream of mine to have a cabana boy, better to save the dough for more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuseful\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 things like umbrella drinks and pineapple shaped refrigerator magnets. Once ensconced in the sand\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddrop-dead gorgeous view of neighboring islands and all\u00e2\u20ac\u201dspend the day drifting in an out of consciousness while intermittently dipping yourself into the sparkling blue waters. You know those Salt Glow things you pay 70 bucks for back on the mainland? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right here baby, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free. If you get hungry doing nothing lazily make your way up to the Tiki grill next to the whale shaped pool and order a cardboard container of yummy fries or better still a hot dog (avoid the teriyaki chicken and beef skewers at all costs, incredibly salty with a highly questionable texture). Later in the afternoon, make like the other guests and move to one of the many free chairs on the lawn to read your copy of Michener\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hawaii or the latest issue of Oprah. Go back up to the room (which at this point is really growing on you) and nap for an hour or so then take a delicious shower around 4:00 or 5:00 and get yourself back down to the beach for the near religious experience of a West Maui Sunset. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling with a painter as I was, watch as the artist falls to pieces over the mind-blowing display of color: purples, indigos, pinks, oranges. It is, as they say, worth the price of admission. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much to do on Maui it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to give any travel bee a panic attack: how can you do it all in such a short time? Guess what, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, so kick back, pick a few things you really want to try and do those. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sunrise bike trip down Haleakala the dormant volcano (we opted out of this after we found out a van picked you up at 2:30 AM for this 8 hour trip) a whale watching tour or the drive on the infamous road to Hana. On our 8 day trip my guy and I drove to the hippie surfer town of Paia, watched windsurfers at Ho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122okipa Beach, went to a hemp store in Haiku, went whale watching, snorkeled Black Rock, explored the rugged coast of North Maui, took in the Old Lahaina Luau (highly recommended) and went to a magic show for humiliation Rodney Dangerfield style (not recommended). All that and we still had time for hours of being and nothingness. We ate at a bunch of great places including Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House which felt like being on the set of South Pacific\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgorgeous\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand bought raw Ahi Poke from the local grocery store, basically tuna sashimi in ponzu sauce, for a picnic dinner of our own next to the ocean: simple and perfect. The fact that Maui is literally crawling with honeymooners can make those of us living in sin feel a little left out never mind downright pressured. If the constant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou two just married\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 question starts to grate on you simply smile, nod and hoist your Lava flow to the heavens, best not to disappoint. Who knows, maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get some ideas\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6A pleasant side effect of all the just marrieds is that there is a considerable lack of creepy singles slithering about. The locals do of course have their own cruising behavior involving the universal slow driving, low slung cars and parading of low slung jeans but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a pasty mainlander you can consider yourself invisible. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for pristine grounds and the perfect tea service try one of the five dollar sign behemoths such as the Four Seasons and the Fairmont. Everything will be freshly scrubbed and sterilized for your, um, pleasure. If, on the other hand you want to relax and work on that thing you use to have called fun, try paradise old school style: the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. Tom, Dick, Ethel and Marge will grow on you and your smile will grow with the passing days. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if you come home with a muumuu collection, an ultra-bronzed tan and a penchant for extra long cigarettes.", "Date": "May 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back...truely enjoyed our stay here\u201d", "Author": "EmpressLala", "ReviewID": "UR2117129", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay a KBH.

They have a great tiki bar with good drink specials everyday. The tiki hut grill also served up suprisingly good munchies also at a reasonable price. We received free breakfast buffet tickets because our booking agency had made a mistake-I would not recommend using these for the Mixed Plate buffet. The food here was cold and not very good.Not much variety either. You can use your breakfast tickets at the other Tiki restaurant where the food is much better-don't waste your time going to the Mixed plate buffet. The hotel is a very short walk from black rock where there is the best snorkeling-almost better than the snorkeling cruise to Molikini we took. We saw some turtles and tons of fish too. Also a very short walk to the Whalers Village where there is lots of good shopping and great restaurants-try Hula Grill or Leilani's. We tried them both and we would highly recommend them. There is no jacuzzi at the hotel but we just walked next door to the Whaler hotel/condo resort and used there's-they didn't mind.The room we had was kind of outdated but very clean-you're hardly ever in your room anyways.

During our stay, the was \"bad weather\" and the hotel had guests that had to \"extend\" their stay longer. This made the hotel rather crowded and some new arrivals were sent to other hotels for one or two nights (of course the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel picked up the tab). They took you there and picked you up when a room was available. Not many hotels will do that! Many times when that happens, upon returning to the KBH, you would be treated to either a huge fruit plate with crackers and cheeses along with a variety of fresh island fruits or maybe a free dinner. Not bad! Any activity that we wanted to do could be set up by the people that work at the Activity Center, located right in the lobby. They arranged great seats at the Old Lahaina Luau for us. Any type of activity that you might want to do on Maui can be scheduled for you right there. And if you want to bring pineapple home from your trip, they can arrange to have \"your pineapple\" meet you right at the airport! That's service! We even took hula lessons at no charge! Children activites can also be arranged. Something for everyone! The night before we were to leave, under our door, there was an invitation to their \"Farewell Ceremony\" held in the hotel lobby ever hour, on the hour from 8 until noon, daily. That ceremony brought tears to my eyes! Sad tears because our vacation was ending, and tears of joy because of the wonderful way in which we were treated.

The KBH is a value price with great staff on one of the best beaches in the world.

But locals come here for the weekend for a reason- the price is right, the beach is 2nd to none, the rooms are decent (they're average, not spectacular but not terrible either), and they're not spending time hanging out in their room.

After reading some of these reviews, i was somewhat leary about the accomidations. We decided to give it a try because of the loctation and price. When we arrived i was pleasantly surprised. We checked in with no problems. We paid for a garden view, but were upgraded to an oceanview to our surprise. The room was outstanding. very clean and appeared to have recently been renovated. We were on the fifth story in the maui wing. Our lanai overlooked the hotel grounds and the ocean. We didn't eat at the hotel except for one morning at the free buffet. It was terrible. After that we'd eat breakfast at the nearby reasturants at whaler's village or we went to the breakfast buffet at the hyatt twice. I will say that the two women at the activities desk were a little rude and almost no help. I asked about things to do and one handed me a book and continued talking to her co-worker about personal stuff. We decided to go into lahaina and see what we could find. We ended up booking almost all of our activities through a place called \"barefoot\" something. Can't remember the whole name, but it was great. They were very helpful and we booked five things through them. They have nothing to do with timeshares. If you want to take in a show, i highly recommend \"ulalena.\" Great show with even better music. All in all we enjoyed our stay at KBH.

Wow, what a difference! This is such an old, rundown hotel. The package we booked was to have included a free upgrade from partial ocean to ocean view. We were told they were very full and could not do it. We were then given a smoking room in one of the newer wings and it smelled like an ashtray. When we told them we had booked a non-smoking room and could not stand the odor of the room they gave us, we were given a non-smoking room in one of the older wings. The room was a blast from the 1970's. Laughable, really. The shower curtain smelled very sour and the whole bathroom was dank and old. From our balcony I could see a speck of ocean between the trees. The pool was a sad little thing, very blah. The beach area was very nice and the grounds of the hotel were pretty and well-maintained.

All in all, I agree with some other reviewers in that this is a budget hotel- you get what you pay for. But even if you don't spend a whole lot of time in your room, you want it to be nice, comfortable, and not smell bad! We spent about the same amount of money per night on our hotel on the Big Island and it was worlds apart from this.

Great location, great service from all of the staff. Housekeeping cleaned the rooms nicely and always seemed very happy and greeted you. The beach is in a perfect place, close to Whaler's Village. The nightly lua I thought looked cheesy but was actually really fun. The downside is this place needs a renovation REALL BAD. The place looks really dated. I'm sure the wallpaper and front desk-lobby everything is from the 70's. The Molokai wing we stayed in didn't have an elevator-We are only 27 so didn't really bother us but it was weird to see that. Rooms were average-nicely decorated but you could tell it was worn out. Also no hot tub-not a big deal but it would have been nice in the evenings. I thought almost every hotel had one, especially at a 400 room property. Overall nice location, good service, ok food. Next time I would stay at the Marriott or Sheraton though-worth the extra money in my opinion.", "Date": "January 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "maserati27", "ReviewID": "UR1553587", "Content": "Just got back from the KBH. Overall, we were disappointed with our stay. Positives: Housekeeping, groundskeeping and Mixed Plate restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a superb location for beach, Whaler's Village and transport to Lahaina. Desk person Salome was very helpful upon our arrival. Negatives: So called non-smoking rooms in the Kauai wing are sandwiched between smokers, so the whole wing is smoking. We couldn't sit on our balcony or leave our window open because of cigarette smoke. We were moved to the Molokai wing because it was \"smoke free.\" Although there appeared to be less smoke in the air, we could still smell it wafting up from lower balconies. Our table tops weren't wiped clean during our entire stay. We had hoped to sit and enjoy a meal and drink during the nightly entertainment, but Jo Camel and her Marlboro man shared their burning dung with us there as well. In fact, the whole grounds and immediate beach area smelled like a smoky old nightclub, even with a good breeze. The Molokai wing has no elevator or tub, which was a pain after a long day of walking etc. We went to the KBH for rest and relaxation, but were wakened each morning around 5AM by old plumbing and inconsiderate neigbors \"talking\" at full volume. The \"free upgraded room\" upon arrival is purely a come on. My request for one was met with, \"We're very busy and don't have the room.\" We had great weather and the ocean water and sunny skies were a super break from winter in The Great White North. We may be back to Maui, but will definitely stay somewhere else.", "Date": "January 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, WI", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1496850", "Content": "My husband and I chose this hotel based on a raving recommendation from our travel agent and much research.

I am soooo pleased that I read all of the reviews -- good AND bad...and my husband and I are happy to say that our 8-day dream vacation here was incredible. Our room and the service (especially the bellmen/maid/valet service) was beyond expectation...the warm, welcoming, cozy, tropical, Hawaiian atmosphere was exactly what we wanted our Hawaiian experience to be -- not a cookie cutter resort that had a 'created' atmosphere! My husband's highlight was the nightly hula show -- what a welcome sound to come 'home' to every night! The beach is by far the best in the area! We have plans to return (and have our lei re-strung to include a white nut!) and it won't be soon enough! The only investment in improvement I would recommend is at the Mixed Plate restaurant...but the other restaurant was wonderful and it worked out nicely that we had the option to use our breakfast buffet dollars toward a breakfast meal there!

We really liked the location and the view of the ocean. The staff was very friendly, they even helped me look for something that I thought I had lost on my way out.

From Oct 19 - Oct 25, 2003 and we made a great choice! We really felt at home and comfortable at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for the most part. The Hawaiians who worked there were very friendly! But the caucasion employees should take some lessons on how to treat guests. That is really our only complaint. They were, to say it bluntly, pretty rude! They are the most Hawaiian hotel but I think they need to be the \"all Hawaiian hotel\". There are a couple of guys who work in the towel hut that really need personality adjustments. I gave them the benefit of maybe having a bad day. But after 5 days of dealing with these guys I was glad when I turned in my last towel and never had to see them again. But the resort was gorgeous! We loved hanging at the pool. The water was perfect. And if you stay you must try the wonton apps at the Tiki Grill next to the Tiki Bar! They are awsome! The breakfast buffet is too expensive. The light buffet which was a glorified continental breakfast was like $11 or $12 per person! With tip it cost us almost $30 a day just for breakfast. When you leave they sing a Hawaiian farewell song and give you a lei. It was pretty special and it made my wife cry. She didn't want to leave.

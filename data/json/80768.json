{"Reviews": [{"Content": "skip the breakfast I spent three days in SF at a very pleasant time of the year: not too crowded, good dry weather. I had chosen this hotel for its convenient location near Union Square. The room was comfortable though a little over stuffed with furniture. The bathroom, on the other hand, lacked a shelf or any other place to put toilettries and was separated from the bedroom only by a sliding door , which did not make for much privacy for the toilet.The elevator is rather antique and no one will help you if you try to get your suitcase in by pushing the heavy grille to the side. The personnel seems to change all the time and is quite indifferent. There is a restaurant and bar , which I didn't visit after my experience with breakfast. The dismal smelly, basement has a small counter where coffee urns dispense indifferent weak coffee, a serving shelf offers bagels or rolls.Two very small rooms with minute tables to sit. The usual array of tea , sugar, jam,paper towels are all available on another table, a bowl of sliced apples and a few grapes were the only fresh fruit . Perhaps the same, served in a pleasant room, might not have seemed so skimpy and cheap. I recommend going out for that meal;Across from the hotel, a very good, Japanese cafe, restaurant , quite lively in the evening.Nearby, a convenience store, a cablecar stop, all the shops you want!", "Date": "Nov 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR983899539", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "laloon"}, {"Content": "Great Stay My wife and I stayed at the Fitzgerald Hotel for new year's 07.

I asked what their policy is when guests find bed bugs in their rooms. She said that they will wash and fold ONE bag of laundry for me, and on weekdays they will call someone to spray, but nothing else, despite the fact that I was paying almost $200 per night. And, it was Saturday, which meant the room would not be sprayed until at earliest Monday, which is when I checked out. I took them up on their clean-one-bag-of-clothes policy, but I still had to sleep with the bed bugs for two more nights. They would not put me in another room, and they would offer me no other compensation.The nice women at the desk did recommend that I call the general manager, who, she said, would take care of me. So, I called the general manager, and he was curt and rude with me on the phone. He told me it's not his job to deal with my problems and that I should call another manager. So, when I called the other manager, he said that he would have to talk to the general manager and then get back to me. Basically, I got the runaround, and heard nothing else from either of them.I highly recommend you avoid this hotel, as bed bugs can easily hitch a ride in your luggage or clothes and infest your home.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR976778077", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Kaesemeister"}, {"Content": "Avoid this hotel!!! Bed Bugs!!! I am pretty shocked that I am the only one (compared to the other reviews) who recognized that they have some problems with bed bugs. Actually, I had no idea that there are bed bugs - didn't even know that they exist. It was horrible. I woke up every morning with ugly bites and after researching the internet I found out that these bites are from bed bugs. I also changed the room - still the same problem. The last day I packed my stuff and found some bed bugs on my luggage!!! Really horrible!!! So I had to wash everything and also bought a new suitcase (threw the old one away). I am really afraid that I will bring some home.So, for me this is the main reason why you should stay away from this hotel. You still need more? The rooms are vvveerrryyy small. In most of the rooms when you open your window you hear and see doves and their dirt. It's really disgusting. I am pretty sure this is also not very healthy. You don't have air-conditioning in the room and since the rooms are so small, it gets pretty hot in there. The phone does not work and everything in the room seems pretty old.

Let's start out with the positives;the hotel is close to as it is represented; highly decorated, European-style- almost kitschy and claustrophobic, but very, very clean. There is a microwave in the room, ditto a fridge, and these come in handy. The lighting is better suited to mood than to practicality- the room I had (301, and if you're not a fan of drunks raving in the street, avoid it) had a lovely color scheme but needed some work. The shower was superb- hot and plentiful water. I had requested two beds, and the person checking us in explained to me that while skoosh (who she said is really expedia?) told us that we were requesting two beds, they actually only requested one, and that is what we got. She told us that we had to wait for the manager, and we did. He said they had upgraded us, free of charge, to a queen bed, but this seemed suspicious to me, since it was only by going to our room that we discovered the one bed- in other words, they upgraded us before we complained? The best he could offer us was an upgrade to a king for 15 more dollars a day- at that point, I felt I was being lied to, and wasn't about to give them any more money. The next morning I got into the shower, holding onto the bar, and promptly fell, bruising my leg severely. I knew there was no mat, but I assumed that the tub had grooves, or else those invisible looking strips. My eyes aren't what they used to be, and my assumption proved unfounded. When we went down to the continental breakfast, the woman who had checked us in was pouring orange juice, and we told her about the mat. She assured us we'd get one.A quick word about the breakfast- this is okay- orange juice, coffee, bagels, danish. The breakfast room doubles as a wine bar at night, and from what I could tell, does a lively business.When we arrived back at the hotel that night, there was no bath mat. So my husband went down to complain to the manager, and he did get us one, but I was quite annoyed and dismayed that a customer could fall and the staff was that cavalier about it. (Upon check out, when I told the woman at the desk my tale of woe, she asked me at once, did they offer you anything? An upgrade? A discount? and she seemed surprised that they hadn't. That was fine, but I found the whole thing to be stupid and shortsighted from a business standpoint.)I neglected to mention that there is also a nice cd player in the room; luckily I had brought some music with me, otherwise I fear that sleep would have been more of a problem because the street noise was horrendous. I've slept in hotels on busy streets in London, in Rome, in Madrid, in Amsterdam, in New Orleans, in San Antonio, in Baltimore and Philadelphia, and I have never had the likes of this. If you stay here, call first and make sure you don't face the street.The hotel is near Union Square, but if you have any condition that tires you out or you have difficulty with legs and/or back, it's a little bit of a hike from the Square, and more of a steep one from Powell Street Station or the cablecar turnaround.Just before we checked out, the girls in the room across from us told us that there had been homeless people sleeping in the hallway the night before. I had heard noises in the hall late at night, but since this was the only night I did, perhaps it was a one-time thing. Now, when we had checked in, the attendant told us that 800 numbers were 'complimentary'- my husband had business in San Jose the following week and was preparing, so he asked, knowing that different hotels have different policies. So we were quite surprised to be met with a further charge- a list of 800 numbers and an energy surcharge. My husband asked, which part of complimentary doesn't mean free? It's not that we so minded the extra 20-odd dollars, and if we had been told the truth, he probably would have used it anyway, but we weren't told the truth. I think this was less an outright lie than a lack of understanding from the staff.Most of the staff, though nice, seemed to have too much of a shrugging of the shoulders problem.

I wanted to stay in Union Square and Fitzgerald Hotel looked ok and had several good reviews. Big mistake, I can't remember staying at a worse hotel; this reminded me of on of those shady hotels we stayed at when pack-packing through Europe as a teenager.My flight out of New York was delayed 6 hours due to bad weather. I called the hotel before take-off informing the receptionist I would be coming in late, (around 2am) and wanted to assure them I would be coming and to confirm I was expected. No problem.After a long flight, my cab finally pulls ups around 3am; I wake up the female receptionist by knocking on the door. She gets up from the coach in the small lobby where she was stretched out. She seems very annoyed that I wake her up and walks up to the door takes my name and leave standing on the sidewalk! She comes back a few minutes later, tells me I have no reservation and that she can't let me in. I show her my confirmation; she finally lets me in, but tells me there are no rooms available.I pointed to my confirmation, mentioned that I spoke to someone at the hotel before I left NY and that I was not going to start looking for a hotel in the middle of the night. She had no sympathy for the fact that I had been up for 24 hours, she was just annoyed and irritated over the fact they I was inconveniencing her, as it was my fault that they had given my room to someone else. She calls her manager and they agree that I can stay at a spare room they have next to the lobby. She tells me that she will charge my $99 for this room, but apparently the manager disagrees and tells her to charge me full rate, $139. At this point I really don\u9225\u6a9b care what they charge, I just want to get a few hours of sleep. However, I find it unacceptable that they charge their customers going rate for a utility room (used for storage etc.), which is located between the lobby (door is 4 feet from the receptionist desk) and the entrance with windows actually facing the lobby, as well as the sidewalk. Needless to say I could hear everything that was going on in the lobby, thankfully it was not a busy night.The last thing I did before I wiped away pubic hair from my bed was to call the Hyatt who informs me that they have had some cancellations the following night, at least some good news. The $299 at Hyatt seemed like a bargain compared to $139 at Fitzgerald. Honestly I would not stay in this hotel if they paid me.

We stayed one night with our three kids, had two rooms and a great time. Realize this hotel is remodeled, but OLD. Built in the early 1900s, when a hotel room did not entail 800 square feet. If you know that going in you are far less likely to be disappointed by the room size when you arrive.We pulled up on Friday evening around 6 p.m. There is no bell staff, so be ready to carry your own bags. The desk person greeted us by name, having remembered we would be arriving with three children. This personal service set the tone for our stay. We were quickly and efficiently checked in, given directions to the parking garage just down the block, and the kids were helped into the old elevator.The elevator is a kick. Small, like only two people at a time, with a gated door and regular door. I haven't seen one in yeasr and the kids loved it. If you don't like the elevator the stairs are conveniently located and not long at all. We had two rooms at the back of the third floor, a double/double for the kids and a queen deluxe for ourselves. My husband had negotiated a great rate for the two rooms when he called earlier in the week, so our entire stay for both rooms, incluidng room tax (14.5%) and energy surchage ($3) came out to less than $200. That's a great bargain in San Francisco.Rooms are equpped with a microwave, small fridge, television, and CD player/clock. Each is decorated differently, and all are cute. It's not the Hyatt, but it's not Motel 6, either.After some whirlwind shopping and a late dinner around the corner at Max's, we returned to the room. Desite what you might read, the neighborhood is not bad for the area. It's a block from the Theater district and just down from Union Square. Yes, you will encounter some street people, but this is a business district in a city. Simply be aware of your surroundings. We were quite comfortable returing to the hotel at 11 p.m.There is no AC, so you have to open the windows for air. There are numerous clubs in the area, so it can be a bit noisy. Once we shut the window we didn't hear anything.The beds are amazingly comfortable, and the rooms are uniquely decorated. A small platform in front of the window at the end of the hall is decorated with large throw pillows and serves as a great window seat to watch passersby.Breakfast was typical continental - coffee, juice, pastries, bagels. No fruit, but I bought few pieces at the little store two doors down. It was a more than adequate start for us, but if you need more there's a diner down the block with one of the best breakfasts on Union Square. We met some nice fellow travelors in the breakfast room and got a tip on a neat exhibit at the Metreon.Checkout was a breeze, with no surprises and good service. All in all it's a cute and funky, privately owned hotel with good prices and a neat old building.

As everyone says, the rooms are on the small side, but they are not tiny. Quite comfortable for one or two people. We had a room on the fifth floor, at the front of the hotel. Friends were in the same room on the fourth floor. The decor of the rooms was really imaginative and sort of funky. Our room had tomato soup colored walls, with a chandelier, dripping with fake crystals, in the center of the ceiling. Similarly gaudy table lamps, a very large heavy headboard, and dark, textured marble desk and dresser tops. Lots of other little quirky touches too. I jokingly referred to our room as The Bordello. Our friends room was painted a sort of deep, rich green. It had a lighted ceiling fan, a large rattan headboard, and a matching rattan armoire (with TV set inside). A mirror over the desk had jungle animals unobtrusively carved into the surrounding frame. In one corner, next to a lounging chair, was a very large artificial shrub. I referred to their room as The Jungle Room. Someone tried to make these rooms FUN, and I think they succeeded. As some other reviewer said, these are not sterile chain hotel rooms. Yes, the one elevator is tiny and old and has two heavy doors to open and close. No more than four people (without luggage) can fit snuggly inside. But, it always worked, and we never had to wait long for it, if at all. Our only complaint was that we liked to leave our windows open a bit at night and the street traffic could be terrible. Not the volume, but there were often a few noisy vehicles to wake you up during the night. Also, when the clubs and bars closed, there was always a loudmouth or two walking down the street yelling or singing or arguing with someone (maybe himself). I would definitely stay here again. Excellent location, convenient to theaters, transportation, and shopping (if that's your thing). P.S. It was clean, and the included modest continental breakfast was adequate.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR531449932", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ArtSea2"}, {"Content": "Tiny rooms indeed I stayed here on business during a busy convention weekend when most hotels in the city were booked.

This would be a nice, funky place for college students or those on a serious budget, if you get a deal like some of the reviewers mentioned (I paid $200 a night through my company's travel agency!) but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Fitzgerald and loved it!! We got a great deal on the room, $69 plus taxes for a Friday night, over Labor Day weekend. One tip, go to their hotel website, and use the name your own rate feature, and bid low! They will accept just about any reasonable price if they are not all booked up. We got our room for $100 less than the advertised price. The hotel is older, but well-kept, and very nicely decorated. The only thing I didn't like was the slow, TINY old fashioned elevator. But it IS an old building, so thats to be expected. The rooms are nicely decorated, but SMALL! The bathroom was clean, but had no ventilation, so the room became a sauna as soon as I turned on the shower. Our room was decorated with an asian-theme. And the location....amazing.

We got a great deal thru their name your price functionality - only $50 per room per night.We arrived on 14 feb morning,  as the check-in time was only @ 3pm, we decided to leave our luggage at hotel and go sight-seeing. We informed the front desk that we would check-in later that night  she confirmed that this wld be ok. At 3pm, we called the hotel again to remind them that we wld be checking-in late, and was reassured that our room wld be kept for us.We were delighted by the hotel's central, busy  safe location. The hotel decor was feminine, bright, clean  comfy - just like in the website. However, when we arrived at the hotel at 9.30pm, we were told by a different lady @ the front desk that the hotel mgr had messed up another party's reservation  decided to give our room to them!! Since the hotel was fully-booked that night, they would get a room for us at nearby hotel. They even told us that it was normal to be overbooked and did not apologise.We were tired and not happy with the prospect of having to drag our huge suitcases to another hotel so late at night, but had to concede.The other hotel, Dakota, was 2 doors away. The elevator was ancient, creaky and very small,  we had a tough time moving our luggage in  out. Room #606 did not hv a shower  the bathtub had urine stains. The bathroom door cld not be shut. The tv turned on  off by itself,  even changed channels by itself,  sometimes cld not be controlled by the remote control. The lights in the room also turned on by itself. No breakfast is served in the morning but u can make ur own coffee in the lobby.We brought our luggage back to the Fitzgerald the next morning, and the lady @ the front desk (same as the previous morning's) was shocked to hear that we were bumped into another hotel and very sympathetic. We were invited to breakfast in their cosy parlour (with a fireplace) and she even helped us make bookings for local tours and our airport shuttle - she was v helpful in giving us opinions on which were good and which shd b avoided.We managed to check-in safely later that night. The room looked smaller than in the website but was still fine with us. The decor was exactly the same as in the photos. V cosy with lots of huge cushions, heavy drapes and ornate mirrors. We were thankful for the shower. The room was cleaned everyday  we were also provided with fresh towels everyday.Breakfast was buffet-style  pretty ok - bagels, half danishes (which were too sweet), muffins, banana cake, fresh OJ (which was to sour), coffee and tea. It was not Starbucks but it suited us perfectly fine.Overall, this is a good hotel to stay in if you're ever in SF. The location is very central, and the atmosphere in the hotel is lovely.

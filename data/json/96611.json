Small maintenance items such as many light bulbs missing in the light fixtures. And the major maintenance problem was the parking lot which was just gravel and being on a hill, had ruts in it that a car like a Mini Cooper could get lost in. How hard is it to use a tractor and smooth out the gravel? This place is so badly neglected that they must save tens of thousands of dollars each year because of the lack of maintenance.

So we called and were told that there was one unit left to rent, a two-bedroom, two-bath condo. We took it. We were told that we had to pay up front since it was so close to the weekend, so we did, paying $411 total for two days. After renting it, I looked it up on tripadvisor and read all of the bad reviews. I braced myself for the worst. It turned out to be a downstairs unit with concrete block walls and a sliding patio door for an entrance. It was definitely dated. The couch had a hole in the arm material; the carpet was green indoor-outdoor. On the plus side, the appliances worked, the air conditioning was very good (there was a constant drip outside the entrance from the air conditioner for the unit above us), and the bathrooms were clean. The staff was more helpful than some reviewers had said. Soon after we arrived the handle on the inside of the door broke off (the door was difficult to close, and after closing would open up about half an inch unless you locked it.) We called and the handyman came out and put on a new handle. Sometime that night, the smoke alarm started chirping randomly every few minutes. We called twice the next day before someone came out and removed it. (There was still another in the bedroom.) The pool was old, but clean. All in all, it was better than I expected.

That sums up this place. From ants in the kitchen to roaches in the bedroom, this place has plenty of wildlife. Not to mention all the other dead bugs around. KITCHEN-The kitchen was not very clean to begin with. It had a really bad odor and had a layer of dust over it. If you want toast, get ready to hold your breath. The toaster smelled HORRID. The fridge would freeze things really fast, even if they weren't in the freezer. Sinkholes? Don't worry, they come with the cottage. There was a spot with absolutely no floorboards! We put a chair over it so nobody hurt themselves. There were also missing floorboards in the hallway and in the front room. THIS WAS THE WORST PART OF OUR STAY. BEDROOMS-Beds were mediocre at best. Very, very outdated, and not clean. I was afraid to sleep on them without putting down a sheet first. When you want to sleep, the AC units in the window don't let you. They get loud, and too cold! One of them was broken, so we had to fix an opening in the window. POOL-If you enjoy swimming in hose water, this place is for you! They use a hose to fill the pool. Apparently its alright just to put chlorine tablets in and call it \"sanitary.\" They pool lining was falling off as well. Be careful in the pool. DOORS-The sliding door had a broken track, so it was a royal pain to close. The front door didn't latch very well at all, but neither did the closet door because the hinges were broke. It did rain one night while we stayed. I was very surprised the roof did not leak! STAFF/FURNISHINGS-Not real sure what they were doing, but a staff member had an extension cord running through an open using one of OUR outlets! After that was taken care of, we made the mistake of getting burnt out lightbulbs replaced. We had a total of 6 bulbs that needed replaced, but I'm sure that's normal. Location-This was about the only good thing about the place. It wasn't far from Silver Dollar City (which I fully recommend), and was a nice little drive from the lake. I will conclude my rant there.

I should have read the reviews before I went.....My family stayed in one of the older 2 bedroom kitchenettes and our friends stayed in a 1 room kitchenette. When we walked in the smell was horrible, there were cobwebs everywhere, the vents had so much dust on them you could choke, one of the beds was propped up by a brick, the mattresses were stained and torn/shredded at the bottom, the carpet was filthy, the bathroom floor in the 1 room kitchenette had not been cleaned, the blankets/comforters were torn, the table leg was broken, the air conditioner was loud & old and dripped onto the \"balcony with a view\".

I booked a 2 bedroom cabin at Trails End, which was supposed to sleep up to 10 people & boasted a view of the lake & a wonderfully serene setting in the woods. \"Enjoy your morning coffee on your private balcony as you watch wildlife...\" whatever. First of all, our cabin was right in front of the 2 dumpsters that I guess were used by everyone staying in the cabins. Those dumpsters smelled like dead animals & we literally had to hold our breath to get to the cabin from the car & vice versa. There was NO way that we were going to enjoy anything on our \"private balcony\", which actually was a dirty wood porch with an old picnic table that had a hundred names carved into it, including Lick. Even if it didn't smell of death, the noise from the window air conditioner would have prevented any enjoyment from hanging out on the porch. And I really wouldn't have gone out there to enjoy the scenery anyway because our view consisted of the 2 cabins in front of ours & the 4 cars that they had parked there. The lake was not visible from our cabin & when we walked down there we saw that we weren't even on the lake - the little bit of water where we were was like the edge of a farm pond. The whole air conditioning situation was absurd. The cabin is advertised as being air conditioned, but all we had was the loud little window unit in the living room. The a/c to the bedrooms consisted of fans that they had stuck in the walls to spread the window a/c air back there. Didn't work! It was miserable sleeping at night it was so hot in those rooms. We had the air on as high as it would go, which meant when my kids wanted to watch tv when we got home at night (since we couldn't go outside) they had to crank it to a volume that we had to yell at each other if we wanted to talk. The cabin had bugs, which shouldn't be a big deal since it is a cabin & all. And I would have been OK if it had been spiders or beetles or centipedes, even a scorpion, but this place had roaches & I draw the line at roaches. I had thought that we would eat breakfast in the cabin before we left for each days' activities & had bought everything for that, but after we saw roaches there was no way that I was going to let us use their dishes. The cabin didn't have a dishwasher & by that time I felt so dirty that I was not going to be satisfied just washing the dishes by hand before we used them. As mentioned in another review, there was no access to internet. That happened to be important for us because my college-aged daughter is taking an on-line class this summer & has to use the internet several times a week. I e-mail Indian Point & asked them about it & a Mary responded that they had a USB device that we could check out & that it was $5 per night. I was satisfied with this but when we checked in & I asked about it I was told that all of the devices had already been checked out & that there was a lengthy waiting list. Well, it would have been nice if Mary had mentioned that in the first place & I could have tried to get on said list. They sent us on a wild goose chase all over the place looking for a wifi signal & I guess they got tired of us because when my daughter & I went in for the 3rd time the lady said we would just have to go the the McDonalds in West Branson. \"Sit and have a sundae or something.\" I wanted to ask if she was buying but refrained. So we drove in to West Branson twice just so my daughter could keep up with her class. Our last night there we lost power to the cabin. Luckily, we had packed some flashlights & my husband was able to find the fuse box & flip the breakers. There were 4 of us in a cabin that can supposedly be occupied by as many as 10 people. If they didn't have enough power to support us, how in the world could 10 people stay there?! I was very upset by then & called the office. Of course, they were all gone for the night so I left a message that we were unhappy with the accommodations & the loss of power was just the icing on the cake & left my cell phone number for them. Nobody ever contacted me. We are not a wimpy family. We camp & hunt & fish & hike & we are not opposed to roughing it. That's not the problem here. The problem is that this place was advertised as kind of roughing it with all of the amenities, in a beautiful & relaxing setting. That was the vacation place I was looking for & that is why I booked it & I feel like I have been swindled. We paid almost $800 for our 3 night stay at this dump & all I can say is that I'm happy that we did have some other good times in Branson or this vacation would have been a total disaster.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed Our Stay\u201d", "Author": "Craig O", "ReviewID": "UR134536298", "Content": "This place is not perfect but a nice place to stay.

When we were finally able to get into our room (the key didn't work well, as the dead bolt was busted, and the door handle moved around in the door) we walked into a dirty kitchenette with at least an inch thick of dust covering the entire place, and spiders (dead and alive) all over the kitchenette, living room, bedroom, and bathroom. Unidentifiable bugs (ones with over 6 legs had a nest in our fireplace (not milipedes or centipedes.) The fridge was broken, so the $100 worth of groceries we purchased before coming spoiled. We had to run the dishes in the dishwasher on \"sanitize\" before using because they were full of dirt and dust.The remotes to the T.V.'s didn't work, and our beds were blood-stained, not to mentioned the sheets obviously hadn't been changed!! And this is all just our first night there! My husband talked to the front desk the next morning and kindly asked them to fix the issues (I can be a firecracker if I feel deemed necessary, so we opted he do the communicating), They said they would \"try to do the best they could\" so when we came back from the lake that afternoon, there was a repairman working on our fridge that obviously didn't have our door shut while he was working - we spent the next hour killing over 40 flies. When the repairman left, it was obvious he never fixed the fridge, but managed to break our dishwasher when he pulled out the fridge to \"repair\" it. Another guy then came out about an hour later to \"repair\" the remotes to the T.V's, and said that we just needed new remotes, but he never returned with any, so we were remoteless. That second night when I was reading a book (on the nasty couch that I put \"clean sheets\" over just so we could sit down, my husband walks into the kitchen and has to stop in his tracks and reaches for the fly swatter to kill a spider on the kitchen floor as big as his fist. That night when we were sleeping, around 1am I awoke to something crawling on my neck. I quickly jumped up brushing my neck frantically, then my husband jumps up, and grabs his phone and uses his flashlight app on it. We didnt see anything on the bed... because he was still on me! I felt him crawling again, and started flailing about (funny to think about now) and beating my neck/chest and finally went to the bathroom to shake my clothes out. My husband comes in with a funny look on his face asking me if I found anything. i told him no, and then he proceeds to tell me that it didn't surprise him becuase there was a pile of bug guts the size of a quarter on the bed with legs all over (one found on my PJs.) My husband was furious now. That night I tried getting a few hours of sleep on the nasty couch while he searched for a new place for us to stay. The next morning he went back to the office and when the front desk people saw him walk in they said, \"what's wrong now?\" and when he told him what had happened that night, they said, \"your neighbors aren't having any problems.\" Wow. So I guess the wasps out on the deck preventing us for enjoying the lake, all the bugs, dirt, cobwebs/spiderwebs was just a figment of our imagination. We weren't asking for much - just a clean place to stay so we could save a few bucks by cooking in a kitchenette, but instead this place ended up costing us more than just the $1200 for the 6 days we stayed, not refunding us one cent for the 4 nights we didn't even stay there and the spoiled food.

I stayed in a 2 bedroom condo, (which was within walking distance to the lodge.) I had visited their website and spoke to staff on the phone and was expecting much more than I got. 1) Room was clean, but dated. Green marble tub was ok... but the dark green towels were not. I prefer my public towels to be washed in bleach please :) 2) The \"heated pool\" that is open all year long is a joke. It is outside and was covered and not very warm. 3) The \"5 hot tubs open all year long\"... well, I only found 2 of them and they are not kept warm on a consistant basis and the jets are not very powerful at all. 4) When I walked in the game room, I felt as though I stepped back into the 70's, but it wasn't a cool experience. The games were old, the ping pong table only had one paddle, and the machine that was supposed to have ping pong balls to purchase was empty. 5) Don't expect a stocked kitchen. There wasn't even salt and pepper and when I asked for it, I got it, but not without a lecture about how they don't supply any food items. 6) We never got our mid-week housekeeping service that the paperwork said we would get, and we were lucky to get clean towels. (you have to hang them outside in a specific place by 11AM. Half the time we weren't even awake by 11:00.) It was nice to have 3 tvs and both bedrooms had a DVD player. The beds were comfortable enough and there was even a bed that pulled out from the wall in the living room. When all this stuff was new, I bet this resort used to be a fabulous place to stay. Now, it is simply a run-down resort on the lake. During the summer, it would be a great place to stay if you like boating on the lake.

Actually, we didn't even stay one night it was so bad I took the loss of $200 from my deposit. It is very old and outdated. It smelled horrible! The \"floorplan\" of the room on their website makes it appear that there is more room than there actually is. When you stepped in the door you are immediately confronted by the first bed right up against the window and AC unit (which isn't completely sealed from the outside) you take a couple more steps and are confronted with the two twin beds that are right on top of each other. The beds were hard as a rock and crackled every time you moved. The TV was hanging on the wall at the head of the second twin bed where not only can you not view the TV very well, but if you get up quickly you are apt to hit your head on the corner and wind up needing stitches. My husband tried to wash his hands in the bathroom sink and let the water run for a while, but it didn't get warm so I was concerned about hot water for showers. There were cobwebs everywhere, the light switch didn't work. We turned the heat on to try and warm up the small room. I was a little concerned about leaving it on while we were out because it was so close to the bed and the air came out so hot I was afraid it might start a fire. However it was so cold we did it anyway. When we came back a couple hours later the room was still chilly and the heating unit was off. Needless to say, it didn't matter at that point since we decided to leave. In the end we ended up forfeiting the deposit because we couldn't stomach the idea of staying even one night. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. For the amount of money we paid it wasn't even close to being considered a 1-star place. Additionally, the staff initially tried to tell us we were forfeiting all our money (including the amount we paid upon arrival) even though their receipt clearly states the policy of keeping the deposit. They eventually did refund us the amount we paid on arrival and we ate the deposit.

We made our reservation at the log cabin. We got our keys and went to log cabin number 16. We opened the door and the cigarette, old musty smell was overwhelmingly DISGUSTING, NASTY. The inside was indoor/outdoor carpet, the mattress was covered in plastic, and the one mattress we could see was the VERY OLD blue/white stripe from the 1970. The sink in the bathroom was held up by a board pained white. The \"bed\" was in the front room with a red coach next to it. Both had cigarette burns on them. Words cannot really describe the disgusting smell, nauseating. We went back to the office and they said they could move us to a \"new condo\" --- there were two other families requesting different rooms also. . . the office staff did not seem shocked or surprised that so many people were requesting room changes. . . it appears this happens frequently. We moved to the condo. . . which is across the street from the office which is housed in a VERY VERY VERY old mobile home. The condo looks much like the picture, but much older, very worn, smelly - very \"used\". The same \"red coach\" furniture was in the condo that was in the log cabin. NO TOILET PAPER, NO PAPER TOWELS, one VERY SMALL BAR OF SOAP. The towels were very worn. The mattress was \"better\" but still at least 10 years old and still wrapped in plastic. The frig was dirty on the inside - I did not even open the oven or the microwave. AGAIN -- THERE ARE NO NONSMOKING ROOMS at this facility. THE CIGARETTE SMOKE was rolling in through a connecting door into our condo. It was totally overwhelming, gagging. The walls are very thin and we could hear the conversation in the next room - as well as their \"bathroom\" noises, water running etc. The walls were dirty, especially over by the gas fireplace. The bedding was the old hotel style. The parking area was nasty gravel, that was dusty. There was not enough parking; we had to park down a hill with large concrete slabs that had metal bars sticking out of them, which was obviously a danger to children. The structure was in bad need of staining - bare wood exposed everywhere. The overall appearance looks like they ran out of money during the build job and just quit. No landscaping, concrete slabs with metal bars, junk lying around. Looking out the sliding glass door, the backyard had a 4 foot hole with the telephone box in it - this was open and exposed - very dangerous to children. Again no landscaping, nothing was cozy or homey. It looked like a building project - that was started possibly 10 years ago and never finished. The lady in the office told us we would be very happy in our \"new condo\". We never saw the \"new\"!!! The whirlpool was covered in a pink stain - maybe from the water. It was separated from the wall and had a very old shower curtain. The only road going to Indian Point is the same one that goes to Silver Dollar City. Therefore, you have to wait in line (which can be up to 2 hours) in the Silver Dollar City traffic to get to Indian Point. The nearest grocery store is a Wal-Mart about 30 minutes away (in light traffic). Now for the best part - the condo was CHEAPER per night than the log cabin -- woo hoo -- however THEY DO NOT REFUND YOU ANY MONEY IF YOU 'DOWNGRADE'! You have got to be kidding! The room was 125.00 a night - INSANE! We would never recommend this to anyone - it was wretched. Please heed my advice and stay clear of this disaster. IT WAS NASTY --- ALL IN CAPITALS!

We all stayed in the same two bedroom condo. Everyone was very disappointed with the accommodations. If we would have gone by ourselves, we would not have stayed one night in this place. Let me start with the good. The Docks: While we were there, a new dock was being built. There are four docks (I think) and they are all in very good shape. The Maintenance workers: When ever we complained about something, the maintenance staff attempted to attend to it quickly. Extras: This is kind of a good and bad. A basket was on the counter with lots of snacks and little boxes of cereal. There were some cinnamon rolls provided, but they expired the day we arrived and were covered with cream cheese frosting that no one trusted to eat. Now the bad. Dirty: From the start, we noticed that the place was dirty. The carpet was dark blue and had stuff all over it. I did not trust the kitchen counter and cleaned it with bleach wipes. The first wipes came up black with grunge. We ended up cleaning most of the kitchen and living room before we settled in. Any and all art on the walls had layers of dust on them. Mold: There was a jacuzzi type tub in the master bedroom. It had red and black mold around all of the jets. The shower curtains were covered in black mold. Grease: The outside grill's grease trap had entirely spilled on the patio. We called maintenance to clean it up. A friendly man came by, poured what appeared to be dish soap and water over it, wiped it up with a couple paper towels and left. Hardly any of the grease was cleaned up. We ended up buying cat litter and pouring it over the spill. HVAC: We noticed that there was a lot of dust bunnies all over the place. After a couple days, my sister in law noticed that there was no furnace filter. All of the vents were covered with lint, dust and nasty stuff. I do not have allergies, but ended each day with a bad headache. I am assuming that the air quality was terrible and caused the headaches. Broken Items: One of the toilet tank covers was broken and had sharp edges, one of the knobs on our armoire came off when pulled, most of the vent levers were gone and there were multiple burned out light bulbs. Cobwebs: Most of the lights, vents and curtains were covered in cobwebs. Dirty Ceiling fans: The blades of the ceiling fans were filthy and we had to clean them before using them. There were other minor issues that, on another vacation, would have caught my attention more. The condo looked like it was probably nice when first built. The wall paper was aligned perfectly, the furniture was sturdy and probably looked nice when first bought.

Later, I started looking at reviews of the location and was devestated to say the least. I called every resort I could find on Table Rock Lake and could find no others with availability. In a panic, I called the office and spoke to Marsha. I explained my concerns to her having 12 people planning on coming and reading reviews that horrified me. She assured me that she would be working during the time we were scheduled to stay and would help me in any way she could should a problem arise. We traveled the 5 hour drive anticipating the worst scenario. TO MY SURPRISE we arrived at an older but well taken care of property. We found our condo clean, good water pressure, beautiful view of the lake, brand new boat slips and very clean grounds. We cooked every meal for 5 days in the kitchen and found everything we needed. We washed numerous loads of laundry in the washer and dryer that was inside the condo. We had 12 people showering 1-2 times per day. I assure you, we had ZERO complaints. I don't know what the other people who are writing reviews are expecting in a lake property!!! These are not brand new units, BUT they are taken care of.

First let me say that the staff seemed very friendly and that we did not complain to them because we had already paid and decided to make the best of it. The pool was fine though not maintained like it should have been. That said, when we first arrived the spots are not well marked and the one we had in no way shape or form was level. My husband spent at least an hour leveling out the camper with jacks and blocks. One entier side of the camper was off the wheels and just on the jacks! Sure we had our own little deck, but it overlooked some trees with a transformer and a bunch of electrical equipment.

And there was about a 10 foot drop off on our site. We have a 3 year old girl and she couldnt even play unless she was right in front of our camper. The playgrounds were a joke and she didnt even want to play on them. It advertises lake access. Yeah, if you want to swim off the docks. We wound up paying a daily pass fee for the campground right across the street to swim and let our daughter play on the nice playground. The water pressure at the sight was terrible and every faucet sputtered and spit unless it was on full blast. The trailers that were set looked very old and worn down and I was suprised that people were even staying in them. No rules were enforced. There were animals wondering around and some people with barking dogs all day and night. We didnt even attemp to go to the shower house or restrooms. They looked broken down and nasty.

The answer is the resort has a wide range of accommodations and a huge difference in quality. It has been built over at least a 30 year period, maybe longer. It is very spread out with a very rustic and well worn landscape. We stayed in a new, built in 2006, \"Deluxe Studio Condo. [--] The room was clean and had a great view. I requested a good view when I booked the room and I got what I requested. It was a nice size with a king bed, queen sofa, table and four chairs, gas fireplace, TV, and VCR. There is deck with a great view, with a table, two chairs and an electric grill. It is a second floor (top floor) walk up, at the top of the hill. The unit has a large whirlpool tub that my wife enjoyed. We stayed 3 nights. There is a another bedroom adjoining this unit that can be locked off, so it could be a two bedroom unit, but the second bedroom would not have a lake view. It basically doesn't have a view as it looks out onto the access deck for the floor and the parking lot. Linens were not good quality, towels were changed daily but some were frayed and all were average quality. The refrigerator made way too much noise. The room is heated and cooled with a typical, motel type, through the wall air handling unit. As is usually the case with these units, it was noisy. The unit exhausts onto the small deck over looking Table Rock Lake. The view is great, but the experience is diminished by the noise and the hot exhaust air from the air handling unit. The air handling unit sits under the window so it obstructs any lake view from inside the unit. So you get a good lake view when standing up inside but none when you are seated. There are two swimming pools, one a 3-4 minute walk away next to a group of small cottages built probably in the 1960s. Another pool is an 8-10 minute walk down the hill next to the Lodge that is probably about 20 years old. (I don't think we would have liked staying there. They don't appear to be very well maintained although we did't go into any of them) The pools appear to be very, very average, although we didn't use them. There is a large covered boat dock near the lodge, about a 10 minute walk from our condo. There are boat rentals available. There appear to be plans for a \"Club House\", pool, and recreation area next to building we stayed in and there are more units being built.

The swim platform ran the length of the dock, and you could see some of the fireworks from celebration city at night. You also had a great view of the Chateau and the Dam. The room was O.K. It was clean, with the exception on a lamp that needed dusted on top. I think the room had been smoked in as the smoke odor was quite strong, but i can not hold that against the staff as i did not specifically ask for a non-smoking room.

CLEAN - The unit was reasonably clean, except the electric grill on the deck, which was a grease bomb inside and out. Towels were exchanged by hanging them in a bag on the hook outside the door. There was no daily cleaning - it's a condo - and that was fine, as we don't like someone prowling our room when we aren't there. SERVICE - We had booked online, and check-in was a breeze. Later bought tickets for Dixie Stampede at resort office, and the ladies were very helpful on which roads to take, etc. Checkout was a breeze as well. Very nice folks. THE ROOM - Good size main room, with view thru trees out to the lake out windows or from deck. Nice and functional bathroom with tub/shower. The beds were fine, the couch comfy, and the dining table a real pleasure, as it was big enough for us all to sit down and eat together -- hard to do in a hotel room. Kitchen was well equipped and handy. OUTDOORS - Saw deer, racoons, and lots of squirrels from the deck. The lake is down a short grade -- it's good to have sandles or watershoes for the walk, as there are rocks, stickery plants, etc. The swim dock is basic, but great fun -- just a deck area at the end of the boat dock, with a ladder to climb out (or I'd still be in the lake). We didn't have a boat, so don't know about boat-related amenities -- looked like a nice dock setup, though. Table Rock is still Table Rock -- warm, greenish-clear water, and one of my favorite lakes anywhere. LOCATION - Nice spot. Minutes to Silver Dollar City, with no traffic until you get to the parking lots at SDC and meet the cars coming from Branson. It worked out great to come and go with such ease and so quickly. (kept me a Happy Pappy). With the new roads in and around Branson, you can really get into town and back more easily than I had guessed ... but we were there during the week before school started, and I think the crowds were down quite a bit. I still have flashbacks of nearly running out of gas during a hour-long, half-mile drive-and-sit on 76 a few years back, and this trip was much easier traveling. VALUE - The condo wasn't cheap, but it wasn't bad considering that we'd need two hotel rooms to replace it, and that we were able to easily prepare our own meals several times, and reheat Take-n-Bake pizza we grabbed at the Mart on the way in. BOTTOM LINE - Good setup for a family, especially if you have a boat (or rent one), and I would stay here again with the kids. If it were me and my wife alone, I'd probably go to the Chalet (or actually, I'd probably go to Colorado).", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat condos\u201d", "Author": "crynay", "ReviewID": "UR7573376", "Content": "Really well equiped condo that had everything you could need, fireplace, electric grill on porch overlooking the lake, club house, games, books, 3 tvs. Also very clean.

The name of their RV park Trails end is appropriate, because when you get there and see the terrible condition of the RV park you will think that you have reached the end of the trail. I pull a 30 foot fifth wheel, and I had hoped to stay in branson at a nice clean secluded place in the ozarks next to the water. Where I stayed at instead was a nightmare, and WARN ALL RVer's to stay elsewhere. 1st problem is that their rv sights are no where near level, and making your RV level on this surface was a challenge, second is they do have pull thrus, but it was impossible to pull thru them because of steep banks on all sides, I had to back out and look for another spot as the front desk personel gave me a map and told me I was supposed to be in #7 a pull thru but if you cant fit there then here a few more spots you can try, and boy I struggled but finally got in #12. This goes to show that even the desk clerk even knew it would be a challenge, when she pretty much told me wherever you can park it that is vacant is yours. Now the biggest problem with this place is the road in the RV park are in such need of repair there are so many deep chug holes and ruts that it ripped off a gas propane line under my hot water heater. Second is it just filthy nasty, the only view I had was of a shotgun trailer that was falling apart with no skirting and trash under it, and the view on the other side was of more trash a a septic tack lid. There is no cable TV here but It did not matter because I brought my satellite. Also if you come at night good luck there is no lighting here to speak off, and none of the rv sites are provided any trash cans. I am a active RV'er and I am a Semi truck driver as well, and I can say for certain that I have never had as much trouble parking any of my Big Rigs as I did my trailer in this HELL Hole. RV'ers should pay close attention to my review, if you are like me and appreciate easy access, smooth roads and a somewhat level parking pad in a nice setting then AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST's your investment in you RV is worth much more, than to park it at this landfill, I would recommend Silver Dollar City Campground, or Compton Ridge as suitable places to stay other than Indian Points/ trails end rv park.

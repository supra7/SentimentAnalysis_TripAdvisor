It was not close to any events or site-seeing (wells fargo center for concerts, liberty bell, downtown, etc..) . I guess the first hint should have been the \"No Refunds\" listed on their site. Most places will give you up until a certain time to cancel without cost to you. Quite frankly my safety and comfort are more important than the refund and chose to eat the cost (albeit I cancelled in the a.m.) Please do your research and check the reviews before reserving in this hotel so that you do not get into the mess I was in upon arrival.

It is NOT reassuring to guests that every parking space has a sign that reminds them they are not responsible for stolen items. It also is not too reassuring that there IS a huge bullet proof glass that separates you from the clerks. I do have to say though that I did enjoy my stay there. Me and my friends books rooms there for the new years and we got there early to check in, I am glad we did. The first room we were told was our has a HORRIBLE vomit smell, like one that somebody got drunk and puked in. We walked in the room, and then walked out and requested a new room. The clerks and staff were very nice and immediatly gave us another room and showed it to us, and even asked if it was ok, and offered to show us other rooms if it was not satisfactory. The room was clean, and I have no complaints. Our room did have an alarm clock, and i beleive it is standard that all of the rooms have one. The heater worked well and did not smell, and the bathroom was clean however I did not use the shower. I also recommend this because the clerks were very nice. Me and my date were going to a party and were supposed to have printed out our tickets at home. I did but she did not, so after we realized this we asked the clerks if we could use the internet. The clerk took us into their break room/office and let us print out our ticket. They were very nice with the limited english they spoke (maybe it was their accents, but very nice and receptive). They also hired a night time security guard since there is nothing keeping random people from walking in and going into the hotel. All in all I recommend this place for business trips, but not pleasure or family outings.

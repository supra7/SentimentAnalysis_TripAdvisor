This \"is the best\" Courtyard I've ever stayed at. The only other downtown Courtyard that even comes close is the Courtyard in the old historic building in the French Quarter in New Orleans. The San Diego downtown Courtyard hotel is in a 12 story historic office building on Broadway. The bottom three floors was a bank (complete with a huge walk in vault) and the upper floors were all offices. The hotel is walking distance from the popular GasLamp Entertainment District and one block from the downtown trolley system. Unlike most Courtyard hotels, this hotel has a full service restaurant, (as well as room service), and a bar - gathering area in the huge open lobby. Marble columns, marble floors, and wood accents are found all through the building. My hotel room was on the 12th floor and was actually an office at one time. All of the high tech hotel accessorials in a historic marble and wood piece of history. You need to check out the \"Volvo Meeting Room\" that is inside the old walk in bank vault. (yes, the original vault door is open next to a nostalgic row of wood enclosed telephone booths). To top off my stay was the attention to detail and outstanding service from a terrific enthusiastic high energy hotel staff.

I often stay in nice hotels because of conferences: 4 Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Montage, St Regis... While the properties are different, I can say that the employees here were on par with the aforementioned locations. I do not hesitate recommneding this hotel and location. The building is quite interesting because it is an historic building - previously it was a bank. They kept a lot of the architecture and it is beautiful. The rooms are well appointed and the hallways are memorable because of the architecture. The sub basement where the workout facility is was previously the location for the bank's vault and safe deposit boxes. The different areas were turned into meeting rooms - awesome! The location was originally a prime factor in choosing this location and it did not disappoint.

It took a few attempts to find the hotel bc of all the one way streets, but we were pleasantly surprised when we did. The hotel is a great old bldg that was formerly a bank. The lobby still has the old teller stations which is cool. The big lobby and bar reminded me of the older, historic Hilton locations, but at 1/2 the price. The lobby staff and valets were super personable and helpful. We opted to park off-site for a lower rate, but they didn't give us attitude about it. The room was really big and clean and the king size bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was huge and clean, but there was some funky water pressure, pipe squealing with the shower. However, not enough to be an issuer, just annoying for anyone still trying to sleep. The only downside was in the morning there were homeless people all over on the same block as the hotel, that I either didn't notice the night before or the police clear them out when people are out in the Gaslamp. Important note- this hotel is right next door to the House of Blues. When we got back to the hotel around 11pm there was a big line of people waiting to get in wrapped around the hotel, but it wasn't an issue getting in and we heard zero noise from the show in our room.

We went back to the front desk, and got put in a room on the 10th floor. When we walked in, the lampshade from the lamp on the desk was sitting on the far side of the desk, as opposed to on the lamp. Doesn't housekeeping check a room before it is assigned to make sure it is all together?

This staff is extremely friendly. The seem to actually like their jobs. I only ate one meal in the hotel, breakfast. While the wait staff friendly and the food OK delivery of the meal was slow. It took 20 minutes to get my breakfast and there was only one oer person in the restaurant at the time. Being on the edge of the Gaslamp area you literally have hundreds of places to choose from in a few blocks. Eat elsewhere. The night I stayed the room rate was cheap for the value but we all know rates fluctuate. I may have been there at a slow time. There is only valet parking which though comparable with other hotels in the area it drives me nuts to pay over $30 to park.

I shrugged it off and figured I'd say something about it when I checked out (thinking I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe they'd discount that night on my room bill) - not even close to the case.

As far as downtown San Diego hotels go, the Couryard is in a decent location.

As far as the hotel goes - the lobby is nicely converted from the old bank and my room was fairly large. The valets were friendly and the front desk staff were professional. The bed was fine, not great, and the bathroom was large (if you need a large bathroom?). Unfortunately, the complements stop there - I stayed for 4 nights but only allowed my room to be serviced once because on the first day of service the staff who cleaned my room ate some of my food, spilled it on the floor of my room, and failed to clean it up after their feast. I was a bit disgusted and could not eat the remainder of my snacks I had purchased and kept in my room, but I immediately opted out of cleaning service to avoid any additional intrusions into the privacy of my room. While I informed the front desk of the hotel, they said they would note the issue both after my first day in the hotel and upon check-out. Also, paying $30 a day for parking in San Diego is absurd. There is a parking lot on every 4th corner, but since so few people use that parking they allow homeless people tent cities to flourish and then they charge outrageous prices for those unfortunate suckers (like myself) who require overnight parking and convenience.

Not even a tiny bit to let fresh air come in, and the room smelled like it had been closed for ages. The smell had transfered to the bed linen and towels too. Moreover my room had a horrible view on an tiny backyard...really not worth looking through the window. Don't know if it's worth asking for a city view though, because broadway has quite a lot going on at night and it might get noisy. It also got noisy on the Saturday night when I woke up due to a couple of girls screaming either in the next room or corridor :-( Fortunately someone else was quicker than me and told them to be quiet and it stopped.

Sometimes a beautiful setting can be ruined by poor service, or one employee's bad attitude or lack of tact. But this Courtyard, at least in December of 2009, employs outstanding and cheerful workers who are efficient and carry themselves with poise that matches the glorious building. We were given one of the suites with a jacuzzi tub right in the room. Fabulous. Even the mattress was a tad more comfy than most Marriott beds. One problem was the huge bathroom door which opened up with its entire face directly against the nightstand of the bed. The problem was that the door jutted out further than the table. So, I was concerned with getting bruised at night if I got up in the dark. If you're not willing to search the neighborhood for street parking, you will have to pay $24 for valet parking service per night. One rainy December evening after rounding the neighborhood a few times, we did just that. On our checkout morning, I glanced at the floor by the door for the receipt, which is often slipped under it.

This CBM is not like others in the chain. It was a former bank and many of the architectual details have been woven into the hotel. The front desk uses some of the old marble teller windows and the hotel restaurant uses the high arched lobby as its setting. The vintage oak doors to the bank offices have been retained for use as the hotel room doors - definitely a nice distinctive touch. The elevators have classic brass doors, too. One little detail: from the reception desk to the elevators, there is a small staircase of 4-5 stairs. No way around it and it makes for an odd bit of ergonomics. Too many to fling your bag down but too few to stow the rolling wheel feature to carry. Being at the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter provides a good buffer from the noise of the nightclubs yet allows easy access to the nightlife. Valet parking is the only option - at $24 per day, it is not the cheapest but you have unlimited in-and-out privileges. Give the guys about a 15 minute lead to fetch your car and you'll be fine.

Though we were initially disappointed to find the Marriott properties near the convention center fully booked, we were completely won over by the brilliant staff and the unique beauty of this historic property. Despite having over 200 rooms, the hotel is reminiscent of some of our favorite small boutique hotels in San Francisco, Europe, and the UK. This is unlike any other Courtyard in which either of us have stayed, partly because of the uniqueness of the building itself, but largely because of the excellent staff. For the duration of our stay, at all hours, nearly every staff member we encountered was warm, friendly and helpful. Having arrived late, we dined in the bar the night we arrived. Our meal was very good and the service excellent. We also had drinks in the bar some evenings and thought the atmosphere congenial and relaxing. We had the full breakfast buffet a few times and found it a good value. The omelets (made to order) and fresh fruit were first rate, and the coffee was excellent. There was a reasonable selection of milks, yogurts, cereals, and breads (though the quality of the bread & pastries could be improved). As is the case at any buffet, the hot items were a bit soggy if they'd not recently been brought out from the kitchen. Our suite was spacious and spotless. The bed was comfortable, and having a mini-bar and microwave was lovely for a long stay (there's a Ralph's grocery store approximately four blocks away). The hotel offers free internet access (wired in rooms, wireless in lobby), a nice gym, and excellent complimentary coffee in the lobby (in the morning only). The hotel is located roughly eight blocks from the convention center, an easy walk for most people. It's about the same distance to the Maritime Museum. Balboa Park is a bit further away, and the park itself is quite large, so people with small children may wish to take a cab. One can find homeless people, buskers, pan handlers, and drunken conventioneers in the center of any large city in the world. San Diego is no different. I walked to and from the hotel day and night, alone and with my husband and never felt unsafe or threatened.

We did not have much expectation from this provided our past experience with another Marriott (at Biscayne Bay, Miami). We arrived a little earlier than normal check-in time (around 2 pm) but the lady at the front desk let us check in without any question. She also later helped us redeem a Marriott Gift card (for some reason it was not activated by the issuer). The room was clean, large and nice with free internet and TV. Our remote was not working but one phone call was enough to get it replaced. We didn't order any room service, but the maid-service was excellent. They took extra care to make stuffs organized. The parking option in Gaslamp Quarters was limited so we had to go with valet parking (a whopping $24/day). The hotel itself didn't have any parking lot, my guess is they park the cars a few blocks north of the hotel. Anyhow, the price will seem reasonable once you stay in that area. Most hotels charge similar. As others have already mentioned, even if you're not staying in this hotel, just peek inside to see its interior decoration in the lobby. You won't be disappointed. The hotel was originally a bank and they have kept the original tellers and original roof intact. The hotel is conveniently located near many restaurants (some of them are best in San Diego), trolley station ( one block north at 5th Ave) and convention center (20 minutes stroll due South). We were tired on the day we arrived and decided to eat at the restaurant at the lobby. To our surprise the food was really good (or it could be that we were really hungry :)). The price was very reasonable, although the service was a little slow. The breakfast was not as good and you can have better breakfast elsewhere. I felt this was the only shortcomings of this hotel. However, there are so many good restaurant nearby one might not want to stay inside the hotel for long. I suspect this was the only reason they don't advertise their food so much. One reviewer mentioned about safety issues near the hotel. We did not have any problem during our stay. The area is well lit and we walked in and out of the hotel late at night without any fear. So if you don't want to book a car, that's absolutely fine. The MTS and trolley systems are pretty good in San Diego. Yes, there is an adult store just one block south of the hotel, and yes 6th street has less buzz than the 5th but its not scary at all! There are many restaurants in the nearby area but I will just mention a few very close to the hotel. For breakfast try Sixth Avenue Bistro. They make the best French Toast in my opinion. It is located just two block north of the hotel and right next to it there is Mama Gucci, which is voted the best Italian restaurant for lunch. A few block south on 6th avenue there is Chopahn, an Afghan restaurant, known for its kabobs. In general you'll be very happy with the City of San Diego itself, the hotel is just a part of it.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood Choice in Central Location\u201d", "Author": "NYCandworld", "ReviewID": "UR12174029", "Content": "I spent 2 nights there earlier this month.

I went on Orbitz, Expedia, and Priceline and the average price was $379 this was high in my eyes but I figured I would venture away from the Starwood hotels that I normally stay in when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in SD, so I called the hotel and tried to work out a lower price. Eventually I did.. I was able to get the room for under $200 and thought I was getting a STEAL for a SUPER luxuries hotel. Well.. I was wrong. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we walked over to HOB to ask the security guards how early we needed to be in line the following day so that we could get front row seats to our concert.. while talking to him we ran into some fans of the band that were spending the night in line to ensure they would get front row seats.. we overheard a conversation where the police were telling the crowds that the street behind them was the MOST DANGEROUS street in San Diego and that it WASN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T safe for them to be out there overnight. We started looking around and noticed that there were prostitutes and druggies all around.. that area by the trolley is VERY bad at night and not so great even during the day. Apart from the surrounding areas I was also very unpleased with the hotel itself. The lobby area is nice and the fact that it use to be a bank is interesting but the rooms are AWFUL\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I have never been in a Motel 6 but I assume that the furniture would be similar to what we found in our room. We had what was supposed to be two Queen beds but in reality they were 2 twin and a half beds.. 2 adults could fit snugly in them but not very comfortably and they were as hard as a rock.. I was REALLY missing the comforts of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heavenly beds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the Starwood hotels provide. When we checked in we tried to confirm the 3pm check out that was promised to us over the phone but a not so nice women informed us that she could not guarantee the late check out until the next day and that we would have to call in the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but on a positive note we only had rudeness on arrival.. during the remainder of our stay the rest of the staff was cordial. Valet is $25 which is average for the area, if for some reason you decide to stay here PAY IT.. you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be walking around this hotel as a lost tourist. If you are young and looking to party I would recommend either The W or The Ivy.. if you are looking for a nice clean comfortable room in a GOOD area near Gaslamp and all other SD attractions I would definitely go with The Westin at Horton Plaza.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sun City, CA", "Title": "\u201cperfect location\u201d", "Author": "steph92586", "ReviewID": "UR10088366", "Content": "Spent Saturday night, October 13th, at the Courtyard Marriott in downtown San Diego, at the corner of Broadway and 6th, at the edge of the Gaslamp.

Upon check-in, the hotel discovered that they had erroneously given out all of the queen-bed rooms .... so they upgraded us to a KING SUITE!! We had fully expected them to upgrade one of their \"full-pay\" customers, moving them to a king-suite, so that the \"Priceline\" customers could have the less expensive room. We were pleasantly suprprised. We rec'd 1st class service from everyone .... front desk, valet service, waiters in restauratnt, and bartender. They have free coffee in the lobby in the morning (no continental breakfast) and they have computers with free internet access, also in the lobby. This is a beautiful old bank (built in 1928) that has been wonderfully converted to a hotel - with all of the original marble floors, walls, columns, and polished brass fixtures, and lovely chandeliers. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on - - no lumps or dents and plenty of pillows. The location was all we hoped for .... we were within easy walking distance to all kinds of restaurants , bars, shops, and the trolley-stop was at the opposite end of the same block down from the hotel, or the bus-sop was another block over. Since we were only going to be in San Diego for about 24 hours (prior to our cruise) we wanted to see as much as possible in a short period of time. This hotel was in the perfect location for that and by using the available public transportation you can avoid costly parking fees in an area that has limited parking available.

All members part of the wedding party and family stayed at this hotel. We booked 6 months in advance a two bedroom suite. We were originally very excited to stay at this hotel from all the reviews and pictures. When we got to the hotel and shown our suite we were EXTREMELY disappointed. If you do stay at this hotel, please avoid room 214. the carpets were stained and unevenly placed. The furniture and kitchen was very outdated compared to the other suites in the hotel. There was no washer/dryer in this suite as well (very important if you're planning to stay for a while). The A/C was incredibly loud, we had to sleep with all of our room doors closed that's how loud it was. Since the wedding party stayed at this hotel, we visited many suites which were beautiful and had a great view. We were given a very outdated and old suite which we did not understand why due to the fact that we were all paying the same amount! We did complain to the manager, they did nothing for us however did include 2 bottles of wine in our room for our inconvenience. They did not adjust the price at our check out. I will never stay at this hotel again and advise travelers to know that not all suites look like the ones in the pic!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johnston, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cservice\u201d", "Author": "Leslie B", "ReviewID": "UR125354263", "Content": "I had the opportunity for the first time to stay at the Mutiny Hotel in Miami Florida.

We weren't necessarily in Miami as tourists, so I can't say much about access to ease of getting to more touristy locations. The staff was very friendly, the rooms are operated like a hotel room - it was cleaned each day (later in the afternoon - our preference), and they offered room service and the front desk and doorman was always available. Our room was very clean - the kitchen and living room are an added bonus to an amazing price we scored. Some of the appliances were a bit dated, but for the price, location, cleanliness and overall comfort of the room and building it was a minor problem.

WE JUMPED SHIP!!! This was to be a \"special occasion\" weekend and I made certain when booking the reservation months ahead, that the person in charge understood our desires. A Deluxe 1 Bedroom Suite was not close to DELUXE nor was it SWEET. I asked for one of the nicest rooms with updated bath and kitchen. I was told no problem. Needless to say the kitchen was dreary and the bathroom was absolutley non functional. There was no place to put your toiletries - I had to drag a chair and place it outside the bathroom door in order to have my supplies close by. The door was in the way of getting to the sink and the same held true for a bedroom closet - there was an end table in front of the closet door making it a chore to open. The mattress need replacing and the furniture was not at all what you would expect in an upscale, boutique hotel. The not so sweet suite had a good view but it was hard to get comfortable and had a sound system that had to be at least 20 years old along with 4 old channel changers to work it. Maybe it was this particular room/suite but even so, if these units are privately owned there should be a standard for the prices that are being charged. One another note...since we bailed out of there quickly, by accident, my husband left behind his cell phone plug and I can not find two garments I had with me when I unpacked....hmmm.... I called and spoke to security the following day to see if all was recovered. His reply to me was that we left the door open when we checked out,(which we did not) and that there were now other occupants in the room, therefore they could not get in to look.

I was easily able to access the internet both in my room and poolside. Nothing like working by their pool in it's lush tropical setting. The feel is so intimate it seems like you are in the backyard you would like to have! But best of all, and most important of all was the staff. WOW! Kind, courteous, friendly and willing to do what they can to accommodate your needs. Oh, and I left out the most important quality of all...........HONEST! Upon returning to the hotel one evening, I inadvertently left my wallet in my car when I left it with their valet parkers. I didn't realize this till then next morning. Needless to say I was panic stricken. I called to the front desk and they had the car pulled up for me. I looked for it on the seats, under the seats, in the glove box... I found nothing. I returned to my room a bit depressed over my stupidity. Moments later, the phone rang to inform me that the valet manager had found the wallet between the door I hadn't opened and the seat. They brought it up to the room, not only was everything in the wallet, it hadn't even been opened. I can't tell you how relieved I was and how impressed by their care and concern. I am returning again in October with a group that is holding a huge fundraiser for Alzheimer's Disease. The Mutiny is our official hotel and one of the sponsors for our event. www.birdstock.info They deserve and have earned your business.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cgood value for a suite\u201d", "Author": "cndnpride", "ReviewID": "UR115940911", "Content": "After readying all the reviews we were very nervous about coming here.

In one instance, they told my husband they were calling a cab for him and 30 minutes later when my husband checked in they said \"oh yeah we couldn't get through.\" There is no laundry service on site and when my husband asked if there was someplace that could press his tux for the wedding, we were given a number for a local drycleaning store - that was out of service! When we asked for brunch recommendations, the concierge said that \"there were good options - just walk around.\" As well, our room was next to a taller condo that had lights on all night and there were not curtains to block out the light.

We stayed at the Mutiny because it was located in Coconut Grove and the rooms were listed as suites. The one bedroom 'suite' we got was smaller than some hotel rooms. We had a full-size bed in a room with only a nightstand - no room for a dresser or chair or anywhere (but the closet) to put our stuff. The living area had a huge kitchen table and a sleep sofa. But had a big square entertainment table in the middle to put the little flat screen t.v. on. Better use of space would have been to put the t.v. on the wall. Sleep sofa had old sheets on it - nasty. No chairs to sit on except for 3 kitchen chairs that only could fit at the table. The chairs were metal scraping on the tile floor. Kitchen was ok - no dish soap to clean dishes. The cold water handles to the faucets in the bathroom were not attached to the sink or bath tub. There was not a fan in bathroom either. In the bedroom there was not a vent for ac - so we had to prop open the door to get air which defeated the reason for booking a suite, so that my son could stay up and watch t.v. The hotel was full so we could not move. Valet parking was $21.00 per day. Charged for internet. Didn't have bill ready on check-out even though I spoke with front desk the night before. Wedding there on Saturday - took up pool area and lobby. The hotel has apartments - lots of people with dogs - one even humped my leg. The hotel could be okay if before you accepted a room - to go look at it before. Typically I do not put up with problems, but my son had a meeting at UM and we were in a rush to shower and get to the school. The 'business center' computer was slow and the printer did not work - free to print boarding passes, but costs if you need to do anything else.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead", "Title": "\u201cGreat location rooms are not the ones you see on the website\u201d", "Author": "denningr", "ReviewID": "UR85270104", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 days with my family.

Parking options were not sufficiently explained to us by the Front Desk. There is a parking garage adjacent to the hotel that is shared with the hotel valet parking.

The room was more towards the front of the building, and the view of Biscayne Bay was great. We were higher up on the 8th floor, and it felt more elegant. The furniture was newer than the first room, and was more comfortable. However, we have a few comments, which basically apply to both rooms: 1. The televisions are very small compared to today's standards. A 13\" television in the bedroom? A 13\" television is good for the kitchen, or the bathroom. 2. There was only one DVD player, not in the Bedroom, but in the Living Room. The DVD player was not connected to the television; we had to connect the wires ourselves. 3. The (small) television in the Living Room was located on one end of the space; the sofa was located on the other end of the space. We had to rearrange furniture accordingly. 4.

He said the Mutiny would pay for us to stay at a nearby hotel for the night and to walk there (no offer for help with luggage). He said to come back in the morning and promised there would be a room the next night since I had prepaid reservations and they had to accommodate us. When we got to the nearby hotel there were 4 other guests from the Mutiny that were sent there too. At 8am the next morning we went back and a different front desk clerk said they were still overbooked so we would have to stay at the nearby hotel again for that night. I asked for more information but he dismissed me and said the nearby hotel had all the information that I needed. Again no phone call was made to let me know there was no room available for that night's stay; I only found out when I returned to check in person. The next morning was the last day of my reservation so instead of walking there in the heat I called to check. A different front desk clerk answered and said she didn't know anything about my situation, so I explained and she said she would have to check with the manager and someone would call me back. An hour and a half later I called back to get an update and the same clerk said they were still 'working on it' and that someone would definitely call me back before I had to check out of the nearby hotel for the day. Half an hour before checkout time I called again and she said they 'hadn't forgotten about me' but that they were still checking and would definitely call me back. I had to ask the nearby hotel for late checkout because the Mutiny still didn't have an answer for me. The 4th time I called I was finally given a manager to talk to who said he didn't know anything about my situation and he said he would look into it and call me back. I told him I had heard that before and he said that I hadn't spoken to him before so I should expect a callback from him in 5 minutes. He called back 10 minutes later and said to checkout of the nearby hotel and walk to the Mutiny, and things would be sorted out when I arrived. I told him I would rather know if I had a room before carrying my luggage over there. He said the Mutiny had other guests that were sent to other hotels because of the overbooking and that I was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclucky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because some of them were sent to hotels closer to the airport, and I should be grateful that I was within walking distance. When I finally did get a room, the bedding was torn, stained and worn, the pillows were thin and yellowed and the curtains were ripped. The closet door couldn't be opened all the way because the nightstand was in the way. The furniture layout was crowded and cramped. Fortunately the bathroom was clean and had nice toiletries. When I checked out the next morning the front desk clerk refused to give me a receipt since the room was prepaid and there were no new charges. I asked him for one anyway and he said there was no point since it would have no balance and he walked away. There was no offer to help me with luggage and no offer to call for a taxi.

I traveled with my mother and gave her the bedroom and I stayed on the sofa bed couch. It was not very comfortable. Another problem is that you could hear everything in the room next to us or so I thought, my mother believes someone came into our room.

The queen sized bed and television stand practically filled all the available space. The bedspread looked shabby and not very clean.The living room had a cooker,microwave, fridge, small eating table with two chairs and a sofa bed. The furniture was scratched chipped and of poor quality. The sofa bed looked old and worn .It sagged in the middle and must have given anyone who slept on it bad back ache.

I needed a fun March Break Vacation for my wife and myself and we settled on Miami and wanted some place relatively quiet. Mutiny Hotel - is lovely - furnished nicely, rooms are great and the suite concept is wonderful. It is impeccably clean and I liked that the pool area had some shade. The Concierge and Bell Captains were polite and very helpful. But there were some problems. I booked a room on-line at a very reasonable rate (read, cheap). I have done that before with large chain hotels and never been penalized by my room selection - either for an upgrade or slotted into less desirable rooms. At the Mutiny, I was. They sell off their less desirable rooms to on-line services and hence the more reasonable rates. Their cheaper rooms are located at the back of the hotel near a large (10 storey) parking garage. Our balcony looked onto it from the kitchen and we were on the 8th Floor of the hotel. At the back of the hotel is the service elevator and garbage chute which can be a bit loud given the walls in the hotel are a bit thin. Some of the Clientele was also an issue. This hotel seems to be popular for pre-Cruise stays in Miami. Which wasn't a problem for most of the week, but one day a large group in the hotel were marshelling in the corridors to get ready for their trip - - - at 6 am. The walls in the hotel are relatively thin - and it was loud. Housekeeping was also an issue. The service cleaned very well and were very polite - - - but I consistently had to ask to have our suite cleaned at 4pm. We tip housekeeping, and my expectation based upon other hotels is that most rooms are normally cleaned by that time in the afternoon. At the Mutiny - it did not seem to be a priority. Coconut Grove is small but cute, I can recommend: Cafe Tu Tu Tange - Tapas style - inexpenssive lunch Senior Frogs - lower cost mexican cuisine - good food, nothing fancy Cafe Med - in Coco walk - doesn't look like much - excellent \"american\" fare and excellent service for lunch - great prices. Le Bouchon du Grove - French Bistro - make a reservation - well cooked, acceptable service, wonderful atmosphere - standrard Bistro fare. Jaguar - new just opened - civiche a speciality - south american cuisine excellently prepared - adventerous palate required. Had shrimp three ways - one with a piri piri suace - very well done Green Street - best pasta dish in while - all boulevard seating, reservation recommended, see and be seen eatery. Very nice. Le Moulin de Grove - crepes a specialty - wonderful spot for a breakfast or lunch Bacio Gelato - very well done Italian gelato creamery - dont order a large it is filling ! :) As you can gather - food is the biggest draw in the Grove...", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHuge suites for a reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3287742", "Content": "My husband and I had just 2 days in Miami after a cruise and wanted a central location that wasn't A. scary (like downtown Miami) or B. loud and expensive (South Beach).

Instead of 2 bedrooms, we were issued two rooms with one bedroom in each. Our party had 6 people. We went up to our rooms on the third floor (which we were told by desk staff they had a view of the bay), and found they overlooked the garbage cans, trees and parking garage. After complaining to the office staff, we were informed that a mistake was made and there was nothing they could do. In fact the reservations manager (on vacation) told us via front desk staff to go to another hotel if we were not happy with our room. Great customer service. Not! We asked the hotel manager, who didn't come in until the next day, to find us a better room. He said there was nothing he could as they were booked up and the hotel next door, who had nice views, was booked. We knew this wasn't true as the Hotel Sonesta next door had rooms when we asked. The only thing he could do was give us one night free. The damage had already been done and staying there a few nights looking at garbage cans was not the highlight of our trip. Never have we been treated so poorly at a hotel and we would not recommend this place to anyone. They are not honest and do nothing to satisfy their customers. Plus their ad says that all rooms have \"city views or bay views.\" That is a joke. Our room was $259/night for a garbage can view.

The valet guys watched me struggle the whole time without even opening my car door. This was a one off, however, and though annoying, I certainly didn't base my overall opinion on the incident. Teh Suite (1bed, king) was very comfortable, though on the smallish side. We didn't have a balcony but that was okay with an aspiring 18mth old crawler in tow. The pool area is very pretty and great for young children. They make a mean 'rum-runner' drink in the bar that you can obviously drink poolside. Teh Pirates bar was decent, nothing amazing, but fine if you are hungrey and can't be bothered to drag yourself away from the pool in search of a restaurant. The hot tub is divine and close to the pool so you can watch the kids easily. The pool is supposedly heated but wasn't very warm. Apparently, if you tell the front desk they will warm it up. Location is unbeatable. A block from Cocowalk and next to a playground. The Mutiny is decorated beautifully with plenty of beautiful people about. Great for families, plus the young free and single bunch. Paid $159 + tax, parking a night, got upgraded from jr. 1bed to full 1bed. with washer-dryer off teh kitchenette.

I said, I'm sorry, that is not my problem, I would like bay views, as I promised my party. They then moved me to a different room, which had the same view, and then asked me to pay $20.00 for the upgrade. The whole time, they said the manager would be back, and then said she was gone. They said they were booked, (which wasn't true according to the bellhop and another employee). They put excuses after excuses and had me wait for 45 minutes where they then miraculously found a choice of two rooms, (despite the fact of being booked, ha ha, in low season), which miraculously had bay views. Of course they only offered this to me and not my other guests. I found the customer service to be rude and they also lied to me throughout my questions of what was promised. I would certainly not recommend going to somewhere that blames everyone but does nothing to rectify the situation.

Check in was very interesting as all parking is underground. When we pulled in, I parked in the first available spot (which was two levels down) then found out you cannot get to the one elevator without a room key. Pulled all the luggage up two levels to the lobby and check in was fairly quick. The room was noisy (ours was along Santa Monica Blvd) and the person on the floor above us apparently walks around in combat boots at all hours of the night. Breakfast was the standard HI eggs, sausage, cereal, bagels, etc. All of the rooms open into an open courtyard and I never had a safe feeling staying here. For over $200 a night (parking is extra plus all the taxes), I would stay somewhere else even if it meant driving an extra 15-20 minutes to where I was going.

After arriving home (2,000 miles away) I notice that they have not put our money back into our acct...I believe in cleaning up behind myself so we left the room clean, towels in a pile all trash in bags..ect....So I call these people and they tell me they took our money because we smoked in the room...Did I forget to mention WE DO NOT SMOKE!!! The manager told me they smelled smoke so there will be no refund wow!!! These people know that people like us are not going to come back 2,000 miles to see them face to face about our money.

But even with a corporate discount, a standard room at this hotel still cost $125 a night with parking extra. The rate is not super expensive but considering it is a HI Express, it is a bit on the high side. I overheard the front desk talking on the phone saying the regular room rate is $199 and I was absolutely shocked! Location. I agree with many reviews here the immediate area of the hotel may not appear to be most ideal. This property sits in the middle of a working class neighborhood right by I-405 so definitely not as posh or appealing if you have West Hollywood or Beverly Hills in mind, but it really is not that bad. I decided to try street parking and walked a number of times to my car never even felt once unsafe. Plus the hotel is so close to LAX, Westwood and Santa Monica (each about 5-15 minutes drive away) and there are also a number of shops and restaurants nearby. So convenient that I simply can't fault the location too much. Hotel facility. Yes the easiest way to enter the hotel is through garage on the side (called Beloit Street) but the main entrance is indeed on Santa Monica Blvd. Once you are in, you will find the hotel to be quite clean and nice. Some reviews mentioned this property looks more like a high end motel which I agreed with due to its layout and building structure but not really a problem for me. I requested a quiet room and was given a top floor double room facing the courtyard. The room is your standard H.I. guestroom with nothing special but it does come with a refrigerator (which many HI Express do not) and a brand new LCD TV. A well-designed desk and sitting area makes the room rather functional. Bathroom is clean and tidy as well. There is also laundry and gym facility on site for guest use. Breakfast is served daily at the courtyard area on the 2nd floor - standard continental breakfast with sufficient food items to choose from. I do wish the breakfast hours can be longer though (6:30-9:30) as it gets very busy from 8:30 on. A couple issues I had with this hotel. First, the bed is hard and somewhat difficult to have a comfortable sleep. The other problem is that walls are thin and you can hear noise from the adjacent rooms. There was a group of college students checking in during my stay (apparently UCLA had some kind of tournaments taking place) and some of them were quite noisy in the early morning hours. Not much you can do about it but worth considering if you are picky about your sleep quality. Overall I will give this hotel a 3.5 star rating for the stay and will consider returning again especially if I have meetings in the nearby Westwood area. I normally stay at West Hollywood but find most hotels in that area are either overcrowded with tourists or simply way overpriced in recent years. This hotel will certainly be a good option for me.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cAnother Decent HIE, Good West LA Location\u201d", "Author": "Tat3r", "ReviewID": "UR119642139", "Content": "This is a standard HIE, but has a good location in West LA, right on the 405 (i don't like that road).

The upsides - are lots especially if you are using it as a base for working: - friendly helpful staff at all times - free Wifi which works first time (although it also pops up a Boingo sign in which costs and needs to be avoided - I was aware of this, but it was irritating) - nice size room spotlessly clean, and that extends to the bathroom which positively glistened - and had good bathtowels and nice if unfancy toiletries (no dispenser bottles) - comfy bed with nice linen and lots of pillows and pleasant decor - efficient AC - the \"continental breakfast\" which included 2-3 different hot dishes everyday, plus cereals, a range of fresh bagels, toasts,hot cinnamon buns, juices and fruit, plus coffees, teas, hot chocolate. And a lovely lady who looked after us every morning - a real bargain at this price - in the reception a range of fresh coffees plus hot water for tea and chocolate all the time; plus fresh oranges and apples - and in the afternoon fresh baked cookies of various types - and there was also a coffee maker in the room too - the room also had a full sized fridge to load with your own food and drink, and a large CRT TV (did not try it out so no idea what the quality was like), plus a good radio alarm and lots of wardrobe and storage space; also lots of power outlets in useful places (too many hotels fail on this) - there was also plenty of secure parking which appeared to be free for residents (although a sign in the reception suggested it was $7 a day.. but then had small print that contradicted this - slightly odd ) - has an amazing looking cinema just a couple of doors away, and shops across the street (7-11 type but nothing special - just good enough to get bits and pieces for the fridge) So great for work for a few days - and if you are not fussy about location a bargain in my view. If I am working at the same location again I would stay there - and recommend it to colleagues.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gurgaon, India", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "fanishsingh", "ReviewID": "UR72424570", "Content": "Great value for money , good ambiance ,comfortable rooms and above all friendly staffs", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange, California", "Title": "\u201cHotel is fine, but...........\u201d", "Author": "JHROrange", "ReviewID": "UR69815727", "Content": "I live about 50 miles south of West Los Angeles. As I had appointments two days in a row in the area, I decided to spend the night at the Holiday Inn Express off of Santa Monica Boulevard. The hotel is fine (although my room did not have a closet to hang clothes, odd). I agree with the breakfast reviews and, yes, ask for a room away from the freeway. I had Room 322. I woulld also suggest you stay off of the second floor as the breakfast area is located here. It is outside under a tent, so I would think noise could carry. They have a fan setting in the room, plus I always bring my white noise machine. I slept fine. The front desk clerk was very helpful. Now, about the area... 1) I could not figure out how to get into the hotel. Literally, you have to turn on a street called \"Beloit\" that looks like the freeway entrance to the 405 and make a quick right into the hotel. They told me they were going to charge $7 for parking per night, but when I checked out, it was not on my bill. 2) Yes, there are restaurants, a 7 -11, and a Subway within walking distance, but there are LOTS of homeless people. Did I feel it was dangerous? No, but it was creepy. 3) The traffic was horrific in West Los Angeles (Wilshire, Santa Monica Blvd). The nearby freeway location is actually good as it can take you more than 30 minutes to drive two miles to the 405. Also, if you want to go into Beverly Hills or Westwood (UCLA) to eat you will constantly be looking for parking and shelling out lots of money for it. In two days, I spent $33 to park in three different locations. 4) So, in summary, the hotel was fine for where it was located. It is the city of Los Angeles that is completely inept in not having any kind of comprehensive public transportation system for its citizens and visiiting tourists.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "ttna", "ReviewID": "UR67917852", "Content": "This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

We loved going right next door to watch movies. There is a Subway sandwich place and 7-11 right across the street and a few decent restarants within one block. It was about 15 minutes to Hollywood Blvd and about 30 minutes to Universal Studios. Also, the Santa Monica pier is pretty close. This hotel is upgraded nicely for an older building. Although near a busy freeway on on a busy boulevard, I did not hear much traffic noise in the room. The room was a good size and I loved the built in benches along the wall by the window. I wish we could have opened the drape all the way but in only opens in the middle. The desk was a good size with a nice plug in on the top of the desk for your lap top and/or to plug in a phone charger, etc. The hotel also has free wi-fi but we could not get it to work in the room so our usb cable came in handy. The tv was decent, not huge but decent. It was great to have a fridge in the room but there was no microwave. The bathroom was pretty nice and clean. There were a few minor flaws that the front desk seemed happy to know about. I waited until our departure as they were really no big deal. The housekeeping staff did a great job cleaning the room. It was even clean under the beds! The worst part of this place was the breakfast. We had to scrape the cheese sauce out of the mini-omelettes as it tasted like a bad copy of the cheese they use in kraft mac and cheese and it was very watery. The day they has scrambled eggs, they were super salty. The room is very cramped so it is hard to get your food if there are more than two people in there. The eating area is spacious but outside under a tent like area. The only fruit they had were bananas. They also had ok cinnamon rolls, toast and bagels, cereals, juices and coffee. On the day they had scrambled eggs they also had biscuits and gravy. On the omlette day they had sausages. I guess it was ok, but really they should omit the cheese sauce as it was probably the worst I have ever had. I never checked out the fitness room and there was not hot tub. But the desk help was excellent and they helped me right away with my requests every time I called them.

The rooms are nice, clean and modern, with a very comfortable bed, and spotless, spacious bathroom. There was a refrigerator which is always convenient. They even left nice touches like chocolates, a greeting note, and a bag with snacks and water. There is a free 'express breakfast' in a central courtyard which is nice to have, a selection of yogurt, pastries, cereal and a couple hot items like eggs and bacon or sausage.

The rooms come off an open courtyard, so be aware that you may be exposed to the elements a little when you go to your room and to the covered breakfast area (we had bad rainstorms that week.) The free parking in a small underground garage is a real plus, because it's so much easier to go in and out at your leisure instead of waiting for valets and worrying about tipping and fees. The location is a bit unattractive, on a stretch of drab commercial roadway, but it's right off the 405 freeway which makes it great for driving off to other locations. (The Westfield Century City mall is convenient, only 2 miles east down Santa Monica Blvd.) There is some road noise given its location but you can try to request a room that faces towards a parking lot in back instead of the main street. The walls were a bit thin so you could hear doors slamming and some talking; but one great option is to turn on the low fan on the wall heating/cooling unit.

If you like a nice lobby do not stay here. There is virtually no lobby. If you like a nice breakfast forget it.

But after entering the room I was relieved to find that everything was in good order and it was obvious that the room had been renovated. The beds were very comfortable with nice white sheets and 4 fluffy pillows on each of the 2 queen beds. The bathroom was clean with a good shower head. There was some traffic noise from Santa Monica blvd (busy street) but it was kind of like background noise and didn't bother us too much. There was Wi-fi in the room so we could use our PC in the room w/o problems. The people working at the checkin desk seemed to be tired and expressionless. Fortunately we didn't have to deal with the staff that often. We did request additional shower caps from our room and the person answering the phone said, \"I'll try to find them.\" Then he never sent them to the room. We survived without the additional shower caps though. The breakfast was typical continental breakfast w/ toast, bagels, and cinnamon rolls (which were only available on one morning during our 3-night stay). The area where you get your food items from was very small so it felt kind of cramped. But my biggest complaint was that the area where you sit and eat breakfast is in an uncovered and undecorated area w/ a few patio tables and chairs. It should've been OK except that it was always windy and cold (even in LA). So we had to bring our food back to our room to eat, where there was only 1 chair for the 4 of us! Overall it's a reasonable hotel room if you are only looking for a good night sleep. If you need extras like hot breakfast, pool/spa, etc., this is not for you.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Location With Many Options\u201d", "Author": "fulgum", "ReviewID": "UR10742138", "Content": "As anyone visiting L.A. has discovered, hotel prices can be outrageous to almost insane. That's especially true on the Westside. Having said that, there is one option that is actually a gem in the rough--Holiday Inn Express West Los Angeles. The West Los Angeles location is ideally located on Santa Monica Blvd and the infamous I-405 freeway. It's the perfect jump-off point if you are planning on driving. There is abundant subtarranean parking below the hotel with the rooms located on floors two through four. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. It was just me and the size was perfect. Two people would do as well too. The room was standard equipped with a very comfortable queen size bed, a desk for work or surfing the Net, high-speed Internet connection, if you have your laptop with you, TV with cable, a coffee set-up to brew your own and a good size individual refrigerator. I asked for a non-smoking room. The bathroom was a nicely designed, modern granite bathroom. It was nicer than some of the 'higher end' hotels I have ever been to. The hotel serves a continental breakfast each morning from 6:30 to 9:30 AM. For a continental breakfast, they serve a surprisingly varied number of items. In addition to the standard juices, they have bagels with cream cheese, hot cinnamon rolls, muffins, fruit, make your own oatmeal, hardboiled eggs and coffee. Those are what I ate. There were other things but I never got around to a second helping! The one downside....this intersention is notorious for traffic because of people getting on the 405, getting off and through traffic going to Century City, Westwood, UCLA or Beverly Hills. The building has clearly been soundproofed but you DO hear the traffic in your room during rush hour. It's not bad but if you were looking for a completely 'silent' room, this wouldn't be it. There are several benefits to this location: This area has a wide array of restaurants all within walking distance or a short bus ride away. Around the corner and 4 blocks South on Sawtelle Blvd is an area littered with Japanese restaurants, stores and markets. It's sometimes affectionately known as \"Little Tokyo West.\" There is a multitude of restaurants including ramen houses, sushi bars and Japanese fusion houses. Stand outs include: Manpuku (Japanese/Korean BBQ) and Chabuya (ramen). By no means are these the only standout places! West L.A. is also littered with wonderful Persian restaurants. Westwood Blvd between Santa Monica and Wilshire Blvd is sometimes annointed \"Little Persia\" for its multitude of Persian restaurants, markets, book stores and other types of related entities. You don't need to speak Farsi to browse these stores. All people are heartily welcomed to walk around. Stand out restaurants include: Shahrzad Restaurant (Westwood Blvd near Ohio), Darya (Santa Monica Blvd near Bundy) and Javan (3 blocks West of hotel). There are many more. Other locations for a multitude of restaurants include Westwood Village, Century City Shopping Center, Pico Blvd between Overland and Veteran, and Santa Monica Blvd West of the hotel are among the areas with large concentrations of restaurants. The hotel location is also well suited for those that want to get out of their cars and take the bus. Parking is very expensive in L.A. and the notorious congestion goes without saying. There are several bus lines, however, that'll take you to a lot of the major destinations: Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Line #1 East goes up Santa Monica Blvd and then takes you to Westwood Blvd, Westwood Village, UCLA-Armand Hammer Museum and UCLA. Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Line #1 West goes down Santa Monica Blvd tp Downtown Santa Monica, Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Beach/Pier and Venice Beach/Boardwalk. MTA Metro Bus #4 East to Wilshire Blvd. Catch a connecting bus MTA Rapid #720 or MTA Metro Bus #20 up Wilshire to Fairfax Blvd. This is the start of Museum Row and the Peterson Automotive Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), George C Page Museum/La Brea Tar Pits, Craft and Folk Art Museum. So, in addition to being a very nice and comfortable hotel, the Holiday Inn Express West Los Angeles is nicely situated at a crossroads of sorts to many of Los Angeles' most popular destinations. This review only covered a few of many throughout this region.

It's just off the 405, so getting there was a snap. UCLA is about 10-15 minutes away, depending on where you're going. (Driving, not walking.) Despite being just off the freeway, noise was no problem. I think it's double-glazed, and the aircon covers the little sound that gets through. I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It's a comfortable size, furnished with stylish modern built-in furniture, including a nice, functional desk. The beds were firm and comfortable. It was clean and well-maintained. The bathroom looked refurbished, with granite, tile, new shower-curtain, and Kohler fittings. From a practical standpoint: There is no closet and nowhere to hang a suit. I used the second queen-size bed in my room to lay out all the clothes that I would have hung up. There are big drawers under the TV set, good for clothes that can be folded. Unfortunately, they have been installed such that they tend to open if they're loaded. And I had to unplug a light to use the plug-point near my bed. Next time, I might bring a couple of hangers and some over-the door hooks. And maybe an ethernet cable, in case I get a room with bad wi-fi. And an extension cord. They had ample free parking in an underground lot with secure elevator access. The lobby is spartan, but the reception was pleasant. They told me I might need an ethernet cable but they were all out. As it turned out, in my room near the elevator, the wi-fi worked fine. They had coffee in the room and the lobby and a convenient junk-food/ water/ soda machine on each floor. I'd planned to stay at Hilgard House for this trip to UCLA, but they were sold out. They very kindly referred me to a few other hotels, including this one. I read the reviews, and found they were pretty favorable, so I booked it. On the whole, I was happy with this hotel.

After the first visit, he knew my name on site. I watched how he handled guest, made the hotel run smooth. Holiday Inn took over the hotel early in '06 from Best Western, and I suppose there was some mid-level corporate flak who decided he knew what was best - but boy did they blow it here.

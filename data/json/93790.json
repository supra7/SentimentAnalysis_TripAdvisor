The rooms and bathrooms were large. The kitchen was great. The staff was helpful. The ocean front price was reasonable. Wi-fi worked out nicely. Discounts at the bar (we didn't partake, but it's a good deal). Here are our concerns...all 3 of us developed allergies during our stay and found our room to be a bit musty. The AC unit is old and \"kicks on\" very loudly and often woke me up. The pool is behind the property off the parking lot (the photo on the website masks that very well), near the dumpsters. We did not use the pool because it was such a blah environment. My biggest pet peeves were the balcony and parking. If you value privacy, the standard oceanfront balconies will disappoint. You sit less than 4 feet from your neighbors, and we were unlucky to have a large crowd of smokers next door. We rarely used the balcony for this reason. If we stay there again, I would insist on a corner unit that would at least have only 1 neighbor, or the suite balconies which looked huge. Aside from the lack of privacy, the balcony was filthy and the management should SERIOUSLY consider new deck chairs. We had to bring a towel outside to sit each time. Parking is VERY limited at this property, so if you can't park in their main lot you have to park a block away. We had to park in the second lot one night and it's remote and not secure, not to mention inconvenient when you have luggage. If we return to OC, we will likely find a more updated hotel...but we would return here for a short stay knowing what to expect.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite OC hotel\u201d", "Author": "pmcc44", "ReviewID": "UR140238357", "Content": "This was our third stay this year and we just love it.

She gave us our choice, was very helpful and we are truly thankful. We also stayed at the hotel in June and had the best room ever (except it was senior week and if you're under 25 I would suggest a different time..lol) We're in our 50s but we had the Marlin suite (805 \u2013 I think) with an ocean front balcony and a huge side balcony than was the length of our room. Talk about wonderful!!! Nothing can beat it. Also location - location -location. Prime boardwalk with an umbrella stand right outside the hotel on the beach. Great if you love to people watch.

However, considering the amount of sand that we drug in from the beach, I can see how tile is a much easier surface for the cleaning crew to maintain over time. The overall rating I've seen on the internet for this hotel is listed as a three-star, I can't argue too much with that. To drill down more specifically, I would put it somewhere between 2-1/2 and 3. I believe that the criteria that work against the rating would be the fact that it is an older facility, and the weather at Ocean City I would think is brutal on any structure. The air-conditioning system was much louder than I would prefer, but the efficiency with which it cooled the room made it very tollerable. The bonus points that made our stay satisfying was with the extremely courteous and professional service that we recieved from the entire staff, the clean room, comfortable bed linen, and the use of quality towels in the bathrooms.

We were at the Sheraton in Norfolk and we were looking for a hotel in Ocean City because we were checking out and going to Ocean City that next day. We found this hotel and we loved the pictures because they looked so nice online. So we decided to book it. When we got there we pulled in and got our stuff out of the car. When we came in and were checking in the person at the counter wanted payment from us for our stay. My dad said \"well can we see the room first\". The person at the counter just told us our room number and seemed disgusted that we wanted to see it. We noticed on the floor we were staying on was smoke. We went down to upgrade our room and the manager had to come out and help the person at the counter. When we finally got up to our room we could find it but it was the wrong room number. We went back down to the desk and got the right room number. When we went into our room I noticed that there was a bar keeping the slider door from opening and no lock. I opened the door and saw lots of rusty gross staples. The only privacy you get is a divider . The room was nice but the T.V. buttons were broken so we had to use the remote. The floor was comfortable on your feet and the beds were comfortable also. If you are a family and you dislike smoke this place may not be for you. If you look closely from standing on the board walk you can see a big black spot up on the smoke stack wall.

In my younger days, I would stay back off the boards because it was cheaper, but now that I have a little one, it is prudent for me to stay on the boardwalk because it is just so much easier to get around with a little person. I was a bit skeptical of staying here because of some of the bad reviews, but we had a two night gift certificate so we decided to give it a try. First of all, I wanted to mention that although we had a 2 night GC, we stayed for 5 nights and the rate for the other 3 nights couldn't be beat for a boardwalk hotel of this caliber. Our stay was in early June, and we typically come in late June so I can't say for sure what difference that made. Usually though, we don't get away with paying less than $200/night, and our rate was less than this. The rooms themselves were bigger than any other beach hotel we stayed at. We did not have one of the luxury rooms, we had a regular side view \"ocean view\" room, but it truly was large for a regular beach hotel room. (We did get to see one of the more luxury rooms while walking by, and they are very nice!) The balconies were large and spacious, and the railings seemed very secure. The sliding door locks to prevent little ones from wandering out onto the balcony were excellent, which is so important for us. ALL of the staff were very friendly. When we needed new towels, they were promptly delivered to our room. The showers could use new shower heads, but that is truly the only thing that I didn't find excellent, and really, as long as I can get the sand washed off of me I don't really care all that much about that. Entry to the boardwalk was through the downstairs sunsations, which will give you a 10% discount for staying in the hotel...also some of the most friendly people you will meet. They knew me after being there for a couple of days and always had a friendly hello and smile for me. The other thing I wanted to mention as a positive for this hotel, as far as their management--we received this gift certificate as part of a work Christmas exchange, in which the coordinator of our resort exchanges hotel stays with PPI, and the gift certificate is given to one of the employees of our resort at our Christmas party. Knowing our coordinator very well, I know how hard it is to get any beach hotels to be a part of this exchange. Just the fact that this hotel was willing to participate is an awesome show of good business practice and we thank them for that. Also, on the GC, it said \"not valid\" and had written two dates, which were memorial day and labor day. When our coordinator called to clarify, it was said that it meant not valid only on those weekends. When I called to make the reservations, she said it wasn't valid between those dates, but when explained that she had recently said only those weekends, she was fine with letting us use it for the dates we chose (thank you GG!). Wherever the misunderstanding occurred, she knew that it was more important to keep a happy customer than it was to bicker over validity dates on a gift certificate, and because of it, she gained a family that will probably continue to stay at this hotel for years to come, that she wouldn't have gained otherwise. I can't say enough for this hotel. Good hotel, good, friendly employees, and good management.

An assistant manager presented and I told her for almost $300.00 a night I expected the floor to be vaccumed and the bathroom to be cleaned, also that if she could sleep on the pull out couch I would give her $100.00, otherwise I would appreciate a different mattress. Later in the day the room was cleaned but the mattress never appeared. Even though I consistently asked for additional towels, they were never left and always required a trip to the front desk.

I'm not picky, I'm not a person that needs the highest standards in the world to be happy. I don't expect to be treated like I'm the king of the world or anything like that, I'm a guy come on,...however, what I do expect, is to get what I pay for. We paid for an Oceanfront room(507) on the 5th floor. I will tell you my experience as it went. We paid all together around a little under $1000, to say from a thursday to a sunday again like I said on the Oceanfront which is always more expensive, so I wasn't complaining. So we check-in around 3-4pm-ish, and the lady was ultra nice to us, very skinny long haired black lady. Check-in was very easy going, quick and we got 2 room keys(which is all we asked for, you can get more I believe if you want). We used a hotel-truck to get all of our stuff in the room, which was very nice and easy. So we get up to the room, and immediately the view takes your breath away. VERY beautiful view, and then it hits you. Did I really just walk past this ridiculously small room to get to the view? This room honestly barely fitted the 2 queen beds we asked for, with an old style TV(however cable worked, so no complaints there). So 1st negative is how small the room is, especially because we had seen on the site that they have rooms with couches and such. But, we(my wife, son and I) aren't picky, so we were like ehh, no big deal. We had gotten a room with a jacuzzi, which I loved the jacuzzi, my fiance thought it could have been a little bit bigger, but otherwise she had liked it. The bathroom was simple, shower/tub/jacuzzi all in one, sink with nice size mirror, and simple toilet(lol). The room seemed quite clean, however we found a baby bottle under the one bed which did not belong to us at all. I myself hate when room service cleans my room when I'm gone, just a personal preference of mine, so I always put a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door at all times, even when we aren't there. I know that makes me seem picky, but I promise I'm not, I just don't like my personals around others, especially if I'm not there. So I usually request towels and sheets to be delivered to us via housekeepers, and we just do it up ourselves. The positives I will say are this: The jacuzzi was a decent future, the view is very dreamy/amazing. The exit is through a \"Sunsations\" store right onto the beach, was cool for us cause we like sunsations. The negatives (read closely, we have a lot more negatives, and this is detailed): Besides from the nice lady at check-in. Every other staff member was not very nice, however this is only from observation as we didn't really interact with them at all, nor did we need to. But we overheard them making fun of some of the guests as they left/walked by. For instance, the day we checked out, I was standing waiting for an elevator to go back up to the room, and the staff/desk workers were laughing that they were gonna tow this womans car that was a guest at the hotel if she didn't move it within 5minutes, as if they were getting some satisfaction out of it. It is one thing to tell someone they need to move their car or they will have to tow it, but it is another thing to just simply make a joke out of her and make her feel like an idiot. My fiance also caught them calling one of the guests crazy, because the guest/lady was simply laughing loudly and jokingly having a good time on her way back up to her room. Another negative would be the ridiculously small room. This is the negative thing that straight P!ssed me off. It was Saturday, my fiance, my son(1yr. old) and myself were beached out for the day(tired of being on the beach for the day) and wanted to still swim, so we decided \"hey lets go to the pool\" ya know, the pool at the hotel we paid almost $1000 dollars to stay at. We get there around 7:10pm, remind you its a Saturday. The maintenance/pool cleaner/rude old man/terrible worker/find him sitting around randomly throughout the hotel ...guy, simply said to us \"POOL IS CLOSED\", so I'm like \"what?!\", I though it closed at 8(even that was early to me), and he doesn't even respond, he just points to a sign that says 10-7, and the times are on a marker board, which they put up pool times I guess everyday. I am sorry, but if I pay that much money, AND you offer your pool as a great reason to come to your hotel, AND its Saturday, AND there is NEVER a lifeguard on duty(that alone I don't understand why you would close your pool at all), with all that, I don't think it should close at 7pm. That was ridiculous, and opened at 10am, so when we got up at 7am, we couldn't even enjoy a fresh jump in the pool. Am I stingy for these simple requests? I mean I'm not asking for tiled floors, or gold painted walls, or not even asking for a simple complimentary breakfast, just usual you would think common things. I would not recommend staying here.

From that very first call, through our entire trip to checkout, we felt we were treated as VIPs. Now, please understand, this is an older hotel and there is some wear (like a stained hall carpet - big deal) but the things that counted (the room, cleanliness, comfort, amenities, and staff) were first rate all the way. Our room was fantastic (805) with a deck and a balcony. The floor was tile and it had a small kitchenette. The view couldn't be beat and it was awesome sleeping to the sound of the ocean. The beds were extremely comfortable. The desk staff were very friendly and helpful, giving us advice on local fare, and the maid took extra special care. My question to people who complained about the maids: Do you tip them? or are you miserable and unfriendly yourself? These people were awesome. Parking was fine and the location on the boardwalk was excellent. If your the type to hang out at the pool, choose the ocean instead.

This was the only thing we could afford, and I wasn't really disappointed. Then again, we only stayed for a 2 night weekend trip. I'll rate it in the simplest terms: Pros: The location. It is literally right in front of the beach and not too far from the boardwalk. There's tons of places to eat and things to do around the hotel. The rooms were nicely decorated and had tile floors (a blessing considering the sandy beach right outside) The balcony (definitely get a room with an oceanfront balcony!) Cons: Not much good service (it's pretty much just a place to crash. Stay at the Hilton if you're expecting a place to eat continental breakfast and have room service) It wasn't the cleanest--there was tons of dirt and sand in the pull out bed, causing one of us to sleep on a chair, but besides that it was pretty clean It's not the prettiest hotel. The lobby is nothing but a little room big enough to let people walk through to get to the store (which leads to the beachfront) and a desk. We had a lot of trouble with the room key--it didn't work about 5 or 6 times Overall, if you're just looking for a place to rest your head in between all of your crazy adventures in Ocean City... the Paradise Inn is a cost efficient place to do so.

We just wanted to get away for the night and stay on the boardwalk in a nice room, so the high price didn't phase me at first. Check in went smooth. The front desk attendant was nice and we had no trouble checking in. Went back out to the car to get our bags, walked back into the lobby to a gaggle of screaming tweens (and this was at 10 o'clock at night, we had a very late check in due to work). We were tired and just wanted to go to bed. So after fighting our way through the crowd of screaming tweens AND their parents (BTW...GREAT parenting skills if you happen to read this, crazy cheerleading parents who let your little kids stay up and run the halls of the hotel until past midnight), we make it to the elevator and could hear the screaming all the way up to almost the top floor of the elevator shaft. Get to our room on the 6th floor and finally walk in the door. Room looked good at first glance. Floor was clean, sheets were clean, nice balcony. Then we walked into the bathroom. C'mon, really? I can understand that \"sometimes things get overlooked\", but how can you \"overlook\" almost black grouting in the shower? And on the floor? And the mold on the ceiling? That needs to be addressed before someone gets sick. I usually don't get really picky about these things, but for what we paid for ONE night, the room should have been sparkling.

They tell you it will be fixed in a day or so, but they really are assuming that you are only going to be there for a day or so, not an entire week. Given that some employees said the internet was down for months, this could probably be a sign that this hotel is not paying its bills. They let us use the conference room on the 3rd floor for internet access, which was a different floor than where we were staying. The internet connection we did get appeared to be from a neighboring hotel. One night while trying to check my business email, the conference room was open and we were told we could not have access to it because the owner had some guests coming in that night. I saw mattresses on the floor and it appeared the guests may be sleeping on floor mattresses. After seeing this, we did not feel very safe in this hotel anymore.

When they did not finish their remodel in time I had to find something else w/less than 2 wks notice. I called this hotel since they were close to where other family was staying on the Boardwalk. They had an opening, gave me a multi-night discount that came out cheaper than what the other hotel would have been. The room was considered Oceanside and we had a small balcony that was great. We could still see the ocean. The room had a small kitchenette with refrigerator, sink, microwave. It came in very handy...we went out and bought stuff to make lunches with to save $$ and had a nice area to fix everything. The bathroom was spacious. The room had plenty of space and the beds were very comfy. MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THIS ROOM/HOTEL WAS THAT WHEN WE RETURNED HOME **NOTHING** SMELLED LIKE HOTEL SMELL..if you know what I mean. I don't know their secret but I was truly amazed. The pool was not all that inviting. It was located in the corner of the parking lot. It was OK but not great.

The ice machine did not work so you would wonder around trying to find one on another floor that did work. The other couple that went with us , was even more disppointed then us , they did not get the balcony that was promised, they were put in a handy cap room , the bathroom sink hung on the wall with no counter to set anything, like your tooth brush and toilet bag. Their curtains were torn as well. The entire vacation was ruined by staying at this hotel for the money we paid. We paid $189.00 per night $60.00 a night would have been about what you got.We had to park our car a block away from the motel because they only had a small parking lot next to the hotel.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money you save!!!\u201d", "Author": "jld1031", "ReviewID": "UR73619513", "Content": "We stayed at the paradise plaza inn, a week ago.

Honestly I am not a snooty uppity person, but when you spend money on a vacation, especially when a hotel advertises themselves as a \"boutique hote\" it hard to overlook things. There were 2 elevators, 1 did not work and the other was very slow, parking was a complete joke, plan on parking in the overflow lot accross the street, and good luck getting a luggage cart. The pool, (not that you really need one in ocean city) was decent, just in a weird place... Wireless does not work, and from what I hear I'm not sure it ever does, so If you plan on doing business or using the internet think again. We checked out a day early with no refund because I needed internet for my work. The room was not dirty, not updated like the pictures, but not dirty.

Our lock on the safe did not work and the front desk was notified many times. The floor was very dirty and the beds sandy even on the first night. There was mold all around the jacuzzi tub, peeling paint and broken blinds. This room looks like it has seen a few too many parties and management doesn't care anymore. We often smelled pot both on our desks and coming through the air vents. Housekeeping came, but did a poor job. She pulled the blankets up on the beds, but didn't make them. She did not give us clean towels and she balled up the dirty bath mat from the previous night and threw it on the counter. Our trash was also not emptied. We had to complain and the housekeeping manager came in to clean it herself and she did a nice job, but it shouldn't take all of that. I have traveled quite a bit and have never had to complain about housekeeping. There was trash in the hallways throughout most of the day. There were a couple of loud party groups at the hotel and for 2 of the 4 days we often smelled pot. We booked the top of the line jacuzzi room and we did not get our money's worth.

I went down this past weekend with a group of friends for a bachelorette party. The hotel and room itself were very nice, the location was right on the beach and the balcony was enormous. However the service was the WORST I've ever had - and I've stayed in many hotels. First of all, we only had two towels, which is understandable for the first day. We called down and asked for more on numerous occassions. No one ever came. Our room was never ONCE visited by the cleaning service (though once again, we called numerous times) in the four days that we were there. I personally called down to the front desk four separate times. It was just ridiculous. We had only one roll of toilet paper and two towels for the three days before one of us just took what we needed from a maid's cart we happened to walk by on a different floor. Sad, but true. The internet connection was also not functioning, which I can be understanding about. There are problems beyond their control and I would consider WiFi to be one of them. Still - we were promised the connection would be back in \"15 minutes\" and it never worked on ONE of the four days we stayed. If they would have just admitted they were having problems with their wireless, I would have been bummed, but not upset like I ended up becoming. And to top it all off, about an hour before check out as we were preparing to leave, the breaker blew out in our room leaving us all with soaking wet hair and no way to use a blowdryer. We called down to alert them to the problem and were told they would send someone to flip the breaker immediately. When we left an hour later, there was still no power in our room. Overall, this was the worst hotel stay I've ever had. And as we were leaving, other stayers were sharing with us similar problems they themselves had with the hotel. The building itself is actually very nice, but with service like that, there are plenty of other nice hotels for the same price that would treat you much better.

A couple of things to keep in mind. If you want a pool this is not the hotel for you to stay at. We can swim back home, we came for the beach so that was not a problem. The restaurant on site was closed but you are steps away from many restaurants on the boardwalk. Balconies are very close to each other,but I didn't expect privacy right on the boardwalk anyways. The one complaint I had is that the rooms had tile floor. Very nice tile, but it was unexpected. If you have small children just learning to walk this could be a problem. It did make the rooms feel cleaner but a little less cozy, hard to keep sand off your feet. The air conditioner was a LITTLE noisy but it drowned out the sounds of the boardwalk at night for my young ones to fall asleep.

Not to mention that Ocean City is promoting underage drinking. \"Beer Bash Senior Week\", \"Drunk Senior #1 - Drunk Senior #2 - Drunk Senior #3\", etc. t-shirts could be found in any souvenir shop.

I was reading a promo email I received towards the end of August 2009 and came across some really out of this world rates for the boardwalk hotel. It was heading into the off season and The Paradise Plaza Inn was really wanting to catch peoples eye. I called thinking this was a sham but quickly was greeted by one of the nicest and friendliest voices I had heard in a long time. I was offered a Direct Oceanfront Room with Private Balcony, 2 queen beds, garden tub, water ( 2 bottles a day ) and coffee ( enough for four cups a day ) service every day in the room with the cups/sugars/creamers/ice bucket, 2 terry bath robes, and Bath And Body Works brand bar soap/shampoo/ lotions fresh everyday ( 3 sets each day left in the bathroom) all for the out of this world price of $59.95 a day due to the end of the season. I quickly grabbed it up and then figured out who to fill the space up with as far as friends go. The hotel had 2 rooms left at that point and they were on the smoking floor ( non of us smoke and I was really afraid it would be bad and smell but there was \"NOTHING\" that even made you think it was a smoking room). In the end, there were 3 of us to share the very large and wonderful room with lots of space left over for even more people if you were traveling with a family ( you could easely fit 3 children in one bed ). The hotel was more then I would have ever thought possable in person when we arrived. It was so easy to find, pleanty of parking with 2 lots but the lot infront of the hotel fills up really fast but they do have a very well lite lot right next to the hotel. I walked into the lobby and was greeted as if I knew them as family. The lobby is very small and can get really crowed in a hurry with the 2 elevators right by the door but the service is wonderful at the desk. We arrived at 2:30 PM and just wanted to see what to expect or maybe fill the time form our 13 hour drive in the hotel restaurant but instead we were offered to go ahead and check in without waiting until 4 PM without even asking. I just mentioned my last name to the desk and was greeted by my first name as if they knew me. We were offered a key card each so we could come and go when we wanted and sent to the elevator. We got off on the 5th floor ( all rooms on the 5th floor are smoking only ) and yes..it did smell of smoke since it was the smoking level but it was clean and neat as could be. My thoughts were still very clouded as to what the room might be like in the smoking section of the hotel and I kept very quiet fearing what I might have gotten us into. We arrived to our door at room 507 and when we opened it, my jaw dropped!!! I was hit right in the face by a view to die for!! From the moment the door swang open you were hit by a wall of glass patio doors at the other end of the room in your direct view facing right into the Atlantic Ocean with nothing in your way but the panes in the glass. It was amazing!! The room was so clean and not even one smell of smoke lingered. The bathroom was so clean and the towels were non stop, the hairdryer on the wall worker like a charm as well. They made sure you never were without. The water was so hot in the shower/tub/sink's that you had to turn it back some. The tile in the bathroom and at the patio doors was so clean and in great condition. The carpeting was very clean and my white socks never got one speck of dirt on them walking in them in the room. The little kitchen area was so well thought out. It had spotless cabnets over and under the counter, a bar sink, coffee maker, waist high fridge/freezer,and microwave mounted under the counter. All in wonderful condition and so very clean. They had 2 terry bath robes hanging in the little open closet above the safe and a really nice iron and ironing board just outside the closet area. The beds were great!! The mattress was just wonderful and the pillows were like clouds. Everything just spotless, in totally great repear, with more then you needed on hand at all times. The balcony was just amazing. We were so lucky to get the room next to the end of the building and the view was just to die for. In the reviews I read already they stated the place was filthy and the balcony a mess but we saw \"NOTHING\" wrong at any level with our service, room, view, balcony. There were no signs of smoking on our balcony as well. The 2 outdoor chairs were in great shape and repair. They were as comfortable as if you had them in your own backyard. The floor of the balcony was clean and swept. The glass patio doors were spotless from the inside but there is no way at all to keep them totally clean from the outside with the wind, sand, and spray. Anyone that picky should just stay home. The view was so amazing! Our neighbors were just as awe struck as we were on both sides of us. We never go to the restaurant at the hotel or the bar. There was just to much to do and we did not get the chance to see what they looked like. The hotel is in the perfect location. 9th street is right where you want to be on the boardwalk. There are 2 other places to eat under the hotel on the boardwalk and 2 shops selling pretty much anything you might be looking for at really quite nice prices from tee shirts for $3 to surfing stuff. Dairy Queen is one of the eateries and The Alaska Stand is the other with a very nice menu for all three meals of the day and don't forget The Candy Kitchen!! What a treat but I felt it was really high priced. The hotel only has the one way threw it to the beach other then having to go out the front and walk around the corner (which is no big deal ) but you have to walk threw one of the shops to get a direct walk threw the hotel out onto the boardwalk and beach area. The hotel does have a pool in the parking lot but I did not see any signs that it has ever been used in a very long time. It is small and they seem to keep the outdoor chairs stacked up nicely along the back for storage. I would not bother with it when the ocean is so close you could through a rock and hit it from the balcony ( just an idea ). All in all..I am going back next year at the same exact time and really will ask for the same exact room if it is available. October 5th-8th was the right time to go for total relaxation. If you have a family, I would go earlier due to a lot of the places on the boardwalk are in fact closed for the season. But there was not a lot of people to contend with, the places that were open were so friendly and kind, and we got a lot for really good deals too. The hotel was really our main attraction. We sat out on the balcony for hours and just enjoyed the view in the 74 degree weather ( you needed a light jacket in early AM and PM ). We could sit and see 5 or more blocks each direction on the boardwalk. It was totally relaxing and they made us feel right at home.

This hotel is old and run-down, it feels moldy and mildewed. We spent much of the trip worried that the place was going to fall down around our ears, that some sort of vermin was going to come out and attack us, or that we were gong to contract some sort of disease or illness. The bathroom had black mold everywhere. Under the sink there was visible dust and spiderwebs. No soap, slow-drain, mold and mildew. No movies available for purchase on the television. Mattress was stained badly, visible all the way onto the boxspring; we are really hoping it was only vomit not something even more noxious. Both mattresses were stained actually, as were the sheets and towels- ewww... Don't go unless you're current on all your vaccines and craving a real adventure. We had an infant and toddler with us and were seriously worried for their safety; we had brought plug covers for the electrical outlets to protect our baby, not necessary since the outlets were mostly broken or missing part of the plates. Other reviewers are right, tearing it down is the only way they are going to improve the place. It is scheduled for renovations but I fear what they will find when they get into the walls and everything. The restaurant/bar there is a pit, but actually had good burgers (I know we were taking our life into our own hands eating there, but it was storming out and we really needed a fortifying beverage). All that said, the view was beautiful, overlooking the ocean, the location was right on the boardwalk walking distance to all the attractions. The swimming pool was closed for the season obviously, but added to the overall haunted hotel effect with murky green water and scum rings.

I had narrowed it down to two hotels and ultimately chose this hotel. My first agenda was to ensure that the hotel had a pool, which was confirmed prior to booking the day before arrival. As soon as we entered the parking lot, we noticed that the pool was empty and closed. The registration clerk was rather rude about the situation and refused a refund. They offered the use of a pool quite a distance down the boardwalk., which would be very difficult for someone who is disabled such as I am. The location and view were nice, but the room itself was awful. The sheets were stained and the couch was so old and disgusting, it could not be comfortably utilized. The bathroom was okay except for the mildew on the shower curtain. The doors to the balcony were difficult to use, did not lock for security and worst of all....the curtains were full of black mold (pictures upon request). On our first morning we were looking forward to breakfast via room service from the resturant located in the hotel. They advertise their hours of availability from 7am-2am daily. We called fhe resturant from 7am until 11am (4 hrs) and ot no response. Finaly we called the front desk and were told that they did not plan to open until noon for lunch. Contrary to what they claimed to offer.... there was NO pool and NO breakfast!!! The people at the front desk did not seem to care one bit! I also believe our room was in direct violation of fire codes, as our main door stuck so badly that I was unable to open or close the door without assistance. Had there been a fire....I would have been dead!!! My teenaged daughter even had a very difficult time with the door The icing on the cake was after check-out. My daughter left her bathing suit and other personal items in the bathroom. I called the hotel and was pleasantly surprised to hear that her expensive swimsuit & other had been found. I actually started softening toward them because of their seeming honesty. My daughter had driven back to the eastern shore for something at Salisbury College, so I notified her and had her drive over to Ocean City when she was finished. When she got there, a different clerk told her it was a mistake and nothing was found in or room. I called a bit later to question and again got a different person that seemed to have knowledge of the original transaction. She said she had been told that my daughter had come by and was given her stuff. She said she would talk to hr manager and call back in 5 minutes. When she never called back, I phoned again the next day and sopke directly to the manager. He put me on hold to look into the situation, then had someone else get on the phone to let me knw that he would call back. He has never called.

We never would have chosen to stay here on our own given the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor, however we were in town for business and the hotel was paid for by the distribution company putting on a trade show at the convention center. We had an engagment in Baltimore the same night we arrived and had called ahead to make sure that someone would be avaiable to check us in. The lady who answered the phone said that there would be someone there and that she would make them aware that we would be arriving around 1am. We are not sure if that message was ever relayed. When we were a half hour or so from the hotel we called to find out where we should park. There was no answer at the hotel. We called steady, 4 or more times until we arrived at the hotel letting the phone ring dozens of times. No answer. After parking we entered the lobby. There was no clerk and no sign that anyone was there at all. We called the hotel's phone number to make sure it was ringing. It rang over and over again. We talked loudly, said \"hello!\" over and over with no sign of an employee. We looked around and found a brochure for the hotel and found an 800 number to call. We called this numer and a different phone rang, this one farther back behind the counter. Still no answer. About 20 minutes passed and we decided to yell as our last hope to get the attention of an attendant. \"Hello, is there anyone in this joint?!?\" at the top of my partners lungs finally did the trick. A young man hurried to the counter with blood shot eyes which he was rubbing hard. We said \"Taking a nap were we?\" in a joking way and received no response. Not \"I'm sorry\". Nothing. We were so tired, 2am at this point. We went up to our room, on the 5th floor, and found that were were given a room on the smoking floor. Neither of us smoke. If you are a non-smoker (or like one of us a former smoker) you know how offensive the smell is. We didn't have any fight in us an decided to make the best of it and get our 4 hours of sleep. The room was just terrible. The sofa cushions were all stained with huge bloches of who knows what. The refrigerator ran nonstop so we decided to cover up that sound with the fan of the ac which was way too loud. The door into the bathroom had to be forced open because it hit the toilet. The beds were hard, the pillows wafer thin, the sheets and comforter were rough, old and the lowest quality possible. Our sleep was not good, probably a combination of frustration and uncomfortable surroundings. At 6am when we got up we looked down beside the bed, now with more light, and found some potato chips and a pizza crust next to the night stand. We decided to pull out the night stand for the cleaning staff so they could get at the floor better. We checked out, this time the young man at the desk was pleasant and attentive. We did not have time to share our experience with him. If I had children I would never bring them to an establishment like this. Imagine if an emergency had occured and someone needed to contact you while you were staying at this hotel or if you needed assistance yourself while you were staying here.

We walk in and the laundry man is sitting on the bed watching tv with a cooler of what appeared to be beer.He started stammering, \"oh uh...shes supposed to call me when people are coming up...\" and scurried out of the room while gathering up empty cans. That was the only room so we had no choice but to stay there. After we settled in she comes back to tell us that our original room is actually vacant so we then move there. We drift into sleep and the fire alarm starts going off in the entire hotel and everyone evacuated and the fire company came. They let us back in because of a false alarm and we try to go back to sleep again. After another 1/2 hour of sleep we are woken to the alarm once again and the entire building had to evacuate AGAIN. By then it was 4am so we were fed up and packed out bags and left and went to another hotel. We were so upset and riled up that we couldn't sleep there either and figured that our whole upcoming day was ruined because it was 5:30am by then and we had had 1 hour of sleep so we probably would have just been dead at the beach all day, so we just drove back home.7 hrs of driving to go through that nightmare! To top it off I called the manager at 3pm after getting some sleep in my own home and he said he wouldn't refund anyones money becsasue it wasn't his fault if anyone left. So I hope that anyone who is planning on staying there doesn't have a problem because if he wouldn't refund our money for the entire hotel having to be evactuated twice in the middle of the night, chances are he won't refund for anything else.

I was apprehensive based on the reviews, but my sister had already reserved the room so there was nothing we could do. We paid almost $300 per night for an ocean front room. This was probably $200 per night more than it was worth. Granted, the hotel is in a great location, but as stated by other travelers, it was dirty and the hotel staff did not care. First, we were not able to check in until 4pm. I understand during the busy summer months that hotel rooms turn over rapidly and need to be cleaned. However, our room only had the beds made and towels changed, so I am not sure what took them 5 hours! Upon checking in, we noticed the room was dirty. The sofa/sofa bed was so stained that we put a clean sheet over it before sitting on it. The sliding glass door looked like every person in a 5 mile radius had smeared his/her hands all over the glass. The sliding door itself was broken so if you went on the balcony and shut the door, you locked yourself out. The draped were tattered. The tile floor had been swept/vacuumed, but not mopped. Don\u2019t look behind the bed; there are dust bunnies, hair, debris, etc. Clearly, no one has ever pulled the bed out and vacuumed the floor under it. Overall the room just looked dingy. Upon further inspection, we found remnants of soap in the shower from previous guests. The toilet paper spool broke off each time we used the toilet paper. The two \u201cspa robes\u201d that they provided were just terry robes which were dingy and worn. (The notice hanging with the robes offered that you could purchase the robe for $45!) The worst part came when we got in bed at 11:30pm. My bed had sand it \u2013 and we had not yet been to the beach! I called the front desk to ask them to send up clean sheets, telling her there was sand in the bed. Her reply was, \u201cOh, they must not have changed the sheets.\u201d Gross! I can live with the other problems, but not changing the sheets between guests is unconscionable. The next morning we saw the housekeeping staff in the hall outside our room. They were sitting on the floor talking. When we told them about the dirty sheets and asked for clean towels, it was evident that they did not care at all about the cleanliness of the room. It\u2019s a shame that this hotel is in such disrepair because it has a lot of potential and is situated in an ideal location. With a little TLC, the Paradise Plaza could be a great place to stay for a beach vacation. There are many other hotels in OC that are cleaner and/or less expensive.

It is a bit worn and could use a facelift. Everywhere you look there are signs of gradual and minor delapidation: small pieces of peeling paint and wallpaper, a ceramic tile that is cracked, shower curtains with flecks of mold, an ironing board that is obviously very used, lamp shades with smudges and breaks, worn carpeting, patio furniture that is a bit dirty (although white resin/plastic furniture does tend to get dirty), bath tubs that have obvious caulking repairs, dirty ceiling tiles, furniture of the laminate/veneer variety -- that have pieces of laminate/veneer peeling or chipped off, etc., etc., etc. The pool is small and seems to have been put in as an after thought. It is in the parking lot next to a dumpster, taking away valuable and much needed parking spaces. The hours seemed short to me, only open 10 am to 7 pm. That having been said, there was a restroom dedicated to the pool -- very convenient -- and the water itself was perfectly clean and comfortable in temperature. There was no odor in spite of being next to a dumpster (a wall did separate the pool from the dumpster). Towels were provided, there were ample lounge chairs, and the children definitely liked the pool. The pool was only 4 feet deep at its deepest, whereas I generally prefer up to 5 or 5-1/2 feet. The lobby is small and the hallways are somewhat hot, albeit perfectly tolerable. It certainly was not stifling, and I noticed no odor, contrary to what some have reported. There are only 2 elevators and only 4 luggage carts. Parking is difficult, but only if you insist on parking in the hotel lot. There is overflow parking across the street that is ample. No big deal in my opinion, but apparently it is to some. The TVs are relatively small at 25\", and are of the older tube variety with bubble screens. The FREE highspeed internet connection was fairly slow with wireless. I never got above 11 mb/second. The hard connection ethernet port was not working. The air conditioner is noisy. So all of the criticisms I have read are legitimate. I can understand them, and I don't disagree with them on a purely factual and descriptive basis. But all that having been said, I honestly feel that many have been OVERLY and NEEDELESSLY critical of the Paradise Plaza. It's a beachfront hotel folks -- NOT the Hilton or Marriott in a major city next to a large convention center. Obviously the decor and upkeep will be different. Expectations need to be realistic. I found the Paradise Plaza to do a perfecty fine hotel. It was as clean as I would expect a beachfront hotel to be during peak tourist season. The room was VERY spacious and comfortable. We did not need the AC at night, even though it was July. So the AC being noisy was a non-issue. The maid service was fine. We had two light bulbs burned out, and they were replaced -- literally -- within a minute. A maintenance person came up immediately to check on the ethernet port when I called down. I would have thought such to be low priority, but they responded with great alacrity. Towels, which were clean and fresh, in contrast to what others have reported, were provided daily; although I did notice that the trash was not always emptied. We got a very nice suite for $265 (total for the Dolphin Suite, various taxes, miscellaneous fees). That got us a large suite with two bedrooms, two full baths, two additional sinks, two balconies, two TVs, two full size closets, a mini fridge, a microwave, three queen beds (all with very comfortable mattresses), and a queen size sofa bed. With an Aerobed on the sleeper sofa, it was also very comfortable. Our neighbors were young adults/teenagers, and they tended to stay up late with \"louder than ideal\" music. But obviously that is not the fault of the hotel. People complain about having to walk around the hotel a couple of dozen yards, or through the Dairy Queen or Sunsations Shop, to get to the Boardwalk. No big deal in my opinion. If I had not read some people complain about such, it would have never even occurred to me to mention it. The hotel has a primo location on the Boardwalk. I honestly do not see that the hotel was anything to castigate or berate as some have done so scathingly. Yes... there were things that could be improved. Yes... the hotel is showing its age and has some wear and tear. But given the price, the Paradise Plaza was substantially better than I expected -- particularly given the negative reviews I had read. I would stay there again myself without hesitation, but would only recommend it to others with the above caveats. Overall grade...

We had children with us so we chose to drive thru the night, knowing we would be too early to check-in.

Well the \"changing facilities\" turned out to be a very small bathroom with a toilet and a sink. Not where you would want to change after being at the beach and have to drive several hours back home. There was no shower in the bathroom. Even though the area where this bathroom was located was totally filthy, we were still hoping that once we got to our room it would be much better. This was not the case. The hallways were extremely hot!! The elevator was so slow and took forever to come. Not only that, these are the same two elevators that the hotel staff had to use. You would think that being an employee you would let the paying guests get on the elevators first, this did not happen on several occasions. Our balcony door was nearly impossible to slide open. It was broken or off the track or something. It made it a real inconvenience to step outside on the balcony. And as for \"private\" balconies, they are not, you are directly next to the room next door. We had a total of 5 people staying in our room. Each and every day we had to call down for extra towels or stop at the front desk to pick them up. We also ran out of toilet paper at one time and had to call for an extra roll because there was none provided. The hotel advertises an in room safe that we did not have a key for. We called right away and several other times, to get a key but never received one the entire time we were there. If they did not exist we should have been told that up front. The access to the beach should not be stated as it is. You have to go thru either the Dairy Queen or a Sunsations store to get to the beach. Or you can go out the front door and around the building. None of those is direct access. As for the cleaning service, they came in made the beds and emptied the garbage. That's it!! They did not clean the bathroom nor did they run the sweeper.

How wrong was I!!! The hotel boasted direct access to the beach through a business connected to the hotel. This business was closed so access was out the front door and around the building. No big deal, but not what was advertised. The hotel boasted a \"very good\" restaurant. This restaurant was closed. A notice was in the lobby dated 8/16/07 that the restaurant would be closed for two weeks. It was still closed as of September 30th. Again, not as advertised.

I could not imagine staying at this hotel during the middle of summer. As for the room...we booked a non-smoking room. When we first entered the room, the odor of cigarette smoke was very strong. The night stand was also covered in cigarette burns. There was also a medium sized stain on the floor that looked like blood but who knows what that was. I immediately returned to the front desk and they gave us a new room (right next door). This room didn't smell as bad, but still had cigarette burns on the night stand. To me cleanliness of the room was an issue. The air conditioning return and vent were covered in a very thick layer of dust. The dust had blown onto the ceiling of the room so it looked like there had been a fire. There was also so much dust on the heat light in the very small bathroom that we wouldn't use it for fear it would catch on fire. There were also what looked to be grease type marks on the sheets, pillow cases and towels. The hotel website lists a pool which they do have but it is small and in the parking lot which is in the front of the hotel. The hotel website says that the hotel was renovated in 2006 but you could not tell it by our room. The beds were very uncomfortable and the bathroom was in need of repair.

Here is what we found last weekend. 1. At check in, the hotel looks fine, although a little beat up in the lobby area, bbut it's a beach hotel, so we gave it a pass. The staff at the front desk was young, and that theme stayed throughout... They weren't too engaged in what was going on, but got us checked in, so up to 8th floor we went to our Premium room w/jacuzzi. 2. In the door, and the first thing you noticed was the whole room is tiled... It's cool, the AC works fine, but the fridge was pretty pungent. But was we walked on the tile, it's already dirty... and we just got here! Ok, so next time, if you get the tiled floor room, bring your own broom! 3. But then... check out the bathroom. Yikes!!! See the photos and judge for yourself... Don't look behind the shower curtain...Don't look at the jacuzzi tub... Don't look behind the toilet! Finally, don't even look up at the ceiling! Scunge around the john, a whole lab full of junk browing behind the shower curtain, and hairs plastered to the ceiling!!! Yuck!! You can't sit in the tub, and you could smell the must growing... So bring your own Tilex too... 4. So after we saw all that, we asked the front desk what could be done, and asked to have the manager call us on our cell. Never got that call, although they did have staff come up to the room, they didn't manage to actually CLEAN THE BATHROOM! 5. Since we have already paid over 300 a night for the room, we had committed to stay. But you could easily pay half that for a dirty room in OC... We spent most of the night on the balcony, which was the only saving grace of the place. In conclusion... We didn't spend much time in the room, which is what most people do at the beach anyway right? But you just didn't want to spend a second more than you needed to in the bathroom. We never heard from management about addressing the room... But worst of all, THEY ACTUALLY LOOKED WHAT WE SHOWED THEM AND THEY STILL DIDN'T CLEAN IT! So buyer beware...

I'll start with the positive... The location was wonderful, right on the boardwalk in the middle, convenient to just about everything- restaurants, beach, amusement park, shops, etc. There was also a Dairy Queen connected to the hotel which came in very handy. The room was a decent size, with Bath & Body Works toiletries, comfy bathrobes, and bottled water supplied daily. The maid service was adequate and timely- had no problem with it at all. Also, we requested adjacent rooms upon check-in and they were able to provide that with no problem. Now for the down side... The hotel could definitely use an overhaul. In fact, I actually cut my arm pretty bad as I rushed past the DQ hot dog statue outside the hotel because it was broken and had a jagged edge exposed. The balconies should also be re-done as they are very worn down and dirty and the carpet on them is ripping apart. The pool is very small but honestly so was just about every other hotel pool we saw on the boardwalk. It was sufficient for our kids. But the pool is located in the parking lot so it's a little awkward. They advertise Pay-per-View TV in their brochure but no longer have it available. And lastly, the BAR in the hotel has no liquor license if you can believe that! We attempted to go to the buffet in this same bar/restaurant for breakfast but quickly did an about-face when we saw all the flies circling the food. I would definitely get your food elsewhere if you stay in this hotel.

First of all, the location was awesome. It was within walking distance of everything you could want and right on the boardwalk; my family and I stayed in the Dolphin Suite # 715. The view from the balcony was of the bay side because it's on the back of the hotel. (This room actually has 2 balconies, both bay view) The room was very, very spacious. It slept 6, so there was actually 2 bedrooms and a living area with each. The first bathroom was pretty big, and fairly clean. It was right there when you entered the suite; the 2nd bathroom was very large. It had a jacuzzi tub, which was very nice and a sitting area off the bedroom. On the outside the hotel looks pretty new and has been freshly painted. The lobby is spacious and nice as well. The staff there was very curteous and fulfilled our requests quickly. The maid service, just plain sucked, but I won't get into that. We got Bath & Body works toiletries which was nice and bottled water each day. The rooms could have been a little cleaner, but the carpet in this room looked new. The TV had some dust on it and underneath the bathroom sink did too. I think the outside had been remodeled and the inside still had not. The AC in our room sprang a leak on our 2nd day; we called the front desk and within 15 minutes it had been fixed, so I will say that was wonderful and not a problem at all. I would stay here again, but I do feel that the rooms are a little overpriced. For around the same price, we could have taken a nicer hotel, but there was nothing available. The pool was behind the hotel; it was small, but nothing to complain about. It did have the usual sand in and around it, but what else can you expect when you're at the beach? Right below the hotel is a Dairy Queen, which was nice. There was also a Candy Kitchen and 2 T-shirt Factories. There wasn't much parking. The first lot was usually full, but they do provide overflow parking diagonally across the street. As a matter of fact, you can see the overflow lot from the balcony. I prefer to park at the hotel, but walking a little, and only across the street isn't bad. It could be worse. We also reserved room # 712, on the same floor for additional memebers of my family. This room was a spacious room with 2 double beds and a balcony with a side view of the ocean. My only complaint with this room was that you had to share a balcony with your neighbors and the rest of the floors. There was hand railing the divided each one, but no privacy what so ever. You could look down on the people on the balcony below you because they stuck out further than this one. Someone could easily step over the rail right onto your balcony if they wanted to; there wasn't a gap or nothing between them. I didn't like this at all, but I did notice the oceanfront balconies were each individual balconies and you wouldn't have to be concerned with this if you were interested in that.

As soon as we got to the front desk they asked for our cars licence plate numbers and gave us a tag to put on the car rearview mirror. We reserved both the Dolphin Suites (they only have 2 of these rooms), one located on the 4th and one located on the 5th and both bayview. Between us was 4 adults and 7 teenagers ages 12-17. The suites included 1 bedroom with a queen bed, wet bar and bathroom and the main room had 2 queens and a pull out sofa, bathroom, micro, frig, safe, coffee maker, table with 2 chairs and lots of closet and drawer space. There is a balcony off both rooms with 2 chairs each. Housekeeping- Housekeepers start their day between 9-10 am each morning. We were told housekeeping only comes if you put out your maid service sign which we did. They start with the rooms checking out first. My family walked in on 2 different days to find 3 people in our room cleaning. I will give our room a 90% out of 100%. The bathrooms were spotless, furniture dusted and they vacuumed everyday but they really needed to pull out the dresser and night stand and clean behind them. Each day they left us plenty of towels, 2 bottles of water and Bath and Body shampoo, soap and lotion. Our sheets were changed twice during our stay. There is a note in the room saying they will only leave new towels in exchange for dirty towels because of the rate of towels that have been kidnapped in the last few weeks. Pool- we never used it but it is located outside the front door next to the parking lot. We go to OC for the beach not the pool so this was not an issue. Parking- You can park in front of the hotel or across the street. We did have to park across the street one night but again this was not a biggie for us. I have had to walk further to go into the mall or food store. Getting onto the beach- You can go through 2 of the stores or walk around the building. We never had any problems of bumping into anyone or anything. Fire Alarm- Our first night there someone pulled the alarm on the first floor at about 11:30pm. This happened 2 weeks ago and they DID catch the person. I wish them the same luck this time. We did get to meet a lot of nice people standing in the parking lot. We made the best of this situation! Robes- we had 4 robes waiting for us in the room. Housekeeping gave us more so each of us could have our own. Front desk- Very nice, very helpful, very friendly......same goes for the security guards.

(the hotel is only 8 floors) it was a great room. bath & body works toiletries, clean, and comfortable. the rooms were sound proofed very well, i didn't hear any noise from the other rooms. my room was an end unit which had 2 queen size beds, jacuzzi, ocean front balcony and an ocean view patio. the patio was hugh. the hotel is right on the boardwalk and in the middle of everything. anything you need is right there from restaurants, bars, snack shops, sunsations, and a convience store right next to the hotel (which has anything you need, beer, wine, snacks, whatever.) the weather was great and the staff was terrific. i had read on a previous posting that the cleaning people would show up late to clean the rooms. i did not experience that. by early afternoon the room was cleaned. i really dont have any complaints about the hotel, the only thing i can point out is that there are only 2 elevators. only one of them will take you to the bar/restaurant, which was no big deal. i never had to wait around for the elevator. the pool is small and located in the back of the hotel by the dumpster, but i never used it because it was so nice on the beach. the main parking lot only holds so many cars, but they have another lot across the street. lastly, the first night the fire alarms went off at 4:30am and we had to evacuate the hotel for about an hour. (it really wasn't a problem either, the staff handled everything appropriately.) overall, i really enjoyed my stay at the paradise plaza. i have stayed in ocmd many times and plan on staying there again. i would definetly refer this place to a friend.

Upon our arrival, we come to find out that we have to park across the street because there is no parking spaces left. Then, we had to carry our luggage in because they didn't have any carts available. We paid top dollar because we wanted their jacuzzi room. The jacuzzi had patch work done to it which was evident by a huge plaster job smack dab in the middle of the tub. The rooms were small and on our last night stay, the bed smelled like beer which means that they either didn't wash the sheets or that they simple couldn't get the smell out, which in either case, it was DISGUSTING! The balcony was so small too. I am so angry over how much the cost of this terrible hotel was for what it had to offer us. This was the first time we were ever in Ocean City Maryland. We usually go to the Jersey shores. I gotta tell ya, their hotels and MUCH better there.

The front desk staff was far more professional and mature than what we experienced in the past. The rooms seem well maintained and in overall decent condition. The oceanfront wall is nearly all glass, which gives a lot of light and there is plenty of drawer space. Little extras like the 2 bottles of water per day, the Bath & Body Works/Bio toiletries, coffee, cups, and the wall mount hairdryer (that works wonderfully) were all nice touches. The soundproofing of the room is better than most hotels - noise from other rooms was relatively minimal, especially in comparison to some of the other hotels in OC. One note - the smallish pool is situated in what amounts to being on the corner of the parking lot on the street side of the hotel. While the location is relatively unappealing, at least there is a pool, which some hotels lack. The housekeeping continues to be a bit of a mystery to me, as they seem to clean far later than most hotels. We found putting the \"Housekeeping Requested\" sign on the doorknob when leaving the room helped. Also, if you opt to forego housekeeping or miss it by having a Do Not Disturb sign out, they leave you a \"Care Package\" in a garbage bag that contains fresh towels, toiletries, toilet paper, cups, the daily bottled water, etc. This helped minimize my frustration when having the Do Not Disturb sign out for 15 minutes while changing resulted in not getting housekeeping two days. We will go back to the Paradise Plaza in the future, as we think it's one of the nicer hotels in OC.

Read this...\u201d", "Author": "eeyoregon", "ReviewID": "UR121867880", "Content": "I wrote a review of this property in 2008. I travel frequently and have stayed in hotels on both ends of the spectrum. To this day, I stand firm that this was the WORST hotel that I have ever encountered. I would like to point out WHY the reviews of this property are SO extreme. There are TWO kinds of rooms at this \"resort\" and they are extremely different than each other. There are the old, dirty, falling apart, disgusting, bug infested, would be condemned by any health authority rooms (the kind I stayed in). These rooms are primarily given to those of us who use budget booking sources like lastminutetravel, hotwire, etc. The photos from another poster are just the tip of the iceberg for the old rooms. And then there are the newer rooms with the nice appliances, granite counters, rich cherry wood furnishings, etc. I did see one of these rooms by peering in a window during my stay and was floored to think that they only updated some of the rooms and charge a much higher rate for the rooms that are safe to inhabit. I did inquire about the nicer rooms during my stay and it would have cost me an additional $60 a night, of which I did not have in the budget. I hope this helps those of you who are on the fence. If, and only if, I knew for a fact that I would get one of the \"nicer\" rooms, I might consider staying at this establishment again, BUT only if every Disney property were completely booked. WHY? Because this hotel wanted over $100 a night for the \"nicer\" rooms but Disney only wanted $69.00 a night...oh how I wish I had known at the time. At a Disney Value resort I get FREE round-trip airport transportation, FREE parking at all Disney Theme parks, FREE use of all on property transportation between parks/hotels and FREE extra magic hours in the parks. Learned my lesson the hard way.

We were the only ones there so no queue for check-in; it was very quick and efficient, my only problem being the room tax or whatever t's called, I don't know why US hotels insist on this, an annoying $40 out of budget I wish they would include in the original price. Our only other issue was the annoying guy at the sales desk trying to sell you Disney tickets the minute you walk in the door which was pretty irritating after a 9hour flight and a stressful drive from the airport. However, this is something you find everywhere in and around Orlando. This was my 2nd trip to Kissimmee (my first had been 5 years earlier and I'd stayed in a villa). The car parking was free which was excellent and there were always plenty of available spaces. That first night we went to eat at Chillis right across the road (crossing the road was an experience in itself; America isn't designed for pedestrians!), service, food and prices were good. There was lots of choice for places to eat withinn walking distance from the hotel; we tried Dunkin' Donuts, Papa Johns Pizza, UNO and bought a few bits from CVS. There was also a good gift shop next door (with a giant wizard on top!) where we bought some cheap beach towels to take to the water parks. Wal-mart was also a short drive down the road where we picked up essentials like breakfast foods and drinks and snacks; there was plenty of room in our fridge and cupboards in our room to accommadate this. The room was clean when we arrived and was cleaned daily to a good standard and we were never disturbed by maids, we left a dollar a day each as a tip which we thought was fair and we received good service in return. The bathroom was small but clean, no real problems with it and there was a huge counter in the room with a large mirror which I used to my hair and make-up. There was a large wardrobe and bedside cabinets plus 2 double beds; more than enough for the 2 of us. We also had a microwave. No, there wasn't many channels on the telly but it was adequate considering I didn't go to Florida to watch TV; an automatic alarm went off on it when there was a tornado warning in our area which was a bit scary! We didn't bother with the laundry facilities; we washed clothes in our bath and hung them over the balcony outside our room, they dried easily in the heat. The pool was OK, it didn't open 'til 9am which I found annoying as I would've like an early morning swim, it didn't make sense as there was no lifeguard anyway and even then it didn't open on time. As a plus point it was never busy so you could easily get a sunlonger and enjoy the pool mostly to yourself. The only bugs I ever saw where lizards around the grounds which were so cute! I found it very close to Disney and never a long drive to anyway I wanted to go.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jim Thorpe Pa", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "SarahJimThorpePa", "ReviewID": "UR46793557", "Content": "We go to Kissimmee every year in October.

I've stayed at alot of different motels in Kissimmee, over 12 yrs. and this was the worst!! I actually gave it a chance, even after reading the reviews. First, it started out with a room that stunk, the bathroom light didn't work and the tiolet kept overflowing! So the next morning, I spoke to the lady at the front desk , she gave me another room that was just as bad, so we called again and asked if we can have a better room, she said for more money you can. I was furious, I was not going to pay any more money for this place, which I had already paid in full. Ten minutes later, the manger called our room and said he would give us the better room at no extra charge. We thought now that's good management, he accommodated us. The room was nice, it had granite counter, big high beds, wet bar.... So we were pleased, we stayed in that room two nights. The morning we were leaving, I woke up to find a little bug walking in the bed right next to me and my daughter, I freaked out. I looked around and saw blood spots on the sheets, but didn't know those were signs of bed bugs, I've never experienced them in my life! Then I noticed red bite marks all over my waistline. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there!!! Well, here we are two weeks later with bite marks all over our arms, legs, back, ...... and doctor bills for the visit and creams for the irriation.

We returned every evening to find that the room was fixed just fine and adequately stocked with supplies. We needed to check into the airport for our return trip home and to print out our boarding passes, so we went to the front desk and ask them to take care of this for us. The desk attendant promptly took our information and printed our boarding passes for us. We didn't see a single bug in the room the entire week we were there, there wasn't any gap under the door, there wasn't any blood on the sheets (they were clean), everything in the room worked just fine (although one light switch was in need of fixing, due to a short).

We spent the extra money on a suite and very very glad we did. My fiance and I were very pleased with the room. Beds were nice. good amount of area to hang clothes. Tons on counter space. Only downfall the shower head was very low. Im 5'8, my fiance 6' and we both had to bend down to just get under the shower head. But no biggie. I read a lot of complaints about bugs. We only found 1 bug and figured we were in and out so much we probably brought it in. As for the room service complaints ..... well you know that little tag you can put on your door that says \"do not disturb\" use it! We left it in there the whole time and nobody that we know of came in our room or disturbed us. We did however hear a lot of noise early in the am outside our door. Sounded like thunder but it was the house keeping carts going by. We also had to call down to the front desk to get a remote control for the tv. They were very nice about getting one up to us as well, took about 30 minutes. All in all its not a bad place to stay. The outside does need some updating. And if you can, upgrade your room.

A fitted sheet was required for the beds - one had a fitted sheet, the other a flat sheet which did not fit the bed properly. Two of 3 lamps had no lightbulbs & the a-c unit had no knob to turn it on. Mgt did fix that problem. The door lock did not work properly. We reported it, we assume they fixed it, because it appeared to work later. 5) The hotel grounds were acceptable, the pool (although not used) appeared to be lovely and inviting. Parking was plentiful. The hotel had no elevator (which should be noted when booking this hotel, for ADA purposes), the handrails were not that secure and in need of paint. The building itself appeared to have been recently painted. If you read some of the reviews, it was obvious that some of these guests were either upgraded to a premium room (which accounted for the 4.0 or 5.0 rating, or they've never stayed at a decent hotel in their lives. My advise to HOTELS.COM (and EXPEDIA) is -- do a more thorough review of the hotel BEFORE establishing your rating!! See EVERYTHING, not just the room they booked for the reviewer to get a better rating! And FULLY DISCLOSE all the facts! I've stayed in thousands of hotels over the years, mostly good or great, a few not so good. This hotel is certainly one of the latter.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeland, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBecareful of the \"bait and switch\" when you arrive at this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "dgoogirl67", "ReviewID": "UR10598342", "Content": "We booked on Hotels.com and had no problems at all.

When we arrived at the hotel (around 10:30pm) the woman at the desk tells us that there are no more NON-smoking rooms and if we want one, we'll need to fork up another 11 bucks. We literally had to argue with this woman (Isabelle) about getting what we had already paid for online. We even had our printed out document that specifically said NON SMOKING ROOM. I showed her and she got so pissed and told us we should have called hotels.come to make sure that the room would be available. I have NEVER had to call a hotel prior to showing up to see if the room I booked was available!! Has anyone else???????????? Bottom line....she gave us a \"suite\" ..which looked just like a \"standard\" room...2 beds and a bathroom with a mini fridge.(whoopie doo) .

If the rest of my party had not already made arrangements to stay at this \"hotel\" (if you can even call it that) I would have certainly left and made arrangements to stay elsewhere. For starters I had to literally shoulder my front door just to get in the room. Upon entry the first thing I noticed was the front curtain was hanging down on the end closest to the door. It had been this way for so long that curtain had a black groove worn through it where the door had been hitting it upon opening and closing. In addition to the groove/rip in the curtain there was black mold and and disgusting stains all over the curtain in several places that coule easily be seen. These stains were so obvious that it was clear that they were just ignored by housekeeping. The bathroom was tiled with three different types of tile from obvious repairs and the amount of mold growing through and around the bad caulk job was enough to make you want to lose your lunch. When I went to complain at the front desk I was offered another room which I was allowed to check out first and thankfully I did. Upon entering the room the smell of must/smoke was enough to knock you over even though this was supposed to be a non-smoking room. Upon further inspection I saw a 5\"x7\" hole in the bathroom ceiling that had the piece of the ceiling used to repair it hanging by a piece of caulk. I returned to the desk to let them know and they told me that they were taking that room \"out of service\" or so they said. The front desk called later to inform us of our new room number and to have us pick up our new room keys. Upon entering the new room it smelled of must and smoke which was again surprising because it was a non-smoking room. The TV in the new room had terrible reception and the AC did not work so a service tech was sent to the room. When the tech removed the front of the AC unit to reveal the filter it was clogged with enough dirt that could choke a horse and was certainly not healthy. He then began to work on the TV and was working on it when I had to leave the room. I returned later that evening only to find it was no better than when I left. I called for service the next day only to have the same result, terrible to no TV reception. The bathroom in the new room was as bad if not worse then the original room. There was visible mold and dirt throughout. In addition to these problems the top sheet / comforters on the beds had rips and burn holes in several places. Since we were only one day away from checkout we agreed to deal with these issues since we would soon be leaving. The Hotel has a nice set-up but is in a state of major dis-repair. The hotel does offer the use of a washer and dryer but do yourself a favor and bring your own quarters if you plan to use them. There is no change machine onsite and when I went to the front desk for quarters they told me they did not have any but I could go to the 7-11 down the road if I needed change. That was just par for the course here. No linen changes, wet towels from housekeeping, filthy bathrooms and carpets....I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more money for a better hotel and you will be much happier. My party had several rooms at this hotel and these types of problems were common in every room. STAY AWAY from the Legacy Grand ! They should have paid me to stay there. If you won't take my word for it then do yourself a favor and ask to see your room BEFORE you pay and you be the judge.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cWe were booked for 3 nights but checked out early.\u201d", "Author": "RedTraveler23", "ReviewID": "UR8708018", "Content": "This was a hotel from hell.

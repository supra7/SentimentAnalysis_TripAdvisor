The hotel has an old world Northwest elegance...not overdone, warm and inviting. It is wonderfully located in downtown within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, as well as Seattle's numerous and very enjoyable shopping experiences. I stay there for business or pleasure as many of the companies I work with are also located nearby in downtown. As a single female travelling alone, one of the things I most appreciate about this hotel is the excellent and reliable staff. From the Valet to the Bellman, Front Desk and Concierge, everyone is friendly, respectful and willing to assist in any reasonable way. I recognize many of the employees from over the years, which, to me, means that there must be some employee satisfaction. Perhaps that is what puts the service over the top. I also really enjoy the atmosphere of Oliver's Restaurant at the hotel. The menu is a perfect size making for a quick and easy decision. I have tried most things on the menu and tend to like them all. My top recommendations are the crab cakes or the hamburger. Whatever you choose, get the fries as your side dish. I would travel a long way just for those. If you enjoy a cocktail, sit at the bar and watch the weather wash over the dramatically lit street sign indicating 4th and Pine Street. It is very mesmerizing at night. When I'm in Seattle my schedule is almost always overfull and I find the Mayflower Park Hotel to be a very lovely respite in the middle of it all.

I'll never stay anywhere else! This boutique hotel came highly recommended by a colleague in California who has stayed here numerous times. The Mayflower absolutely exceeded my expectations. I am so glad that the hotel I had planned to stay at for a big conference at the Washington State Convention Center was booked. The Mayflower Park Hotel was less expensive and far superior (we stayed four nights). The ambience in the lobby and upper sitting room by the fireplace is comfortably elegant and inviting. All the staff, from the moment we entered, were extremely professional, kind, and knowledgeable. The concierges are very helpful. Jane did our booking for the Seattle 2-Hour Van Tour (great tour, by the way) and Andy secured for us a fantastic museum package for the Gauguin Exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. They made my birthday very, very special, even delivering a small box of chocolates to our room with a birthday card signed by numerous staff. Katya at the front desk is lovely and the doormen are courteous and have friendly smiles. Our deluxe room on the 9th floor had 2 bathrooms and a view of the Space Needle with free wifi. Oliver's on the main floor is perfect for happy hour drinks and hors d'oeuvres in the late afternoon. The West Center Shopping Mall is connected to the hotel as is the Monorail station to the Space Needle and the Link Light Railway Tunnel Station to the Sea-Tac Airport, 35 minutes away. All the Seattle highlights are within walking distance -- even the Space Needle, to which we walked for dinner at the Needle's Sky Restaurant (about a 20 minute walk).

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historic place within easy walking distance to anything and everything I wanted to do in 3.5 days. The light rail from the airport is so easy to use and the 3rd Avenue exit is just around the corner and down the block from the hotel. I was able to check-in early, always a plus. My room was fine but I was directly across from the ice machine and I could hear it repeatedly during the evening. I also faced the Westlake Center and on that side there is a lot of very noisy equipment that runs all the time. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to dead quiet at night so I thought this was going to be a real problem but I slept reasonably well every night. Must have been all that walking, fresh air and using the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small but adequate fitness center. I recommend Oliver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, great service the night I was there even though it was busy, and room service, also good service, and an excellent, hot, burger. Andaluca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s though was not my best dining experience. The food was tasty but barely warm for both the breakfast and dinner I had there. No idea why that would have happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c twice. The coffee was hot though and very good. Another big plus was that the Chocolate Indulgence tour through Savor Seattle starts right at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upper lobby. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that when I booked the hotel but it worked out very well and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend the tour. All in all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go back to the Mayflower Park in a second. I like a good walking city (the front desk folks are really good with directions) and from here it was easy to get to Pike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Place Market, the aquarium, Miner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Landing, the Seattle Art Museum and the Regal Theatres (also there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an AMC about the same distance). Plenty of excellent food and drink a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from all of these places. If you choose the Mayflower Park I think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enjoy it.

Specifically, my room was a cozy queen, just right for a person traveling alone. It was decorated in classic traditional furniture and fabrics. The bathroom was tight, with a modern shower head, but an old-fashoned tub and pedestal sink. The toiletries were good, but the bathroom -- while spotless -- could have used some updating. The classic TV cabinet contained a modern Vizio TV. The fitness area was outstanding, though small, equipped with two modern treadmills, a stair-stepper and an exercise bike. Internet service was free and powerful -- always a plus. Another plus was the restaurant and a separate cafe-bar under the same roof -- one on each side of the lobby. The food was excellent, ranging from BLT sandwiches to pepper scallops. Moreover, the wine was reasonably priced by the glass. I would agree with the reviews that grumble about the thin walls. I could hear someone's cell phone ringing and faint voices next door to my room. But fortunately, it wasn't loud enough to disturb -- just to distract.

This is a wonderful place to host your parties! It is worth the investment and the planning staff works hard to meet all your company needs. The hotel sleeping rooms are also nice. We usually have random drawings at our dinner parties and one of the gifts is a night's stay at the hotel and the winners have consistently expressed their thanks and satisfaction at having been able to stay in the Queen Anne- style rooms. I do look forward to hosting another dinner party here soon. One of the things that the catering manager always assures you is that the decorations and atmosphere will be beautiful and he has been right everytime. It is perhaps one of the most elegant places in Seattle. You will have a wait staff to take care of all your needs during the party- but make sure to request that the staff members be veterans and not new ones (that is, new on the job) because you want the attentiveness to detail that only the seasoned waiters consistently provide. Also they offer a coat check service - but it is best to have one of your employees/assistants to take care of this.

We especially enjoy the Mayflower's room rates, central location, friendly & helpful staff, tasteful ambiance, lounge (Oliver's) and restaurant (the Andaluca). When we arrive on Black Fridays, the lobby and Olivers are abuzz with a happy crowd enjoying hot chocolate, home made cookies and drinks awaiting the lighting of the Christmas tree at Westlake Centre, next to the Mayflower, followed by Macy's roof top fire works across the street. Although we have had a room with a view onto the fire works, we always choose to join the outdoor crowds and enjoy the happy atmosphere - a good start to the Christmas season. Upon arrival at the hotel, we park our car and leave it parked for the weekend as everything we want to see/visit is within easy walking distance. Seattle has a wonderful selection of restaurants, interesting neighbourhoods, good shopping and, of course, the always entertaining Pike Place Market.

As I'm an Entertainment Card member, was able to book the room for 50% off the rack rate, which was still over 20% off the seasonal rate, and there was no fee or penalty for cancellation. The hotel is actually attached to Westlake Center, which is located directly over the Westlake Transit Tunnel, through which not only the LINK rail from Sea-Tac is connected but also several city & suburban express busses pass through. As we'd arrived on the Amtrak, it was a quick (FREE!) ride from the station to the hotel. We arrived a couple of hours prior to check-in but the front desk was very accommodating & gave us a room immediately, with the offer that if we had any issues w/noise or location that they'd willingly move us to a different room. As the hotel's website said, it's decorated in a traditional style so if you're looking for ultra modern, this won't be for you. However, the decor didn't matter to us as much as location, comfort & service and this hotel has all of those in spades! The room is exactly per their website's \"Classic Guestroom\" photo: generously proportioned w/a separate walk-in closet w/safe, full entertainment armoire, work desk & seating area, the bed linens were wonderful (altho the mattress was a little too soft for my liking), and the bathroom was a decent size too. Their toiletries are very high quality Gieves & Hawkes, which I really appreciated! I also like that their shower curtain rail is curved out so there's no icky wet curtain to stick to your skin. There's plenty of counter space for personal wash bags as well. There's in-room wifi which requires a password (changed monthly) but that's already on a card w/in the room. The signal wasn't always @ full bars but never dropped. I would comment however that there's no fan in the bathroom so the mirrors get foggy, and that the towel rack/bar is located @ the back of the tub/shower enclosure itself & there's only 2 hooks which are installed @ the top of the bathroom door, thus the towels get a bit damp after a shower. Also, when I was trying to hang my towel after showering I either had to hang it over the tub (awkward reach) or jump up to try & catch the door hooks (I'm 5' tall). I would really suggest to the hotel to look @ installing some extra bars/hooks to separate the new/dry towels, which already take up all the space on the existing rack, from used/wet towels elsewhere in the bathroom. The concierge & doormen were really helpful w/dining & shopping suggestions, and due to some pretty wacky weather, we were glad to take advantage of the complimentary umbrellas which were available to guests. We didn't eat in Andaluca but did order an American Breakfast room service to share (yay for US portions!) which was very delicious & delivered promptly on a sturdy wooden tray w/linens & cutlery. We were able to request a late checkout and when I mentioned some noise from the \"Occupy Seattle\" demonstrations, the lady said we should've told them as they would have happily moved us to a room on the other side of the hotel. The noise wasn't a big deal when the windows were closed tho so I didn't feel like a complaint needed to be made.

I booked this hotel for a one night stay in order to photograph Seattle. I try to review various hotels, especially if the experience is significant. The Mayflower Park was a massive disappointment in -Appearance -Accommodation -Most importantly, customer service. Check-in was average; however I noticed that in the \"business center\" (standing kiosks only) we could see guests conducting their business at computer stations. The room was shabby at best, and about the size of a closet. We walked in and noticed that the room was dingy, small, and had only one bed. I am disabled; room size is easy to overlook, if the room is presented acceptably and I can get around. We requested a second bed: No can do. We requested audience with a manager and let him know very clearly we were not happy. He was accusatory and combative, but kindly offered a roll-away bed. We finally conceded, and the manager continued to be combative. After that was over, we decided to see the city. Apparently the hotel was connected to access for various methods of transportation. Not for us; we were sent outside and around the building as the result of an event happening at the hotel. Again, I'm disabled which is unfortunately clearly visible. Regardless, we were sent outside in slick rain on concrete, with no assistance offered by doormen. I had to grapple down wet cement stairs and into rain. After clearing yet another flight of stairs, we made it to our transportation. Upon our return to the hotel, we called to request a roll away. After four hours and three calls to the front desk, it came. An employee set it up, and left absolutely no clear path to the restroom as a result of the small room. That is not possible for me-again, he could see that I was in need of better accommodation, so he moved furniture all over the place attempting to clear a small opening for me to reach a restroom in the night. Up to this point the entire hotel experience had not only been inconvenient, but extremely dangerous. Then our neighbors chirped in. We could hear the conversations of hotel guests in rooms next to us through the walls. The next morning, we checked out.

Found it confusing to get from the light rail exit to the actual hotel front door - i suppose i could have studied the map better, but really didn't know which exit i came out from. dragging my suitcase through evening traffic didn't get me off to a good start. I caught a taxi on the way back to airport and this was organised by the hotel - in fact, they actually had the hotel private car waiting and so i took this instead as it was ready to go - cost me a bit more $40? from memory but got there safe/sound early in the morning. I felt safe at all times in the hotel - despite being hassled by the usual suspects once i went out of the hotel into the masses. Had some yummy local meals - Cheesecake Factory, Palamino.

A Nice Change From The Chains.\u201d", "Author": "cromartie", "ReviewID": "UR83420061", "Content": "My wife and I opted to break from our usual chain stays to take in this hotel, because it is ideally situated close to the Pike Place Market and the Monorail. I can't speak positively enough about the location. It is in or near the center of everything touristy. The price is competitive with the chains in the market, and it's worth it to eschew earning points for a more convenient and frankly nicer room. Upon the advice of some of the other reviewers, we opted for a double queen room over the standard queen room to get more space. For an extra $20 nightly, we got two queen beds, room to spread out and two full bathrooms. The view of the surrounding area is terrific from the room, and the air condition in our room is above average. The service was prompt, gracious, and appreciative. The valet was prompt and eager. The classic elegance of the lobby and attention upon check in are not to be missed. The room itself was clean and updated. There are no plugs above desk level (important if you travel with several electronic devices), but plugs located above baseboard level all around the room more than make up for this. The HD Visio television in the room was not overly large but does the job. Curtains can be closed completely. The bed is hard, but not overbearingly so. Not great for a bad back, but it won't leave you immobilized like some other chain beds. The bathrooms are satisfactory. However, the shower head is difficult to deal with if you're taller than 5' 4\" and would be unusable for an extended stay if you are exceptionally tall (they are fine, however, for persons of size). The bathrooms in our room were not vented, and that lends to giving the rooms a dirtier appearance. It appears as if the walls in the rooms and their respective doors had been neither painter nor cleaned in quite some time. Skip the room service from Oliver's. Delivery was prompt and the price was reasonable but the food was not very good. For those of us who are late risers, the noon check out time is appreciated. Don't let the negatives distract you from the overwhelming positives, unless you are over 6' tall, however.

The decor is subtle and feels like a average persons nice hotel from yesteryear rather than plush like a Fairmont style hotel (which is what I think many expect it to be). I went for the deluxe room as I do not like small standard hotel rooms, the room was larger than expected, but a very small bathroom. During the day the room was noisy with banging from around and upstairs, however was quiet at night. The mattress was uncomfortable for me and I woke many times during he night with a sore back (stretches and a hot shower fixed that), my partner had no problem though. Olivers and the restaurant were nice and if you want to eat on the cheap, there's plenty of places to chose from next door in Westlake Center The room was on special at time of booking, otherwise I wouldn't have chosen this hotel given the amount to chose from in Seattle. If I needed to quickly book a hotel downtown for a night I would stay here again, but if I had time I'd try somewhere else due to the mattress and normal price.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA hotel with a bit of character\u201d", "Author": "Locky33", "ReviewID": "UR74199852", "Content": "We arrived at 10 am, fresh from an Alaskan Cruise and were delighted to find that our room was ready for us to occupy.

We had arrived at 1:00 in the morning very tired and needing a good nights rest. The gentleman at the desk also gave a a very big welcome and proceeded to check us in quickly and afficiently Upon hearing that we were there celebrating our anniversary he gave us a certificate for 2 free cocktails in their wonderful martini cocktail lounge. What a nice way to start our stay! We found our room a mini king size suite to be beautiful, comfortable, very clean and quiet. The next morning we had breakfast in their restaurant Anduluca. The breakfast choices were wonderful as were the wait staff. The breakfast was also included in the price of each night we stayed at the hotel ,which I must say is the best deal in town. Each morning we had a delicious breakfast which was prepared to a tee,(my favorite being the stuffed french toast YUM!!) and some great conversation with the wait staff. They were always helpful with ideas of things we should do or see,and all their recommendations were great. It was a nice way to start our day. The concierge, Sean, was also extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He made reservations at 2 of Seattles finest restaurants for us and we loved them both. Lets get back to LOCATION. This little grand hotel is right in the hub of all that is going on in Seattle.Shopping surrounds you,from Nordstroms, Macys, to the world famous Pikes Market which is only 2 blocks away. Great fun at Pikes and we visited it every day. The hotel is also conveniently located 1 block from the Lite Rail which is a great train ride that takes you to and from Seattles Seatac airport. It costs only $2.50 each way and we found it to be clean and comfortable. What a great perk, as a taxi ride from the airport can cost around $40. We made use of our certificate for our 2 Free cocktails at Olivers their martini cocktail lounge and once again were so happy with the service and genuine friendliness of the staff. The drinks were delish! The Mayflower Park is attached to Westlake center where there is a shuttle that will take you to the Space Needle which is just a short 3 minute ride away. You can't ask for more than this hotel offers. They are truly a great example of what a hotel stay should be like. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation to any one staying in Seattle. P.S.

Everyone was so attentive and so helpful, from the front desk staff to the Concierge, ALL the staff. My room was a Deluxe Queen and very elegant. After a long day exploring the city it was a pleasure to come to my room to relax and get a good nites sleep. The bed was elegant and very comfy. I also liked the fact that the room had a coffee maker with complimentary coffee and an electronic safe. I was also told at the front desk that if I wanted to a small refrigerator could be brought to my room at no extra charge! The location of the hotel was also excellent. It is centrally located and within walking distance to many great attractions. There is a shopping center (Westlake Center) very close to the hotel where you can do a lot of shopping or grab a bite to eat at the food court. On the third floor you can buy your tickets to take the monorail that takes you to the Seattle Center area where the Space Needle and other attractions are located. A few block south of the hotel you find the famous Pike Market. I strongly recommend starting your day with breakfast at Lowells Restaurant at the Pike Market. Its very affordable and the three floor restaurant has excellent views of the waterfront. In sum, I had a great stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel and whenever I go back to Seattle I will stay there again. :-) PS. If you are traveling solo it is more affordable to take the Grey LIne Downtown Airporter that takes you from the airport to many hotels in downtown Seattle. I was dropped off at the Westin Hotel which is less than a block away from the Mayflower Park. I only paid $25 for the round ticket.

Pros: Location (Right across the street from all public transportations, including Light Rail to Seatac airport). Polite & courteous staff (The concierge was particularly helpful) Quiet inside and out. I even had the window open and barely heard any street noise Coffee Machine in room Enough hangers for clothes and plenty of drawer space Alot of lights in the room Free WIFI in the room One of the best ideas I've seen in a hotel room: Electrical outlets all along the baseboards in the room. No problems plugging in all your electronics. Clock radio also had a 'white noise' option, ie: The sound of the ocean, etc. Plus it was MP3 compatible, unlike the iPod-only clock radios found in most boutique hotels these days. Queen Size bed, but very comfortable Cons: Housekeeping: When I got to my room on the first day and was unpacking, I noticed some long, dark hairs in the drawers. I then noticed hairs in the bathroom...all over the floor, on the wall, in the shower. It was pretty disgusting and I almost asked to change rooms. I was hoping that the following day, the hair would be all cleaned up. However, when I returned to the room in the evening, I noticed that the room had not been cleaned at all!!! I did call downstairs for towels, which were brought up promptly. The good news, they did clean the room the following day and the floor, wall and shower hairs were gone too!! Unfortunetly the drawer hairs remained! Closet safe too high up. Hard to see inside when you are under 5'5'' No mini bar or little fridge in room Very strange and awkward location for magnifying mirror in the bathroom. It was positioned right over the toilet. Lousy water pressure and shower The main restaurant Andalucca was closed and my Seattle friends and I had been dying to try it, as it had top reviews. Summary: I would actually rate this hotel 4****, as it was comparible with most 4**** hotels I've stayed at. The price was very fair and you absolutely can't beat the location.

The lobby is small but nicely appionted. The restaurant is very nice - reasonably priced with well above average food. My wife and I requested a deluxe queen. The hotel only advertised that they had 3 types of rooms - Standard queen, Deluxe queen (larger) and Double queen. Upon arrival were were put into a King room (the clerk explained that they only have about a half dozen king rooms) Our room was very large - could have accomodated another King with adaquate walking room remaining. The double queen rooms appeared somewhat more cramped, with limited space next to the beds. As is common in older hotels, electric outlets is a bit of a challenge. No extra power near the bed, and we had to rotate power supplies to keep a laptop, cell phone and blackberry's all charged. One significant negative is the very VERY small bathrooms. A tub, sink and camode with room to stand is all you get. Nice shampoo and conditioner in large wall mounted pump bottles in the shower, a bar of soap and towels. No extras. My mother in law complained that there was nowhere to hang a towel - the only towel bar is in over the bathtub. The only other significant complaint is that the 2 very small elevators are inadaquate to service the 10 floor hotel. 4 - 5 minute waiting times were normal during peak hours. Each elevator can handle only 6 people at a time so arriving at the lobby to find 10 people waiting (happened more than once in our week long stay) resulted in an unacceptable wait. One other point to note - the matresses are rather firm. Great for my wife, not so great for me.

I'm somewhat surprised by the previous review shown below, as I had a very nice greeting at reception (even though I was arriving from the countryside in GoreTex and walking shoes due to the stormy weather, Iand found staff in both the hotel staff gracious and helpful). My room was booked at special rate on a 24-hour \"special\" so I certainly received no special treatment because of the room rate! My single room was somewhat small, but well-appointed. The bathroom is finished in sleek white tile and and is small, but I certainly did not find it unusually so, especially for an historic boutique-type hotel, where I have different expectations than when staying at a Sheraton or even a Ramada Inn. I don't know how this compares to other rooms in the hotel. Though I was given a room right adjacent to the elevator on the 10th floor, I could not .hear the elevator and noticed no noise. I also can't tolerate being next to an ice machine room, but it isn't located on the 10th, so can't comment. The previous poster complained that they didn't put a priate note for her husband on the pillow prior to their arrival, as she requested--As far as putting notes on pillows--this wouldn't occur to me to ask . Who would be doing this for the customer, and how would they know for certain which room would be assigned until the customer arrives? Asking a bit much, IMHO. The hotel's Andaluca Restaurant is a delight, with Mediterranean cuisine using local Northwest produce, seafood, etc. I highly recommend their prix fixe Mediterranean Tour menu, with several choices among three courses of samplers of of many kinds, at $18 at lunch, $30, dinner, pp. It also has an excellent staff, pleasant and efficient, but unobtrusive.

I had written to the hotel before our stay telling them about our celebrations and asking if they could just put a note on my husband's pillow ( 'The best husband in the world sleeps here') or something similar. They claimed not to have received my e mail and had no knowledge of a similar note added to our booking form and couldn't care less that our room and the lack of attention has spoiled the stay for me even before it started. I commented in a disappointed way rather than complain as I didn't want to make things uncomfortable for my husband. But there was no apology-just defensiveness. We were rather begrudgingly given a free drink in the bar as compensation. The bar, however, ( Olivers) is fabulous-best martini ever. The staff here were friendly and delightful and the restaurant was great. The hotel is also very central-right next to the Westlake Centre and transport links. We made the best of the room as it was obvious that there was no point in commenting further and I didn't want to spoil our trip.

They are very friendly and will help with practically anything. -Clean rooms -one day we didn't even leave the room. Housekeeping called to check if we wanted our room cleaned and just asked that we let them know if we wanted towels or anything. -Good pressure and temp in the shower at any time of day. -Good WiFi. Just call down to the front desk for the password. NEGATIVES -the pillows were way too soft! my neck hurt by the end of the trip and we had too much stuff to travel with to bring my own pillow. this is just my opinion, though. -They got rid of the vending machines. You could either buy a $4 bottle of water in the room (not worth it), or hike it a few blocks to Ralph's market where you can buy the same water for half the price. -We went to eat at Oliver's lounge, attached to the hotel.

Received an awesome rate of CDN$129. Rates for our room would usually go for over $200 a night. We think it was because we booked the room just for one night (Saturday) and just two days before we were in Seattle. They may have just been trying to fill the rooms. Upon our arrival, check-in was excellent. The front desk was extremely helpful, we used the valet service and it was $15 for 24 hours with unlimited in-out privileges. Considering that the hotel was on 4th Avenue. It was an awesome deal. When we got to our room, it was on the 11th floor (the hotel only has 12 floors), the front desk had booked us into a quiet corner suite and the room was immaculate. Others mention that it was smaller but for a married couple, it was just fine. The bed was comfortable, the sitting area with the TV and the desk with the mirror was helpful for putting on makeup since the bathroom didn't have much counterspace. The bathroom was small but had all the essentials. A good flowing shower, plenty of towels, complimentary products and bathrobes. We only stayed for one night so we didn't even use all the products but it was definitely great. Keep in mind, this hotel was built back in the 20's (i think) and it has been renovated a few times but the essence of the old-school style wasn't lost but it didn't feel dated or grungy at all, in fact, we felt like it was a great little getaway hotel that was close to the main downtown Seattle area. The lobby lounge, Oliver's, has really good martinies, they have won competitions for it. It was really nice also with the big windows and the high ceilings because you could watch people walking by and enjoy a tasty drink at the same time. A great before-dinner option. The concierge was extremely helpful, he gave us some options for how to spend the night and we gave him ideas of what we wanted to do and he gave us suggestions that fit it perfectly. The restaurant Andaluca's, we didn't go to but supposedly they have the best mediterranean, we will definitely check it out next time we visit. Overall, our stay at Mayflower was excellent. We would highly recommend. Even though it is rated 3.5 stars, it could be 4 stars for sure but since it is rated 3.5 i guess you are even more pleasantly surprised.

However, I mostly walked everywhere, because the hotel was at the most just a few blocks from everywhere I wanted to go. Although the decor in the room was a little dated, it was not what I would call shabby -- and the room was kept very clean. And I loved the botanical art on the walls of the room (that type of art is one of my favorites). So many hotels have very unremarkable art hanging in the rooms -- this was a step above the usual, in my opinion. Some people don't care much about art, though, so take that comment with a grain of salt if you are that type. The service in this hotel was excellent. I stayed 4 nights and rarely had to call for anything, but when I did my concerns were addressed promptly. This hotel is not part of a chain. It has been locally owned for over 30 years.

For those of you looking for a beautifully furnished, timeless and intimate boutique hotel located in the heart of downtown and providing superb service, food and ambience, I can't say enough about selecting the Mayflower Park for your next visit to Seattle.", "Date": "November 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cNice room in Downtown Seattle\u201d", "Author": "WineTool", "ReviewID": "UR21829131", "Content": "A business trip to Seattle brought me to the Mayflower Park hotel for two nights. Although I had lived in Seattle for much of my life, I'd never noticed the place or (amazingly enough) been to Andaluca or the hotel bar. Overall, this was a fine place to stay; it's a solid downtown hotel. LOCATION The hotel is centrally located, at 4th and Olive. Although I didn't do much sightseeing, it's walking distance from a number of Seattle attractions. Close to the Market, close to the Waterfront, close to Westlake... you get the idea. Mind you, central location does have its occasional downside as well. There's a lot of traffic on the surrounding streets, and I did notice a little traffic noise in my room. It didn't bother me, but if you're sensitive to that, you might want to look elsewhere. ROOMS I stayed in a Deluxe guestroom (a step up from the Classic), which had plenty of room and a nice configuration. There was a large bar area that had the coffee maker and a sink, which was nice to have. The workstation was large and functional, perfect if you need to work on the road. The bathroom was small an unspectacular, but nicely appointed and perfectly functional. I'm not a huge fan of Queen Anne Style (as the hotel describes their decor), but it seemed pretty understated and didn't bother me. There was no noise from other rooms or the hallway, but there was some early-morning street noise. Know your tolerance for traffic noise and plan accordingly. FACILITIES/LOBBY The lobby is small, but nicely appointed. Not much to say about it. Oliver's, the bar, is a good place to have a drink, and always looked inviting when I returned to the hotel. Bar help was friendly and they have Pike Place Ale on tap, always a plus for me. Aside from WiFi, I didn't use the business facilities, so I'm not sure what they're like. There's also a workout room, which I never found time to use. RESTAURANT I ate at the very chic-looking Andaluca the first night I was there and was very pleased. I sat at the small bar in the restaurant and got great service. If you like shellfish, don't miss the baked mussels; they were stunningly good, and went really well with a glass of Spanish bubbly. I wanted to go back the second night but had already made other dinner plans. I'll go back when I get the chance. STAFF Hotel staff was helpful and tolerant of my questions and occasional mishaps (like losing my room key). I'd describe the help as professional if slightly aloof in some instances -- not a problem for me, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by warmth. Bar and restaurant staff were professional, attentive, and friendly. SUMMARY If you're looking for a decent hotel in a great downtown location, this should fit the bill. The restaurant and bar are the strong points, although everything was certainly better-than-acceptable. For a two-night business trip, the location and amenities were just what I needed, and the stay was uneventful. I'd rate it at the lower end of \"above average\"", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Staff\u201d", "Author": "NOCALIFE", "ReviewID": "UR21259304", "Content": "This hotel was great.

Our flights came in very early and left really late, but they were able to accommodate an early check in and a late check out with no problems. I had booked their Rise and Shine package, so we had a delicious breakfast sent up to our room every morning. And it's true what others say---Olivers is great! We enjoyed their cocktails (especially the infused Bloody Mary) each night before having dinner in town. The front desk staff and concierge was very helpful and polite. We got a room on the 12th floor in the corner, so we had great views. Although the room was smaller than an average sized hotel room, it suit our needs perfectly. Also, at the suggestion of others on tripadvisor we took the Downtown Airporter through Grayline for $18 each, roundtrip. It picked up/dropped off at the Westin less than 2 minutes away from the Mayflower Park. This was a super easy alternative to taking a cab from the airport/downtown. We had considered renting a car, but glad we didn't in the end. Everything was easy to get to without a car. Location wise the hotel was perfect for our needs. We walked to the Pikes Place Market everyday. Also, having the monorail and Westlake Center (food court/shopping) attached to the hotel made travel to Seattle Center easy. We celebrated one night with dinner at the Space Needle restaurant. It is overpriced as other say, but it was worth the experience and views. Plus you have to consider the $16 per person you'd spend just to go up it, so it worked out! We also went on the Savory Seattle Food tour through The Pikes Place Market and it was great! Well worth the time and money. Overall, we had a great trip to Seattle and the Mayflower Park Hotel is probably the biggest reason why!

We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights at the beginning of a 10 day trip to the Puget Sound area and returned for the last two nights. Our first room was a very nice large deluxe room on an upper floor with a king bed and sitting area with sofa, two chairs and coffee table. We slept with the window open a couple of inches and were not bothered by street sounds. Rooms in Seattle were scarce at the end of our trip, so we emailed the hotel after getting the first reservation and were able to get a smaller room, about the size of a standard Marriott room, with two queen beds and two bathrooms on a lower floor at the same price. Both were very nice rooms, great for sleeping with good maid service, but being an historic building, the bathrooms were smaller than bathrooms found in newer properties. The front desk staff provided good recommendations for dining and were extremely pleasant. On the evening of our arrival we had a light meal and drinks in Oliver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the hotel lounge. The food and service was good. Preferring a light breakfast, we used coffee shops and cafes out of the hotel. We opted to pick up our rental car at a downtown location at the end of our 1st two nights, preferring to explore large cities on foot and eliminated both the valet parking and airport rental car concession fees. Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus service ($18pp roundtrip) from SeaTac to the nearby Weston Hotel worked well and we walked the two blocks to the Mayflower Park.

The 2nd floor of the hotel links to the Westlake Center Mall which we enjoyed, and there is lots of shopping available around this hotel's location. We had one room with 1 queen bed, and another room with 2 queen beds. Both were clean, with comfortable beds. The 2-queen room had a flat screen TV while the 1-queen room had a normal model. Both had desks with chairs, cozy sitting chairs, and free wireless connection. The shower/bath was great with plenty of hot water and terrific pressure. The decor is very charming, and it was quiet--we never heard any noise from neighbors or otherwise. One of us ate in Andaluca for breakfast (opens at 6:30am) and it was nice but pricey ($11-16). The rest opted for Starbuck's which is only a half block down 4th Ave. For lunch, we loved P.F. Chang's which was just around the corner. We enjoyed our stay very much, and would like to return when we have more time to spend in Seattle. All the staff, from the desk attendants to the bellmen to the concierge, were very warm and responsive to our questions and needs.

For the rates we paid, it was a decent value for downtown Seattle. The location truly is the best selling feature of the hotel. We were able to easily walk to all the major downtown attractions, even the Space Needle. The attached mall with the monorail stop, was a great convenience. Pike Place is a short downhill jaunt and the fabulous Tom Douglas eateries are scattered throughout the area (Palace Kitchen and Dahlia Lounge/Bakery are not to be missed). The front desk was staffed by friendly, attentive service professionals. Check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient. We had a mixed experience with the doormen/bellmen/valet staff that lounge in the entrance. Doors were opened and held sporadically and conversations among the bellmen apparently took priority over guest service. Yes, the elevators are slow, but this was nothing we had a problem with. We had a king size corner room with couch and side chair seating area on the 9th floor. We had no issues with street noise, and enjoyed the view of the city. The room was a perfectly comfortable for two. The bed could have been a bit more plush. The mattress was just okay and could be due for replacement. The bathroom was a good size and was tucked around the corner, giving the room a nice layout and a break from cookie-cutter, chain hotels.

I don't usually compliment hotels on their valet service, but in this case it proved another distinct plus, especially since parking (normally $25 overnight) had been included in my package rate (check for specials if booking through the hotel website). The valets were extremely quick to bring the car around when I called from my room, alert to pick up the keys whenever I returned to the hotel, and volunteered to give directions.

This place gets busy, so the wait for drinks can be a bit, but it was never very long. We used the valet several times and they were always very quick.

Getting the car was relatively quick, never a long wait (and supposedly the hotel was fully booked the time we were there) The room was always cleaned on a timely basis. One time we thought we lost our phone (after we had already come up the room) so the valet searched our car for us and even pulled our car up and helped us look for it again. 2) Location-Short walk to Pike Place Market and connected to the Westlake Center (monorail/stores/food court) 3) The king suite was spacious with a refrigerator and wet bar (convenient to bring back drinks since there is a Walgreens and Rite Aid about 2 blocks away), 2 tv's, and 2 thermostats (one for the bedroom and one for the sofa area) Negatives- 1) Noise level-note from the other rooms but from the street below (Our room sat right at the corner of Olive and 4th) I don't know how it is from the higher floors (the hotel is only 12 stories tall) but being on the lower floors you will defintely hear road noise from buses and cars (worse if you open the window). If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room. The noise didn't bother me but I didn't need an alarm in the morning with all the buses passing by. 2)No safe in the room-I though all hotels had one 3)Only 2 elevators-Not really a big deal, but they are slow and the staff also use the same elevators so at times you will wait (but again not too bad unless you're impatient) and the elevator are on the small side 4)Not stroller friendly-there are 2 entrances into the hotel one of which is a flight of like 10 steps (the main entrance)so you have to use the other entrance on the other side. And the connection to the Westlake Center is on the Mezzanine Level where you also have to go up about 15 stairs. (and again the elevator is small. 5)Less chance of getting a good view-Remember there are only 12 floors and I think you have to be on the upper floors if you want to see the water or Space Needle. Compared to the Westin across the street which is super tall and I'm sure you have a better chance of getting a better view (I'm not too much into views so I was okay with looking at the street) Overall I was very pleased with the room and the hotel and wouldn't mind staying here again.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

Initially, the Plymouth Room, their largest conference room, which is under the lobby is attractive, but can only handle 8-9 tables of 8-10 people. Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane. As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont. While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet.

We prefer to stay at hotels that have a local feel, rather than a corporate hotel. This hotel fit that bill. Our rooms were nicely furnished. My husband and I had a corner room (I specifically requested because the deluxe ones are slightly larger). On the 10th floor we had a fun view of the Macy's marquee out one window and the Seattle Space Needle out the other. Our kids shared a double queen that had 2 seperate bathrooms! and an amazing picture view ot the Needle. Having 2 bathrooms for the kids was a very pleasant surprise, because the bathrooms are not large. One of my few complaints about this hotel is the lack of vanity space and the very low water pressure (at least on the 10th floor.) I am not sure exactly how many rooms have this double bathroom feature, but I would ask about it if I were booking here again.

While the bathroom was small and the showerhead was so low on the wall that showering was an adventure, that is to be expected of an older hotel and it was neither inconvenient nor overly unpleasant. The customer service was fantastic. Our flight was incredibly late, and they accomodated our 2 am check-in. The valet service was also very nice. The bed, pillows, and sheets were very comfortable. I'm a light sleeper and I slept wonderfully, even with a room directly next to the elevators. The best part, however, was the amazing view of downtown Seattle. We even saw a Martin Luther King Jr. parade pass right under our window the morning we left! My only complaint was the expense of the parking ($28/day), something of which we were not made aware until we checked out. Next time we won't bring a rental car, or we will park it somewhere else ourselves.

I chose it for the very central location -- walking distance to the Pikes Market, Space Needle, ferry terminal, monorail, etc.; the price-point -- about $215/night plus tax; and the good reviews here and elsewhere. The biggest problem was that our room's air conditioning was not working. It was close to 80 degrees in the room. An engineer came up twice, but the problem was never fixed. Ultimately, the engineer admitted to us our room had a problem as did another room on our floor. We had to ask to be moved to another room -- no offer was made. The substitute room looked out at a brick wall. It appeared to be a single -- full bed, not queen; one nightstand; no table by the reading chair as in our first room. The room rate was adjusted down, but it was a lesser room, so it just ended up feeling like the hotel didn't care more than the minimum necessary. On Sunday, our room was not made up until 4:30 in the afternoon, after we had been out all day and returned hoping to relax for a while. When our bill was prepared, we were incorrectly double-charged. The hotel provides one computer for free internet access, but it is not easily found and no one told us about it. Not awful problems, just annoying. The Mayflower is a place with lots of brass trim, big flower arrangements in the lobby, and you have to call room service if you want ice. If that's your style, and if the air conditioning in your room is working, I think you'll find the Mayflower to be a fair choice. If you're like me, and favor modern accommodations, no opulent frllls, consistent quality, and a feeling you are a valued customer. . . you may end up deciding the Mayflower Park is a bit underwhelming.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eatonton, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful room and great service at the Mayflower Park Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "brerrabbit", "ReviewID": "UR5513540", "Content": "Mayflower Park Hotel Review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6/30/06 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7/2/06 and 7/9/06 My husband and I visited Seattle for the first time earlier this month, in conjunction with a cruise to Alaska. We always try to stay at historic hotels if possible, instead of the cookie cutter big box hotels where you would be hard-pressed to know what city or state you were in. We read the reviews of the Mayflower Park Hotel on Trip Advisor, then found their website on the Internet. I was hesitant about staying here at first, after reading Trip Advisor reviews about the small rooms and bathrooms. When I called to get more information, I was told by reservations that the deluxe rooms were about 100 square feet larger then the classic rooms. I knew through my research that all hotel rooms in downtown were very expensive, and I was pleasantly surprised to be told that with an AAA or AARP discount of 30%, the rate for the deluxe room would be $179 instead of $255. I reserved a deluxe room with a queen bed for 2 nights prior to the cruise, and for 1 night after we returned. I then received an immediate confirmation by e-mail. The Mayflower Park was the best of all the places we have stayed in the Historic Hotels of America group. The restoration/renovation of the hotel is beautiful and everything about our stay was fabulous! We arrived from the airport shortly after noon, and were surprised to find our room ready for an early check-in. Check-in was a breeze and our luggage was quickly brought up to our room. Our room was beautiful and very large! Room 815, which was on the northwest corner, faces Macys to the west and had a view of the Space Needle to the north, although the flagpole atop of the flatiron building next door competed somewhat with the Space Needle view. We also had a small glimpse of the snow covered Cascades between the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-rises. This corner room was bright with 3 sets of windows, very spacious and beautifully decorated. Queen bed, 2 bedside tables, armoire with television, 2 upholstered chairs with a table in-between, and a desk with chair in an extended area that also had a wet bar with granite countertop, a small under counter refrigerator and a coffee maker. The coffee packs that were furnished were without a doubt the best hotel room coffee I have ever had! Bathrobes, hair dryer, ironing board and iron were in the closet (small) and the bathroom was also somewhat small, but beautiful with a new pedestal sink, large tub and a great showerhead. The only drawback here was the close placement of the toilet between the tub and the door. Not much wiggle room there! The toiletries that were furnished were top of the line. When the bellman brought our luggage, he told us that the rooms that ended in the number 15 (815, 915, 1015, etc.) were all the same large corner rooms. The front desk called a couple of minutes later to ask if we needed anything, and the only thing I requested was to have the same room for the following Sunday night, after we returned from our cruise. We were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go in the downtown area. Pike Place Market was just 3 blocks away. See\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Candies was 1 block. We also walked to Pioneer Square, the Smith building, the new library and the ferry terminal to Bainbridge. We took a city bus up to the Seattle Center, and then walked up to Lake Union for the Wooden Boat show. Weather was gorgeous! Would I stay at the Mayflower Park again? You bet! Would I recommend it to others? Yes, most highly and without a doubt! Service (front desk, concierge, bellmen and housekeeping) was excellent. Location was great. Room 815 was wonderful.

When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running. Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room. The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size.

However, the warmth of the staff over the years (with little turn-over, actually) and the coziness of both the connected bar, Oliver's (one of the best Martini bars in Seattle- a MUST!!! even if you don't stay here) and Andaluca restaurant, which is pricey but tastey (free wine tastings on Wednesdays) are sometimes worth the small rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near several restaurants and many stores: Macy's (they give you discounts for this former Bon Marche at the hotel), Nordstroms, Abercrombie, Sophora, etc. The hotel is connected to Westlake Mall (another convenience), and the monorail is on the top floor that can take you to the Space Needle, park, and Experience Music. The Simpson's did a take-off on this one minute monorail, another part of Seattle life. Each room is carpeted with an armoir that contains a t.v. and drawers for whatever, no mini-bar. The beds are quite comfortable, and a.c. or heat are generally in good working order. If you're uncomfortable, go down to the desk and let them know- they will re-accomodate you. The restrooms are nice, but have limited space just above the sink on a glass railing to place personal items. Aveda products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion) are provided as complimentary items. Showers are somewhat narrow, so it help to put the rubber mat on the floor. All closets are a very nice size with thin, cloth robes provided. Of course, very Seattle-esque, there is a Tully's on one corner and Starbucks just behind the hotel. I have read many of the reviews thus far, and I agree with all of them; however, one must remember that Seattle is the Emerald City, and people operate on a completely different level than in other parts of the country; it's part of the charm (and sometimes healthy tension). Having lived in New York, L.A., Dallas, and Houston, it was culture shock at first, but then it became delightlful and the source of good laughter. I got a good laugh from the review before mine about the guy not knowing how to make coffee- that's so Seattle. Yes, phone servce in the hotel is not the best, but Seattle people like face to face, and the responsibilities of that SMALL front desk with that many rooms and people wearing two hats is difficult.... Just relax. The lobby is GORGEOUS! A huge chandelier hanging in the front with fresh slowers put in often. The 2nd lobby floor (that connects to Westlake) contains a player piano and great sitting area fo meetings. Meeting rooms are great at his hotel, which is often the host to social events, from weddings to other celebrations. My only complaint is about the elevators: they are certainly large enough, but since the wait staff, maids, etc. use them, they often take a LONG LONG time to get to the lobby. Just go the bar, get a Martini, then catch it when you can. Make sure to visit restaurants along the Sound. The concierge (Derrick these days) is excellent, and they can get you deals that sometimes you can't- every conciege at this hotel has been both brilliant and enthusiastically helpful.", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3432715", "Content": "Stayed at the Mayflower Park in Feb 2005 for a few days and had a wonderful experience. We were able to obtain the Entertainment rate which was 50% off the rack rate. Room was very large and we had a view of the Space Needle. Front desk staff was very helpful with last minute dinner recommendations. Did not eat at the hotel because it was on the expensive side and there were so many places to eat within walking distance. Monorail entrance is located next to the hotel and the underground bus stop is down the block. Definitely would stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Mayflower Park", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d100542-Reviews-Mayflower_Park-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$172 - $242*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">405 Olive Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "100542", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c3/ea/64/hotel-lobby.jpg"}}

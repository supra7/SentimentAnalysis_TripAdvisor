Checking in, the young lady was really nice and gave me everything I needed. The room was small, and suited my needs. The fridge in the room did not work, though... and I'm not really sure the A/C worked very well either. Over all, though, it wasn't bad. In walking about the grounds, I noticed that some of the area looked a bit run down. The blinds in the housekeeping area were mangled, and quite visible for any of the guests walking by. That wasn't terribly attractive. The grounds were clean and pleasant, but \"tight\" because of the small space. Everything seems a bit cramped, including the walkways. This hotel is literally wedged between to 101 freeway and Ventura Blvd -- and that means lots of road noise. This really is the type of place you go when you just need a place to sleep -- so if noise bothers you, bring earplugs. For me, though, the worst of the experience was the next morning. While I was getting dressed, the phone kept ringing and ringing. I picked it up a few times to find a dial tone. This continued for about 30 minutes... random ringing. When I mentioned it to the guy at the front desk, he was pretty rude about it, blowing me off. He said, \"All calls come though here, lady, and there haven't been any. Are you sure you aren't hearing things?\" Yeah, that went over well. It's a good thing I was on my out and didn't want to deal with it. Breakfast was okay. Apparently, they've recently expanded their breakfast buffet to include hot bacon and eggs. The bacon was fine... but the eggs? YUCK! They are cooked from discs of salty yellow goo. Blech. The price was okay, considering that most rooms in this area (during summer) tend to be pretty high, but I've certainly been in much nicer hotels for less. However, it's a nice place and the rooms are clean and have just about anything you'd need (hairdryer, iron/ironing board. microwave, fridge (if it works), etc. The free breakfast was okay, but avoid the nuked egg patties.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "granada hills,ca", "Title": "\u201cNice but bugs ahh\u201d", "Author": "dreams42", "ReviewID": "UR96389902", "Content": "Well I have been to this hotel in the past and it has always been nice but I recently went there with my young son and my husband and the room was nice everything was pretty clean and nice.

Add to that the free internet, free parking and free breakfast. Finding all of this together under $100 per night in the LA area is hard to do. So the room overall was decent, nothing to write home about. The bed was very firm, which works for us but some others may not be so happy.

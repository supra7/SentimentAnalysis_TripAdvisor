Horrible Location.\u201d", "Author": "MikeP2K12", "ReviewID": "UR125557047", "Content": "I stayed here on business for 10 days at the end of January. I was supposed to stay for 60 days but I was smart enough to book in 10 day increments in case I didn't like the property. Here are the pros: 1) Big Rooms 2) Cheap Here are the cons: 1) These are not suites, they are one large room with no separation. 2) The staff is extremely unprofessional. I had an issue with a shower head that I'll get into in a minute. They wear whatever they feel like wearing to work and they are never at the counter. Usually playing on their phones in the back office with a tall wall mirror set against the door so they can see customers. There is absolutely no uniform. Usually skull caps and sweatshirts for the guys. 3) Shower pressure. When I checked in I had no water pressure in my shower. I'm not saying that it was too weak. I mean, none. I just took a bath the first morning. After I got back to the hotel in the afternoon and explained the situation, the guy behind the counter told me that there is construction going on and they're going to fix it eventually but there was nothing that he could do. He didn't even attempt to send a maintenance person to look at the problem. This also happened on Day 3 of my stay. On Day 4, the woman at the front desk sent a maintenance person and they changed out the shower head. Problem solved. 4) Not remotely close to anything. If you don't have a rental car, don't bother. The closest restaurant or bar is about a half mile walk. You are also on top of a hill so you have to walk down a long drive just to get to hotel circle. 5) Didn't feel safe. The property only has one person on duty after 1600 or so. There was no screening of guests. Anybody could just walk in and do whatever they wanted and there is no way the hotel staff can do anything about it. I felt like it was just a home invasion waiting to happen. I really just got the feeling that this hotel is the red headed step-child of Wyndham. It's dirty, dingy, old, unprofessional and just a bad place to stay. Pay a little more and get a better room in a better location. I'm spending the rest of my time at the Crowne Plaza across the street. It's not that much more expensive but the difference couldn't be greater. The management in this hotel needs to be fired or start caring about what it is that they do. I felt as though they had no control of anything. When I wanted to talk to the manager on a couple of occasions I was told that he doesn't get to work until 1100 and that he leaves by 1500. Ridiculous. I read other reviews where people are describing the great beds in the rooms. I was not impressed. My bed was an old mattress with a newer pillow topper placed on it. It did not feel good. I didn't sleep very well due to the fact that the first couple nights I was just waiting for the bed bugs to start attacking me in my sleep.

Hawthorn suites is a little difficult to find like other reviewers stated but hotel circle is all hotels so theyre all right next to each other it could get confusing but its not anything to complain about because if you know what you're looking for it shouldn't be a problem. The water pressure was the only thing to complain about, at least in room 216 you're better off taking a bath, plenty of hot water though! Other reviews complained about running out so I was worried but it was endless for me, and my 2 other family members. The toilet flushed weird and the sink drained a little slow. But nothing inconvenient. The room is big! Plenty of room for an entire family. The fold out couch wasn't as uncomfortable as I assumed it'd be and the bed was so comfortable! Great pillows and blanket. Very clean as all, the entire room was cleaned well. Hotel staff is great! So friendly and breakfast was good! It's a buffet. And like with any hotel, get there early to get the best food and variety (that's obvious and shouldn't be complained about, you cannot expect to show up 5 mins before it's over and get what you want) They also have coffee available 24/7 it seems. Laundry is available. No pool, but there is a jacuzzi. Vending machines down stairs, free wifi, flat screen tv, computer downstairs in lobby for use along with printer. Over all good experience, I will stay again, so close to sdsu for anyone coming to visit their children it's a convenient location! Best deal too ( I booked thru priceline bid now option) I save over 20$ a night and they had a stay three night save deal. 80$ a night plus tax of course is what I paid for Thursday-Sunday.

(Tip: The Double Tree next door has a great breakfast buffet). There is no restaurant on the premisses, but the front desk will kindly provide you with affordable delivery options. The exterior needs renovation, but the rooms inside are nice. I had a one bedroom suite which far exceeded my expectations and ultimately left me feeling very pleased. There was a fairly spacious living room with a kitchenette and two tvs in the suite. There wasn't a full partition between the \"bedroom\" and the living room. Even though they are a bit separated, there's no true privacy between the two areas. I found this layout to be quite nice, but this may not be what you're expecting. The free wi-fi worked well and I found myself to be very comfortable in the room. For some reason my reservation through a third party site did not show up in the hotel's system when I checked a week before my arrival.

Since there were several family members attending we need rooms large enough to accommodate everyone and lots of stuff for the busy weekend. I was thrilled to receive a great price through priceline.com (name your own price) and figured it wouldn't be perfect but the price was. To even find the Hawthorne suites took an act of congress as the property sits behind two other properties. Their tiny sign is located adjacent to a very narrow road which leads up to the property. After a few drive-bys, we finally found it. First thing we noticed when we approached their main entrance were employees smoking right by the front door. I guess they don't have a smoking area for their employees. I loved it when we opened our room door and was greeted to a giant discolored stain on the carpet. It looked like someone had dumped bleach on it :-) Ok, whatever. However, I was thrilled with the sight of black hair in the bathtub. I ran down to the front desk to retrieve a container of comet so I could clean the tub. There are certain things I won't trust to others once they have screwed it up, like me booking this place for family members. Ok, whatever. Now I'm assuming the beds were from the stone ages, probably from the Fred Flintstone era because they were as comfortable as sleeping on rocks. After messing around with the air conditioner we assumed it didn't work. However the following day when we returned it was like walking into a giant sub-zero refrigerator. If you decide to stay here give your A/C at least 24 hours to turn on or request a manual from the front desk for detailed instructions. In all fairness, we didn't spend much time in our room and the breakfast was ok as reported by my mother-in law. The rooms are very large and basically clean except for our nasty tub. The property itself could use lots of new paint and carpet. A gardener and a broom would be a welcome sight and proper signage should be a must. However, I really enjoyed the staff at the front desk. They had printed directions to anywhere you may want to go in San Diego. Their staff recommended great restaurants.

The young man at the reception desk was very helpful when we arrrived with car trouble, directing us to a repair facility and providing a map. Other staff seemed not as helpful. While there is a sign in the bathroom saying not to take the towels to the spa as there are towels provided there, this proved not to be the case, and we had to walk back to our room dripping wet and cold. When we mentioned this to the front desk, their only response was, \"Oh, we had to move them to the front desk, as they kept disappearing.\" I would think they could modify the signs in the bathroom or add a small sign at the front desk. Also, after we had checked out, my daughter realized she had left her camera charger plugged into an outlet. She called the hotel multiple times about it, but no one ever called back. Breakfast was OK - fruit cocktail (not fresh fruit), scrambled eggs and bacon, cereal, bagels. Waffles were good the one day that the waffle iron was there. The breakfast area is small. There's a large sign at the area entrance saying it's not allowed to take food from the area. This doesn't strike me as very friendly, especially when there's not enough space to eat in the breakfast room. Why not allow it, as Residence Inn does, both as a guest convenience and to free up space. The hotel location is good. While it's on busy Hotel Circle, it's set back from the street up against a hillside, so is very quiet, and convenient to all area attractions.

We had booked two King suites with kitchenettes. We were told the rooms we were getting were standards with two double beds and no kitchenette. We could also see the sister location from their site.

The girl at the desk seemed apathetic and put-out that we were making a fuss. We even called Expedia, but the hotel insisted they were offering us a comparable room. COMPARABLE!?! Charging us for King beds and kitchens and giving us doubles down the street is not quite comparable in my mind. Even American Express was not able to remedy the situation because the hotel continued to lie and insist that they had given a comparable option. To make matters even more disgusting, a man who was checking in as we arrived came back down while we were still arguing and said that he was checking out because the room was filthy and unacceptable. The woman at the desk, without looking at the room or offering to send housekeeping through, said we could have that one. We declined...

Apparently not enough time to buy some syrup... Front desk staff told me that management is too greedy to place some WiFi boosters around the hotel, so even at the reception the WiFi signal was 'Very Low' Most of the time we had no WiFi in the room which was a reason to checkout early to go to the Residence Inn next door to do our daily online work. Front desk staff seemed very frustrated by the great number of complaints they got. They was not interested, unpolite and rude. Apparently they could dream our complaints already If you can get this hotel for $50 or less, just take it and expect nothing But the $240 we had to pay was outrageous and very well overpaid..

Everything was clean and comfortable except I that I couldn't figure out a way to fully open the windows. A huge plus was the free wireless that worked flawlessly, but I got the impression also other hotels in the region offered that. Parking was free, plenty and felt safe. The hotel was nicely situated a bit above the street and the room was thus very quiet. Breakfast was included but nothing special, or actually quite weird for my European taste (sausages, omelette, chili) but could serve well 'truck driver' types trying to survive with it through the day.

I phoned guest services and spoke with Sue, who was extremely helpful, who phoned the hotel and connected me with Darryl, the district manager. He was adamant that I could not be reimbursed for the error. In his opinion, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the fault of the hotel. After speaking with him for a few minutes, he reluctantly agreed to have the front desk manager, Lourdes, seek comparable hotel rooms in San Diego and follow up with me before the end of the business day. On Friday, March 24, 2006, two business days later, Lourdes sent me an e-mail and suggested I make a reservation with the Residence Inn San Diego. (I made a reservation with the Residence Inn prior to her suggestion as I had not heard back from the staff at Hawthorn and wanted a guaranteed reservation.) On Tuesday, March 28, 2006, I contacted Darryl to learn the details of their reservation guarantee policy. The policy notes that Hawthorn must pay the full cost of the first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lodging if a suite or room is not available because of an unintentional error. Additionally the staff should make every effort to find accommodations for me at a nearby Hawthorn, or a comparable hotel and pay the cost of a telephone call to notify your home or office of your change in accommodations. Darryl was incorrigible. He was vehemently against paying for the first night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay because he felt that the error was not done by the hotel. Furthermore, he stated that his staff had done enough by referring me to another hotel although the above referenced policy states that it is their responsibility to do so.

Their staff is not always the best trained or most sophisticated, but if you approach them in a friendly and respectful manner I think you find that they will reciprocate for the most part. Its obvious they are saving money on staffing, but this did not detract from my stay.

The girl behind the desk explained that \"corporate and their location don't communicate very well\" Duh! I would book through the hotel directly.

I travel weekly for business and have periodically had this happen to me when I check in to a hotel late at night or during a convention, but none of this applied. One of my colleagues actually did check in and went up to her room to find it terribly dated, dirty and with a bed visibly sagging. She came back down to the lobby, very dissatisfied. I continued to press the desk clerk for a non-smoking room and she voluntarilly said she could put me in a non smoking two room suite. I told her this would be fine. She then disappeared into the back room and came back with a change in the rate from $87 to $159 a night because of the \"room upgrade\". I explained to her that this was unacceptable and I would only pay the rate which I guaranteed to my credit card. She again went in the back and came back with an older man in street clothes who then accused me of making his employee cry. At this point I told him in my 15 years of weekly travel, I have never encountered this. I am a Diamond Level member in Hyatt's Gold Passport program (of which Hawthorn participates). In the end, he was extremely rude and refused to honor the rate or provide a non-smoking room. We then cancelled all three of our reservations and moved to a much nicer property.

I love this hotel. No, it's not the Ritz, but the prices are also not the Ritz. If you are looking for a hotel with spa and little mints on your pillow, no this may not be the place for you. When I call, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and they already have me in their system so they always greet me with a smile. I get my room quickly - always oceanfront - and the room is always reasonably clean - reasonable as in \"lived in\" but livable. The food is much like a lot of other hotels but, hey, it's free so why not? Never seen a bedbug there but if I did, I am certain they would change me to another room. Shower always worked, door was always fine, no problems. Loved the pool and hot tub (although the hot tub could use some updating). LOVED the Tiki bar. And the closeness of the beach just beyond the pool is incredible. I never stay in the hotel long enough to whine and complain about everything I'm not getting. That's not what I am there for. The hotel is comfortable and the atmosphere is great - not snobbish like a lot of the others. I like it.

This is an old structure well kept, clean, the pool is good, with complimentary breakfast (that is not bad). The only thing I would recommend is that they update the game room for bigger kids and paint or cover the back area of the pool to make it more appealing to the eye, but besides that I have no concerns.

One room smelled horribly like paint, so much so that it gave you a headache after being in it for five minutes. The other room had a horrible smell that I don't even know how to describe. I guess it was a mix of mildew, dirty carpet, and smoke (although I don't think it was a smoking room). They don't have a computerized key/lock system. They instead have the old fashioned plastic keys with the holes in it which made me nervous to begin with. We got confused with the keys and while trying to figure out which one worked for which room, realized that one of them worked for both. We went down to the desk to tell them and I guess the maintenance man didn't believe us because he gave us attitude as he followed us to the rooms. Turned out ANY key could open that room so back to the front desk. They did give us two new rooms and apologized. The rooms smelled a little better (although still not good) and they skeeved us out, but I pulled the sheets off the bed for inspection and did not find any bugs. The hot tub didn't have any water in it which was disappointing. Although the pool was nice, first my daughter got too close to the water intake, which had very strong suction and a really sharp edge, and it sucked her finger in and cut her hand. Then my son got too close to the intake and it sucked his stomach skin into it which gave him a welt which lasted days.

My husband and I were planning on going to pcb but due to the oil changed to daytona at the last minute. I went through bookit.com and found the islander for 60 a night oceanfront. Too good to be true? Not exactly. I immediately booked it. I didn't even look at any reviews. After the room was reserved I started to look on tripadvisor and quickly became VERY nervous, but everything went great. Checked in two hours early with no problem (the manager was very nice) also last minute we invited my mother and expected an extra person fee but the lady said it was no problem. The elevators didn't spell like urine or anything nasty as other people stated. I guess they have never been to a beach hotel, they just spelled like beach and chlorine. We were on the fourth floor and it was very clean as well as our room. Was it old and in need of some updates like new carpet? Yes, but it wasn't something overwhelming or gross just old. The view was AMAZING. The pool was clean and so was the spa. We liked that rules like pool hours weren't that strict. Swimming in the pool with the moon light was pretty and romantic. Basically if you come to fl to live in your room you might be dissapointed but if you come for the beach the pool and amazing views at a cheap price it's perfect. One note though the breakfast is bread cereal or oatmeal oj and coffee, so not much to it. And one last thing there is a 100 deposit per person under 26 which can be paid cash or credit. We paid cash and recieved the full 200 back no problems. They didn't STEAL or trick us out of any money. Overall our stay was pretty plesant.

This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in. I am by no means a person that is snooty or has really high standards. I am not wealthy. I just expect that when I stay somewhere that the place be clean. In my honest opinion, Motel 6 is a step up from this place. Here is our experience\u2026. We booked our 2-night-stay at the Islander Resort at Daytona Beach Shores, on their website. It looks like a decent place from the pictures and descriptions. And for the rates it seems like a great deal. Our initial price was $49 per night plus tax. Sounds great right? Let me first tell you what the website does not. A $5 per day parking fee will be automatically added in to your bill. We arrived at the hotel on 6/25/08. The place looks a bit rundown from the outside but I kept my hopes up. The lobby is very well kept. New carpeting and furniture. We also had a nice experience with the front desk clerk. She was very friendly and helpful. Things were looking promising. We got up to the 3rd floor hall and noticed immediately how different things started to look compared to the lobby. The carpet was tattered and dirty, the paint on the walls was peeling, it smelled bad like fish or something, and everything just looked old and worn, in very bad need of an update. When we entered our room is when things got worse. The carpeting was stained and VERY dirty. Don\u2019t even think about walking around barefoot in these rooms. The comforters on the beds were stained and dirty, they looked as though they probably had never been washed. The paint was peeling off some of the walls. There were holes in the corners where the floor meets the wall. The carpeting clearly was not vacuumed or anything in the corners of the room, it was just plain dirty. The bathroom is very, very small. I am not kidding. So small it is just about impossible to close the door while you are in it. You pretty much have to step into the tub in order to close the bathroom door. There was human hair and pubes stuck to the walls in the bathroom. There was quite a bit of mildew in the tub. The bathroom ceiling was splattered with something brown, don\u2019t really want to know what it was. The floor was dirty, it looked as though it might have never been mopped. The only thing that appeared to be clean was the toilet. All these things that we initially noticed were upsetting but we decided could be tolerated seeing that we would not be able to get a refund since we pre-booked our reservations online. We decided to pull back the blankets on the beds and check the sheets. Always check the sheets. Immediately we noticed a couple of small black bugs crawling around on the one bed. They were tiny, about the size of fleas, but not fleas. In the other bed we found a fire ant. There were blood stains on the sheets of one of the beds. Then we checked out the bath towels\u2026some of them had human hair stuck to them. It was at this point that we went back down to the front desk and told her what we found. She immediately apologized and said housekeeping would be addressed in the morning. She gave us 2 new fresh pairs of sheets and pillowcases, as well as all new clean bath towels. So we went back up to our rooms and changed the sheets, left and went to dinner, and came back and went to bed. It was the following day that my son woke up all bitten up on his legs. After inspecting the new clean sheets once more I found more fire ants in his bed. We determined that they must be coming out of the mattresses. It was then that we decided refund or not, there was no way we were going to stay in this place one more night. We packed up our things, went down to the lobby, and told the front desk clerk we were checking out early. She couldn\u2019t have cared less. We ended up losing our money and in addition had to pay to stay at another hotel that night. But I guess it gets to a certain point when you just think there is absolutely no way you can tolerate some things, and $$ is no longer a deciding factor.

Due to last minute reservations alot of places were sold out. I called the 800 number to stay at the Acapulco which was sold out and the Islander was one of the few options that fit our needs. The hotel is somewhat old but the room was decent. We had an ocean front room with kitchen on the second floor. The patio was great and we spent alot of time out there. The only complaint with the room was the small bathroom but we made due. The kitchen came in very handy and made the room more spacious. The outdoor pool was great! Very clean, hardly ever full at all even though we were there with ROTC competitions in town it was still very quiet. The beach is literally a stairway from the pool, nice and clean and very vacant for the 3 days we were there. Never had a chance to drink at the tiki bar by the outside pool as it was only open on the weekend. Didn't take advantage of the breakfast as we slept in every morning and I beleive it was only available until 930 am. Didn't use Wi fi as we were on vacation but I think it was available in the lobby and not the rooms. This location was south of Daytona and a taxi ride was $17 just to Ocean Walk. We did have a rental car as well which came in very handy. The front desk lady was very nice even got us the cab and everything. Pat, I believe to be the manager, was able to let my friend who was in Daytona ahead of me check in under my name as we were stuck for 12 hours at Ohare and didnt get in until 3:30 am.

We went to the bar near the pool , ordered some drinks and started to wait , thinking that the room should be ready by 3 pm -the check-in time for the hotel. We went to the reception several times until 7pm to ask for our room keys and we got the same answer each time: \"your room is not ready yet\". We spent the whole afternoon at the parking lot waiting for our room. I was so frustrated and asked the receptionist at least to give us a time , she said she did not know. I asked for the manager, she said she the manager was checking on the housekeeping staff to make the rooms ready and not available to speak with us.She got our cell phone number and said that she will call when the room is ready. There were several other families waiting for their rooms at the parking lot in their cars, since there were no lobby area to sit and wait. Very frustrated, we decided to go our to have dinner. It was 10pm and we still did not receive that call....I called the hotel and was told that the rooms is ready this time. Honestly, I regretted that we waited that long for the room we got finally...It was a disaster.The a/c was very very noisy that I had to turn it off to sleep, the kitchen area was very old and nasty...The sheets were nasty and the pillows were too thin that I could not sleep even putting two of them onto each other. The carpet was dirty, I did not want to walk on it barefoot. There were several bangs and noises coming from other rooms all night long, could not sleep at all.

I have to say that after reading reviews from various websites I was pretty scared and was prepared to walk out and forfeit the money we prepaid if the place looked as bad as it sounded. It is obvious that the new owners/managment have made efforts to clean the place up. There was new carpet in our room and everything was nice and clean. The pool was kept very clean as well but they had some construction going on around it. They were in the process of replacing concrete and decking in the pool area but kept the work to small sections at a time so that the pool area was still very accessible. The breakfast thing was pretty non-existent so don't count on that. I think they put out a couple of doughnuts and some juice but it was too early in the a.m. for us to bother. The outside bar is very small and wasn't opened at night but it was the off-season (late August) so it was not at all crowded and didn't seem to be an issue for us.

If not, or if you are vacationing with your children, stay away.", "Date": "July 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cthe best place ever is sea garden inn hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3508876", "Content": "You just have to go to Sea Garden Inn.It is the best place ever.Although I've saw bad reports on other hotels this should never have a bad report.It was cheap for ocean front,full kitchen and one room with four people in it four five nights at the cheap price of $456.32.This is one place you should consider going to.", "Date": "May 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful setting on the Atlantic ocean\u201d", "Author": "laniejo", "ReviewID": "UR3490443", "Content": "The Sea Garden Inn sits right on the beautiful Atlantic ocean in Daytona Beach Florida.

We had been at Magic Kingdom and stopped to visit family in Daytona and needed a place to stay for the night before heading home. We checked several places and found only this hotel with two rooms available, so we took what we could get. I would have rather slept in my car after this experience. It was filthy. I was afraid to touch anything in the room and if it wasn't for my exhausted children, I would have just checked out and driven through the night to get home. There was something foamy and unrecognizable in the indoor pool and I wouldn't even go into that room to get a closer look. The hotel room was dirty as well, from top to bottom. There was mold, mildew and other undesirable odors. We had to unplug the refrigerator because it was so noisy. It had a good view, which is the ONLY positive thing I can say about it.

We got a really cheap rate of $55 a night during spring break which was really good, and expected for the place to be a dump. After reading reviews, I was suprised that it was not bad. We had an oceanfront efficiency on the 3rd floor. My only problem was the bathroom could have been a little cleaner and housekeeping needed to vacuum the room better, other than that the pool was decent and location was good since we were away from most of the college crowd. For the price I would definitely stay there again if I was looking for something cheap. We usually stay at Oceanwalk but prices were to high for the time period, so I went already being disappointed about where we were staying, but like previously said for the price it was not bad!", "Date": "March 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cDump!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3225878", "Content": "This hotel was the worst we stayed in during our recent stay in Florida.

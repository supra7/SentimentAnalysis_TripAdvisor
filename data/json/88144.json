The interior of the hotel is current, comfortable and clean. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations. It is within walking distance to all the attractions and restaurants downtown. The breakfast (included) was nice with the usual continental selections plus hard boiled eggs, yogurt, biscuits and gravy and GREAT coffee. The breakfast area is one of the largest I've seen with multiple seating areas; it was clean and well-stocked. The guest room was clean and comfortable - loved the multiple selections of pillows! I did not have much success with the wireless internet but I didn't need it since I was working at a local office all week. The covered parking is close and convenient.

Some things others may have an issue with: Parking is a little tight. I have a compact SUV and had no problem. Someone with a very large car might struggle a bit. Elevator is very small. But its only 3 stories. If able, take the stairs. Lighting in the room is not that great Our room did not have a fridge. The couple we went with had a fridge in a similar room next to us. Our room had a place for one but it was not there. If you think you need a fridge then you might want to request a room that has one. Hotel is next to Heliport. This did not bother us. You could here helicopters taking off and landing but it was only during daylight hours and I'm sure busier than normal due to Super Bowl. Walls are thin.

My check-in was efficient and the staff was friendly. Also, no problems when I had to be reassigned to a different room due to some kind of plumbing issue with my first room. Parking was plentiful and free. This LQ is in a downtown location with not much around except municipal buildings, parking lots, and lone men walking around holding plastic grocery bags. In the evening, the neighborhood looked somewhat empty and dark which might be an issue for more timid solo travelers. My room was fine \u2013 it was clean and had a flatpanel television, small fridge, and microwave. The shower stream was plenty strong. I didn\u2019t get a chance to try either the fitness facilities or the business center. I was a little concerned about noise because all the rooms overlook into a central parking courtyard but all the other guests seemed to be keeping similar hours so the evening was quiet. That was fortunate because I could hear my neighbors through the wall pretty easily \u2013 not enough to join in their conversation but enough to sense their general emotional atmosphere. Street noise wasn\u2019t a problem either probably because this is more of a civic district rather than nightlife area. Access to the freeway on my way out was easy.

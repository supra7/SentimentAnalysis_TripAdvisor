The staff was friendly, the rooms were spacious and the beds were comfortable. In the housekeeping dept, they just filled clean towels and pulled sheets up. Room could have used a vacuum after a few days. I'm guessing it is a \"clean your own\" sort of hotel. The breakfast was good! Could use some yogurt and possibly a meat such as sausage or bacon. The swimming pool was warm and clean with plenty of lounge chairs and tables. I loved the tropical surroundings of palm trees and other plants around the pool area. We also grilled a few steaks on the properties grills which were clean and in good working order. The location was wonderful situated right next to I-4 and very close to Disney theme parks.

However, it also happens to be right by the I-4, and if you happen to be one of the lucky ones with a room facing the interstate, prepare for a substantial amount of road noise. That's what we experienced. The hotel itself is average, though clean and in good repair overall. We enjoyed the fact that the rooms were suites (having three kids), but the hideaway bed was very poor quality. Thankfully, we just had small kids who didn't need a lot of extra support, but an adult would have had a very difficult time on that bed. The floor probably would have been better. There was a nice, good sized refrigerator / freezer together with a stove, microwave, sink, and dishwasher. They didn't have enough chairs for the suite, just two, so we had a very difficult time sitting around the table. They should have at least three chairs, probably four. The pool is located in the center of the complex. It's fairly large, very accessible, and in good condition. We were pleased with it. The clubhouse also is nice. The breakfast is probably about average, maybe a little above. They have precooked eggs, which don't look especially appetizing, but actually tasted pretty good. They also alternated between precooked waffles and french toast, both fairly tasty. They are sticklers for the bracelets that they give you at check in, which you are all supposed to wear at breakfast. Down sides for the hotel include the nearness to the interstate--we had a lot of road noise in our room, which was disappointing. If you have a room overlooking the pool or on the side away from the interstate, I imagine it wouldn't be nearly as disturbing. The interiors of the rooms are dated as well. They also make you pay for the entire visit up front, which kinds of smacks of second class operation. The room cleaning service was a little indifferent, not especially timely, and they only had two small garbage cans--one under the sink and one in the bathroom. It would have been nice to have another. Overall we were happy enough with our hotel, and pleased that it was so close to Walt Disney World, our destination, but if we went back, we'd probably pay a little more to move up the hotel range. The road noise was the biggest disappointment.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belleriver", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent place to stay with incredible service.\u201d", "Author": "Johnyz", "ReviewID": "UR127934435", "Content": "There were approx 30 of us that came and stayed here.

Anyway, I notice the full size kitchen, with brand new Whirlpool appliances/refrigerator, over the counter microwave, dishwasher, stove, that came in handy, my wife loves to cook, she cooked two dinners there and we saved money too! The living room had a couch that opens up to a bed, also a chair with ottoman, and a table to eat, with only two chairs but it was ok, my kids ate first, then me and my wife, also the condo sleeps six, also had an overhead fan that was nice since I don\u2019t like to use the air conditioner if it\u2019s not that hot, but the AC worked well and it was quiet, the bedroom had two double beds nicely made up, with fresh clean sheets, when I went into the bedroom I notice, a large LG 37in wide screen TV on the wall, how cool is that! Get this, on the night stand there was a ILUV Clock radio with iphone/iPod docking you can play your own music from them, or just to charge them, and it also had a bed shaker and speaker for me that was nice since I am a little hard to wake up, it was very quiet and I slept good the whole time, I asked the maid if all of the units was so updated like this one was? She said yes, that some are, and some they are working on it, the property seemed well maintained and clean and it\u2019s a good thing that I brought my laptop computer, they have Free internet/wifi, also you can use the desk top computer in the lobby my son loved it that\u2019s for sure, I stayed 1week and I and the kids really enjoyed it. They also have a game room where my son made some friends his own age; the staff was very friendly and helpful. Everyone was very nice. The breakfast buffet was really good. they had Eggs, Waffles, Pastries, Bagles, Hot & Cold Cereals, juices, milk, Coffee Tea, we saved a lot of money, for a family of four, I would have paid $60 a day from somewhere else, like $360 just on breakfast alone for the six days that I stayed there, also the pool was heated and it was crystal clear, I am a fanatic about clean pools because I have a small child 5yr old, he may sometimes drink the water, he is learning how to swim, they also have a children\u2019s pool in good condition ,and a nice big Jacuzzi tub, that was good for me after a long day at the park to relax, also they have a nice exercise room, loved the massage chair, not to mention they also have a Gazebo with a gas Grill, Sports Court, you can get a basket ball at the front desk, my son did, and they have a large send box for the kids, and they also have Laundry facilities, and plenty of free parking, and it\u2019s only like 6:min from here to Disney World I think just over a mile or so, and they have free Shuttle service, if you don\u2019t feel like driving, what more can, I say! I absolutely love this place, I have paid a lot more to stay at other hotels with no condo just two double beds, and they did not even come close to what I got there, I will positively come back next year. Thanks for reading my revue. ANTHONY P.S I have read some revues that was negative about this place, I think it is a total lie, perhaps it is from the competition, I know that there are only 500 or so hotels in the area, that must be the case.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lee, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "tjv38", "ReviewID": "UR126941718", "Content": "very nice place nothing to fancy, but stayed 1week and really enjoyed. the staff was very friendly and helpful. everyone was very nice. the breakfast was great. also pool and hot tub great. loved the massage chair.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAn average hotel that could be so much more\u201d", "Author": "GeorgeNovak", "ReviewID": "UR126872125", "Content": "I was attending a convention at the nearby Gaylord Palms, as chose this hotel as a lower priced option. With Florida resident pricing, I paid 80 including tax and resort fee. For the Orlando area, this is an excellent price considering the location and size of room. Check-in was a bit slow, as there was only a single desk clerk. He seemed vaguely interested in his job and he was dressed as if he slept in his clothes. I don't expect suit and tie, but desk staff should not look like the plumber. The reservation was all in order and I was checked in without any issues. I did ask for a room away from the highway (eight lanes of I-4) and was assured the building was in a quiet area. For my parking pass I had to go to the attractions counter and talk to a young lady. Apparently this hotel makes money from Disney tickets, but I was leaving town the following day. For me, this second counter visit was a waste of time. I was booked into building 7, which is in the outer ring with one part facing the highway. The Palms seems to be an old Homewood suites, as I noticed their familiar \"duck\" logos still in various locations. My guess is that Hilton sold off the property and it is under new management. Homewood suites are nicely designed, so this hotel has a good foundation. I was on the third floor at the end of the building. I generally don't like rooms located next to a stairwell (due to security and noise issues), but the stairs were more convenient than the old elevator in the middle of the building. I was surprised that the 3rd floor entry door was not secured, and shocked to see the locking mechanism was gutted. This is a huge security issue that seems to have been done in response to the fire code. I would rather have a locked fire-door than sleep in an unsecured building in Orlando (an area with a high crime rate). The Palms uses magnetic strip key locks, and one of my cards did not work. The unlocking process seemed to be hit and miss, which could result in guest dissatisfaction. The amount of time spent going back and forth for new keys is magnified by the size of the facility. In the Florida heat or rain, this process would be extremely dis-pleasurable for a guest. The room itself was large and very clean. The furniture seemed new and there were no overt stains on the linens, floors or furniture. There was a full kitchen with two microwaves (I assumed the one over oven was not functional). The bedroom was separate, with two double beds. The bathroom was a long room, and it held the only closet. I didn't mind, but this would be an odd arrangement even with two people in the room. I don't think a bathroom is the best place for a closet. The hotel offers free wireless Internet, which worked perfectly on both of my devices. This was not the case at the Gaylord Hotel which has at least 20 competing for-pay WI-FI networks. Kudos to the Palms for providing this service freely. Most hotels charge a resort fee and then also charge a per computer, per day fee. The beds were clean, but very hard and you could feel the springs. I found it difficult to sleep and it only got worse when the traffic started at 6am. When I went to bed the room was fairly quiet, but in the morning I discovered than I was a few hundred yards away from a major highway. The double pane windows did very little to stop the noise, and by 6:30 I gave up sleeping. The bed was killing my back anyway, and I found the couch much quieter and softer. I managed to get 30 minutes on the couch before I decided to start my day. The hotel includes free breakfast in a clean dining room at the hotel lobby. The food isn't great in taste or variety, but it is better than many meals you will pay for in Orlando. The eggs were well cooked and the french toast was nicely prepared. Considering the cost of everything in the Disney area, this was easily a $15 breakfast. Checkout out was easy, and there were no hidden charges on the bill. I did mention that my room was noisy, but there was no compensation offered. In short, this is a good hotel that could be much better. The rates and location are excellent, though the location is next to a major highway. I would consider petitioning the state for a sound wall to easy the noise. The desk staff are satisfactory, though dress code should be addressed. I would strongly suggest securing the outer doors of all buildings or add exit only fire doors. Also a concern the is outdated guest room door lock system. A few needed upgrades and this hotel would become an excellent facility.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cIt Aint \"The Ritz.\" But, It Aint Bad Either\u201d", "Author": "Family-Traveling-Man", "ReviewID": "UR126439577", "Content": "The good things about this property start with its location; right off of Irlo Bronson Highway, route 192, at its junction w/I-4, just down the road from Disney's main gate. But, it doesn't stop there. They offer a free, and rather substantial, continental breakfast, free shuttle service to and from Disney World, and the property includes a medium-to-large sized pool area that is well landscaped with palm trees, and includes a gazebo with gas grills available for barbecueing.. There is also a large laundry room with plenty of coin operated washing machines, and a game room with five (5) coin operated video games, and an air hockey table. The lobby area doubles as a sitting room during the evenings, where people sit, have their coffee, and chat, or read a book during the evenings. They also offer complimentary use of a desk top computer with a thrity minute time limit for each patron. There is also a basketball hoop, and half court for anyone who wants to get some outdoor excersize. Our room was a one bedroom villa (two rooms total), with two double beds, and a fold out couch. There was a kitchen area complete with refridgerator, stove top, microwave, sink, and dishwasher. The unit was well appointed, and accomodated our party of five comfortably. The only problem we had was that five people are probably too many for one bathroom. We'll keep that in mind when booking future trips. There were some drawbacks, as there are with all properties. First off, let me state that the property is not dirty. But, some parts of it are a little \"worn.\" For instance some of the woodworking in the hallways, and in the units have marks and scars from people banging their luggage into it. The bathroom in our unit was very clean. However, the grouting around the tub, and the molding on the walls in the bathroom could use an \"update.\" Also, I noticed that the basketball hoop was \"drooping\" a little bit, and in need of repair. The light bulbs in our unit were only 40 watts when we originally showed up, and we had to ask maintenance to replace them with brighter bulbs. Additionally, the door on the refridgerator opened in such a fashion that the it blocks access to the sink and stove; instead of opening from right to left which would have allowed one to take articles out of it while reaching the sink and stove counter. And finally, building #7, has one side that faces I-4, and gets all kinds of highway noise. You probably wouldn't be too happy if you were put in one of those units. When all is said and done, the positives far out weigh the negatives at this property, and we would definitely stay there again. Some parts of it can use some \"updating\". But, all in all, its a very good place to stay. I would also like to recognize the efforts of a desk clerk by the name of Brian, who helped us retain our reservation, even though we were a day late because of car trouble while enroute. Also, I must commend the general manager (I think his name is \"Gene\") for making the rounds at breakfast, shaking hands, and greeting guests individually. It was a nice touch. We would definitely recomend this place to families on a budget, who want the amenities of a larger hotel without paying the extra $ usually associated with larger name brand locations. I should also mention here that there are inumerable places to eat and shop right around the corner on Irlo Bronson Highway. Steak restaraunts, buffets, Italian, quick-food, whatever you want; Its all within short-to-medium walking / very short driving distance from the property. We give this place a four (4) on a scale of one (1) to five (5), and we definitely recommend it positively.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, New York", "Title": "\u201cPalms Hotel & Villas\u201d", "Author": "Marymscintalogalbo", "ReviewID": "UR126116759", "Content": "We have stayed on this property 4 times, have always found it to be excellent, the staff being more than helpful!

We had arranged to meet up with some friends at the hotel and carpool to the park. I walked inside and explained to Brian that we were 7 hours early for our reservation, but asked for a parking pass so we could leave 1 car there for the day. He told me not only could we have the pass, but he would check us in early because the room was already clean and we wouldnt have to leave our things in our cars, we could put them in the room. I was impressed to say the least!!! Brian went on to ask me if this was our first trip to Disney, which it was. He recommended some things to do with the kids in Downtown Disney and also referred me to their Disney counter. We left, had a great day at the park, enjoyed the pool, took advantage of Brian's recommendations, and called it a day. When we woke up on Saturday, we ran downstairs, had the breakfast (A+ once again), and took off for that park, not expecting housekeeping after the 1st day. When we returned to the room after a full day (9am-11pm) at the park the room looked as if we had never been there, It was in pristine condition and the only sign of us was that whoever cleaned the room had folded up our kids' blankets and laid them on the beds next to their stuffed animals, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

So let me address each of these in turn. (The fact that the hotel was inexpensive certainly helped, too, but prices fluctuate so much that I won't comment further here.) The location was fantastic! This hotel is just off of 192 (Irlo Bronson Highway), and only 5 minutes to the Disney area (about 10 minutes to Epcot, slightly further to the Magic Kingdom). And you avoid the traffic on I-4 and International Drive. (The location made our trip, as we were able to easily go back-and-forth from the parks to our hotel each afternoon.) In addition, the hotel is not far from drug stores, a supermarket, a Starbucks, and a boardwalk/small theme park (\"old town\") that was nice to walk around at night. I would recommend the hotel for the location alone (though there are several other hotels in the immediate area). There was, indeed, a pull-out couch for our kids and a door dividing our room from theirs. Overall, though, I was disappointed in the rooms. The pull-out couch did not look very comfortable (fortunately our kids are young and did not mind). The room was a bit small. The kitchen was not very well stocked or organized: very limited cookware, a barely functional stove, and a fridge (but no oven). Overall, though, the room was reasonable for the price we paid. Definitely \"no frills,\" though. Our room faced I-4 and we could hear the traffic at night: be warned if you are a light sleeper. The pool was nice, and there was a jacuzzi also. Wish they provided bigger towels. The free breakfast was ok, but nothing special. (Limited selection of cereals, bagels, frozen waffles, muffins, and oranges.) We had some problems with housekeeping: they didn't get to our room until around 3:30 in the afternoon, which was just when we were returning from the parks. The day after we complained, however, they did come earlier. The staff was friendly enough when we brought this to their attention, but they did not come earlier the rest of our stay.

The floors were all clean; I walked barefoot most of the time and never had blackened feet. My biggest complaint about this hotel was the below par breakfast. They offered milk, juice, coffee and tea, so that was great. They also offered cereal and pastries which was also nice. However, while most hotels now offer waffle makers, the palms offered frozen waffles...very cheap. They did have eggs but no bacon or sausage. There was no fruit of any kind. It was all carbs, carbs and more carbs. It would have been great to have had some fruit and yogurt and definitely some meat of some kind. The pool area was clean and towels were provided. The drive from here to Gaylord was very easy so that was great!

We didn't want to stay on site so we looked for reasonable hotels in the area. We booked the online pre-paid rate for a King for four nights. The rate was around 67 per night plus tax and the resort fee. The Good: To be honest, we didn't need the kitchen area, but it was nice to have a separate section off from the bedroom. The fridge was dated but worked and seemed clean enough. Older appliances can only be kept so clean. The room itself was alright. It was very clean, just dated. I think we paid about the right price for what we got. Overall it seemed like it had been built cheaply but kept in pretty good repair. We never received housekeeping service because we kept our privacy sign on the entire stay. There were plenty of linens in the room for us to even have towels left over at the end of our stay so we never really needed service. Loved the bed, we slept very well on it. Also, all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The Bad: On a King bed there were only three pillows which I thought was rather odd, but not a huge deal. There was an extra one in the bathroom closet (I assume for the sofa pullout which we didn\u2019t use) but it didn\u2019t have a pillow case on it. I also noticed that none of the pillows had protectors on them. Working in the hotel industry myself, that raised a huge red flag. When we arrived we noticed that a bed room lamp and the light above the toilet were not working. I reported the lamp issue to the desk, but since we left the sign on the entire time it was never fixed. It didn\u2019t bother us so we didn\u2019t mind not having it work, but still, housekeeping should have noticed this when they cleaned the room to make it vacant. The carpet was probably the worst thing about them room. As soon as I put my bare feet on it I knew it needed to be cleaned. It had that sticky feeling that dirty carpet has. When I looked at the bottom of my feet late on the first night we were there, they had a turned gray so I wore socks or shoes for the rest of the stay. Other Comments: It is well in the back of a road with a lot of other hotels but the area was very quiet. I don\u2019t know if it was just the off season, or if that is normal. I suppose you are within walking distance to restaurants, but it is a nice piece down that road. The location of the event we were there for was a little over 2 miles according to Google but it seemed like longer than that. Several other people we knew had booked there as well and hadn\u2019t brought a car which ended up being a major problem for them. We never used the pool or went to breakfast so I can\u2019t comment on any of that.

The place was nice!! Then later I was able to stay there for the latter part of my trip at a much discounted rate and that was even better because I was willing to pay full price for the room because it was that great but the fact that I got it at a lower discounted rate made the stay even more worth it!!!

Our reservation I guess weren't enough to hold the room we needed or requested. We got 1/2 off the full price of the reservation, but still we needed the big room for our big family. Turns out they only have two of the 2/2's that are the biggest they offer. To make matters whose we have a handicapp daughter in a wheelchair. My husband had to carry her up and down the stairs every time we came back or left. We left the wheelchair in the van since it was to heavy to carry up stairs. They had no elevator. Once my husband unloaded all of us stuff in the living room he decided to look in the bedrooms too see we had one less bathroom and the master bedroom had a double bed and no closet. It was the size of a closet. The other bedroom had two queen beds. Needless to say we didn't sleep together on our family vacation. The pool was freezing cold in March. We enjoyed the free breakfast if we made it by 9am to get food. I kept apoligizing to people in the breakfast area. It felt like I was back at home with a house full of people and we were all in eachothers way.The villas were busy on the weekends. The food, drinks and toasters were all over the place. Two different sides of the room. The eggs looked like egg beaters and they were burnt everyday. They offered 4 different kinds of cerel and a mixture of fruit. It looked really weird. They also had fench toast or waffles, but they were weird looking too. We enjoyed the pasteries and bagels with cream cheese. The hotel/ villas was at the back of the road we travelled down. The up side was we were in the first building which was nice to get in and out and right over to breakfast. The bummer was that we had to drive over 6 speed bumps to get to our hotel/villas. The baby would be asleep on the way home and after all those bumps she was awake again. I am looking into other places to stay next time. It looked clean, but i did read that they only give you new towels on tuesday and fridays. So the towels I had on the floor did they just hang them back up???

The elevator and the hallways stunk and the A/C seem to work only in the rooms. We booked 2 queen beds and they gave us a small room with 2 double beds. To try to make our stay more comfortable, we asked the front desk if we could upgrade to a villa. We paid $30/night upgrade that turned out to be even crappier than the hotel we were originally booked at. The villa smelled like mold through out, the bathroom walls were peeling and moldy, we found a peep hole in the bathroom, and the place was just dirty. To make matter worst, on the day we moved to the villa, our TV blew up and had a short circuit. There was a small fire that I thankfully was able to put off. The hotel accommodated us by compensating us with the hotel fee. On our 3rd day at the villa, we discovered our room wide open after coming back from Disney. Thankfully, nothing was missing, or maybe we just don't know it yet. After this, we ended up canceling the rest of our stay and moving to another hotel - Ramada, which is also around the area. If you want to enjoy your vacation, don't come to this hotel. If you add all the fees, they actually end up charging more than a nicer hotel, such as Ramada. This hotel/villa is a ripoff.

My girlfriend and I had to store our luggage in a storage room for an afternoon because we arrived there early from a cruise we went on the previous week. We went to a disney park that day and came back and checked in. When we got our room it was suppose to have a king size bed and they gave us a room with two full beds. This would not be a problem but the front desk to the hotel is not actually in the hotel its a three to four minute walk to the villa part of the hotel which is across the street. We finally got the right room then we discovered that money was taken from our luggage while it was stored in the room. We then had to walk over to the front desk and ask for the manager who conveniently was not there. We filled out a claim about the money and wrote down our cell number for the manager to get back to us and check the security tapes. The manager never called and every time we went to the front desk we asked for him and he was never there. Apart from the money issue the hotel is tucked back in a corner far away from restaurants and we did not have a car. We had to walk two to three miles for groceries or a restaurant. The Palms website is misleading with its pictures as well. As the week went on we noticed our room had leaky pipes which caused the bathroom to flood making the carpet wet and moldy. The doors to the room were not sound proof and you could hear everything in the hallway which made sleeping hard.

Breakfast was fine and served in hotel lobby or main lobby building, a decent selection and something for everyone, plus you could take the food back to your room so that was good. Asked for fridge and microwave in room and we had both, clean and useful. Location not the greatest, was very dark walk back from the shops at night and with two small children did not feel safe. Shuttle service was good, drivers all very nice and friendly. We used the pool at the villas once and it was ok, towels provided which was helpful. There is a sand box for kids but it was dirty and full of bugs so didn't let my kids play in there at all and we tried to play in the games room but the token machine was broken and all games took tokens so the little ones were disappointed. Our main issue was the phone. We could not dial out on our bedroom phone at all, wouldn't call locally or even the reception for that matter. They sent a guy to 'fix' it and he had no clue what to do with it. In fact he thought he was supposed to be fixing the air conditioner (which was working perfectly thankfully). They offered on the third day to move our room but said we would lose the fridge and microwave and with two small children we needed those things so chose to deal with no phone. It wasn't great to have to leave the hotel building and walk over to the other building just to use the reception phone to order food for the kids, especially in the pouring rain, but we did it.

I literally could not sleep the first night we arrived because the smell was so bad. I didn't want to touch anything and became obsessive about washing my hands during my stay here. After our first night, I complained about the room and they 'upgraded' us to a villa. It was better, meaning it did not smell as bad, but it was still very old and dirty. The couch had stains on it, the carpet hasn't been cleaned in years, the toilet ran constantly, there's mold and mildew in the tub and around the tile. I would not walk anywhere in the room without my shoes on. The room was downright depressing. The breakfast was hilarious. I've never seen eggs cooked this way - they were like rubbery disks. I can appreciate the difficulty in preparing food for a large amount of people however, this was very disappointing and no effort was put into it. I would only eat the toast because based on the state of the hotel rooms, I wouldn't want to think about the state of the kitchen. After being out of the hotel from 9:30am - 4:30pm, the maid service never made it to our room. The following day (check out day - yippeeee) when I had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, she barged right in. Can't win. There were long black hairs on the clean linens when we were lucky enough to have our room serviced. The pool is nothing to write home about and come to think of it, I never saw a maintenance person attend to the pool or any other area of this hotel. No wonder the place is falling apart. This place is far away from everything and your taxi ride will cost you a minimum of $20 one way if you choose to go out for dinner or go shopping. I have never spent so much money on cab fare. To be fair, that is not this hotel's fault however, be aware if you plan to stay here and budget for it. I will say that the hotel staff that I dealt with were pleasant enough and will not say anything negative about the customer service with the exception of the maid service. The bottom line, this is a very old hotel that has not kept up with maintenance or cleaning and it shows. What I find most disappointing is this hotel is a Disney World Good Neighbour Hotel. This is what it means to be a Disney World Good Neighbour Hotel: Disney Good Neighbor Hotels what does it mean? Simple, the Disney Good Neighbor hotels are hotels which have passed a certain high standard criteria that has been setup by Walt Disney World. Disney understands that there are a lot of popular Lake Buena Vista hotels and Kissimmee FL hotels which guests like to stay at. So they came up with the Disney World Good Neighbor hotel program, the idea behind this program was for Disney to set high standards for hotels near Disney World to be part of this program and to ensure that Disney World guests who stayed in these properties were pleased. www.hotels.orlandovacation.com/disney-good-neighbour-hotels/ There is no \"high standard criteria\" at this hotel.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cJust about perfect!\u201d", "Author": "kimmyann", "ReviewID": "UR68692620", "Content": "We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite/villa which comfortably slept 5 of us.

Wireless internet service was only available in the lobby and they did have a guest computer with a 15 minute time limited.

They have a free shuttle that brings you to Disney, but the earliest it left was at 9:05am. Since we are morning people, we ended up renting a car in order to get to the parks right when they opened. The location to the parks was very close \u2013 it took us less than 10 minutes to get to the Disney parking lots. It was convenient to have a car, especially in a villa to go get groceries. On site, they had two pools (one kiddie and a larger one) and a whirlpool. The bigger pool was very nicely heated, but we have a two year old who liked the kiddie pool, but in mid-March, it was a little too cold for him. They also had a gazebo with gas grills (we made a few hamburgers) and a fenced-in sandbox next to the gazebo, which our son loved. The continental breakfast was excellent \u2013 each day they put out either French toast, waffles, Danishes or muffins. There were always bagels, bread, oatmeal, cold cereals, juices, coffee, tea and milk. During our week-long stay, I only saw apples out on two occasions, but we had enough fruit from the grocery store. They had more than enough high chairs and booster seats for the little ones \u2013 and the staff even let us borrow one for our room for when we ate-in, which was very nice! There were plenty of places to walk \u2013 it was in a neighborhood that had a mix of vacation properties, hotels and residential apartments. There was even a board-walk nature trail close by! We also used the laundry facilities located next to the pool, which was $2 per wash and $2 per dry \u2013 quarters only. Even though we had a fantastic time \u2013 I would recommend to management that the room needs a little maintenance. For instance, the TV in the bedroom was not working as well as one of the stove-top burners. From what it looks like, there was some water damage on the bathroom walls as well as under the kitchen sink. And a few of the tiles on the bathroom floor were cracked. The one major complaint that I have is that the floors were filthy. I do not know why they were so dirty, but our socks would turn black on the bottoms from just walking around the room. I usually do not like to wear shoes indoors, but I made a conscious effort to encourage my family to always wear shoes until we went to bed. I think it just needs a good steam-clean \u2013 or even a regular clean. I dropped some mustard on the tile floor in the kitchen and when I went to clean it up with a paper-towel (which they supply which was very nice) I picked up a lot of the black dirt along with it so I know they did not clean the tile floors \u2013 I even intentionally left a small cheerio on the floor (in a visible location) to see if the floors were cleaned \u2013 and unfortunately \u2013 the cheerio remained there for the next four days. I understand that housekeeping can get busy and overwhelmed to clean a lot of places in a short amount of time, but I just wonder how often they vacuum the floors?

Good thing we only stayed a night so I didn't have to give my kids a bath in it. 3) The door on the backside of the building (where our room was) was never locked, even at midnight. Did not like that for security reasons. 4) The breakfast wasn't that great. They had your basic bagels, waffles, cereal, juice, coffee, etc. That was pretty much it and we ended up stopping on the way to Disney to get something else as what they had didn't really do the trick.

Of course we didn't realize it was huricane season. When we got to the Palms Hotel and Villas we were kindly greeted by the lady at the front desk. She checked us in and then said to go over to this gentleman and get our hotel parking permit to put on the dashboard of our car. Before he gave us our parking permit, he told us how would we like to get into Disneyworld free. We told him we already had tickets. Then he said how would you like to see Arabian Nights? I said. \"Is this a time share program? He said, \"No, it is owned by Holiday Inn and it is a vacation ownership program\". After saying no and just wanting to go to our room. He said. \"It's only a hour long and you can give them your input even if you don't want to buy. So its been about 20 minutes and we say okay. We had to give them $30.00 to make sure we would show up that we would get back after we went. We made it at 7:45 in the morning. The people were really nice but we were on vacation, we should have never said yes. I was stressed out about going for the next few days. After 2 !/2 hours we left and got back to our hotel. If you were looking for a deal like this, then you might want to attend. They started off showing us 2 different condos. One, one bedroom and one two bedrooms. When they sat us down they didn't have any one bedrooms. The two bedrooms were $35,000.00. This is for one week per year, plus a $99.00 fee per year and a $720.00 fee for maintenance a year. We said no, and hear comes this guys boss to offer us a one bedroom where the people were upgrading to a two bedroom. It was only $14,000. and we could get it after the first of the year. We said no and here comes his boss. The first guy said our payment would be $659.00 per month after a down payment. This guy said our payments would be $219.00 a month. We said no, Then here comes his boss to ask us how much we could afford to get us into something? We said no and he said so n so will be over to check you out and get you your vouchers to get your $30.00 back and your tickets to arabian nights. When he gets there he tells us we can get you a repo for around $5,000.00. We don't make any money off of that but we can get you into one. Oh brother!!!!!!We said no. LIke I said 2 1/2 hours later. Don't get me wrong they were all really nice. If you have a problem saying no do not go to this. Just say no thankyou and get to your hotel room. The villas were very nice. We were the only ones swimming in the pool. The breakfast was very nice served from 7 am till 9 am. It consisted of coffee, juice, milk, cereal, oatmeal, french toast, waffles, eggs ( that didn't look like eggs but they were good) A lot to choose from. We had a one bedroom villa and it was very nice. The people at the front desk were very nice. They had a shuttle that took you to epcot every day and you could get a shuttle to go the other parks.

The breakfast was basically cereal, toast, waffles, bagels, pastries, juice, coffee, etc. It was basic but filling! The best thing about the hotel though was the free shuttle which was very convenient. We were the last stop and it never took more than around 15 minutes to get either there or back and it was always on time. Watch out for the dodgy taxi drivers who'll do anything to get a fare!

The bed was comfortable, but the fold out sofa was lumpy and the mattress sagged through broken springs at the bottom of the bed. The internet did not work in the room, but only in the lobby. We quickly found that our white sport socks were filthy black after several hours being in the room. The carpet was dark green so it was hard to tell it was so dirty, but we never walked barefoot the rest of the week because of the dirt. The ktichen was roomy and there was a large pantry. Would be great for a large family to store food for a week. Dishwasher, fridge, cooktop and microwave all worked. Housekeeping did a good job, plenty of towels provided as opposed to other similar hotels in same price range. Breakfast was not elaborate but was good and included hot eggs. Coffee was good. All the staff were very nice and helpful. Pool was nice. Workout room very small and no eliptical machine, only 2 treadmills, a small stairclimber and a few free weights.

I've got a few complaints, but let me say first of all that the rooms were clean, the grounds well-kept, everything worked, front desk attendants were friendly, and the breakfast was better than expected. Now the complaints: 1. The wireless internet was very definitely available ONLY in the lobby, and that was a weak signal at best. 2. Could it kill the hotel to have yellow pages in each room? The hotel has no restaurant and there are no adjacent restaurants. I don't know what it is that they don't want guests to know by keeping phone books out of the guest rooms. 3. Keep in mind that the Guest Relations desk is not like a concierge. It only seems to be there to help guests buy Disney tickets, and is fairly useless for anything more. 4. The hotel was not even close to capacity while I was there, but the timing of housekeeping services was completely unpredictable. On one particular day when we wanted the room serviced, we got back at 1:30 and learned that no one had been there. Being tired, I took a nap and put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. Later that afternoon, housekeeping had left a note stating that they had tried to service the room twice - once in the AM and once about 3 PM - and that the \"do not disturb\" sign was on the door all day. That was a complete lie as the room was fully available in the morning! This incident marred what had been a good and trouble-free 5-day stay. I would say that the breakfast is much more than juice, coffee, and day-old donuts.

My husband and I stayed here the weekend of 4/14 while visiting our college student.

I am so sorry that our reservations are here and now we are having difficulty getting a room any place else. Lobby was not clean and definitely not what I've found to expect at Renaissance properties. Even the checkin counter left alot to be desired. Then we get to our room which was OK, not really as clean as expected, carpet soiled, and towels were old and shredding. The Starbucks and cafe in the hotel was awful. Tables were dirty with crumbs, etc. from previous customers and overall appearance was not good.

We love the location to everything in and around the Inner Harbor. No need to take a car or even a cab most times if the weather is nice. Most attractions are a 10-15 minute walk away in any direction. Check in - Check in was quick and efficient. My wife checked us in as I parked the car. We arrived around lunch time and our room was ready. There was a mixup in booking since my wife did it online. They gave us a room with a single bed, but we were a party of 3. A conversation with the manager got us moved up to the conceirge level with a full harbor view. Still only a king bed, but they provided a cot for our daughter. The upgrade included access to the lounge which had continental breakfast on the weekend, so this more than made up for the confusion with the room. Service - Everyone we encountered was more than friendly and knowledgable, but there were a couple of weak points during our stay. When we arrived in our room there was an issue. My wife noticed that they hadn't cleaned the bathroom toilet. The previous guest had \"left something behind\". It was gross, but housekeeping quickly responded when we told the front desk, who apologized profusely and we were able to get free room service out of it. The second issue we had was with regards to room service. We put out the room service form the night before and requested it be delivered between 6am and 6:15am. The first day, around 6:20 I called down to the front desk. A few minutes later, our meal showed up. Not sure if this was because they were afraid to wake us up or just because the service was slow (hard to believe at 6am on a Saturday). Every other Marriott brand hotel we've been in has gotten room service to us on time or even a little early. The person delivering it to us apologized and said the meal was on him (even though he was unaware that it was already free). Not completely discouraged (and because it was already free), we ordered again the same way. Again, it did not arrive on time. We were working on a tight schedule so this time when I called the desk I told them to tell room service to cancel or order completely. Both days, we returned to the hotel later in the morning and ate at the club lounge. This, combined with the fact that the meals were already free made this a minor inconvenience. Other than those two issues, the rest of the service we received was fine. Rooms - Standard hotel fare. What we've come to expect from any Marriott product. It was large enough to comfortably acommodate the cot without feeling over crowded. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean (except for the bathroom issue mentioned above) and was in order. One thing of note is regarding the safe. The safe is in a drawer above the refrigerator, not in the closet. It is MUCH smaller than other room safes in other hotels. I typically have no problem storing our valuables and still have room for our Nikon Camera and telephoto lens. Most of ths space in the safe box is take up with the lid to the safe. The locking mechanism for this already small safe must be huge. I couldn't fit the camera in the safe, so I had to carry it with me or leave it in the room, hidden. This didn't sit well with me. Keep this in mind when deciding which vailuables to bring on your trip. Other notes - The hotel is attached to the Gallery Mall. Access from the mall to the lobby is for hotel guests only and can only be opened with a keycard. Parking is not associated with the hotel, so it cannot be negotiated off of your room bill. There is an elevated walkway that attaches the Gallery Mall to the smaller Harborplace Mall across the street. The entrance to the walkway is near Five Guys in Harborplace Mall. Bathrooms near the Ground Floor Cafe also need a room key to access. I'm sure this is necessary to keep undesirables from using the bathrooms. That is somewhat comforting, but also a little disturbing as well. Due to this hotel's location, we'd come back. We didn't have the service issues the first time we stayed that we did this time. I will give them a pass for now and hope that it was a not indicative of a larger issue. Overall, it was another good stay at the Renaissance Harborplace.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Safe Area\u201d", "Author": "mich128", "ReviewID": "UR127977550", "Content": "I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.

Finally, when we went to check out, the bell hop took our bags down, but he didn't give us a claim check; we wanted him to hold our bags so we could walk around the Inner Harbor some more before leaving Baltimore. When we got back to get our bags, the new bell hop didn't know where our bags were, and we had to go to the luggage room to point out our bags. I will not stay here again; I will try the other Marriott property in Baltimore in the East Harbor; that location is just as good, within walking distance of the Inner Harbor as well.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cgreat\u201d", "Author": "elaine n", "ReviewID": "UR125605199", "Content": "great place. close to inner harbor. across the street from the aquarium. when in baltimore i would not stay anywhere else.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookfield, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Altaskibum", "ReviewID": "UR125463577", "Content": "This was my first stay at this hotel and so far it is my favorite of all the Marriotts in Baltimore.

The property itself has been around for a number of years and the evelevators do show it, however, don't let that put you off as the rooms have all been upgraded and are very nice and large. The bathrooms have also been updated and are nice and clean. The only thing you need to know about the rooms is that the hotel is arranged in a big open square so some rooms are quite a hike from the elevators! I stayed on the concierge level and the concierge lounge is pretty typical for a full service Marriott. They do serve a hot breakfast in the morning and it is actually quite good.

Perfectly located overlooking the Inner Harbour. We arrived around 11:00 and were immediately given a room without waiting. No \"we don't give rooms until 3:00\" or \"You're early, come back\". That was nice. And the room was on the 11th floor (out of 12 floors) with a \"full harbour view\" overlooking the stern of the USS Constitution. What a beautiful view of the Harbour and the buildings. To die for. Also located adjacent to the Gallery Shopping Mall, so if you are a shopper, you can access it through the lobby. The room was first rate. Huge window wall overlooking the Harbour. Beds were some of the most comfortable I can recall. In fact, the second night I was looking forward to going to sleep. It appears that they use firm mattresses and then cover them with an inch or two of soft material. Bed linens were of top quality and cosy. There was some hallway noise and sirens of the crime fighters on Pratt Street, but other than that a good nights sleep. Large flat screen TV with the typical satellite/cable channels plus HBO. Nice coffee service, an in-drawer modern safe, hairdryer and Wi-Fi (for $`12.95 for 24 hours). Parking was a bit steep at $28 a day, but it appeared that they used public garage and they pass that cost on. For $12 more a day, they provide valet paring. I normally don't take the valet option (I'm not that old that I can't park my own car), but there were so many cars when we arrived that the idea of someone taking care of the car was too tempting. While the hotel was magnificent, I thought that some of the people could improve. While I was very happy with an early room, it wouldn't hurt the lady at reception to smile once in a while or ask us how's it going. After all, other than the valet parking guy, she is our first experience with the hotel and first impressions are hard to shake. So reception lady, relax, smile and enjoy people. Also, when we arrived there was only one person manning reception. While we were second in line, the person ahead of us had some personal issue that took more than 5 minutes. Once the line began to form, they did bring out another staff member to deal with the arrivals. But at a hotel of this calibre, there shouldn't be a delay. Also, I noticed that reception handled questions and matters that the concierge should have handled. Reception should refer such issues to the concierge and get on the reception matters. People seemed to really like room service. You could tell by all the plates, glasses and trays outside doors in the hallway. And they stayed there for some time. Not only was it an eyesore and disruptive, the aroma wasn't pleasant. I'm surprised that the dirty dishes stayed there so long as they could easily be collected at least once an hour. Also, we forgot a Europe to US electrical adapter and hoped that the hotel had one we could borrow. Most upper scale hotels in urban areas such as Baltimore normally have them. No luck, but reception happily referred us to the Hotel store. It had one, but at three times the price as that on the normal economy. Ouch! The store also sold newspapers, but would put yesterday's paper on top of the pile of today's paper. Sort of like a grocery store putting overripe fruit on top of the better fruit to get rid of it. Shame, shame hotel store. Why trash your name for the price of a newspaper? We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was very good. Not cheap, but not that much more than outside places. And the food was of very good quality. They did incorrectly charge me for two days of internet when I only used one. I was sent a final email bill with a link to ask about the bill. Unfortunately the link doesn't work, so looks like I got stiffed for $12.95 worth of internet I didn't use. In the end, its a wonderful hotel, ideally located and luxurious. Nice people who will certainly smile more in the future if anyone reads this. Not cheap, but it had an affordable Government rate. Well worth the money.

This hotel was selected by my employer. First, the positives: the hotel is in a great location on the inner harbor. It is nicely decorated and clean, and the room was large. The service was pleasant. There was a better than usual selection of tv stations (I've never stayed at a hotel where I could watch hockey on the NHL network before). My employer had made special arrangements for some additional amenities, to include an in-room fridge and microwave, free internet, and complimentary breakfast. (According to the hotel website, they normally charge $12.95 per day for in-room high speed internet access, which seems ridiculous these days.) For the first couple of days, I thought I could over look the negative, which was the noise problem. Specifically, the first noise problem is the lack of sound proofing between the hallway and room. People in the hallway speaking in a normal conversational voice sound as if they are right in your room. The second problem is the doors, which slam shut behind you unless you make an actual effort to close them gently. The first two nights, this was not too much of a problem, because the hotel did not seem too full and after 10pm there wasn't much hallway traffic. But on the third evening, a huge group of high school students arrived for a conference. From 9pm-1am that night, I was treated to a seemingly never ending chorus of hallway voices, backed by a symphony of slamming doors. Earplugs failed to block the noise, and when in bed and nearby doors would slam, I could actually FEEL the vibrating \"thud\". I should emphasize that although these were large groups of teens, they were in no way misbehaving or being rowdy. They were simply doing what most travelers do in a hotel- speaking to their companions and letting their room door close behind them. But in this hotel, these simple actions from a large group of people were ridiculously disruptive and made for a miserable attempt at getting a decent nights' sleep. For this reason, I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone sensitive to noise. On most of my previous trips to Baltimore, I have stayed at the Residence Inn on Light St. (see prior reviews). I would continue to recommend that hotel by comparison- full kitchen, free internet and breakfast (for everyone, not just by special arrangement), and no slamming doors.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location for Inner Harbor\u201d", "Author": "TNtraveler1998", "ReviewID": "UR124121667", "Content": "Quick check-in, large clean rooms, and comfy beds.

I had my spouse and two kids with me and the location was great for the tourist attractions. The hotel is in a mall so there is stuff to look at right near the lobby. The room was a nice size and very clean. The most outstanding aspect of this hotel was the friendly and knowledgeable staff. Considering how crowded the hotel was for the convention, I was amazed at how helpful and upbeat the staff remained. The main negative of this hotel is that I had to pay for internet access each day per device. Seeing as how my family had five devices needing internet access, this was a MAJOR drawback for us. I still can't believe hotels continue to insist on charging for wi-fi access in this day and age when just about all travelers require internet access. If this had not been the host hotel for my convention, I would have searched for a hotel that offered free wi-fi. My employer paid for my internet access but it was really frustrating for my husband to have to drag the kids to the Starbucks a few blocks away in order to use his iPad to plan the day's activities. It was also a major pain that the hotel did not even offer free wi-fi for conference participants in the meeting rooms. For $220 per night, spare me some wi-fi during the day so I can check my work e-mail on my iPad! Also, I wouldn't recommend going too far off the beaten path around this hotel. There are plenty of places to walk to right in the Inner Harbor but don't walk too far outside the boundary. We wanted to try a crab place recommended by a friend that was one mile from the hotel so we figured we would walk. Not a good idea! The neighborhood went from bad to worse in a matter of blocks and we did not feel safe at all. Needless to say, we took a cab back to the hotel after dinner. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for business trips but I would might look elsewhere for a family vacation spot.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAvoid - not up to standard\u201d", "Author": "Dan S", "ReviewID": "UR121935119", "Content": "I'm a Marriott Platinum Elite member - lots of nights at lots of Marriotts.

The package we had was supposed to include breakfast, but when we got to the restaurant we found that our names weren't on the list where they were supposed to be. In order to straighten this out, we had to make a couple of trips to and from the front desk and back to the restaurant, and though it seems that they got it straight in the end (I haven't gotten my credit card bill yet, so I'm not 100% sure), it didn't leave a good taste in our mouths--and neither did the breakfast, which was fairly mediocre. More importantly, we'd specifically requested a quiet room, and were put on the sixth floor, where we listened to the music of the wedding reception on the floor below until it was almost midnight. Frankly, though, it probably wouldn't have mattered where we were put, as soundproofing was pretty much non-existent: when seated in our room, as far away from the room door as one could be, I could clearly hear the conversations of people passing by in the hall, and they weren't even talking loud.

First, the positives: the hotel has excellent service, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I only had a few special requests while I was there but I was always readily accommodated. I really enjoyed the workout room, with treadmills and elliptical machines facing windows (not the optimal view, but still nicer than a wall). The coffee bar opens very early and serves Starbucks beverages, which I really enjoyed. The beds are very comfortable, and the rooms in general are nice. Each room has a mini-fridge that probably used to be a mini-bar. I made good use of mine since I didn't like to eat in restaurants every night (though there are an abundance nearby). Which brings me to the best thing about the hotel, its location. It is directly across from the harbor, and the views - if you get a full harbor view - are delightful. The aquarium is across the street, as are many attractions at the harbor (e.g., USS Constellation, water taxis, live music in the summertime). On the downside, the hotel is pretty pricey unless you get a good corporate rate or some other deal (which I did). Also, parking is not cheap, but similar to other locations in the city. And ... this is kinda petty ... there is only one elevator bank which is quite far from some of the rooms. The hotel occupies nearly a full city block and is built around a courtyard. So, if your room is at the opposite corner from the elevators you feel like you have walked a half mile to get there. It's good exercise, but I finally started requesting a room closer to the elevators. The best rooms are the ones with the full harbor view, because they are a medium-distance from the elevators as well as the nicest.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "McKinney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely terrible to Otakon goers\u201d", "Author": "StaceyBla", "ReviewID": "UR116225326", "Content": "Let me get this out of the way first, I came in from Dallas, Texas in order to go to Otakon.

This guy continually told her the wrong amount for the room, would not work with us, was condescending as all get-out, and pretty much continued to COUNT OUR MONEY WRONG at the same time. I walked away to calm down half-way through this but I counted at least three times he counted our money wrong and no one else at the front desk would help when one of our other friends tried to get someone else to help us instead of him. It was pretty much like we were \"lesser guests\" because of the fact we were there for Otakon. I watched before we were able to check in and everyone who wasn't \"convention goers\" was treated with absolute respect and politeness. This is ridiculous considering we pay just as much as other people to stay in this place. The rooms were also entirely uncomfortable as the AC was spotty at best and the beds felt like I was sleeping on a slab of stone instead of a bed.

Decor is modern and pleasing to the eye. Negatives: Our suite was very very far from the only set of elevators. If mobility is a concern specify a room close to the elevators. The lobby bar not open as much as the hotel literature said it would be. We had a drink there on Friday, but were not able to on other days when we posted hours stated the bar would be open. (We did not venture to the bar in the restaurant which was probably open at those times). Also the hotel conducted a test of the fire alarms at 8:30 am on Monday. Guests were given no notice and most of us evacuated using the stairs when the announcements told us to. When we reached the outside and made our way to the front of the hotel a security apologized, to us it was a drill and said we could return to our rooms. Kind of irritating. I'm glad it wasn't raining. If you are there and the fire alarms go off at 8:30 in the morning, you might want to try calling the front desk before you hike down 10 flights. :) Overall a very positive experience. We would consider staying there even if we can't ge a Priceline discount in the future.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, California", "Title": "\u201cBeware tech savvy business traveler\u201d", "Author": "drkraven7", "ReviewID": "UR109411800", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for business. Since both of us are in the computer software industry, and are tech geeks by trade, we tend to travel with several mobile devices i.e. laptops, netbook, tablet, smartphones, ereader. Upon booking this hotel we were aware we would have to pay a daily internet charge of $12.95. Much to our disappointment that charge was per device, per connection type. That meant if we used the internet on my laptop by firstly connecting to the ethernet cable at the desk we were charged the $12.95. However if I decided to work away from the desk and attempt to connect via wireless, from the same laptop, I would again be charged another $12.95. Or when I finished using the internet and my husband tried to connect to the internet using his laptop or another device (other than my laptop) we would have again been charged even though we were not using the internet at the same time. Knowing how this technology works, and being aware that we are living in the year 2011 where even cheap hotels can offer free internet, both my husband and I found this policy ridiculous. When my husband called the night time front desk representative to clarify our understanding of the policy, the hotel employee was not only unapologetic but rude with my husband. We called the customer service of the parent company, Marriott, and the representative was very polite and tried to help us by clarifying the policy with our hotel's front desk. She must have reached the same hotel employee because the customer service rep called us back to inform us that the employee had hung up on her after telling her that that was the policy. Overall, I could say that the hotel room was nice and comfy (albeit not as quiet) as many other guests on this site have mentioned, and that it is conveniently located to many attractions, shopping, and restaurants, However, given our trip was for business purposes and we found ourselves inconvenienced by outdated internet policies and unprofessional customer service, our stay was definitely not worth the high price tag of this hotel.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "BA2011", "ReviewID": "UR108839113", "Content": "Outstanding location, great beds, incredible views of water, food was very good...

The Renaissance Harborplace is a decent hotel, the rooms are comfortable and roomy and the staff was helpful and cordial.

First, I asked for a quite room and I was put in a room next to a large industrial fan that was very loud . . . one of the rooms offered to me to move to was on the other side of the same fan! This is a problem for me because I have nerve damage in both of my ears and being next to constant humming noises causes me discomfort, others may not care. After about 45 minutes or so, I finally was given a quite room. The bell man was great in helping us deal with all this, but I cannot say the same about the person who checked us in or the ones on the phone who assured us of a quite room. The hotel offered us no compensation for the inconvenience caused by all this. Also, I should say the comfort of the room is well above average and has a really good bed. Unfortunately, I also had a huge problem with the Internet service at the hotel. For one thing, it is pretty slow and that is frustrating. Second, and this can be a major problem for anyone if interruptions in your Internet service is an issue, you have to renew the service every 24 hours and without warning it just stops. There is no option to have the Internet service for multiple day use. It turned out this was a disaster for me given I rely on doing auctions over the Internet for a living. I had a group of bids to place at 9:59 PM for an auction that closed at 10:00 PM and what happened? The Internet shut down without warning and I had to renew the service . . . and given how slow the Internet here is, that took two minutes and by then the auction was closed and I no longer could place my bids. As a result, I problem lost a few hundred to a couple of thousand dollars in potential profits. Hopefully the hotel will fix this as more-and-more folks rely on the Internet.

Rooms at the hotel were nice and well appointed. We had a partial harbor view which was fine with us. Our room also had a view of ships, the Hard Rock and much more. Renaissance beds are always the best. One small complaint about the rooms is the front door. there was a lot of space between the door and the frame. most notably at the top and bottom. This allowed light in and some noise from the hallway traffic. Not a huge negative but one none the less. It was not just our room. I took notice while walking past rooms.

It is cheaper if you are by yourself. However you ride with other people and it stops at several hotels. So you can add an additional thirty minutes to your trip from airport.

My room directly overlooked the Constellation and the Harbor, and I had a fantastic view over the entire harbor from the Hard Rock and Aquarium to the convention center and college area.

The bottle of water is $4.00, so you might want to get your own from one of the nearby stores. Nice flat screen TV is good and has plenty of channels, and I particularly like remote controls with a sleep timer. There's a pool and a business center.

I was not given the option of refusing a morning newspaper and so had to be guilty of wasting paper and natural resources when one was delivered every morning. The hotel is arranged in a large square formation with about twelve stories looking down and surrounding a courtyard. There is only ONE bank of elevators, meaning that you have a long walk from the elevator to your room if you are not on one of the arms of the square adjacent to the elevator bank. It seems criminally negligent not to have built another elevator bank opposite the existing one which would result in everyone's room being at least 50% closer! The usually ubiquitous \"Guide to Guest Services\" was not found in my room and instead had been replaced by a card with room service choices. I found this annoying because it so happened that I had a number of questions regarding the hotel's amenities. As usual in hotels that fail to attend to details, the batteries in the TV remote needed changing. Also, for some reason my cell phone signal seemed to be very weak despite my perch on the 11th floor. I have two cell phones and both the Sprint and Verizon signals were not good (?) My room was not cleaned or serviced until after 4 pm regardless of the fact that I left the room at 7:30 am each morning and didn't return until about 3:30 pm or later. On discovering that my room had not been serviced, I retired to the bar each day and worked on my meeting files and presentations to kill time. I would much rather have done this in my room! When I used the business center I was dismayed to discover that the \"free computer use for airline check-in\" apparently did not include the cost of using the printer to print a boarding pass!

I checked in around 2:00pm on a Sunday and was told that my room was still occupied, but that they hoped to have me into a room by the evening. This wasn't a great start to things. The hotel was packed from a few events over the weekend so I wasn't surprised when I was told the room was still full. My conference was starting and so I headed of to it for a few hours and didn't pay the room issue much mind. I returned around 5:00 to find that a room still wasn't available but was told that they thought that housekeeping was celaning one and that it should be ready shortly. I managed to do a little work in the conference area for another hour or so and finally I had a room. The first thing I noticed was that there wasn't a coffee machine in the room. Heck, even the little coffee shops in the hotel and adjacent mall were not open. I was settled in around 7:00 or so and as it was now raining I decided to order a sandwich and cup of coffee from room service rather than going for a walk. The person who answered the room service line gave me a long sigh and told me that room service was going to be **at least** 1:45 minutes for a coffee and sandwich. I wasn't going to eat at 9:00 so I had a granolla bar and called it a night. A little after 6:00 the next morning I was hungry and really in need of a cup of coffee. Room service supposedly starts at 6:00 however when I called none bothered to pick up. I called a few more times for a few more minutes and still none would answer. I went downstairs hoping to find some coffee somewhere but 6:00 am is apparently too early in this part of the world. Finally one of the staff asked if he could help with anything and I asked if coffee was available anywhere in this hotel. He asked me to wait there and a few minutes later he returned with a fresh cup; just like that, the stay improved. I gave a good tip (as deserved!), but I regret that I didn't get his name to pass along to the management. Back in the hotel on Monday night I was able to more fairly assess the hotel as I was not anxious about a room, had found a coffee shop down the street, and even room service came through. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the desk and work area were nice, and there were a ton of channels available on the TV. The little bar on the ground floor was a nice place to grab a beer that evening and watch some football on Monday night. Overall I have to blame my experience of Sunday night/Monday morning on what I guess was a booked-solid weekend at the hotel. Once things settled down on Monday night it operated as normal and efficiently as most other hotels I've stayed at. It's clean, modern (not in a funky way, but in a new facility way), and some of the staff are really good people.

We had a room on the 7th floor with two queens. CHECKOUT / CHECK-IN / INITIAL IMPRESSION: The hotel seemed clean, and the staff seemed relatively knowledgeable. However, the person at the front desk took several minutes to see my name on the reservation that I had made, despite the fact that they were staring straight at it. There were multiple names on the reservation, and I was nearly told I could not check in until he finally noticed my name in big letters right on top of the reservation. Chalk that one up to being tired I suppose, I understand. Next I was informed that my debit/credit card would have an amount of 100.00 held on it for incidentals. I have never been to a hotel where this was done before -- always, there was a card on file for incidentals that would be charged as thing were taken. To automatically assume I'm going to drink 25 bottles of overpriced water over the weekend is insane. Whatever, I went with it. Needless to say, we did not use a thing, and yet my 100.00 has not been returned to my card yet. I'm still working on that (came home three days ago). Upon checkout, my card was AGAIN charged without being told until after it was charged for our parking. I had cash in my hand prepared to pay the guy, and he walked off and came back and said \"Okay, we charged your card for xyz amount that you owed for parking.\" Fine, it's not like I couldn't afford it, but the obliviousness of the fact that I had 80.00 in hand cash and was trying to hand it to him directly was almost enough for me to want to scream. The staff is, to say the least, incredibly unhelpful and lacking any sort of politeness, tact, or apparently common sense. One night I was even carded the moment I walked in the door for my hotel key, as if they would deny me entry to my room if I wasn't currently holding one (I don't doubt for a second that they would have either). For the record I am not a teenager, I am not a suspicious looking person, and I was not drinking. So they had no possible stereotype / bias to even profile me on, as if my whole goal was to sneak into a Baltimore marriot at 2am? Please. VALUE: Prices were abhorrent here. -20 oz. sodas were nearly 3.00 at the in-hotel cafe located downstairs. -On-site parking in their garage is 26.00 per day, per vehicle, even for hotel guests. -Room rates started at about 300/night. The worst part was that for your nearly 300 a night, you don't get hardly anything. What you'll get is one king or two queens in a CONNECTED room (yes, this plays into the story later...). What else you get / don't get: -No available wi-fi or hardline internet in the rooms. You can pay 12.95 a day to recieve it in the conference / business center, but you will not be able to get that signal from the higher floors (I tried). Even the roach motel down the street from me has wi-fi...get real Marriott. Free wi-fi is only available in the \"lounge\" area, which is directly connected to the main entrance, elevato area, and check-in area. No walls to create any seclusion whatsoever, just a few tables and a few couches in the main lobby. -No mini fridge or ice bucket was provided. -The \"beverages and ice\" room actually only had ice in it...no beverages or even beverage machine to speak of. -An archaic iron and ironing board were present, but there was no microwave. -There are probably less than 25 channels on their TV (which to their credit is a large, relatively nice flat panel). -Walls and doors are paper thin, I could hear every single word people in adjoining rooms and in the hallway were saying, clearly as if they were in my hotel room. So say goodbye to privacy. -No continental breakfast is included. THE STAY: The beds were pretty comfortable and I slept very well, though the fact that I was utterly exhausted at the end of each day was probably helpful in that regard. Around 8am Saturday morning (we finally crashed around probably six hours prior) my brother and I were awoken by screams of children playing in the room next to us -- screaming to their parents \"ONE TWO THREE FOUR TIME TO WAAAAKE UP\" and then continually trying to open the door that connects the rooms. Thankfully after that morning they apparently checked out, as no more screaming children were heard. The fact that high dollar hotel rooms like this connect, particularly when we didn't request any sort of thing, is ridiculous to me. I shouldn't be able to hear screaming children, nor worry about them trying to open the door into my room at 8am. What if the door was unlocked? I can't blame the hotel for how other people's children act -- but I can sure blame them for the lack of noise control and access doors between rooms. OVERALL: I have stayed in high dollar, big name hotels. I have stayed in cruddy, bottom tier motels. I've stayed in everything in between. Thankfully, we are Silver (once gold) members and burned points to stay here -- because if I'd paid cash, I would be out nearly 1000 dollars plus parking to have had this awful experience. I was infuriated with how poorly this hotel was run and managed, how awful the customer service was, and how lacking in quality my room was for the level this hotel is SUPPOSED to be at. I would never ever recommend this hotel to someone, nor will I be staying there again. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had, and the only part that I'm happy about is that I didn't have to pay full price for it. I wouldn't be upset if this was a 100.00 a night place. However, this is a prime example of running a cheap cruddy hotel in a decent location and charging primo dollar for it. I've stayed at other hotels in the area and this one is FAR inferior to them.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSleek and Convenient\u201d", "Author": "oothoonceleb", "ReviewID": "UR73192601", "Content": "With a sleek and inviting first floor, the Renaissance hotel is a hub of activity while maintaining an intimate feel.

Nice fridge that kept all of our water cool. We both slept very well and found the beds to be extremely comfortable. We only ate at the hotel one morning and found the breakfast to be good, but a bit pricey. We both went with the breakfast buffet and I believe the cost without tip was $38. The biggest selling point of the hotel in my book is the location.

That said, it makes pretentions of being a 5-star hotel, but only a total fool would pay the 5-star price for this place. The front desk staff is very good, check-in and check-out were painless and quick. The undergound garage rate is one notch below extortion, yes, and you are well advised to lock anything you want to keep in the trunk - this IS a big city and the criminals DO know where the tourists and all their toys hang out. The rooms are adequate as far as size goes. Furnishings are generally up to date, the bed was comfortable (if anything, they go overboard on the pillows), and the expected extras are in the bathroom. Big minuses are a hefty $12.95 per day charge for internet access, no exhaust fan in the bathroom and rather dim lighting in the mirror there, and a paucity of free channels on the flat screen TV. A smaller minus was the coffee maker, that was cleverly hidden behind the ice bucket in the cabinet under the TV. The biggest downsides are room location and noise - there is only ONE bank of elevators for the entire hotel, so long waits can be common, and since the hotel is laid out in a hollow square, be prepared for a lengthy hike if you room is in a far corner. Of greater concern for many might be the noise. The walls are thin, and you will hear almost every conversation and TV program of your neighbors; the corridors also carry sound quite well and loud, late night groups can wake up an entire floor as they make the long trek to their room. Contrary to some reviews, I did not find the fifth floor restaurant horribly overpriced, but then I wasn't trying to feed a family. There is a huge variety of restaurants within walking distance, but the view from the Harbor Place restaurant can't be beat. I can't say the same for the ground floor coffee shop, it always seemed either overcrowded, understaffed, or both. Although the lobby is nicely appointed and furnished, very loud background music makes it almost impossible to have a normal conversation (maybe that was intentional?)

I have to travel to Baltimore frequently and have often chosen this hotel before. But based on my most recent experience, I will not be staying here again. On this occasion, I chose this hotel only after verifying that it had a business center with computer access, as I knew I needed to submit information by the morning of my departure and I didn't have my laptop with me. The desk clerks told me when I called that the business center had free computers and that it was open 24/7, so I was surprised when I discovered that the computers charged 49 cents a minute for general internet access. Since I arrived at the hotel after midnight and was already in an exhausted state, I'd planned to spend about 20 minutes to submit my information online and then get some needed rest. Unfortunately, the state of the computers in the business center made this impossible. Although there were 3 computers, each was very slow, sometimes taking several minutes to refresh a page (all the while charging 49 cents a minute). On several occasions, in the middle of entering my information, the computer rebooted itself spontaneously. This meant that I had to rescan my credit card and re-enter all of my information. The help desk staff for Showcase (the company that was in charge of the computers) were unable to assist and claimed that the computers were working OK. The front desk at the Renaissance tried to be helpful and sent up their engineer very promptly, but he was unable to do anything as the computers were controlled by and owned by Showcase. By 5 AM, after spending hours trying to get my information entered, I decided that it was a losing battle and that I was better off taking a late penalty and get a few hours of sleep rather than continuing to struggle with the business center computers. [I should also note that I had to spend another 20-30 minutes on the phone the next day with my credit card company who was convinced that Showcase was submitting fraudulent charges on my credit card. In addition, I spoke again today to the Showcase representatives about the fact that my credit card ended up being billed for all of the charges even though the initial help desk person said that 5 of the 6 distinct charges would be dropped.] Based on this experience, I would recommend steering clear of any hotel business center that uses ShowCase services. In other respects, my hotel experience was mixed. The desk clerk staff were very friendly and welcoming as well as trying to be helpful. I was given a room that was a very far distance from the elevators, as is true of many of the rooms at this hotel. So anyone with difficulty walking should specifically request a room that is near the elevator. The hallways and room smelled a bit musty but this was subtle. The room was otherwise nice and the bed was quite comfortable. The hotel location is an excellent one, right across from Harborplace and close to excellent dining choices. I had no trouble with parking though it is expensive as others have noted. In sum, there are many options for lodging in Baltimore in the vicinity of the Inner Harbor and, although I've liked this hotel in the past and it has a number of positives, I was totally alienated by my experience with their business center and will be staying elsewhere in the future.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOne night stay..\u201d", "Author": "Trinity524", "ReviewID": "UR58688440", "Content": "I loved it.

We booked through Priceline and got a rate that was better than most Motel 6's so we were already excited by that. We arrived at the hotel around 4pm (check in time) and were greeted by a valet who instructed where to go to park the car (we decided to self park because it is $10 a night cheaper). It took us about 15 minutes to find a decent spot so be prepared for that. We made our way to the front desk to check in and were helped by Danny. I asked Danny if he could move our room to a harbor view room and when checking he said they didn't seem to have anything available. I explained to him that is was our anniversary and I would really like to make this stay a special one. He then proceeded to check again and was able to fit us in a partial harbor view room that looked directly at the WTC and Hard Rock cafe. I was pleased with this and while we waited for the door keys a gentleman brought my wife and I some hot chocolate. There are four elevators for the hotel and we were a short walk around the bend to our room. I will say that I never felt like I waited too long for an elevator. Because we had chosen the harbor view room we had to take 2 double beds which was fine for reasons I won't discuss here ;) but the room was very clean and the decor was nice and modern. TV was HD flat screen and included HBO and HDnet as well as basic programming. The bathroom was decent enough with the shower having plenty of water pressure. The beds were comfortable enough if not a bit too firm. There is a mini fridge in the room which housed a 12 pack of Orange Crush easily but probably couldn't accomodate much more. This hotel is literally connected to a 4 story mall! Something we didn't realize until the first morning we woke up and were looking for something to eat. You can walk from the lobby through a door and boom you are in the mall.. Pretty cool I must say, although I think it accounts for why it took so long to find a parking spot as the hotel and mall share the space. We were checked on by the housekeeping lady during the day and were given fresh towels. Later that night I approached the front desk after returning from Power Plant Live and asked Danny about late check-out. He and another employee were in a conversation before I came up to them and they jokingly said it would cost me $100 bucks! After a few laughs he went ahead and allowed us 2pm check out. Great job Danny! I was sure to fill out a comment card for him and drop it in the comment box. After all, good service deserves to be recognized. We checked out around 1:30 the next day and that was a breeze as we only owed for the parking. The $100 for incidentals that was held initaly dropped off my credit card the next day (it took 2 weeks almost at the Sheraton in Philly!) and I was wished well and asked to return soon.

BTW, a taxi from BWI was approx. $36 and on the way back -- flat rate of $30. Patrice was working the front desk and upon check in, we provided her with our Marriott Gold Card and identification. The gold card seemed useless to her because we were given a room on a lower floor and she even seemed to question our harbor view room (as if it were a mistake?). As a business traveler, my husband enjoys the perks he gets especially with Marriott. This was a new upgrade in status for him and he should have received an upgraded room with access to the club/concierge lounge (free continental breakfast in the morning) and late check out. None of those things were afforded to us on this trip. That aside, the hotel is perfectly situated and the room itself was fantastic! Loved the large flat screen TV, huge closet, and the bed was one of the best I have ever slept in. Never heard housekeeping in the morning and when we ran out to use the fitness center, the room was cleaned up on our return. Housekeeping was moving like lightning down the halls and doing a spectacular job, not something I see a lot of these days. The bathroom is a little outdated and could use a facelift. The tub has a shower curtain and the tiles are somewhat dated. It was strange to step UP to get into the tub and I still don't know how my 6' tall showered. There is a hairdryer available, which is put in a wire basket on the bathroom countertop. It takes up space and is just ugly to look at. The fitness center was the highlight of this hotel. Large with more treadmills than one would normally see and they were clean and modern! There were also a few elliptical machines and stationary bikes as well as weights. Towels and water were available and disposable cups were made from vegetables -- talk about green! Best of all, if you happen to forget your headphones, they have free ones for you to take. They are individually wrapped and available by the towels. A nice touch for business travelers. Each treadmill had its own television and although there were a lot of people in the gym, it never felt packed and never smelled or felt stuffy. I wish other hotels could take notice and do their fitness centers like this one. Restaurants: When we arrived on Friday, my husband checked in for his conference on the fifth floor and on this floor the hotel's restaurant, Watertable, is located. We did consider going here for dinner, but after reading the reviews on Urbanspoon.com -- we decided to pass. The fifth floor of the hotel is actually connected to the adjoining mall, but there aren't any restaurants other than Sbarro, McDonald's, Starbucks, and I think Manchu Wok. Across the street were a few more options and since we were tired and didn't know the area, this worked for us. In this building is Cheesecake Factory, Pizzeria Uno's, and an Irish pub - Tir Na Nog. In the daylight we discovered far more in the area to do and places to go eat, so please don't limit yourself to the overpriced hotel choices. A short walk in either direction can take you to some great places, including Little Italy. Checking out on Sunday, I called down and asked for a late checkout and was told I could check out at 1 pm, standard response. I waited in the lobby for my husband to finish up and noticed a few burned out bulbs and The Ground Floor Cafe & Bar was understaffed and unimpressive. They have great furniture in the lobby including large tables where you can sit and work if you have to wait. A big turn off was the people who chose to sit on the couches, take off their shoes, and place their feet up on the sofa as if they were at home. C'mon people -- this isn't your home! Overall, the location was the biggest selling point of this hotel and I might stay again in the future because my expectations would be lowered.

Hotel shop has amenities you might need. Room was clean and had very comfy beds, nice TV, in room coffee and a small fridge. Reading lights attached to the beds are a nice tough.

Excellent location right opposite the waterfront and a very comfortable hotel (we also went into the Marriott Waterfront, and we all liked the atmosphere, decor and poistion of the Renaissance better). Plenty of shops and restaurants both within the next door gallery, and over the road on the harbourfront. It is a big hotel, with lots of business meetings and congresses going on, and I suspect it could be a bit impersonal if you were there on vacation. Check-in was fast and efficient. Lifts were fast and large. Rooms are arranged in a huge square, and I had to walk for ages to get to mine - it was fine, but just meant that I had to allow an extra 5-10 mins to get anywhere. If you have limited mobility, you'd be well advised to let them know in advance, so that you can get a room nearer the lifts. Rooms were HUGE - big lobby area with wardrobes, marble dressing stand and general suitcase dumping ground. The wardrobe had an iron and board too, very useful. Not quite enough hangars though (only 6 for a double room), had to phone and ask for extras. The bathroom was off this lobby, and was a standard hotel size, with marble countertop, underslung sink etc. The bath was good and the shower was excellent. Plenty of fluffy towels. No robes or slippers though, even though I asked twice - I'd normally expect these in this class of hotel. However, with so many rooms, the maids take forever to get round them all, and my room was not cleaned until after 3pm each day which was a bit irritating. Then the main room, which was also of a really good size. The bed seemed quite high off the floor, but was extremely comfortable, although 12 pillows seemed slightly over the top. There was a fridge (no minibar), TV, and a good sized desk with internet connection. However, I had to phone technical support to get the internet to work - apparently the wireless had gone down and no-one else had bothered to report it. Odd. The $12.95 cost for 24 hours was reasonable, and once paid for, the wireless connection could be used anywhere in the hotel, so that was quite good. There were plenty of electrical sockets, although it took me a while to work out that they were incorporated into the lamp bases, rather than on the walls. The rooms were pretty quiet for such a large hotel although there was a little bit of traffic noise and the air con was not the quietest. No breakfast included with the room, although there is a Starbucks in the lobby that sells cereals and muffins. We elected to walk to Miss Shirley's, about 2 blocks along on the left - huge pancake and waffle menu, an excellent recommendation by the concierge. We also ate dinner out. However, we had lunch on the fifth floor during our meeting, and everything was of a good standard with a reasonable amount of choice. The meeting rooms were well set up, and the staff here was extremely helpful in organising room layout, catering, electrics, projector etc. The business center was OK, but the cartridge in the printer had run out, so we either had to go down to reception to get things printed, or get a card to let us into the 10th floor where there was an executive suite with another printer. Despite promising to fix the printer on the fifth floor, it didn't happen in the 3 days we were there. The pool was lovely, and the fitness center was apparently also well set up (so my collegaues told me). There are also ice machines and laundry areas on each floor, which was extremely useful. Overall, I liked it and would stay again, mostly because the location was ideal, being right across the road from the aquarium and other activities.

I found out when I took the stairs to the abandoned 7th floor and got chased away by construction workers. The connected mall was kind of cool. Also free Wi-fi was nice.

The Renaissance Hotel is directly across the street from all of amazing things Baltimore has to do. The View--Amazing--- you could see the old ships, the street performers,the water taxi, sailboats, the aquarium, the power house, the old Domino sugar sign reflecting gorgeously on the harbor waters, the cute water dragons that the kids and adults alike paddle throughout the inner harbor and fabulous restaurants... It was a 3 minute walk from the conference center. A 5-10 minute walk to a amazing evening activity of a Orioles baseball game (even though we lost!!) (Oriole fans are fantastic, welcoming and love their city!!).. The hotel though wasn't made with any sort of 'sound protection' in mind. After a full day of being at the conference and enjoying what Baltimore had to offer the noise continued. The constant noise of the the cars going by, the many many fire engines/police/ambulances going by everyday with their alarms on high. I guess there is a really great hospital nearby and this hotel is by their 'flight' pattern.. The windows and walls need sound proofing. The wedding downstairs on Saterday night sounded really great but when we're not invited and its past midnight then either offer a bottle of wine to the people above you or just do slow songs..

I have 2 teenage sons, where was I putting them? Them suggested one sleep on the floor! After telling the front desk how upset we were, they offered us an upgraded room with a king on the 10th floor, harborview. We took the room and the view was awesome. BUT the rollaway NEVER arrived and all they had left was a small cot!!!! After about 8:00 pm after we again had to walk down to the front desk to complain about the bed NOT arriving, they siad that there were NUMEROUS cancellations and we can have a choice of rooms now with 2 double beds, all waterviewm no extra charge! Not sure how they can explain the big change in 4 hours but that room should have went to us in the first place! UNREAL! Also if you get a harborview room, be prepared for LOUD SIRENS ALL NIGHT LONG! The firehouse is right around the corner. Now the positives were that the location couldn't be any better and the view was spectacular. Camden Yeards is a 10 minute walk with plenty of police around so you feel safe. The rooms were VERY clean and the towels were clean and fluffy. The beds were also clean and very comfortable with the exception of one of my sons having to sleep on a cot! We had newly upgraded rooms so I can not speak for the other rooms. Our carpets were very clean and the room had an awesome 48 inch HD flat screen TV with in-room movices for a charge of 13.99. The staff couldn't be any more helpful though and the front desk really tried hard to accomodate us after we complained a bunch of times about forgetting the bed, etc. The guy at the front desk, Mike, even helped us when our car wouldn't start and validated our parking ticket at a lesser price. Valet parking is 35.00 a day whereas if you park in the garage ad take the elevator up yourself, you can pay 25 per day and a bit cheaper if you have it validated at the front desk.

The floor we stayed on was apparently undergoing renovations as evident by the plastic carpet protectors and boxes of floor tile lining the hallways. After our party we returned to our room at about 3 am and went to bed. At 8 am workers in the room immediately next door began cutting floor tile on an electric saw and mixing grout with an electric mixer. My wife spoke with the manager, Alezia Johnson, who stated that the construction was beyond her control. We asked for a different room and were told the hotel was full. We asked why we were not told about the construction at check-in, and told that it was not their policy. We were told that the construction started at a \"reasonable\" hour for a Saturday morning and that \u2018maybe we should have gone to bed earlier!\u2019 At that point we refused to pay for the room by withdrawing authorization for the charge. Our credit card was charged anyway. This is being disputed with American Express. Construction is a fact of life, however, it seems like common sense to put a few buffer rooms between the construction and the guests, and if, as in this case, the workers will block the hallway with tools and construction supplies, they should have closed the floor for safety reasons. The only thing more appalling than the noise at 8 am was the manner in which the management handled the situation.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Located and Fun Hotel for a Solo Traveler on A \"Weekday\" Getaway!\u201d", "Author": "lonelyplanetboy", "ReviewID": "UR22278475", "Content": "True!

Just hop on an Amtrak train bound for Baltimore and when you arrive at the station, take a taxi to this hotel and your solo adventure will begin You can explore this amazing city, check out historic Fells Point, and eat some amazing local food! I walked everywhere along the inner harbor by myself and was never bored! I saw and did so, so much....this hotel was a great base to experience this historic city like a local! Sorry normal people, but Baltimore is a great city for solo travel..... even if you visit it in the off season! Did it matter to them that I wasn't dragging a family with me or carrying a laptop to a meeting somewhere and looking corporate? No. it didn't. Who cares?The staff is very nice here. The lobby is modern and hip. The rooms look like they came from the 1980's and are large, simple and clean.

The property shows signs of wear and tear in some quarters (e.g. hallways and elevators), but overall it is nicely kept. My room on the 12th floor was large and comfortable with a huge flat screen TV for entertainment. The small-ish Ground Floor Cafe and Bar is fine for a quick drink or a cup of joe, but it's not a cozy place for an intimate evening or sensitive business discussions. I only had the brunch at the Watertable restaurant on the 5th floor ($20), so I can't say much about dining. Brunch was standard fare with fresh waffles and eggs available to order. With so many wonderful food choices nearby, take a walk unless you're in a hurry. I spent two weekend nights there in mid-July at a discounted rate and would consider it again at the same price. It's a Marriott rewards category 5, which is about right in my experience. If you don't get a discount or a package deal and you can only book at full rate, think about another hotel.

We had a room on the eleventh floor overlooking the inner harbor. If you are going to stay at this hotel, you must get a room on a high floor that faces the inner harbor, as it will make your stay much more memorable. What views! The hotel is the closest hotel to the harbor and all of its attractions, being right across the street from it. The location is one of the reasons we decided to stay here and our decision to do so was the correct one. All of the attractions, shops, restaurants and sights are within easy walking distance. Orioles Park at Camden Yards, where we saw a baseball game, is an easy five block walk from the hotel. Other notes: The hotel charges $10 a day for internet use (wi-fi free in the lobby, though). In the room, I was able to find other wireless connections for my laptop, so I didn\u2019t have to pay to use the hotels connection. Our room was clean, large and well appointed, but it could have used a nice comfortable chair. I do know that some other rooms had a comfy chair, but not ours. The hotel did provide binoculars for your use in order to take in those views from our eleventh floor room \u2013 nice touch. We had a flat screen TV and, as an unexpected added plus, a small refrigerator. Other plusses: a nightly turn-down service (with chocolate mints) and bath robes. Check-in was quick and easy. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Self parking was a bit pricey at $26 a day (we had two cars which made it even more expensive). The coffee shop in the hotel lobby was very convenient for a quick breakfast, but other options are really close by (Starbucks). The hotel is attached to The Gallery shopping mall (some upscale shops). Other stores are just down the block (Filene\u2019s Basement, Barnes and Noble, Best Buy . . .). We dined in several of the inner harbor restaurants during our stay: we recommend Phillips (great crab cakes!). Street noise was noticeable at night, but that was not a problem at all. It just made the area seem more vibrant and alive \u2013 there was even a wedding reception on the USS Constellation that Saturday night (we could faintly hear the DJ\u2019s music).

We were looking forward to showing our son the sites. So we booked at the Renaissance Harborplace for one night, purchasing the Nat'l Aquarium package, which advertised including free parking, 2 tickets to the aquarium, and free breakfast in the brand new 'Watertable\" restaurant. Check-in was fine, albeit chaotic, but to be expected for a bright, sunny Memorial Day weekend. We requested early check-in and our room was ready early, so it was nice to unload luggage and park the car, and get settled in. We also requested an extra Aquarium child ticket and the front desk was able to accommodate us, which was great. I recommend a hotel package (several offer packages) or buying your aquarium tickets online ahead...do not wait in line to buy. You'll only get tired and frustrated. We had our tickets from the hotel and walked right into the aquarium. Lots of people and street performers on the inner harbor. In the afternoon, we thought we'd try out the pool at the hotel. It was fine, but small, and even at the dinner hour, was quite crowded. After swimming, we selected M&S for dinner, only because the wait wasn't so long. But while it was very pricey...most reasonably priced entree was meatloaf for $16, to NY strip steak for $32, the food was terrific. We had the mahi mahi blackened and the fried shrimp dinner, and both were excellent! We recommend the twice-baked apple pie for dessert. The wait staff were accommodating and friendly and kept our iced tea glasses filled. Nice atmosphere for couples as well as families with children. We recommend it. The hotel is not on the water as it is portrayed in its advertising, but it is a close walking distance to everything. Not the clean, shiny harbor place it used to be though....lots of trash, and loiterers (be prepared for all kinds of people), and the faint smell of stale water everywhere you walk. We did request a harbor view room, but we didn't get one. Instead, we got a view of the inside of the attached Harbor Gallery Shops mall. No big deal as the room was comfortable and clean. Beds very comfy. Bathroom very clean. However, the night of our stay, there was a wedding one floor down and rooms facing the shops could hear the blaring music. I called the front desk once to ask when the music was going to stop as we had children trying to sleep. Music stopped at midnight and we finally settled in for the night. But we were awoken again at 3:35 AM by the fire alarm, and that scared our 9-yr-old. Thirty minutes later, after some confusion, it was determined that a guest had pulled the alarm, and no need to leave the hotel. Needless to say, it wasn't a very restful night after a day of walking and site-seeing. The next morning, we woke up and looked forward to a nice, free breakfast in the brand new Watertable restaurant. But when we went down to breakfast, it appeared as if only one item was on the menu for breakfast, only one cashier/order taker at the counter, and only one family having breakfast. We opted to check the shops or eateries at inner harbor; however, none were open for breakfast at 9 AM Sunday morning. Cheesecake Factory would have been a good choice, but they don't open until 10 on Sundays. We opted to have the valet bring our car, packed up, checked out, and drove to another breakfast restaurant on the way home.

I love shopping so this was just very convenient, for spending a few hours. Also, the selection of restaurant is so big that you can find food for absolutely any tastes and budgets within 10 minutes walking. I would also assume that the proximity of the Aquarium is a plus for family with children: we had the closing night dinner there and I can say this place is a must see for anyone, not only for kids. The room was clean and spacious, and everything worked as expected. We arrived at lunchtime, along with 100 other tourists, so the check in process was a bit slow, but there is nothing I would hold accountable the hotel for. My room had a nicely sized sitting area, and the work desk was a bit aside from the bed which made working at late hours a bit less difficult.

Yet we\u2019ve been charged $10 a day, and here comes the worse part, for a service that we didn\u2019t use.

The room was very nice--we always look forward to the comfortable Marriott beds with their cushy comforters and thick mattress pads. This hotel is a bustling place that hosts many business functions. It is, however, also a great place for the leisure traveler--the location is terrific--cross the street, and you're on the harbor or in the mall that fronts the harbor and contains several restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, California Pizza, a sushi bar, tapas restaurant, Irish pub). A short walk in different directions offers you various cultural or shopping options. The hotel itself has a free wireless internet connection in the lobby only; the room connection is $10 daily, but with that comes free local and long distance calls -- something I didn't realize until check out when I came across that bit of info in the book in the room. We had stayed at the Marriott Waterfront the preceding month, which initially appeared to be the better hotel. There are trade-offs, though, that ultimately led us to prefer the Renaissance: the coffee shop downstairs, the free internet access in the lobby, pleasant & eager-to-please personnel, convenience to many harborfront attractions & restaurants, a liveliness about the place -- the Marriott Waterfront was much more subdued. The Renaissance is connected to the Gallery mall--accessible on the 1st & 5th floors--other reviewers had commented that that connection compromised their feeling of safety. We didn't feel that way at all; all areas of this hotel are teeming with personnel and there is always a very safe feeling. We stayed here for 6 nights when my husband had surgery at Hopkins--a $10 cab ride & 15 minute ride away. One night, I returned to the hotel alone at 11 P.M. and there was so much activity and such a presence of staff that I felt extremely safe. The staff at this hotel truly seems to enjoy working here. Aside from that, being in this hotel minimized the feeling that our world was being turned upside down with a serious surgery. I know that is not the experience of the typical traveler, but many travel to Hopkins for its medical excellence, and it is nice to balance that experience with a stimulating harbor location and a lively hotel that also offers you luxury & quiet. We did not use the pool, but it & the whirlpool appeared very nice; the exercise room was open 24 hours. We'd return here in a heartbeat, even with the $26 daily parking charge.

They were very efficient. I only needed a 5-minute warning to have my car brought around. The best thing about this hotel is that they don't make you feel inferior because you booked on Priceline.

They said they were out of water view rooms, but I got a room on the 11th floor (the hotel has 12 floors.) Room 11009 faces a courtyard and is still a nice view. It is certainly better than some hotels where you are looking at rooftops. The rooms are very large for a downtown hotel. The beds are very comfortable. The linens are a very nice quality and I love all their pillows. The seating area and the work are very roomy. The whole hotel feels as if it has been re-done and well maintained. The bathrooms are a nice size and the water pressure was great. The towels are a nice quality. They do not provide robes. The stock the regular Renaissance Lather products. I personally really like products...especially the Lemongrass soap. The closets are a nice size. They do not have safes in the room. Room service is served until midnight. The selection is very good and the prices are reasonable. There was a old refridgerator in the room, but it was not stocked. I'm assuming this is something that will be replaced in the near future. It didn't match the rest of the hotel. The free wireless internet worked great. As others have said, if you are visiting Baltimore and want to say on the Harbor...this is the place.

The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect - allowing you easy access to the Harbor and many other venues of downtown Baltimore. The hotel itself is beautiful - but still undergoing renovations in some areas. My room was spacious and extremely comfortable - exactly what I would expect in a $200-$500/night base rate room at a Marriott. Of note is that internet access is an additional $9.95/day - just irritating in a world where I can have free access at a Holiday Inn Express. If your room is on the 12th floor, you have access (using your room key) to the Club which provides continental breakfast, beverages, hors d'oueuvres, and dessert. Rooms are quiet - there is an Anime conference in Baltimore this week and many, many loud costumed participants. My room, situated mid hall, has been virtually silent. There is a nice pool and direct access to the Gallery - 5 floors of shops adjacent to the hotel. The Harbor is directly in front of the hotel. BIG problems: I arrived late Tuesday night after working and traveling all day - was booked into room 12068. As it was late, I did not explore the room until after checking email and calling home. 15 minutes after the bellhop left, I headed for the bathroom which I found in dissaray and wet - clearly uncleaned from the last user. There was a wet towel on the bed and the mini bar had been raided as well. The bed itself was in order except for the towel. I called the \"Delighted to Serve\" operator who appeared to not believe me, but assured me she would send house keeping. 20 minutes later, I made a second call asking for a new room. 20 additional minutes later, I got John, the night supervisor who had my room changed immediately and provided me with a $38.00 credit for breakfast during my stay for my trouble. It was now nearly 2am. Needless to say, I did not sleep well. Crystal glasses in the bathroom were the next snafu - one of which slipped from the granite countertop into the sink and shattered. My request for cleanup was minimally met - they got the glass out of the sink, but did not check the countertop for shards so it was still hazardous when I returned from my day of conferencing. Friday brought my lunchtime visit to Windows - Watertable (Marriott's award winning restaurant). I went in anticipation of a great meal, only to find the service absolutely unacceptable: long wait for initial contact from waitstaff, disregard of request for tea without lemon (3 times), no offer of bread, etc. I asked to order from the dinner menu in order to get the famous and requisite Maryland Crabcake and was told I could at a cost of $32 for a single crabcake. Fine. I expected the extras afforded to a dinner priced entree and was presented LITERALLY with a crabcake on a white rectangular platter. I had requested salad, which came seconds before the entree - undressed. Another salad came with the crabcake - again mixed greens from the bag - nothing more - no dressing. Bread was again requested and I was informed that it had been used by the large party which arrived about 15 minutes after I did. Long story short - Crabcake and cold bread - $32.00. I did give extensive feedback to the restaurant manager and by the end of my comments (like above) I had 7 people listening to me and an offer to return for dinner - gratis (I declined). When I arrived back to my room yesterday afternoon - I had a bottle of wine and a fruit/cheese tray and an apology. This was very, very nice until I realized that there was a very small, live baby cockroach wandering on the dish of fruit and cheese under the plastic wrap. Alrighty. This morning I awoke in anticipation of my breakfast - using the credit provided 3 days ago. Of course, I had to greet room service in my PJ's because the housekeeping staff took my robe yesterday and did not replace it. My bill for 4 days is $983.06 - not including the breakfast I hope will added and then removed from my bill. Parking is $25.00/day - I did not use. Cab fare to BWI airport is about $35.00.

This was our second time staying at the Baltimore Harbourplace Renaissance. The room was a very large king.

The room was clean with very nice white linens. The housekeeping staff actually CLEAN he rooms - we even saw carpets routinely being shampooed, not just swept. Amenities included an indoor pool, hot tub, and sauna. A nice workout area. Nice bath products, too. The lobby is nice (but the restaurant is under renovation). They provide ice cold lemon/lime water in the lobby which is great when you return from the heat and humidity that is Baltimore in the summertime. Fresh lilies make the lobby smell great. The staff was also very friendly. We were always greeted with smiles, doors opened, and a polite \"hello\" in the hallways. The location is perfect for families and people who want to \"see\" Baltimore. The hotel is directly on the water, just across from all the tourist hotspots.

First, the positives: as everyone has said, this is one of the best-located hotels in Baltimore, across the street from Inner Harbor and attached to a four-story, somewhat high-end, indoor shopping center. We were upgraded to a harborview room on a weekend with tall ships sailing in and out of the harbor. Even number rooms in the 02 to 20 range have this view -- beautiful. The staff could not be more polite or accommodating. When I stood on line a little too long to pay my bill, the concierge came over to apologize, take my bill, and correct a $90 error. The room was large, well-furnished (except for an armoire that should have been replaced because of the chips and nicks in it, even though the hotel is undergoing a total makeover), and the bathroom amenities were all top notch. The workout room is rather small and the pool is a bit of a hike from one end of the hotel to the other. I didn't mind because I walk everywhere, but someone with children or an older person staying in a harborview room would have some walk. On the real negative side, dining options are limited in the hotel. The restaurants are undergoing renovation, so breakfast is served in one of the meeting rooms -- buffet only, nothing off the menu. The buffet was standard fare and fine. Room service breakfast was very bad -- greasy eggs and home fries not befitting a hotel of this stature. Fortunately, there are many wonderful restaurants close by the hotel (recommendations at the end of this review). The one thing that really irked me was the poor excuse of a business center. Horribly maintained with broken furniture, a company contracted by the hotel provides Internt access for 49 cents a minute. I learned my lesson -- NEVER travel without my laptop and a V-card. Online services are provided in the room for about $10 a day. This is a pet peeve with the Marriott Corporation hotels. With so many smaller hotels, chains, and establishments of lesser quality offering free Internet service, why must Marriott (including Renaissance) continue to charge for access? Of course, I know the answer. Business travelers like me will pay for it. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and when the refurbishment of the hotel is complete, I'm sure issues with food will be ironed out. As for fine dining, tops on my list is Charleston at 1000 Lancaster Street in the Harbor East area -- nouvelle Southern cuisine. If you can afford to splurge, get the seven course tasting menu -- superb! Chef Cindy Wolf oversees the kitchen (we had a table looking into the kitchen, which I enjoy watching). Top service, beautiful space, and outstanding food. Other nice choices -- Roy's has a top notch branch near the Polish Martyrs memorial and the high-rise Marriott Waterfront in the Harbor East area. If you like sushi, Edo Sushi on the second floor of the Inner Harbor building you see directly across from the Renaissance is delicious and has a welcoming and efficient staff.

Check-in was easy, we came in around 4:30 and waited less than five minutes. I asked for a high floor, and was given the 9th. The room was fairly large (I'll upload pics tonight) and the bathroom was larger than most. The nicest part about the bathroom was that you can hear the television through a speaker in the ceiling. We stayed in 9009 and had a view of the courtyard and pool. It was not what I had in mind, but did not intend to stay long. The pool is very small, but goes up to 6'.

The room is spacious and the water view is simply spectacular.

You won't be disappointed! The lobster boil is also superb. In retrospect, there is a few hotels that offer more amenities on paper and cost less, but I can't stress enough how convenient it is, after a long day of shopping / dining / sight-seeing, a nice room with unparallel views awaits you merely a few minutes away. A few blocks of walking is a whole lot more than you think at the end of each day! TIP 1: Before booking this hotel from all those travel websites, try the property's website directly first! I regret I didn't do it. The property offers really good deals / packages periodically. For example, you could book your room at Expedia or Travelocity at $239 a night, but for $30 more, you could have book it directly from the hotel and get 4 adults tickets to National Aquarium (that's $130 folks!) or, for $10 more, 4 breakfast buffets ($64 value). TIP 2: You want a healthy exercise? Try the Dragon Paddle Boat! The rental is merely 2 minutes away from the hotel, right next to the World Trade Center.

Our room was ready and we were placed in room 11043. Room: Nice size room, very clean, bathroom clean, tub, sink, toilet, floor all were spotless (no hair). The room, bedding, and furniture were all clean and dusted. Lather bath products (love them) were in the bathroom. No dust on the tables, behind the curtain, or even behind the TV (I checked).

The lifeguard immediately stopped children who were diving (no diving is permitted) or behaving in an unsafe manner. Well monitored pool area by the lifeguard. We didn't use the sauna but did use the whirlpool/jacuzzi and it was also clean. Yes, the pool is small, it is not an Olympic Size Pool but it is adequeate especially for children. Staff: Excellent, friendly and greeted us with a hello/smile in the hallways. Concierge was very helpful. He provided us with directions as requested to the Great Blacks in Wax Musuem (excellent by the way), and to local restaurants. He was very friendly, accomodating, and thorough. Room Service: Our meals arrived within the 25 minute guarantee with a smile each time. Set up was complete and professional. The food was good and priced fairly in my opinion. I don't expect \"value priced meals\" when ordering room service in a hotel. Let's be realistic.

Although the conference room was the size of an apartment and the view was amazing, the \u201cqueen bed\u201d was a rollaway twin about a foot off the floor next to the conference table. We called to the front desk, and they said they'd bring up a queen. About 45 minutes later (and only after a second call), another rollaway bed was delivered, but it was only a double. The thin mattress was very uncomfortable, the sheets were coarse, and the box spring was literally falling apart. We felt like we were one step up from camping. We tried the pullout bed in the couch. The edges of the thin mattress were curled upwards, and we could feel the metal bars through the mattress. We moved back to the rollaway bed after I cut my elbow on an exposed piece of metal in the pullout couch. We requested a room change, but the front desk said nothing would be available until the next day. Because we were going to be out most of the day, we were told we would have to check out of our room and let the front desk store our things for the day. Not only did we not want the hassle of re-packing and moving, at this point, we had very little trust in the front desk to secure our luggage. In the end, we had two nights of horrible sleep, and we both had neck and back stiffness the following day. I am shocked that a hotel like the Renaissance thought it would be acceptable to misrepresent the quality of the room (it was not a suite, it was not an upgrade, and there was NO queen bed) and then charge 300+ a night for us to sleep on a rollaway bed.

Everyone was very nice and helpful in the check-in process, even though I'm sure they knew we bought the reservation on priceline.com for practically nothing. It didn't matter, they treat everyone like celebrities here. We didn't need help with our little suitcases and the butler didn't push (i hate it when they force themselves on you when you can easily roll your own little bag!). I let the lady checking us in know that we were celebrating a birthday and within minutes of entering our room the maid arrived with a birthday card and chocolate dipped strawberries from the hotel! How sweet! The room was gorgeous (and I'm picky!) a huge bed, new carpet, pretty drapes, just very tasteful! The bed was unreal. About 6\" pillowtop with a featherbed, 400+ threadcount sheets, down comforter, tons of pillows of various types to choose from. Of course there was an in-room coffeemaker (standard) but you know how aweful that stuff usually is. Not here! Organic, Fair Trade coffee and it was so delicious that I brewed two pots while I stayed there! YUM! The bath products are made by Lather, an up-scale brand with light but delicious scents made with nice ingredients (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, two soaps, plus sealed Qtips and cottonballs). I asked for extra bath stuff to take home with me! We stayed on a Friday night and be warned that if you have a harbor view it will be noisy. This hotel is literally on top of the action (there is a 4-story mall under the hotel) and there are bands playing outside and lots of people enjoying themselves all around. There are also quite a few ambulences that add to the noise. I wasn't bothered by it because we only had a partial view room but I can see how some people might be annoyed. Do not get a courtyard view room, it's pretty blah--no grass or flowers, just brick and an indoor pool to look at. If you eat at Phillips order the Chessapeake Crabcakes. We ordered breakfast room service and it arrived 10 minutes late, so it was free (it's their policy!). I'd highly recommend the Eggs Benedict. Wonderful spread including the heating tray to keep things warm if you aren't going to eat right away. They allowed us to have a late checkout at 1pm and also stored our luggage until our flight at 5pm. The butler offered us delicious lemonade as we left! I can't wait to go back, this hotel is in the best location out of all the hotels. The service was excellent. You won't regret staying here! Bought the night on priceline for $102.

It's much smaller than we imagined and much more crowded (in terms of buildings) so it's not very picturesque. We have two kids so we did the aquarium which is cute (Definitely buy your tickets ahead of time online. We were so glad we did. Otherwise you have to wait in a long line for tickets only to be told what time to come back to be admitted. But because we had tickets in advance, we were able to walk right in). We also did the Maryland Science Center which we didn't care for. Not much to do or see.

Check-in went smoothly enough, we requested a rollaway bed without issue and it was delivered within the hour. We also requested more towels and these were promptly delivered as well. We paid a rate of $219/night, including breakfast for 2 people either via room service or their signature restaurant, Windows. The first morning we opted for room service - called at 8:30 am for breakfast for the four of us. The way they work things is that they give you a $33 credit towards breakfast and you pay anything over and above that amount. That was fine. They said our order would be delivered in 25 minutes or less. Well, 45 minutes came and went and finally we called and they said it would be another couple of minutes, but because of the length of our wait, the apologized and said the entire breakfast was complimentary. That sounded great to us, but in reality it took another 30 minutes at least before our food was delivered. It was lukewarm and they forgot our orders of toast, but at that point, we were so hungry, we didn't have the energy to complain! The second day we opted breakfast in the Windows restaurant. It is a nice restaurant with a great view of the Inner Harbor and the food was great. When the bill came, they didn't take the difference off for the credit that we got in our room rate and when I questioned them, they said they would do it and it would be correct on our bill when we went to check out. Needless to say, when we checked out, the full amount for breakfast was still on our bill and the assistant manager had to make a couple of phone calls to get it all straightened out. He did, but it was still a tad bit inconvenient.

Firstly, there was this sense of southern hospitality when the bellman was seen admiring my wife carrying 20 pieces of luggage by herself. After check-in, we squeezed through the door fit for a ten year old and plunged into the bed never to return. In all fairness, some people like a bed that swallows them whole. After peeling from the abyss, we began investigating what other exciting features this room may have to offer. Highlights such as previously owned shampoo bottles, flame throwing air conditioner (1970's window unit), and stained sheets reminded us of how lucky we were to be enjoying the weekend in the heart of the quarter. After we realized alcohol couldn't even help this room, we decided to check into the Omni Orleans at 4am and cursed for not doing it sooner.

I circled the entire French Quarter 4 times before the lone attendant arrived to shoo traffic around my car while I straddled the curb to check in. He had been unavailable because of the \u9225\u6e03ommute\u9225?between the main property and the Cottages where I was staying. After I checked in, he navigated my car another lap around the Quarter until we arrived at the Audubon Cottages, again straddling the curb so I could off-load. There, just after dark, was a staff member, lurking in the dark in the sitting room area of the Cottage. One look at me, and he quickly slunk off into the night \u9225?aware that he had violated the most important rule in all hoteldom \u9225?staffs do not spend time in the room unless doing work. Then the real nightmare began. The floor of the first bedroom had stains from patrons vomiting (something one expects on Bourbon Street from the strollers there, but not in one\u9225\u6a9a room), and throughout our stay no one bothered to vacuum the bobbie pins and other debris left on the floor by previous occupants. In one of the 2 bathrooms, the toilet leaked onto the floor, then on our last day it simply stopped flushing. The flat-screen TV (spoken of glowingly in other reviews) was off kilter, so one watched garbled pictures. The wireless Internet service \u9225\u6e22hroughout the property\u9225?never did work \u9225?so the first morning, I trekked over to the main property, but the Internet service there, having failed the night before, was likewise out of order (so I ended up trudging down the block to a dingy Internet caf\u8305). So much for enjoying a leisurely morning coffee in my room \u9225?I ended up spending more time at the Internet caf\u8305 than at the Maison de Ville! New Orleans is famous for its decadence, but the two jardini\u732bres on either side of the door to our cottage contained limp, dead plants which failed to revive despite my watering them (moral: The staff is not being supervised, and the management is not touring the property often enough to notice the problems). The much-vaunted \u9225\u6e07irst swimming pool in the Quarter\u9225?was ice cold, and no one seemed interested in a polar bear plunge throughout our stay. The \u9225\u6e01ntique\u9225?furniture is just old, care-worn stuff \u9225?and the pictures of historical English figures (Oliver Cromwell and Sarah Churchill in our Cottage) would have given traditional New Orleanians fits. When I complained to the Manager about the ongoing lack of Internet service, I was given a much-pained look and offered a credit on my bill for the cost of the Internet caf\u8305 charges. In the ensuing verbal duel I told her that, for over $600 a night (base charge of $539, plus the confiscatory state and local taxes), I was expecting basic amenities to be in place and workable \u9225?which simply isn\u9225\u6a9b the case with this property. Recommendation: This is not a hotel; it is a rather poorly maintained guest house whose staff seems a bit out of control; do not expect high standards of service or hygiene; and for the same neighborhood and much lower prices, I highly recommend the Olivier House Hotel which, interestingly enough, constitutes one contiguous property between the 2 Maison de Ville \u9225\u6e03ommutable properties, but it has much more spacious, interesting, and well maintained rooms and suites. (In fact, after several attempts to get dining and other information out of the Maison de Ville staff, I started going into the Olivier where the staff was much more responsive and knowledgeable.)

I now live in NYC, so I wasn't really interested in the big box type hotel (no Ritz or Windsor Court) and wanted to try a good BB or smaller hotel with more character - preferably in or near the Quarter. Also, was planning on getting engaged on this trip, so the place also needed to be really nice, romantic, have a good level of service, amenities, etc. Ended up making a decision between the Soniat House, Maison de Ville, House on Bayou Road and Maison Perrier. Ended up taking Maison de Ville primarily based on location and then Trip Advisor reviews. First of all, the place couldn't be in a better location if you want to be in the Quarter. A block off Bourbon, but still quiet enough if you take a room on the courtyard. Luaggage drop off is a pain since the street is narrow and one way, but the main building is fantastic - the courtyard is off the charts. Gary at the front dest was a huge help with everything and a great guy. We actually stayed in Audubon Cottage #1 which is about a block away on Dauphine. The cottages are totally secluded and surround what's said to be the oldest swimming pool in the Quarter. Our place shared a huge patio and fountain with Cottage #7. The place had two bedrooms, two large bathrooms, a large living area, a ton of antique furniture and was really one of the most unique places I've ever stayed in the US. Fiance is a high-end event planner and she said the same. Large bay doors open out of the living room onto the patio and we would eat our great breakfast in the morning listening to birds and the fountain. Service was good and amenities are nice - full wireless, flat screen TV's. I think there is a certain trade-off to staying in this kind of place v. a larger hotel, meaning that if I was in town for a night on business, I'd probably stick to the CBD since it's a little easier to get in and out (if you have a car, parking is offsite at the Ramada and $30/ day - bellman will grab your car in about 5 minutes through), but otherwise, I'd reccomend this as one of the better hotels in the country.", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR548421710", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bogginla"}, {"Content": "Damp room The hotel is lovely situated in the French Quarter.

The room was way to damp and the air conditioner kept me awake most of the night. I tried to change room, but the hotel was full. Furthermore, the bathroom floor was dirty. The 8 towels were changed once a day (very good) and the sheets once during my 3 nights-stay. Breakfast is nice- take it on the balcony or in the courtyard. A friend had a room upstairs, which was absolutely charming (nr 4), with a canopy bed and Toile de Jouy hangings, so I'm certain the hotel is worth its 175 dollars/ night/ single room. Do stay at Hotel Maison de Ville while visiting New Orleans, but stay away from the courtyard rooms! Tip: eat lunch at Bayona, Commander's Palace, Bourbon House.

The Maison de Ville has definitely returned to it's pre-K standards!! We have stayed at many properties in the Quarter thru the years, but once we found the Maison de Ville, we have stayed no where else. The ambiance and staff are simply unbeatable!

Nothing is better than walking thru your floor to ceiling bedroom window to have coffee and pastries on your balcony ,watching the Quarter wake up.

You can see the damage if you look, and the empty slabs and shattered houses of the 9th ward, East New Orleans, and the Lakeview area stand as testaments to the tragedy that befell this beautiful city and shattered the lives of so many of its citizens.

The next thing I noticed was that the room was very dark and I'm talking like a cave. There were no over head lights, just two nightstand lights. At this point I was getting a little let down....till I walked into the bathroom..Come to find out only one light bulb was working. Sure everything was marble and not bad fixtures but I could barely see....the fan, overhead light and one light bulb above the sink were all either burned out or not working. We did have a flat screen tv but it really didn't matter at this point. Did I happen to mention that the walls were wood paneling-which also made the room very dark.

Breakfast in the courtyard is so peacful listing to the fountain and watching the two big turtles swim around. The bed was so soft. The matress was down and so were the pillows and the comforter. It was like a little piece of heaven. We enjoyed the feel of staying in a place with so much history while watching the British Open on a flat screen television. A nice touch to a very historical room. Although this hotel is only a half a block off Bourbon Street it is amazing that the minute you enter the front door, all the noise is gone. We never heard the noise of Bourbon Street. The location of this hotel is excellent for sightseeing and enjoying the party on Bourbon Street. We loved the afternoon port wine and sherry available for their guests. A nice way to unwind from the day and relax before dinner. We did get a key from Tina and go over and look at the cottages and the swimming pool about a block away that are also part of this hotel. They are hidden away and share a common courtyard of their own. This will probably be our choice next time we stay at Maison de Ville. I have been to the quarter many times before and have stayed in many of the high rise hotels, but I will return to Maison de Ville from now on. I can't say enough good things about this hotel, we loved our stay and will never stay anywhere else when we come to the quarter.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR844042844", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Modaud"}, {"Content": "like being in europe My daugher and I visited the cresent city for the first time since the hurricane.

We had to cancel a trip last October because of Katrina, and we were not sure when it would be OK to visit New Orleans again. We checked closely, and went the last week of April. Well, we are so glad we did. The hotel is completely shipshape. No sign of water damage whatsoever. The Bistro at Maison de Ville is likewise. All your favorite people are there: Brian, Greg, Patrick, and HollyBrian at the Bistro. Rates are down, and rooms that are usually booked a year in advance are much easier to get than usual just because the word isn't out. For those of you who have never stayed at the Maison de Ville, this little gem is a well-kept but widely known secret. It is small, right off Boubon Street, European style, and by far the most romantic hotel in the Vieux Carre. It has one of those courtyards that tourists hear about but very few ever get to see. Top-notch French-style continental breakfast is served on your balcony, in the courtyard, or in your room (your preference) on a silver tray with a rose and a newspaper daily until noon (included in daily rate). The Bistro, located next door, also is less widely known because it is small, but the food there is matched only by the two or three top restaurants in the city and surpassed by none.The Quarter is actually in fine shape. If you like the music or dancing, it seems the businesses in the quarter are actually trying harder to please in order to attract people back. Crowds are a bit light, especially midweek (a good thing?), but even midweek there are lots of live bands playing lots of music. On the weekends the Quarter fills up, especially with people from all over the region who can drive to town. Most of the top restaurants have reopened; if it's the food that brings you back, you will have no problem finding your favorites. We had our usual super bangup time. Maybe a little bit better than usual. Besides, we think we should help our friends in need, and what they need is visitors. N'Awlins is reknowned above all for its hospitality. Here is a chance to return that favor while enjoying your vacation. Hey, y'all. It's time to come back.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR491179452", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fanandsteve"}, {"Content": "Fabulous Find, Obscenely Comfortable This is the type of hotel you hope to find when you vist a place like the French Quarter. For us during the madness of the Jazz Fest, it was an oasis from the noise and movement and excitement. It is the type of hotel you swear you will keep a secret until the day you die, yet, at the same time, you find yourself sharing it with your aunt, your friend at work, your neighboor, kicking yourself all the while because, soon, someone will be sitting having a drink on *your* balcony and sleeping in *your* bed. Here are some details to make your mouth water.Location: Right where you want to be, just off of Bourbon Street. Far away enough from the party in the street, but close enough to walk right into it.Breakfast: You can have the continental breakfast brought to your room. We had ours in the courtyard, which was a cool, flower-draped place, with greenery tumbling over the walls. They brought us fresh orange juice, hot coffee, croissants fresh from the oven, and sweet rolls. With plenty of butter and cream and jam to go with, and with those weather-softened bricks under our bare feet, we swore that we were all moving to the French Quarter! The courtyard had a lovely fountain, that was quiet and gentle, with interesting balconies, all was swept and clean and soothing.Bedrooms: I could have sworn we had the nicest, the *best* room in the whole place. After all, it had an enourmous bed, and a balcony that overlooked Toulouse Street and one of those cool windows you push up far enough to where you can just walk right out onto the balcony. Then I got a peek at some of the other rooms and realized they were *all* like that, with special touches that could make you feel you were in some unique place undiscovered by anyone else. The bed? Oh, man. Obscene. A grand, king sized bed designed to make you want to get out of it just so you could get back into it. There was first a pillow-top mattress. On top of that was a feather padding, about two inches thick. On top of that was a batting to give even more cushion. Then this was covered by 300 count clean white sheets, and there was about ninety-eleven (six!) pillows so there was no need to be stingy or even share.Decor: This hotel, like many others, suffered during Katrina. However, within the walls of the hotel, of the hurricane I found no sign. The hotel was one of the last to open this season, and when I asked why, I found out that it was because they wanted it to be just exactly like it was. All the furniture and stuff was taken out and cleaned. The walls were dried and cleaned of mold and then repainted in those soft hues so suitable to the French Quarter. The floors shined as though they had been lovingly polished by hand for hours. The bannisters gleamed, the windows were spotless. The whole place smelled clean and fresh. The furniture was what it should be, a collection of slightly Victorian, slightly French with dark polished wood carved in graceful curves.Brian: The man in charge. The concierge. He took care of so many things for us while we were there, and seemed to be available whenever we needed him. When we arrived at the hotel, and went too far in the car down the street, Brian sent someone out to park the car for my dad, so that he did not have to sit in the heat to wait to go around the block in the stand-still traffic. They took our luggage right up to our rooms, and Brian delt with the cumbersome oxygen tanks that my dad has to travel with. Then Brian gave me directions to just the right bar to take my neice to get a drink, and answered our questions about the hotel and its history. He's been with the hotel for at least 20 years and seemed to really enjoy his job.Overall Rating: Excellent! I have a thing for old buildings that are kept up with love and respect. This hotel retains the charm and texture of its history, and while there is a computer in the lobby for you to use, it is arranged so that you almost don't see it sitting there amongst the small side table, the victorian couch, and the standing room screen. The plants. The rugs. The gleaming floor. You get the picture. Sure, if you want someplace new you can find plenty of new, sparkling hotels on the edge of the FQ that have wall to wall carpets and elevators and stuff like that. But if you're coming to the French Quarter to get a little texture and charm and something real, then why on earth would you stay anyplace else? All the rooms are unique, and it staying there is more like visiting your Aunt Louise, who has a thing for French windows and can afford the staff to keep up that floor and deliver your croissants while they are still warm. The only thing you will regret is that you don't live there yourself.", "Date": "May 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR436366567", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Maison de Ville I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in April of 06.

My husband (who is a hotel manager himself) and I had a wonderful experience with the Maison de Ville, even before we stayed there - we got into New Orleans after a red-eye flight to catch a cruise ship. The hotel staff were very accomodating and happily held our luggage for us while we went out for breakfast, killing time before we could board our ship. In fact, they helped us find a restaurant that my husband remembered from a previous trip to New Orleans (The Old Coffee Pot - on the block behind the hotel).When we returned from our cruise, Patrice (at the front desk) and Albert (the bellman and great asset to the hotel!) were there again to greet us. We got in early and they did all they could to get our room ready before the usual check-in time. They offered us juice, water or coffee while we waited in the cute lobby. We talked with Brian, the concierge, who was very helpful. The courtyard (with turtles in the fountain!) is very cute and relaxing. We chose to have our (complimentary) breakfast in the courtyard each morning. The coffee was fantastic (and served in elegant little silver pots), and the fresh orange juice and warm croissants and yummy pastries were a fantastic way to start the morning.Our room (#11) was not huge, but had a fantastically comfortable and very large bed, along with a nice mini-bar, great shower and plenty of closet space. We overlooked the courtyard of the hotel and a little courtyard restaurant next door. The restaurant from time to time (during daytime hours - no disturbing noise at night or early morning) had a live jazz trio which was like our own private concert as we sat on the chairs of our balcony.Yes, the bed was comfy, the location of the hotel is super (a few doors down from Bourbon Street, in the heart of the French Quarter) and the continental breakfast and complimentary internet service in the lobby are all super, however it is truly the service at this hotel that sets it apart. We were blown away by how truly kind, accomodating and warm the staff were. They went out of their way to make us comfotable and happy. It is truly the best hotel service (next to my husband's hotel, of course!) that we have ever experienced in our many travels.

Stayed in a balcony room w/ king bed. The balcony overlooked Toulouse Street (just off of Bourbon) and it was very nice to sit out there in the afternoon, listening to jazz music and watching the people below. The bed was comfortable and the room was furnished with antiques. The bathroom was also very nice - not spectacular, but clean and more than adequate. The hotel itself is very old and in a historic building with a beautiful courtyard where they serve complimentary sherry and snacks in the late afternoon.Service was impeccable. They allowed us to check in early and to check out late on our departure date when we asked at the last minute. They even offered to print our airline boarding passes for us when we left (most places will point you to the business center and certainly won't offer). Our favorite part was the complimentary breakfast each morning which you can have brought to your room on a silver tray or enjoy it in the courtyard. A carafe of coffee, juice and several pastries and croissants, all still warm from the oven (very fresh and delicious). A great way to start the day. Overall, the hotel was very romantic and homey.Restaurants:Bella Luna - We really enjoyed this restaurant. It overlooks the Mississippi River and has huge picture windows which afford a great view. Definitely a romantic environment. We had excellent service while we were there - waiter came by to pour wine periodically and check on us but was otherwise unobtrusive. Food was very good - more nouveau creole/southern cuisine. GW Finns - known for fresh and inventive seafood dishes. The smoked oyster appetizers were to die for. The menu changes daily depending upon what fish they can get in fresh that day so it's difficult to recommend specific dishes. Our service was good but a bit overly friendly (he talked our ears off for a good 15 minutes about his hometown - it was just a bit much but better than having a rude waiter). Would recommend highly - we went early (6pm) and did not need reservations.Napoleon House - Had a casual lunch in the courtyard. Just a 1/4 muffaletta and a salad. Adequate and inexpensive. The courtyard is nice, weather permitting. Service is what I call reactive. If you are pleasant to the waiters (who tend to be older gentlemen) then you get good service. We watched a group of 4 come in and they were very obnoxious right off the bat to the waiter. When they told him they were in a hurry he basically told them that they should go elsewhere or shut up. Personally, I thought they deserved it but I'm sure they thought he was rude. Definitely stop by the old bar for a Pimm's cup.Deanies in the Quarter - Had lunch here. Food was so-so (just a po-boy, kind of hard to mess up). Problem was the service. We sat at the bar, which is very large. They had 1 bartender who was serving food and drinks to approximately 30 people at the bar alone and doing drink orders for the restaurant, which is large. It took forever to get a drink, to get our order taken, to get our food and to pay. I felt sorry for him b/c he was clearly working hard but the management needed a few more bar backs.Felix's Oyster House - We like Felix's. If you just want raw oysters and the shuck-n-jive, it's the same at felix's as it is at Acme across the street. So, why wait? Dinner in the restaurant is so-so. You're probably better off sticking with either gumbo or po-boys. I had blackened fish and it was mediocre but the twice baked potato on the side was great.Just a few bars we liked - Jean Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, Napoleon House, Fritzel's, Molly's on the Market. These were good bars for sitting and talking and catered more to people in their late 20s and up (i.e., no loud music or frat boys puking up their hand grenades).

Will not stay there again1 I stayed at this hotel and I must admit that I am very surprised about the very high ratings and reviews this hotel is getting. Besides having a great concierge in Brian, a helpful staff and a beautiful courtyard, this hotel has by far to many flaws to grant a top 20 twenty rating on this site.The rooms are very small and do not even earn a 3 star rating. The room rates for this hotel are over prized. The restaurant, which is part of this hotel, is also not of the high quality the reviews promise, as our dinner was extremly disappointing and over prized. In addition we overheard other guests as well complaining.In conclusion I like to state that at least in my opinion this hotel and restaurant does not earn the high ratings it received from Fodors and Frommers, especially if you consider the high prices.The next time I will visit New Orleans I will definately stay at another hotel, but not at the Hotel Maison de Ville!", "Date": "Mar 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR250075777", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Easy Choice in the Big Easy After spending much time reviewing hotels in the quarter, I chose the Maison de Ville as the place we would stay. The hotel was small and quaint, the service was extraordinary. Our room #7 was small, but from our balcony it opened up to a beautiful brick courtyard that also over looked another courtyard where you could hear live jazz music. The entire staff was very friendly and made sure that a person who stays at their hotel, leaves wanting to return. Rommel was especially helpful. Some of the bigger hotels may have more to offer as far as room size, pool and spa. But if you're looking for charm, look no further.

My Husband and I recently went to New Orleans for our Anniversary. We checked into a hotel that I had found online. It was awful (small, dirty, cold, and furnished with garbage) and we began to panic. We decided that we absolutely could not stay there, so we began to walk around the Quarter to see if we could find anything available. Luckily, the first place we found was Maison De Ville. My Husband told Brian a brief version of what had happened and everyone sprang into action. We were a bit distraught at the time and Brian and the staff treated us like we were family. Unfortunatley, we were committed to at least one night in the other hotel (named after a President), but Brian assured us that everything would be ready for us in the morning. We didn't even shower in our other room, we simply awakened and headed to Maison De Ville. We arrived earlier than regular check-in, but they said that everything was ready. Room #3...My Gosh, it is beautiful. There was even a beautiful, hand written card welcoming us. Throughout our entire stay, everything was PERFECT.

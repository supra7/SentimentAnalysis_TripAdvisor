But, I'm sorry, for me this was the WORST. Waking up coughing 5 times throughout what seemed like an endless night and waking up with beet-red eyes are not my idea of a good hotel stay. Aside from the smoke, I also found cigarette holes in the bedspread, rips in the sheet, they don't supply you with hangers, dishwashing liquid, or paper towels, eventhough this is meant to be somewhere you can call your home away from home and I don't want to even imagine what the brown gooey substance on the inside of the windows was!

We arrived late on Thursday, but the young lady in the office was very friendly, and took great care of the five of us that were checking in. We were missing a remote control for the TV an she got us one right away. I go to my room and my roommate goes to turn down the covers on his bed and finds hairs. So I check my bed...same thing...so that's a little disconcerting. We were tired and had to be at work the next day so we put the bed spreads back up and slept on top of that for the evening. So when we get back from work, I go to the office to get clean bed linens, and the young man in the office couldn't have apologized more. Other than that...the room was actually pretty nice. Bath tub needed to be reglazed, and there were some stains at the top of the tile in the tub area, but the room was clean, and once we got the clean sheets on the bed, they were comfortable enough...This particular ESH actually has a living room/kitchen combo, then the bedroom is actually another room... Four burner stove top, full size refrigerator/freezer, microwave. You could walk to Palms and Gold Coast...the Strip is right across the interstate...so plenty of entertainment in the area... Now the hair on the bed was bad, but there is also one member of the staff who really needs to go away...younger guy who looks like he might sleep in his uniform, but he is rude and pretty damn obnoxious....everyone else was plenty friendly, but it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for every one...

We booked late, a huge convention (120,000 folks) was going on at the LVCC, and the major hotels were either booked or very, very expensive. The Extended Stay America on South Valley View was a decent alternative for us. We paid about $ 639 for the week, with tax included. The suite (#1502) was on the back building, back side, facing the Cay Club/Interstate 15/strip. No view whatsoever from any room, so don't bother to ask. This was my 8th vacation of Las Vegas, and my first in anything but a regular hotel room. The suite was approximately 25 x 25, divided into two big rooms. The living room/dining room/kitchen was the first room. Sofa, TV, table with 2 chairs, coffee table, end table and 3-drawer chest. The kitchen has a stove top, microwave, sink, large refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster, and the bearest of kitchenware and utinsels. The bedroom/bath had two full beds, a nightstand, 6-drawer chest, TV, one sink, large closet, small tub and toilet area. The suite had one A/C unit in the front room, and a thru-the-wall fan to send air to the bedroom. The furnishings were nice and clean, but not luxurious. The TV's had poor cable connections and poor pictures. The check-in and check-out was super smooth, with friendly personnel. I asked for extra items (coffee, toilet paper, etc.) during the stay, and got all I needed. I even received mail promptly. The pool and hot tub was very small, but clean. The lounge chairs were unimaginably hard and uncomfortable. We sat by the pool only 2 hours, then left. We didn't use the exercise room or onsite laundry. The noise factor was very good. The place seemed deserted during the day. What neighbors? Nice and quiet. You could walk to the Rio, Gold Coast (both one block), or Palms (two blocks) during the day, but the neighborhood was a little scary at night. If you walk at night, don't do it alone. We had a car and drove everywhere. Flamingo Road, I-15, and the strip were very close. I would stay at this hotel again if I had to, but would rather stay at a nicer place. If you are crashing in Vegas for a few days and need a convenient and inexpensive place to lay your head, you need to consider this hotel. If you like and/or need to cook, this is a good choice too.

This Extended Stay on Valley View *is* right off the strip (the end w Rio and the Palms). However, once you turn down Valley View you are in a totally trashy neighborhood, and not well-lit at all. I did not feel safe in that area. In fact, the first night there, our car was broken into!! The front desk staff was polite enough, but very slow to check us in. We got to the room, and I was so grossed out. There were clumps of black hair all over the floor, and dirty fingerprints all over the walls. One of the cups in the kitchen cupboard was actually stuck in the cabinet. Ew! The bathroom was small and cramped, and when I went to take a shower the shower head actually FELL OFF. It was bizzarre. Furthermore, the beds were incredibly hard, and the sheets were scratchy. I paid $80 / night for this room, which is the same price I payed per night at the larger, newer, cleaner, safer, more comfortable Extended Stay on Flamingo.

However , I never met a worse staff as the Extended Stay in Las Vegas at this address. First of all the maid staff is lazy. I would go for laps in the day and they sit around smoking cigarettes outside the swimming pool gateway where us guests have to pass and enter. Second, there's two days out of the week that they clean and they don't even show up. Third, I tried to complain about the service on a day the maid was supposed to show up and the manager Carol Farmer excused the maid by saying, \" She showed up Sunday and serviced the room and she was not going to tell the maid to service my room that day\". I was outraged. I tried to explain the maid did not come on Sunday when she was supposed to and my carpet was filthy. She denied my request to have my carpet vacuumed and dismissed my request making me feel like I was lying. How awful I felt. I had a dirty carpet. Mice run around the property on the sidewalks near peoples doorways. I also observed Carol not being able to handle her lazy staff. I asked for clean towels and without even looking, a 19 year old girl at the front desk dismissed looking for clean towels and sheets by not even checking , and said, \" We ran out \". I found the staff extremely lazy. Carol has no control over her staff and she doesn't have the proper skills to run a hotel. She's too easy on her smoking cigarettes staff when I needed something as easy as a quick vacuum . It would of took a maid 5 minuets but no while I complained I looked out my window and the maids were busy smoking cigarettes by the motel pool gate instead of doing what they were supposed too like vacuum for 5 minuets. I found that ridiculous. I was on the phone with her, and I kid you not! 3 maids were smoking by those pool gates while she was denying me. I find her to be an awful manager. If carol farmer can't control her staff then can't a exec come in to investigate and see how lazy everyone is.

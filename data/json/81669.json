I have stayed at other Westins in the past and have always looked forward to their \"heavenly\" beds. This time the bed, which felt a tad smaller than a double, was far too small for two adults and my husband and I both woke up with knots in our backs.

We arrived during the football play-offs, timing our arrival to miss traffic but still catch the second half. When we arrived at 4:30, our room wasn't ready. They gave us a coupon for a free drink in the bar and said they would call our cell when the room was ready. There was no TV in the bar, so we followed the game on our iPad. After 45 minutes and no call, I went to check on the room and it was ready. Why didn't they let us know? When we got to the room, the TV wasn't working properly. We called the front desk and they did send an engineer up fairly quickly. He was able to fix he TV and we did get to see the last quarter. I agree with other reviewers about the noise of the bathroom door, particularly since my husband got up for business, while I slept in. Also, the bed was very uncomfortable, lumpy and soft, sort of futon-like. We had a corner room on the 28th floor, so it was very quiet with regards to street noise. We did get a ride in the courtesy car when we asked about a taxi, which was good since we had the wrong address and the driver was able to find where we needed to be. Thank you, driver!

The front desk staff were great and we hosted two large meetings hosting 100+ people. The catering was outstanding--both the food and the staff were just great. We received so much positive feedback from our clients. Then we ate here several times and again, the staff was great, the food just incredible. Then I went to get a facial at their Bliss Spa and once again I was absolutely delighted. The woman who did my facial was helpful and really knew her stuff. Now I wish I could stay another week. It is such a great hotel with comfortable rooms complete with bliss products in the bath, delicious food and an incredible staff.

The hotel has the usual W vibe, i.e. special music and lighting in the lobby, attention to details, very strong services team, etc. The rooms, unlike other W's I've visited in the past, are actually spacious and has great natural light (something most W's actually miss), so you can enjoy the 'Work Hard' part in the hotel room (if needed) before the 'Play Hard' part in the lobby/lounge. The bathroom is also quite big, only downside I could find was the low pressure in the shower, nothing too annoying. The heavenly bed (or whatever name they use here) was perfect, and the linens are just too soft. The staff has been extra attentive, always friendly and really sensitive to every small request / detail. During my rather long stay I contacted both Whenever/Whatever and the front desk numerous times and constantly got very helpful reply, real interest in helping me and very friendly stuff. One additional good example is the room service, that ALWAYS beat the time they mentioned over the phone (one time I got my in-room dinner in less than 10 minutes, amazing). The hotel also has an car shuttle service (free of charge, paid by a car company to promote a specific brand) which is useful for the quick rides in the city.

Unfortunately, given that I stayed for only a night - this review will be cursory at best. The overall standards were what I would expect from the W: clean, efficient but casual service, average quality amenities. The room was large and had truly wonderful views of the city (see the pictures). Also, the staff was generally helpful throughout our stay including the next morning when my girlfriend was suffering from an upset stomach. We partook of room service the next day for lunch and the quality was above average for American hotels but certainly not at the same level as the Mandarin in San Francisco or other \"5-star\" locations. The service staff was a bit intrusive, especially the cleaning lady who kept insisting on coming in despite the fact that we had arranged for a late checkout. The lobby/entrance of the W in San Francisco, like all W's, doubles as the main bar. It was a Thursday evening so the crowd was a bit older and not very heavy which was perfectly fine for 2 severely jet lagged guests. I would say that the San Francisco lobby is not quite as stylish or clubby as the W in Chicago by comparison. It was also overrun by a group of extremely drunk folks from Ireland who were friendly enough but seemed to have trouble avoiding other people. Location-wise the W hotel is ideally situated for people looking to shop (say at the Westfield Mall) in the Union Square area. Certainly, its closer than other hotels like the Mandarin and 4 Seasons which are located in the heart of the business district. As a result, the guests tend to be more along the tourist lines and the hotel clearly caters to them (with only perfunctory business services and amenities) - that may be something other people need to factor in. Overall, the W is clearly a step below the staple 5-star hotels like the Mandarin Oriental in terms of its service, fit and finish.

F&B Dir. went above and beyond and exhibited every concern and kindness. To say he represents each W attribute would be an understatement.

Instead of telling me where the drug store was, he asked what I needed. I showed him my list, he reviewed it, and said \"yes, I have this; yes, I can take care of this; and yes, I think I have this in my first aid kit.\" He inquired how my girlfriend (name redacted for review) was feeling, what he could to assist, and said, \"here at the W we take care of our guests. In which room are you staying? I'll have my staff deliver your request immediately, I'll alert them to be on the lookout for any additional needs you may have, and allow us to attend to the bill.\" Less than fifteen minutes later, F&B Dir. knocked, directed his colleague to place the beautifully arranged tray (cf. attached) on the table, and again asked after my girlfriend (name redacted). There are and were no words to express my appreciation. While there are many who talk about service, and even a few make a valiant effort, fewer still go beyond that extra step to not merely answer the question rather to understand the true need.

The W theme gets old fast, but that's a minor detail. Example - instead of garage they call it Wheels. The button on the phone reads Whatever, Whenever. You get the idea. I was put off when the check-in agent asked if I would like to forego maid service in exchange for having some nominal number of points deposited into my Starwood account. This is ostensibly an environmental initiative, but to me it smacked of cost-cutting at the staff level. Given that California has a 12% unemployment rate, I don't want to be responsible for a hotel maid losing her job, especially at the corporate rate of $319 a night for a regular room. Decor is West Elm meets Anthropologie. Cute little light-up Buddha in the bedroom, nice windowseat, well thought-out built-in desk with lots of compartments, funky headboard, decent bed. Bathroom has glass door, which is a trend I abhor, though I was traveling alone at least. The glass is frosted but still - not enough privacy when traveling with someone else, at least to me. Nice products, good blow dryer and fantastic towels in the bathroom. A/c is acceptable but not great if you like the bedroom really cold at night. Noise control is superb - I didn't hear anything in my room from the hall or other rooms. Room service was friendly but a little bit erratic. There I was in San Francisco and no strawberries were available for breakfast! The strawberries I buy in my ghetto supermarket in Washington D.C. come from California, for cryin' out loud - but the W won't stock them because they are not organic.

We found everyone, from the concierge to the room attendants to be uber friendly and helpful. The only awkward time came when a bottle of wine showed up in our room on the second day, with a tag on it. It looked like the typical buy this, and we will charge it to your room item. Later, when we checked our bill, we had a $48 charge on it for a bottle that was supposed to be in the room when we checked in. They handled it well, but it was uncomfortable to be in a situation where they obviously weren't sure what had happened to the bottle of wine that should have been there. I would ask that they rethink that policy of leaving something like that in the room, as that was the only real negative of this stay.

First the check in area is quite small and can get congested. I know the decor is supposed to be contemporary, but it's a bit too black and dark. Also at least on this trip, they pumped the dance music a bit too loud in the lobby/check-in area. I think it's primarily because of Oracle World this week... but still, the music volume is a bit much. Although others have mentioned security at the hotel entrance, the elevators do require a guest card to access it. The rooms decorated with modern furniture and do feel \"cool\", however they are a bit on the cramped side. The property is showing a little bit of age, but the room that I stayed in is clean (King bed). The rates were a bit expensive relative to what you get (I had to pay +$600 for corporate), however I think it's because of the Oracle World conference. The bed sheets could be a little more comfortable for what your paying, but they're acceptable. The +30\" LCD TV is acceptable for the room size and the entertainment selection is very good (on demand movies, all high def cable, etc). The work area in the room is great for business travelers. The desk has 6 power outlets within easy reach, a dedicated ethernet cable and of course wifi (if you pay for a day, you can connect up to 3 devices). I would say the direct ethernet connection is better vs. wifi...as I found the wifi performance a bit spotty. If you're a Starwood Gold member, you get a free Fiji bottled water with the room. Room service is good and the services is pretty fast. The breakfast I had was excellent. The location of the hotel isn't bad if you're spending time downtown or in SOMA.

From the airport, is a 30 minutes ride for $45 by taxi and $17 per passenger by a local van. My best recommendation is for the Tower Tour that takes you to major attractions with better prices.

The sliding bathroom door with no way to secure it made me very uncomfortable and lacked privacy. I was told that even though the computer center was on the 3rd floor if I went to the second floor with my own laptop I could browse for free as to avoid the cost to use my own laptop in my over priced room. Of course it did not work and the staff there was of no help so a nice man at the bar allowed me to use his wireless card in his cell phone to get on. I could go on and on but I think I might save the rest for the letter I plan on writing the company.

To start with the building works; the hotel really should have closed during the reconstruction as there is absolutely no lobby or bar space and it feels more like a low costs lodging room building - but at $300 a night rather that $30. Short-term just don't stay here, long-term this decision to stay open is going to hurt the W's reputation a lot. Even if the building was in perfect nick, the pretentiousness would still be truly gag-inducing. Ask for bell-boy to bring a coffee machine to your room (shouldn't they be there anywhere in a a 5*?) and reception will announce that they are sending up their \"room stylist\". There is a lot of \"sending up\" going on at this hotel but mainly of the guests. Reception desks are labelled \"Whenever\" and \"Whatever\" while the door guys wear T-shirts asking\"What Next?\". When Apple does this in its stores it is somehow ironic wit. When the W does it it comes across as a crass attempt at being cool that is actually just irritating. But nothing beyond the superficiality of slogans and a rather noisy air conditioning system supports the hotels supposed chilled status. The rooms are OK, but little more. The location is all right, but then so are the St. Regis, the Westin and the Four Seasons. My final gripe is the ease with which you can spot the reviews on tripadvisor that have clearly been written by the hotel's staff or its PR agency. Take a look, they are quite easy to spot (they start with something that established credentials - \"staying here on a business trip\" for example, then heap praise on location, facilities and comfort and end with a round of applause for the wonderful staff).

Upon arrival, I was a little thrown back by the fact that the bar was right near the entrance doors. They had a DJ playing the worst music ever (house music - gag) and it was REALLY loud.

She bumped us up to the 26th floor with an amazing view. She also gave us vouchers for 2 free drinks. The room was small but confortable and very clean. Bed was perfect, so much so, I was asleep by 10pm (hubby didn't like that!lol) One negative is there was no coffee maker in the room and I have to have coffee. Luckily all you have to do is call the front desk to request one. We went out to smoke and when we came back we had a coffee maker and a free anniversary dessert waiting for us. They really made us feel special. Parking is normal for the area (about $55 to park overnight). You definitely want to call them about 30mins before you're going down or you'll have to stand there and wait.

Really, who wants to get dressed and put on shoes to go fetch their own coffee in the bustling lobby? And I don't particularly like opening the door to room service in my PJS.** We paid a little over $250 a night for a double room with a high floor city view. We were traveling as a family with our 13 and 1 year old daughters for 2 nights. We are from the South Bay, wanting just a couple of nights in the city to celebrate our 13 year old's birthday. She chose the W based on the modern & whimsical decor. It was our first stay. W Wheels: We drove into the city in our car. The turn off for valet was a sharp turn down a narrow covered alley. We had to lap the block because we missed it the first time, no big deal. Valet were helpful and polite. Parking is expensive, I think I overheard $48/day with in-out privileges. This makes one cringe, but it is standard in an old/crowded city like SF and we knew it would be a hefty fee to park the car. The Lobby was under construction during our stay so it was very cramped, but again, we knew that in advanced from the hotel website. It wasn't an issue and although our stay was over the weekend, we never heard any disruption evident of ongoing construction. Staff at the front desk was efficient and courteous. We did not utilize the car service, bell service, concierge, fitness, spa, or room service during our stay. Oh wait, I *did* use the fitness room - I refilled my water bottle from the cooler there. Why? Because the FIJI in the room was $6 for a teeny bottle. Go to one of the many many many Walgreen's within walking distance and buy your own water bottle(s)! Previous reviewers noted that the key-card elevator was complicated, but we didn't find this to be a problem (at least worth mentioning). (Weird, but given the clubby feeling to the downstairs, I can see them wanting to deter too many non-guests from the upper floors.) However, they'll just clomp up and down the metal stairwell (see below). The room decor at the hotel is light and airy, the view was great. The condition was fairly clean, good condition, minor wear and tear. My husband who travels for business felt that the desk area had a bit too much clutter for his taste, I thought it was cute and it had a lot of plugs. I was more concerned about the idea of a community wooden foot massage under the desk...maybe ok for home, but at a hotel? No thanks! But moreso, it prevented the desk chair from being pushed in all the way and the room is a bit tight on space! Lots of good adjustable lighting in the room, very bright, or soft and dim. The lava lamp buddha was noted as \"cool\" by my 13 year old and husband. (Same husband who felt the little organized paperclip, notepaper and pencil holder on the desk was cluttered, actually LIKED the bright glowing Buddha that prevented the baby from going to sleep, lol!) Beds were comfortable with a feather top and nice sheets and pillows. I do my typical \"bedbug\" check whenever I get to a hotel and pull up everything. Let's just say that housekeeping doesn't check the mattresses very well - could've used a good vacuum. Lots of feathers from the feather bed, some random hairs (eek), a few crumbs, and on one bed, a yellowish stain - leaky diaper, I imagine (hope). The feather bed topper and the linens were all crisp and spotless. And I supposed the feather bed was a decent barrier from said stain... Behind the headboard, they could use more attention with the vacuum - lots of dust and feathers back there where the vacuum can't reach. Great choice of carpet color/texture - no visible stains. I know hotel rooms are dirty from use, but it makes me feel better if I can't SEE any actual stains, even if they're there. :) Small room, but I don't do jumping jacks in my hotel room, so it was ok. We even had an umbrella stroller sitting in the room by the window and it was fine. 4 people in the room had plenty of space. Average room size for SF. Bathroom decent size as well. The window seat was comfortable. The cushion had some signs of wear and tear, the walls had some nicks from people being careless with the shutters, but the view was great - what stains? What gouges in the drywall? View made up for it. Comfortable enough to fall asleep on! The closet was fine, kind of tight on space, but doable. I never use the hotel bathrobes, but there were two. Slippers would have been awesome...or even flip flops! How hip would that be, W? Purple flip flops? SUPER cheap way to impress guests. The bathroom - I really like the light blue walls and the glass surface. The toiletries were plentiful and I particularly appreciated the face wash. I often forget mine at home and hotels rarely offer this! The shower/tub combo had the curved curtain which seems to be the standard now. The toilet paper seemed to be awfully far from the toilet, but I'm short and I guess my arms are as well. The roll had the annoying metal flap on it, too. Toilet paper needs a mudguard like a 4x4? I didn't like it. For a double room, I could have used more towels initially (4 of each), however, housekeeping did a very good job. They came while we were out (not too early, not to late) and did a great job refreshing the room. Linens were changed, toiletries were restocked, towels were replaced and everything was dusted and vacuumed. It is always pleasant to come back from a long afternoon to a fresh room. Worth not getting the $5 credit. I also like that if connected rooms are requested, rather than a door in a wall, they have the outer door to connect the rooms. So if you book two rooms together for a family, you almost have a little (dark) foyer. The not-so-perfect: we were located near the stairwell and it got SUPER noisy very late at night. Stairs in a hotel are bad enough, but we're talking about the W and that means herds of girls wearing high heels clomping down metal stairs. As each herd trundled down, it sounded like steel drums...we were watching a movie with the volume pretty high and the noise in the stair well was so loud and startling, it took a moment to register the cause of the noise! The walls are also very thin so it is quite noisy. There were some hooting and hollering guests in the distance. It didn't last particularly long (maybe someone complained) but it was pretty loud and let's face it, it's a hip party hotel for special occasions - parties, etc. We knew this going in, so we were ok with it. However, if you like a nice sleep and are a weary business person or a couple looking for a romantic trip - this might not be the hotel for you. If you are a family and you and the kidlets can't stay up past 8pm, this might not be the hotel for you. Families and peace & quiet seekers, be forewarned. It's like: don't go to Disneyland if you don't like kids. Don't come to the W San Francisco if you're a curmudgeon. So yes, I'd probably stay here again if traveling with my family. Nothing really pulled me in enough to say, \"OMG I'll always stay here every time I come to SF,\" but if the rate is reasonable and it's the best option, I'd do it. There was nothing unpleasant about the stay, it just didn't WoW me. I'd say about average; not the best, not the worst. If I were to travel without kids, as a couple, I wouldn't stay here. I'd pay a bit extra and opt for the St. Regis (around the corner, also a Starwood property) or the Four Seasons to feel really relax and enjoy. And yes, my coffee maker came as requested and promptly.

Nowhere to put your stuff in the bathroom. Very squashed for two people. The restaurant was being refurbished during our stay so dinner was served in the lobby. Not ideal as the lobby turns in to a bit of a bar/disco in the evening. It is also very windy! You can use the pool/spa area for free. There were kids in there when we went which was not at all relaxing. Try to get a deal on Travelrepublic, Expedia or one of those sites. You get a much better rate. Also, just a note to those thinking of visiting San Francisco. The city seems to have a major problem with homelessness and drug addicts. Living in London this is something we are use to seeing but nowhere near the level that we saw in San Fran. The locals seem to ignore them which was just really sad.

A few niggles made us decide that we'll not pick \"W\" for an upcoming SPG stay. Firstly, the double/triple charges for internet is rediculous - at $40 for 3 nights \"per device\". W, you need to sort out your internet service delivery as your policy does NOT indicate that you will be charged on a per device basis. Guests anyway anticipate they will be charged on a per room basis as is customary at other (non Starwood) hotels so if you want to extract extra revenue from this service, warn guests at checkin. Secondly, there is no coffee maker in the room and you are invited to pick up free coffee at Whatever or order a coffee maker to be delivered to your room. A coffee maker in a room is standard in the US and, although you probably want guests to linger in the lobby and purchase expensive drinks there, its not cool to have to request to have one put in the room......and to wait for 6hrs to actually get it.....and to not have the coffee packs refilled the next day. Thirdly, the cleaning staff were forever opening and closing doors all day along our floor thus disrupting my sleep (I was not on SF time zone as would be most guests).

I LOVE this hotel. From the moment we enter the valet, we feel pampered. It seems that the W, a Starwood property, has thought of everything. Let me count the ways... The valet - though we often drive up in a gigantic Ford F550, dually, dump truck totally covered in mud, the valet is always accommodating -- more than accommodating, actually. Our truck in the W valet is a hilarious sight, and I love that they welcome us so heartily. The front desk - We've stayed at the W at least 10 times over the years. We have only had great experiences checking in and out. One morning we were leaving to catch a flight before anything (Starbucks, Pete's - anything) opened, and the woman that checked us out went out of her way to get my husband coffee and tea for me. What service! The room - We usually stay in a corner suite. I love these rooms. The bathrooms are very well lit -- perfect for putting on makeup (this is something that's often overlooked by other hotels). The products are wonderful, and include not just shampoo and soap, but also wonderful conditioner and the BEST lotion. The bathtub is deep -- perfect for a relaxing soak. I sleep astoundingly well in the W beds. I love that the duvets are crisp and white and the pillows are squishy and down. The W rooms feel clean, fresh and new. This is a small thing, but my husband and I don't have a TV at home, and both of us really enjoy watching HGTV and the Food Network when we go to a hotel. The last three, very wonderful hotels that we've stayed in have not had those channels. The W does. The restaurant - I've mostly eaten breakfast at the W. I've only had good meals there, and I believe everything they serve is organic, which I appreciate. The bar/scene - The W bar scene is hip and fun. If you're up for it, the bar is generally going off most nights. You can hang at the tables in the bar, upstairs or on the couches off to the side. On the weekends they have a DJ, and it gets pretty riotous. Fun! Pets - My husband and I had to pick up our new dog at the SF airport, and stayed at the W that night. A dog bed, organic dog treats and food bowls were waiting for us on our arrival. Finally, the W uses all eco-friendly cleaners and detergents. Another small, but significant detail.

Room service, in room movies and a lot of sleep. The W changed my entire impression of the city and Starwood Hotels. From the time of arrival and our short 3 nights in the hotel it was nothing short of a perfect stay. Everyone from the doorman, to the room service attendant was courteous, punctual, and went above and beyond the call of duty. The W's tag line, whatever, whenever truly holds true at this hotel. They continually did everything in their power to make me feel like royalty. Maybe they knew ahead of time that I was not a big fan? I don't know what it was but the managerial team should be commended on their leadership. I learned a long time ago that people and customer service are never perfect, but when things go wrong, how does the service provider recover from the mis-hap? That everyone, is a true sign of a good General Manager, Department Manager, and training. On one occasion, I specifically asked for Tabasco with our morning breakfast. The room service attendant came upstairs, politely set the table and as I was signing the check I asked him where the hot sauce was. He immediately apologized, and left to retrieve the sauce. That would have been enough, but upon his return he also brought us a very large bottle of Fiji water. What a great surprise. He must of seen the thirst in our eyes. This small gesture was only the first of many great experiences with the staff. Also take advantage of their free Acura MDX service. They will drive you around the city within, I believe, 10 miles to dinner, lunch or shopping.

We'd been travelling around California and this was the last hotel we stayed at before flying home. I paid nearly $400 a night for a 3 night stay in a 'Fabulous' corner room, and I felt a bit ripped off. The hotel markets itself as a boutique type hotel with a cool vibe, but to us it came across as snobby and unwelcoming.

Pros: 1. The porters were great and out of all the staff these guys were really helpful, and the only ones who seemed to care about the guest experience. 2. The location is great for SFMOMA and Market St/Union Sq restaurants, bars, sightseeing, and shopping. Cons: 1. The front desk staff were really snooty, uninterested and unhelpful. 2. The hotel charges premium prices for *everything* on top of the already fairly high room rates. 3. The 'fabulous' room is just OK. OK view, OK size, adequate sound proofing, decent bed. Hardly 'Fabulous' and personally i found the quirky room decor more than a little garish and tacky. 4. The area seems to be a homeless hot-spot, and there were usually several people begging right outside the hotel every time we went out or came back. It seems the numbers of homeless people increases every time we go back to San Francisco, especially in the Market St/Union Square area, and seeing people who are clearly mentally ill, disabled and/or old living on the streets and rifling through bins is something we can never get used to (Not the W's fault of course, but as it's rife in the area then it'd be remiss not to mention it). 5. The concierge was constantly busy, and when I did wait long enough to get to speak to her it felt like I was an irritating distraction for her.

These may be small items, but my expectations are high and these small items should not occur at a W property. 1. Check in. The person assigning me my room made it a point to let me know I she gave me an upgrade. I asked her what that was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6she said she put me on a higher floor. Well, for one, I am a Starwood member and am automatically placed on a higher floor and second my co worker who is not a member was put on this same floor just as a matter of assigning her room. Just put me in a room, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell me I am getting some kind of special upgrade when really, I am not. 2. Bath amenities. My co worker received makeup removal cloths each day, I never received any. If I have a sink and a bath, I appreciate 2 bars of soap so I am not moving them back and forth. To only get 1 bar, and then the next day not be given another for the tub is not appropriate. Additionally, on one of the days when my room was made up, they did not give me any washcloths! None. Now yes I can call housekeeping, but at 6 am I should not have to wait to get in the shower, potentially causing me to be late to my meeting, in order to wait for housekeeping to bring me washcloths and then provide a tip as well. 3. Desk outlets. The outlets on the right side of the desk were dead. When charging laptops, cell phones, etc. it was inconvenient to only have the 2 outlets on the left side of the desk working. 4. Bed, sitting on the edge of the bed the mattress coils stuck out, and the mattress was definitely compressed on the side nearest the window . I would say if the mattress is that old, it should be replaced. 5. Coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 boy. On the morning of the no washcloth situation (already in a bad mood) I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee.. .this is about 6:30 am. The coffee had been set in the lounge area the previous 2 days. I went there only to see no coffee, so I trek to the check in area, a gentleman there is draining the very last of the coffee there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.arrgh. I really need some coffee. Finally find someone only to learn that the coffee is now kept around the corner in the dining room, its only in the bar on busy mornings. I suspect if you are not going to offer in room coffee you can at least make it clear to guests where they can find some without searching for 10 minutes or changing the coffee location based on criteria that I am not privy to. 6. I am supposed to get the paper at my door each morning. Did not, so spoke to the front desk and that was rectified. But I was told on check in that I would be getting the paper, I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have had to ask a second time. I will say the Acura car is nice to have, and that worked out well for us. Like I said, these are pretty minor inconveniences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but when staying at a Westin or W property I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to have to deal with these issues.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhen trying to be cool is uncool\u201d", "Author": "tippd", "ReviewID": "UR84666657", "Content": "This W hotel is fairly average overall.

The doorman Dustin was really great - we had a problem with one of the tour operators that we booked through the hotel - he had the concierge follow-up and sent us a \"little something\" to the room with a very nice note. (He did this all of his own accord, and followed up with us the next time he saw us.) The hotel had little touches which meant a lot - like complementary coffee in the am, water or light lemonade in the afternoon/evenings, apples everywhere for you to munch on, and biscotti in the morning and cookies in the evening. Sometimes there was fresh fruit or nuts. The rooms were nice, small but expected for a city hotel. Loved the bathroom, lots of light, liked the cube seating and the amenities were really excellent. The room, as I said, was very small but the view made up for it - we were room 2307, had a great view of the Bay Bridge. If I had to pick one negative, it would be the lighting in the room - it was very poor. I am a reader, love to read at night for 20 minutes or so before I go to bed and with every light on in the room, it was pretty dim. But I guess those rooms are not made for the studious reader sort, given the chic reputation of the hotel. Used the gym, thought about using the pool but didn't (it was a very cold 5 days, highs were in the 50s so I didn't feel like swimming.) Gym was more than adequate for my needs, used it 3 times. Almost used the spa but they didn't have availability when I wanted it - and I asked at the last minute so that was my fault. However, it looked nice and smelled wonderful. Oh that is another thing, the smell in the hotel was great! They had fragrance sticks in the elevators but it wasn't overpowering, just added to the overall atmosphere. I know I've said a lot about the hotel but I wanted to give you the impression it made on me.

After a long trip from the east coast the scent was enough to make me feel at ease. However, as I put my bags down to wait for the rest of the girls to arrive I was dismayed by the worn furnishings in the lounge area. Some of the couches and ottomans need to be replaced and I was disappointed that they were there for guests to see. That being said the rest of the experience was steller. We requested connected rooms but did not recieve them although we had been told at the front desk that the rooms were connecting. The rooms were certainly next to each other but not connected as we had been told. The conceirge was outstanding and recommended Amber for a great Indian dinner. He booked a fantastic last minute reservation for us there and hands down it was the best Indian cuisine we had ever had before. The front desk staff was very polite and courteous. The restaurant on site was great for breakfast. The service was slow however but our waiter accomodated us when we asked for our food to be packed up as we were headed to Napa and were on a schedule. You have to allow more than an hour to eat in the restaurant. We returned the next day for breakfast when we had more time and enjoyed it very much. We found the prices reasonable and the portions plentiful. The rooms are okay. I think the W is still figuring out its clientele. We were a young group but are in our early 30s and late 20s so did not find the dorm room decorations appealing. We kept joking that it looked like a college dorm. The water pressure in the shower left much to be desired. We were staying in a room which can hold four people (there were only three of us in the room), yet there were not enough face cloths and wash cloths in the rooms. The maid service was good in that unlike other hotels they did not come around bothering us early in the morning. The on site gym was pretty decent and included free ear buds for the equipment televisions. Too bad we did not notice the ear buds until we were leaving the gym. There needs to be a better indication that they are there. There is a night life at the hotel but we never hung out there but there was always a crowd when we returned each evening. Overall the stay was good but I can not rave about the hotel the way I had hoped too and I certainly would not reccomend it to couples or groups.

Upon arriving late Friday night (around 10:30pm), we walked into the hotel to find a DJ spinning at a turntable in the lounge area, with young professionals having drinks and mingling. At the check-in desk, Abbey was a breathe of fresh air with her upbeat and pleasant attitude. She warmly welcomed us and let us know that our room had a King bed and that we would be staying on the 23rd floor with a city view! Woo hoo!

W also has a partnership with Acura, who offers a free drop-off (no pick-up) within x mile radius (I think it's 3) from the hotel for staying guests.

There is also a sheer curtain, so you could have the shutters open for light and still have some privacy. The desk was groovy and well appointed with Ethernet and six outlets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the most ergonomic workspace, so probably not the best choice for someone working in the room for long hours. The room was big enough for two, but would be cramped if you tried to fit a family of four into a double. Lighting was a bit skimpy. If I was in the room during the day, I opened the shutters for more light. Noise: Hallway noise was fairly typical for a hotel: you hear door slams and people in the hall. I heard almost no street noise\u00e2\u20ac\u201dquite impressive for a downtown hotel in a major city\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom my room facing towards the Bay Bridge. However, you should note that the south side of the hotel is next to a firehouse. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing rooms on that side will hear the sirens. I could hear toilet flushing/showers, and muffled TV from the room above, but did not notice any footfall or conversation noise. Bed: Quite comfortable. They provide a generous 4 pillows per double bed. Location: ideal for conventions at the Moscone Center. This was one of my primary considerations. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an easy walk to BART and the shopping district at Market St. Restaurants and a movie theater are also quite close. Sustainability: I took the no-maid-service option at checking. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need my sheets and towels changed every day and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d generate much trash either. I have found that at hotels that say they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change and wash your towels everyday upon request, they actually do. Security: elevators require a key card to ascend above the 5th floor. Food: Pricey, but in line with this class of downtown hotel. Breakfast was better than I expected. Dinner was just OK. Technology: In-room internet was $16/day. Not cheap. If you want internet access included with your room, go to a hotel that offers it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m certainly not going to complain about a charge that I knew to expect. Nice HDTV with actual HD content. The clock radio is a stylish Tivoli and had an ipod dock connected. It struck me as impractical to go with the high style radio then cobble on a dock that either has to sit on top of the radio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaker or take up more of the limited bedside space. Parking: I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t park at the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy walk from BART. Service: Employees were eager to help. Late on the second day, water started to gurgle up through the shower drain. I called it in and was told engineering would be up to fix it. However, they quickly called back and offered to move me to another room (on a higher floor) and comp me a breakfast. Unfortunately that floor had a group that was up all night moving from room to room. The next morning, I asked to be moved again and was given another room. It was inconvenient to have to move, but they were clearly concerned about my comfort and safety. Spa: I did indulge in a massage my last night there. Facilities were quite good, especially for a downtown hotel (as opposed to a rural, desert location). My therepist, Angeles, was great. One of the best massages I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had. Overall I was very pleased. I was worried based on some of the complaints I had read.

You could leave the air on to keep fresh air circulating and have it blow on your head all night or turn it off and be suffocating in a room with dead air. There was a very fine line between the AC being on or the heat. I was expecting that the beds would be of the same caliber as the Heavenly Beds at the Westin. Not! The beds had these awful feather bed pads that were crunchy. Not exactly what I want to lay on. Feathers are one thing, feathers with quills is another. It made the bed super hot when you had only a thick, hot duvet to use. This is San Francisco, not Siberia. It was a bit of an overkill. The second and third nights we got the pleasure of listening to a yappy dog all night long and if the dog wasn't barking it was because the owners were busy yelling at it. The walls were so thin and cheap that we could hear every single word of the conversation in the room next to us. When we called to complain about the dog, the lame stories of how the owners aren't supposed to leave the animal unattended come out and we get send bagels and coffee for breakfast as an apology. Thanks, but some sleep would have been preferable to the bland cream cheese you send with the bagels. We had to call 3 more times to complain about the dog barking. We were given the option to move, but why should I have to pack up my family and move because some idiot can't leave a dog at home. Dogs aren't babies, they can't be toted to restaurants and stores.

You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that at the Westin across the street. In San Francisco, the W will always be relevant because of its location. I stayed there because it was directly across from Moscone, and for a convention there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply no better place. The dichotomy between badge-wearing conventioneers and twentysomethings is a little awkward, but it makes for interesting social mixing. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going boutique, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d put the W SF several rungs below the Hudson in NY or Delano in Miami Beach or any of their brethren. It remains more homey, however, than the stark modernism of the new St. Regis next door or Intercontinental one block down. The room worked for me. Smallish (no surprise), it was more residential and quirky than I expected. I liked the playful accessories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the foot massager under the desk (every hotel should have one), the glowing Buddha, the kaleidoscope, the bench running the width of the room along the window with the block of wood as a step, the wealth of stationery and things with clever phrases on them. The bathroom was fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I like the Bliss products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tangy without being silly. The bed was heavenly as expected. On the other hand, the plantation shutters make absolutely no sense in a city hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck with them blocking your view in the middle of the window if you open them, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t black out the light, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a pain if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sitting on the bench presumably trying to look out the window at the fantastic skyline. The clock radio was too cool for its own good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I prefer digital clocks with the correct time that I can read in the dark instead of a 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style form-follows-form piece. The room was too dark and turning the lights on (and the Buddha off) required more reconnaissance than necessary. And finally, the $14.95 for internet access in Downtown San Francisco is frankly insulting to Steve Jobs and everyone else who made Silicon Valley what it is - even a B&B in Vermont gives it to you for free these days. Guys, charge another buck at the bar if you have to. Downstairs, the food was good in the restaurant and the prices reasonable, the fitness center serviceable, the pool a welcomed surprise and their kiosk to print out boarding passes very handy. The service was fine, nothing exceeded my expectations but no disappointments either. The free Acura shuttle was perhaps the most memorable part of my stay, they swept me away to an outstanding Greek restaurant for dinner - Kokkari Estiatorio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c splendid lamb chops. My one recommendation to W is to change up the music in the morning so that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like I have a hangover in Vegas when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m coming down in the elevator.

It was eventually taken off our bill, but like some folks have said on here, you shouldn't have to check your bill at these supposedly swank and well run hotel. So, look at your bill carefully! Also, a downer that they do not included high speed internet. Young and hip crowds should expect that they get their internet for free.

Oh and ditch your car- its $40 a day to park... you dont really need one in SF anyhow... trust me it will only lead you to frustration if you are not a native :). Only downside to the place is that its across the street from the convention centre- great if you at a convention... not so great if you are not.

My room was stylishly, yet comfortably decorated. It had a nice king size bed, large desk area, flat screen tv, closet, and window seat with bridge view. The room was a nice size, but not huge. They made the most of the room size by adding a built in desk with tv hanging over top. The room's window seat was a unique touch. The room, like the hotel overall, had funky and hip decor touches like a glowing color changing Buddha lamp, kaleidoscope, alarm clock radio with ipod dock. The bathroom was clean and a good size and had some trendy decor as well. However, the bathroom door was made of a frosted glass which was slightly see-through and didn't have a lock. This was fine for me since I was traveling alone, but may be inconvenient to people traveling with friends or kids . I liked this hotel much better than the Westin St. Francis (another Starwood property in San Francisco). The St. Francis caters to a much older crowd than the W.

The Nice. Good location just across the street from the convention center and directly next door to the SF Moma. Helpful staff especially the concierge counter when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there (see The Bad). We had a light filled room; some may say too light filled, on the corner of the 27th floor. Breakfast at the restaurant was well prepared and timely although the menu was limited with no kids menu. The Odd. The W tries to cultivate a young urban crowd and they, for the most part, succeed by setting an environment that attracts them. DJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and dance music in the lobby, every employee dressed in black, dim lighting and disco music piped in everywhere. The odd part is that they go a little overboard. The music playing at 7:00 am is the same as it was at 7:00 pm, not exactly breakfast tunes. The room had several odd features as well. There are shutters on the windows instead of drapes or shades which look nice however, if you want to sleep in, forget about it. Light seeps in from all the slats and unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wearing eye shades, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re woken up with the sun. Also the bathroom door doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close like a traditional door; it slides like a barn door so it never quite makes a seal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also frosted glass which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer much privacy. The room decore is funking and odd (in a good way) and was always cleaned properly. The Bad. Parking was not good. First you have to drive down a very narrow driveway which had cars parked on either side. If you have a large car or are unfamiliar with your rental car, you could easily create gridlock in this tunnel-like entryway. When we arrived there was a queue down the street because someone left their car in the middle of the tunnel and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find them to get the key. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waiting for your car after checking out, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s virtually no place to stand in the tunnel with your luggage. We had to wait inside the lobby then drag our belongings outside when the car was brought up. Another bad was the $45.00 nightly parking fee. More bad. On one occasion the concierge was MIA. There was a queue of four people ahead of me waiting. No signs of where she was or when she would return. (come on W, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153back in ten\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign would go a long way). I checked with the check in counter and got a shrug as to where she was. When she did return she offered no apology for her absence (over 10 minutes) just saying that she went to get her sweater. Another room issue for me was that the AC would turn off if you left the room for more then a few minutes. After returning it could take up to \u00c2\u00bd hour for the room to cool down. I know this is to save electricity however, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sit in a stale warm hotel room for 30 minutes every time I return.

We looked at quite a few hotels, as never had stayed in a hotel in SF since we live so close and decided to splurge on this one. The W chain is well known and caters to the younger affluent business/party goers, which is evident when you walk into any of their hotels. Rude and arrogant, but decorated in a funky way. We arrived 2 hours ahead of check in (3pm) and called to let them know that we were going to be there early. When we got there they told us our room was not cleaned and we would have to wait in the lobby. Where they had free internet which is nice (but they don't provide wireless in the rooms, interesting isn't it. It is like 15-20 to actually get internet in your room). They want you to hang out downstairs to give that trendy vibe so people come out and hang out in their bar. Anyway the front desk guy was rude. Took our cell phone number to let us know when it was ready. There were maybe 30 people waiting for their rooms, and at 3 pm magically they were all cleaned. Basically they didn't want anyone to check in ahead of time, even though everyone knew they were done being cleaned. We had a Fabulous room on the 24th floor, which had a king corner view. The view was AMAZING. But we were paying a lot for that view so it was expected. They had a cute sitting corner and it was nicely decorated. However all the decorations were covered in dust (the frames, fake tree branch, games, books). The TV was oddly small and in a weird position that hurt your neck when trying to watch. The bed was comfy, however the sheets (which are supposed to be one of their trademarks) were not Wonderful. They had obviously been bleached and it doesn't matter what your threadcount is if you bleach it ever wash, it is no longer soft and luxurious.

I wasn't even sure I was supposed to pull in there even though the sign indicated that it was the W Hotel Valet. 2. The front desk agent was fabulous when I arrived. She informed me of different aspects of the hotel like the spa and fitness facilities. She welcomed me to the hotel and offered me a room on a higher floor with a phenominal view since it was my first time staying at the W Hotel. The room was not ready but it had been vacant and all they needed to do was to get housekeeping in there to clean it. That was fine as I had some appointments that I needed to get to anyways, however, what I didn't know at that time was that my room would not be ready until almost 2:30 p.m. (5 1/2 hours later). 3.

When I finally got into my room at 2:30 p.m., I wanted to take a look at the items in the cabinet (i.e. the mini bar with snickers, mints, etc). I tried my best to open the cabinet but could not get it open. I called the \"whenever, whereever\" button to see if I could have someone assist me. It rang, and rang, and rang... with no one to pick up. So I hung up the phone and dialed again... no one picked up again... the third time finally someone answered the phone. I told them that I could not open the cabinet and she said that someone would be up to open it for me.. 5. My room smelled terribly of smoke... this is a non-smoking hotel so when I get into my room, I expect to have a non-smoking room that does not blow you away with smoke smell from the guest before. 6. My tv did not work properly. I would select a channel and then a few minutes later, I would get previews for movies that I did not wish to purchase. 7. They give you one bar of soap... so if you stay at this hotel, be prepared to bring your own soap. 8. One of my lights did not work at all.. too frustrated to call anyone to fix it. 9. I called room service around 8:15 p.m. for just a light dinner. I ordered my dinner and then the room service operator informed me it would be 45 minutes for my peanut butter and jelly sandwich and popcorn... 45 minutes to make that? 10. In the hotel's information directory, they state that guests should leave 30 minutes before departure in order for your car to be brought around to the front - FYI.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWanna go back\u201d", "Author": "linda.cloudnine", "ReviewID": "UR32497741", "Content": "We Loved the W Hotel.

It was not immediately apparent where the desk was, so dim were the lights. Only one employee was at the desk, involved in a lengthy interaction with a guy who we realized wasn't even a guest of the hotel, just a party attendee. Not once did she acknowledge us. It would have been easy enough for her to say, \"I'll be with you in a minute\" or \"I'll get someone else out here to assist you.\" We could tell that several other employees were milling about behind the curtain, and when one finally emerged but made no move to help us, we asked him what was going on and found out that just about everyone else but the one desk worker was on break. Finally someone did come out and help us, which was quick and painless once it started, but being ignored for a long time set the tone for the rest of the stay. I also think they are more interested in catering to the nightly party guests than to those who are actually sleeping at the hotel. Why else would internet be free in the lobby and $15 a day in rooms? Other problems: --The bed sheets were scratchy. Some of the worst sheets I've ever slept on, in a hotel or anywhere. --Water pressure was inconsistent, coming out in pulses during showers. --Our iron broke while we were preparing to meet friends for dinner on Saturday night. Twenty minutes after we were told that a new one would be brought right up to us, we called again, and it took another ten or so for the replacement to arrive.

We stayed four nights in a room on the 23rd floor. Elevators were readily available and fast. Room was small but hip and lovely -good bed, large flat screen TV, bed side radio/alarm; view of the Bay Bridge, Embarcadero and downtown was spectacular. Downsides - room was adequate but on the small side, and there were only three shallow drawers to stash clothes in. They were assigned to my wife, and I crammed whatever I had on the shelves in the bed side table. Likewise the bathroom had limited space to put things out of the way. Bliss products were good and replenished regularly. As others have noted - there was no coffee pot in the room - but when we asked, one was delivered to the room along with packets of good coffee. My wife enjoyed a decent - but not great - overpriced massage at the Bliss Spa. We also found the exercise area well equipped and useful for our work-outs. The hotel has an arrangement with an Acura dealership to provide taxi service by prearrangement in the evenings. We found this a most useful, convenient, way with congenial drivers to take us to our reserved dinners on successive nights - from Slanted Door in the Ferry Bldg complex one night to Gary Danko's down near Fisherman's Wharf area on another. High speed internet connection is available in the room for a daily fee - but free in the lobby areas. An unexpected surprise was a ringside view of the annual \"Bay to Beaches\" race and sort-of-parade that unfolded down Howard St the morning after we arrived. I managed to get a snapshot of my wife - arm in arm with one of the more colorful men parading with nothing on but his ten gallon hat and boots. As I said - great location.

We drove, so we had to pay for 2 nights of valet parking, which ended up being $50 / night. Check-In was uneventful and we were on our way to our 20th floor room.

The bar/lounge guests were in their mid 30's to early 40's, a bit older than what we were hoping for, nonetheless, the music was spot-on; the atmosphere was almost clublike. We did not end up drinking at either bar because we were looking for food. At 11PM, the XYZ restaurant was closing and our only option was the 24/7 room service. 2 orders of fries, a creme brulee and fried calamari were about $50, all inclusive. We must have also ate a few snacks from the in-room pantry, as 8 oreo cookies cost $9; $12 for 4 oz of cashews, etc. Not a big deal, but the pantry seemed more like a business opportunity for W than for our convenience.

I have seen a lot of hotels in my life but this stay was the most horrible one account for the amount I paid for the room.

In reality the bar is full of punks enjoying themselves listening to the ugliest and loudest music I have ever heard. You can be sure that you will have a chance to listen to those musical masterpices from your room. In the evening of the second day I encounterd a live cockroach in my room.

What an opportunity to have such a wonderful neighbour for only $250 a night! It took me five minutes to chase and execute my guest. Next morning I reported this incident to the front desk and it seemed to me that their receptionist was not surprised at all. I suspect that the whole building is infested because cockroaches usually do not come alone. The receptionist assured me that the hotel would perform disinfection of my room and issue an official apology. Certainly no special cleaning was done apart from regular room service and I am still waiting for that promised apology. After we had checked out one of my friends discovered a charge of $75 applied to his account for drinks in the lobby bar he has never visited. Since it happened last week he still keeps calling the W trying to get his $75 back. The other friend of mine who also prepaid his room discovered a charge equalt to 8 cents (EIGHT CENTS) on his account when checking out. According to the hotel they made a mistake when giving a quote for his stay so the actual rate was eight cents more than the one my firend has prepaid.

Needless to say, I decided to go elsewhere to pick up some food. Concierge was very helpful and recommended a good restaurant within walking distance. The location is decent. Very close to MOMA and an entertainment complex though there weren't too many restaurants close by. I got back a little late but the hotel was hopping!

My slingbox would not work and it took forever to download files. W Internet is a small step above using a phone modem. Apparently the W is on an insane drive to save electricity. The room lighting is terrible. I happened to have a light meter with me so I took some measurements. At the work desk the illumination was 22 lux. There is no lamp or light anyplace near the desk. 22 lux is considered to be a light level suitable for inactive areas of warehouses. Offices work spaces are supposed to have 500 lux. If you want to read in bed at the W the light level is about 90 lux, a low but not impossible level for reading. The window benches have their own light which is so dim as to provide only 15 lux. The only place in the room with decent illumination was near the bathroom mirror where it reached 400 lux.

It's been an extremely nice stay and I quite enjoyed the room. The W's location is great - very close to all the shopping, dining, etc on Market St. (if you're an SPG member and location is key to you, SPG has several properties all within a few blocks of one another around Market St. including Westin St. Francis, Westin Market St, St. Regis, W, and Palace Hotel and so you have a lot of really great options). I stayed in a high-floor Fabulous room which had ample space and a nice, large bathroom. As with some of the other Ws I've stayed it, some of the furniture was more stylish than functional/comfortable (such as the desk chair) but the bed and pillows were fantastic. Always tend to find great beds/pillows at Ws. Work space was very well done, with plenty of outlets and internet hookups conveniently located (I hate having to dig around a room looking for a place to plug your cell phone charger or laptop in to). The view from many of the higher floors is great, as well. I had a wonderful view of the surrounding city scape and bay. Depending on the time of night, things can get pretty crazy at the entrance to the hotel. Cars were backed up well down the street trying to pull in to the hotel's driveway as valet attendants scrambled around, but quite frankly as I walked around the neighborhood I saw the exact same thing happening at other hotels in and around 3rd St. and Market St. so I think that's just more of a San Francisco/Market St/Union Sq. issue than it is a W issue. Despite that, everytime I got my car out of valet it didn't take long at all (even if I didn't call down ahead of time). Room service was good. Didn't blow me away, but didn't disappoint, either. It was delivered in a timely fashion, though. I'd suggest requesting a table with your room service as most rooms don't have much of a seating area fit for dining. Lobby (\"Living Room\") scene wasn't as wild and crazy as some of the other Ws I've stayed at (at the W San Diego there was a line down the street of people waiting to get inside to hang out at the lobby bar!), where it's like going through a nightclub on your way between the street and elevators but it was lively and obviously a popular place to hangout in nonetheless All in all, a comfortable stay with helpful staff (all friendly and ready and able to give directions and advice on what to do and see whenever I asked for it).", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

Also the hotel was able to accomodate us w/ 2 rooms together as we were with my sister and nephew. The concierge was great, though overwhelmed at times obviously with so many people wanting restaurant reservations or other service. One little detail I should mention just in case u also are not told, when i called the front desk and asked about free internet use I was told there was none, but if we had a laptop we could pay with a credit card in our room.

When we knew we would arrive late we called the hotel in advance, even though the room was guaranteed with a credit card, to be sure they did not give away our room. Upon arrival we discovered they were booked for the night (this was midnight after a very long drive) and that they were going to put us up at a hotel within walking distance. Have you ever been completely exhausted and had to walk down the street with the bellman who had your luggage on a cart? On the upside we stayed at an excellent location, the St. Regis...which I would highly recommend. They comped our room and parking..so the W tried to make amends. Late checkout at St. Regis before hiking back down the block was necessary due to meeting obligations...and was graciously arranged at the St. Regis. Upon re-arrival our room was not yet ready...so we left our bags with the bellman who took them up for us. The room at the W paled in comparison to the St. Regis, although the comparison was the issue. It was actually fairly well appointed with modern furnishings, comfortable beds, and a nicely updated bath (glass countertop, stainless sink, etc.). Our view was rather exceptional. There was no phone book in the room, no map of the hotel, no emergency evacuation map in the room...and the phone seemed standard and had no buttons marked for dialing up different services. The typical hotel traveler will find these items oddly absent. The phone issue was especially frustrating as their \"W\" book took a while to flip through to figure out who to call for what...just dial '0' and forget it! The location was superb, and here is where the W stands out. We were across the street from the convention center and next door to the museum of modern art. Shopping and cable car lines were a short walk from the hotel. We easily got down to Fisherman's wharf and then back up from Ghiradelli Square late in the evening on these lines. This was not a family location however. I travelled with my teenage son for a business meeting and was more than uncomfortable with the lobby area which was basically a bar and lounge. We found it necessary to enter the door closest to checkin desk and valet entrance to avoid having to pass through this very singles oriented atmosphere. A room decoration fell off the headboard and fortunately hit the unoccupied pillow during dinner...a real topper to some annoyances. Room service was fair, the coffee was good but I found it overpriced for the quality of food. We were given a complimentary cracker, fruit, and cheese plate as a gesture our first night's stay and received a written and in-person apology and offer of assistance.

Interesting thing I noticed is that while the rooms were pretty similar the king bed room had great CD player and a cordless phone, the double bedded room had a traditional hotel phone and the only way to play cd's was through the dvd player and television. that inconsistency surprised me.

I suppose it is ideal for a business traveler, but if I were coming to San Francisco for leisure, I'd much prefer to stay in a different neighborhood with a little more life/culture.

The hotel was good, but has a few flaws - mostly service-related. I've stayed at many Starwood properties, but this was my first stay at a W. We used the BART system from SFO International to Powell Station. The ride cost $5.15, and it's about 4-5 city blocks from the station to the hotel. We checked in around 8pm, so it' wasn't busy. The process was reasonably fast, but not particularly friendly. They said all the right things, but I got the feeling I was talking to a robot, not a person. As a SPG gold member, I was upgraded to a 30th floor corner room. It was very nice, but a little on the small side. The bed was probably one of the best hotel beds I've ever stayed in. The down comforter was really nice too. The banquette in the corner was a nice place to sit while I reviewed paperwork; I would often look out the window to enjoy the view. There's a lot of nice little things like the W Music in the CD player, the Etch-a-Sketch, and current magazines (like Wired). One bad note about the room -- the noise. Eventhough we weren't adjacent to the elevators, we still heard them operating all throughout the night. It was difficult to sleep at first, but we got used to it eventually. Maybe the most obvious thing to point out is the glass window bathroom door. It's not completely transparent like a regular window, but it's not as translucent like frosted glass: it's something in between. Refer to the attached picture as a sample. All I can say is that I know some people will appreciate it, but some people will not. The bathroom itself is fine. Concierge service was disappointing. My wife asked about booking a tour to Alcatraz, and they simply provided her a website address to book. She assumed we had Internet access and didn't even offer to book for us. I thought that was odd. When I asked about breakfast recommendations, she gave two: the XYZ Cafe and Mel's (which is about 3 blocks away). They were both terrible. The XYZ is the hotel restaurant. Service was terrible; the server was grumpy, she was slow, and she didn't bother asking how our food was. The food was bad. I didn't bother going back for dinner. The W Cafe Lounge is okay. I got friendlier service there, and it becomes a hot spot at night. There are a lot of great places to eat in San Francisco, so I wouldn't waste your time at the XYZ. If you want a really nice dinner, I would suggest going to Ame, which is in the St. Regis, one block away. The hotel is conviently located across the street from the Moscone Center, and is right next door to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). The hotel is about 6 blocks away from Union Square, a 10-15 minute walk. Overall, I thought the hotel is good and would recommend this hotel to business travellers. The room was very nice, but a little noisy. The service was very disappointing at times, but if you don't normally rely on hotel services, then there should be no worries.

We've stayed at this W property around 5 times now. When greeted at the front desk upon arrival, the clerks are always pleasant, but this time there were probably 4 other groups of people checking in at the same time we were (around 4 p.m. on a Friday). The only problem is that everyone standing near the front desk heard every bit of everyone else's business, including room numbers and other stuff. It was kind of uncomfortable, and I'm used to a more professional check-in environment at the W. Upon getting to our room, we had an upper floor room designated for a bay view. Well, the bay view is disappearing fast with new big buildings being built in downtown San Francisco. One high-rise in particular has blocked a huge section of the view now so it's not the same as it used to be if you haven't been there for awhile. A couple of years ago, we had the \"city view,\" which is nice, especially during the holidays when the nearby park close to the Metreon is lit. The rooms are always nice and the W hotels always have a signature smell inside, which is wonderful. I have no idea what fragrance they use (and I was told by one of the clerks in the Bliss Spa on site that it is indeed a signature scent that is not sold anywhere on the property). This was the first time we ever noticed thin walls between rooms at the W. Either the rooms next to ours in the past were unoccupied or the people were extremely quiet. This time, we could hear actual conversations in the room next to ours and it was uncomfortable to say the least. One bad thing (or good, depending on how you look at it) is that the hotel is often a \"party\" type hotel, where you have a number of 20somethings who can be very noisy. Now that we're in our late 30s, it's beginning to get kind of annoying. :-) We heard a lot of door slamming and a lot of loud laughing in the halls at times like 3 a.m. and stuff like that. The Bliss Spa on site was very nice and the staff there was excellent... helpful and friendly and I'd give them an A plus. Some drawbacks are the ridiculous prices for the honor bar in the room. A $5 Reese's peanut butter cup? Are they kidding? And there are no soda machines anywhere on the property. We called their \"whatever whenever\" number at the hotel and were told that we could order room service if we wanted a pepsi or something similar. Ugh. We ordered breakfast from room service one morning and it was pretty standard fare... good but certainly not outstanding or unique in any way. Overall, it's a very nice hotel and you can't beat the location. The rooms could use some tweaking though. There wasn't even a sleep timer on the TV, and it wouldn't hurt the W to begin investing in plasma TVs. They want to be considered upscale yet they stick with older television sets, which is kind of strange. Their bathrooms are well-designed and very nice.

After going to the Bliss spa in the hotel, I saw the 6 pack of goodies we get in our rooms sells for $25! at Bliss. It was well worth the little extra I added to the tip each day. Everything in the hotel is very expensive...a Voss water bottle goes for $8. I recommend finding the closest Walgreens, which there are many around that area, and loading up on some munchies and water. There is also a liquor store nearby on 3rd and Mission (across the street) where you can stock up on spirits too. Hotel is located within a 5 minute walk to Market Street, the main street where you can get on virtually any bus. The area is quieter than Union Square but a 10 min walk gets you to Union Square for shopping. 2 blocks away is the Metreon movie theater. Overall, W location was great given our activities. OH..parking is $45. If you plan on renting a car and not touching it for a few days, move your car to the SOMA parking garage, 3 minutes away, for $20 a night parking. The valets from the W park you car here anyway. Only problem is the garage closes daily at 11pm. I highly recommend buying the PASSPORT for the Muni system. They are hard to find but you can get them at Union Sq. right where the Hyde-Powell cable car turns around. Also, buy the Muni map for $6 at Walgreens which gives you all the information you need to get around the Muni system. Overall, we enjoy modern decor but after 7 days we missed the more homey traditional style hotels like the Hyatt. The W hotels halls and elevator waiting areas are dark and their is lounge music playing 24/7. Even we had our limits. Hotel looked like it needed some updates. Location, window seat, and bath products compensated. May return or will try the Westin St Francis at Union Square.

From the time I arrived at this hotel until the time I left I was comfortable. And thats about it. Our taxi drew up and the first thing that strikes you as you walk in is the pleasant smell, and cool, dark atmosphere. Now when I say cool I don't mean it in the Fonz sense. The crowd was \"ageing businessman\". What I mean is the temperature was cool and refreshing. Check in highlighted the first major problem. Parlez anglais? My partner and I are British. We speak clearly, we have no funny accents or colloquialism's yet everytime we approached the front desk we found ourselves repeating everything we said. No where else did we encounter this problem except at this hotel. I can only think that they weren't listening the first time round....needless to say this was tedious and made the checking in process drawn out. Our room was on the seventh floor, just above the pool area. Not a bad location and the sound proofing was good. The room itself had two double beds, a large TV with CD player etc, coffee maker with selection of Tazo teas and W blend coffee, a large desk area and a comfy day bed. Here there were some nice touches; quality dressing gowns, Bliss spa products in the bathroom (and the Maids replenish generously!), a good selection of pillows on the beds and a day bed by the window to relax on. It is all very comfortable and I had no complaints. Ok, so the phone didn't work properly. After a protacted exchange with the front desk, where we had to repeat had to repeat had to repeat what we were asking for, it was fixed within a day. Now for the rest of the hotel... Both of us wanted to check out the gym and were pleasantly surprised. The emphasis here is on cardio. There are about 4 treadmills, all fitted with tv screens, a couple of bikes, crosstrainers and a selection of free weights, yoga mats and ab balls. Jet lag meant that we were down there at 5am. It seemed to get busy at 6am so time your visit carefully. Bliss is adjacent to the gym (both on the fourth floor). Now I am not a big Bliss fan but I did try and find out if they had any massage appointments available and they didn't. If you feel like spending $120 on a facial then make sure you book ahead. We didn't eat in the hotel for dinner but we did have breakfast in the XYZ (gettit?) restaurant one morning. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Ordered cappuccino which came in a cup that I can only describe as Dolly sized. The fruit salad was okay but anyone can chop up melon, drizze Vanilla yoplait over the top and charge $13+ can't they? Mentally decided never to bother with that again....as an aside they have a less format buffet just outside XYZ and this looked better. Muffins, cereals, bagels and a barista are on hand to deliver a quick breakfast. The hotel is located in a decent area. They are lots of casual dining options nearby, you can walk to Union Square in less than ten minutes and it feels safe round there. Plus art lovers will love the fact that Moma is next door. Now to the rating. The W is a good hotel - but its not great. It charges high prices and bills itself as a cool hotel. But the fact is, it just misses the mark.

It was not our first stay at the hotel, and we previously had a very favorable opinion of it. Not anymore. Let's begin with the shameless manner in which the W San Francisco charges for incidentals. There are all kinds of nasty hidden surprises. One example is a $10 to $30 and up \"package handing fee\" to bring boxes or packages from the hotel loading dock to the guest room. This includes FedEx packages. Then there's the $1 per page incoming fax fee. I can understand recouping a reasonable sum for ink and paper and even making a reasonable profit but at that rate I could have purchased my own fax machine over the duration of my stay. All seasoned travelers know that minibars are an unholy rip-off. But the W San Francisco gives new meaning to this term. The price list next to the snack goodies breaks out the costs, but you must look very closely at the fine print; there is a 20% \"restocking fee\" tacked on to the numbers listed. This is very easy to miss and a very immoral business practice. I awoke, very thirsty in the middle of our first night, so I grabbed the water the hotel had conveniently set next to my bed. Sure, they've got fancy artesian water in the room, and again, I would expect a reasonable premium for this. Well, the W San Francisco seems to have no problem charging guests $8 a bottle ... that's right folks, EIGHT bucks for a lousy 12-oz. Bottle of water. Then there was the night we wanted a stiff drink before bed. We sauntered over to the W bar for two long island iced teas. I was in total disbelief when I saw the bartender concoct a drink consisting of about 90% sour mix, 5% Coke, and maybe 5% alcohol for $10 each. I am not exaggerating one bit. It was totally undrinkable. Parking ... again, I understand their need to charge a lot. After all, the location is prime real estate and they've got a valet staff to pay. Most garages in the area charge around $250 a month for self-parking. The garage down the street charges $22 per night. So, hey, $30 or $35 wouldn't be so bad with all those full service valet guys. But no. The W San Francisco seems to think that $90 every two nights is perfectly okay to charge people for PARKING. Oh, and be careful if you decide to park off property and use the valet to run up to your room for five minutes because the hotel will tack on $14 plus tax to your room bill. Some readers may be thinking \"yeah yeah... this guy is just upset because he spent more money than he could afford at an expensive hotel.\" I only wish that were true, because I'd have far less of a problem. The truth is, we found many of the hotel's staff to be both rude and unresponsive. Now don't get me wrong here. There were many very helpful and friendly folks. But we found that a handful of people working the front desk were the reliably slow and unfriendly. We noticed this was a pattern more than just a few isolated incidents. Oh, and remember the package delivery fees, and the $1 fax pages? Let's talk about those for a moment. I sent a FedEx package for Saturday delivery at a huge expense to ensure its timely arrival. I arrived on Sunday night and asked for it upon check-in. Three different people insisted the package was not at the hotel after repeated requests to locate it. It was not until I could contact the shipping clerk at my company on Monday morning to prove that the package had in fact arrived on Saturday that I was able to retrieve it. The same goes for the faxes... I could only get them delivered by repeatedly badgering the front desk staff, and only then would they send them up. In one instance, a fax sat downstairs for nearly two hours before it was brought up to my room after repeated requests. Overpriced and spotty service. That's enough to keep me away for a good long time, but the discomfort of the guest room really put the whole experience over the top. The mattress was hard as a rock. After five days, my companion developed deep dark rings around his eyes from inability to sleep. I'm not sure if this was just isolated to my room but it was hugely disappointing. You'd think with all the money generated from the $8 water bottle sales and $45.60 parking fees and other annoying nickel and dime fees that they'd at least keep the beds in good shape. The pool area is in need of a facelift with dirty, worn pool cushions, and the treadmills are older base models. Bottom line, this hotel is a terrible value. There are so many great hotels in San Francisco.

The trip was amazing and the W was a big part of that. -Location: As they say location location location. For walkers like us, we found almost everything to be within walking distance. Walks down to the Ferry Building were pleasurable and provided for \"out of towner gawking\" at the buildings on or around Market St. Walking to SBC park to watch the Giants was also pleasurable... especially when they win both games against the Dodgers! When you aren't up for a walk, or want to go over to Fisherman's Wharf like we did, you are only a few blocks away from Muni (including the fun historic F-Line that we took) and BART. -Staff: We were a bit worried, having never stayed in a place like this and reading some of the reviews, that the staff would be snooty and would not smile. I don't know if it was the fact that we were wearing Giants jerseys or not, but the staff was warm, proficient and helpful. We got there way before check in and they said they had a room for us already. Turns out that it was on the 31st floor. We got up there and turns out it only had a double bed instead of the king that we had reserved. No problem, a call down to the front desk and everything was taken care of with a kind word and a smile. The service didn't stop there. When I got a blister from all the walking in bad shoes (yeah I know my fault), the front desk sent up band aids post haste. Amazing really when you are used to the Super 8 or something and aren't used to such service. EVERYONE on the staff was very nice. We are talking the cleaning crew even. The only people that weren't were our fellow guests....... -Hotel Style: The first thing we noticed was the amazing plants in the lobby and throughout the hotel. Not only are they real flowers, but they are big and healthy in really nice vases. That alone impressed us. As reviewers before have mentioned, there was techno music playing in the lobby which we felt added to the \"cool\" of the hotel. We also got a drink at the hotel bar and it seemed to be quite the place to go on a Saturday night. Plenty of people milling around for a good atmospher but not so many as to feel like it was a bar first and hotel second. Add to that the blue lighting and contemporary styling and art and you have yourself a nice place. -Rooms: The rooms are not overly big but you are not cramped in the slightest. The bed was amazing. The sheets were high thread count and the pillows comfortable. Add to that we had a view of the Bay Bridge from our window seat and it was wonderful. They also have a cd/dvd player and all the other amenities that you would expect at a place like this. The bathroom was nice, with a shower/tub combo and nice fixtures throughout. But the one thing that I noticed the most was how quiet it was on the 16th floor. We are talking total silence. You couldn't hear the traffic from down below. You couldn't hear the people above, below or on the side of you. It was such a new experience for that reason alone let alone everything else. All in all the W was a fantastic experience.

All the floors are lit very dimly with music playing. The hotel restaurant was delicious for lunch and service was excellent. The Bliss Spa on the 4th floor was recently added and is such a great addition. The pool and gym area are very clean nice as well.

Elisa checked us in and gave us a 12th floor \"Wonderful\" room with a Bay View. Lobby: The lobby was called the Living Room. The Living room was filled with cool and sophisticated furnishings and contemporary art. At night, the Living Room was filled with a mass of people at the bar and all over the Living Room. You felt special walking through the crowd to go to the elevators. Elevators and Hallyway: The elevator was dimly lit but in a cool, fun way. The elevators were very quick and very large. When you get off the elevators, the carpet reads Welcome!. The Hallway was lit by blue lights and spotlights on the art. The hallways smelled like new carpet. Room: We booked a 2 dbl. bed, non smoking, Wonderful room. When you first walk into the room, there is a little area with a bench and 3/4 full length mirror/ The bathroom was to the left. You continue walking in and there is the 2 dbl. beds crammed into the room. A built in Tv cabinet that felt like it would fall on you! A Desk with leather chair, a nightstand with some San Francisco Magazines and a W Hotels Book. The Desk featured Bliss, The Spa catalouges, the hotel directory, and some paper and pencils. At the end of the room by the windows was a large window seat with 4 brown square pillows and 2 neckrole pillows. There was a dark blue throw on the window seat. The coushin was stained with white and red staines. I suggest that be recovered. The Beds we're so comfortable, I slept like a rock. They had 4 down pillows, a down comforter with a brown duvet cover. The duvet covers we're both stained and were pretty gross. The headboards we're really cool: They were big slabs of wood that stoped just before the ceiling. For the long morning sleepers, there were wooden shades that kept about 3/4 of the sunlight out. 3 complaints: 1. The windows DID NOT OPEN. 2. The windows we're terribly dirty and hard to see out of 3. You needed to keep the shades on the windows, if you try to move the middle ones to the center of the seat, the window seat is unuseable. And if you want to move the outer wooden shades, there we're 2 wall sconces on each side so you could'nt put them on the wall. I agree with the previous reviewers that some of the furniture was a little shabby and scrathced and probably needed to be replaced in the near future. The Artwork was black and white pictures of San Francisco. There was a 27 inch tv, a dvd player, a CD player, the W CD, and the mini bar, which was terribly overpriced. The carpet was brown and was alittle worn. Bathroom: The bathroom was pretty awesome! The sink faucets came out of the wall and the sink was metal. The shower head was great! Is almost massaged you. The shower curtain was clean and had the W on it. 1 complaint: The door was a glass slider and it didnt work well. The glass was not opaqe but ribbed and you could see in easily. It also didn't slid very easily. The robes were great and were 100% cotton. Sweat/Wet: That is W's pool and fitness center. Sweat: The fitness center looked pretty well equiped with alot of machines and quality machines. Wet: The pool was dissapointing. It didn't have WET on the bottom which wasn't a big deal but it was tiny. There was a family with about 2 kids and it seemed they took up the whole pool! The tile around the pool was also outdated. Whatever/Whenever: That was their service to their guests which was pretty efficent. I called down and asked for extra towels b/c our got wet and they we're there in about only 5 minutes! Great! To rap it all up: We had a pretty good time in SF and at the W, but it was not perfect. The rooms need to be changed a little bit and the pool updated. Some people say the dark in the hallways hide the dirt and wear but i do noy feel that way. So a 3 star hotel experience.

A couple of notes: You can order from the cafe menu at the restaurant, so don't feel like you have to get a gourmet meal when you only want a burger. Also continental breakfast is a bit pricey for what you get...($2.50 for coffee, $2.50 for croissant, $2.50 for fruit) Better to get out into the city and find something quaint and fun.

However, please be aware of the incredibly steep parking charge --- $40 per car, per day. Also, the hotel borders neighborhoods that could use some renovations. You don't want to walk alone at night (as we were warned by locals.) The bar is really crowded on Friday nights --- very fun. All in all, I'd stay somewhere better next time, but this was okay.", "Date": "April 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cvery nice, typical W (not necessarily for the traditional set)\u201d", "Author": "TC1", "ReviewID": "UR3395900", "Content": "Stayed 1 nite here this week.

The hotel was very nice - neat rooms, very clean, comfy bed, bathrobes, coffeemaker, Bliss bath products (although housekeeping didn't leave soap for the bathroom sink), friendly staff, good bar, and good food at the XYZ restaurant. Hallways and elevators were a bit dark and it was a bit overwhelming w/the loud music in the reception area, but that's somewhat typical of Ws. Food and drinks were a bit pricey, but I guess that is what to be expected in the cities. Can get grab and go pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee at the bar in the a.m., although pricey ($10 for a granola and fruit mix!). Parking was very expensive - $45/night. Also, heads up if you stay near the fire house side (near the parking entrance) of the hotel - you might get woken up in the middle of the night for a fire call. Also, heads up on the opaque glass doors on the bathrooms - if you're travelling w/friends, this might be a bit much. (You can't really see much, but it might be uncomfortable for some.) One other thing - the gym/fitness center is currently undergoing renovations, so they have an arrangement with a hotel down the road for W guests. Otherwise, very nice place.

The hotel room was really small - even though it was termed \"spectacular.\" There were two double beds that were squished in there, and a entertainment bureau that felt like it might fall right on top of you...It felt really small which was more than just an aesthetic problem since there were two of us bumping into each other all the time. For $239 the only thing \"special\" about the room was some complimentary Bliss products. Everything else was for sale with a high price tag -the $6 water, the $14.95 a day internet rental, the use of the business office and so one and so forth. The room service was also over-priced and the restaurant (which I had heard good things about) was really terrible. I had soup which I sent back and a $10 dollar salad. Again not happy. I must also say that I am not one to post my grienvances but I would really steer people away from staying at this over-priced, underwhelming hotel - basically it is just too much for too little.

You can barely hear it in the hallway next to the elevator. I stayed in a corner king room on an upper floor with a great view of the bay bridge and surrounding bay to the south. It's the most peaceful urban hotel room that I've ever stayed in. The really fun part of the hotel is that when you're ready to leave the calmness of your room, it's a short elevator ride down to the 2nd floor bar or the 1st floor cafe/bar, both of which get a large crowd of urban young professionals seven nights/week. The bar staff were not pretentious at all; they were very friendly and approachable. The drinks are expensive, but the atmosphere is great, so long as you're into the hip/trendy setting. The room is set up really nicely, and the bed, as at all W hotels, is probably the most comfortable hotel bed that I've slept in. The sitting area beside each of the windows was also great. It was large enough to curl up on and read a book. The bathroom is large and the shower is pretty decent (nothing like the shower at the carneros inn, but the water pressure is strong and adjustable...it's also not cramped). I understand some of the reviewer complaints about the bathroom door. You can't see through it exactly, but it's not opaque. In a King room it makes sense. In a double room, I'm not sure why they wouldn't switch to an opaque door (if you're not sharing a bed with your fellow traveller, I really doubt you want to see a sillouette of him/her on the can) but then again, it let a lot of natural light into the bathroom. Some reviewer mentioned that the wooden shades didn't block the light. I guess their shades must have been broken, because I found that they worked great, and I like my hotel rooms very dark. I also ordered room service one morning and it was brought up in about 10-15 minutes and was very good. Yeah, it's expensive...it's hotel room service, so what. The pool and workout area are also very nicely done. I wish that the outside patio that extends from the pool were on a higher floor rather than just the 3rd, but then again it was raining most of the time, so it wouldn't have mattered for my stay anyway. The only piece of advice I have is this. If you're getting to the hotel by cab instead of your own vehicle, don't drag all your luggage in through the main enterance at the corner of 3rd and Howard. Instead, go down Howard about 100 feet to where it says \"Wheels\" and go in that way. If you go in the main enterance and it's after 5pm, you will feel like an idiot b/c you'll be dragging your luggage through a mob of people and probably try to check in at the bar. The hotel is a great retreat and you'll have fun as long as you like the hip/trendy type of hotel. Check out their website and know what you're getting into...if you're older and don't want to be around a bunch of young professionals, probably better off at a Union Square hotel, which is really only a few blocks away.", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLong-term stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3072077", "Content": "I lived for 7 weeks at the W while on business in CA.

Service was high quality throughout the hotel, though the meal service in the hotel's restaurant can be very slow depending upon the server.

The bathroom was smaller than my 19th floor room but the room had the same wonderful features: a wooden headboard that stopped just short of the ceiling, 20 inch TV, minibar, great views of the surrounding area, and the same peaceful vibe and d??cor. We used the hotel laundry service--clothes were returned the same day when we submitted them in the morning. After I left for home, my wife had many small service issues with housekeeping (on separate days they did not provide her soap, then toilet paper, then took her towels and bath mat and did not replace them). The hotel is dark in the corridors and other guests would loom up out the semi-darkness and surprise me. The techno music in the lobby and elevator areas was a bit much at 5 AM when I went to work but this is the price for staying in a \"hip\" hotel!

Let's just say that the lighting in the elevators and hallways is just super if you're looking for a high-tech opium den. The bar and restaurant were nice but somewhat sterile--cosy is not the vernacular here. I will give them props for nice, comfy lobby chairs and sofas arranged for chatting with your friends. The concierge was very nice and friendly and funny and, of course, helpful. The Desk staff was professional if somewhat distant. Valet parking was efficient and expensive. As for the room, it was smallish, as was the bathroom, but quite comfortable and well-appointed. It also had a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge. There were two outstanding things about the room, though: 1. The most comfortable bed in the known universe (which, incidentally, you can buy from their website). I travel a lot and have been tortured by mattresses and pillows across the country, but this is simply superb sleeping. 2. It had a window seat. This may be just my own personal preference, but there is just somethig so appealing about sitting in a window seat on a cold, misty night, propped on nice soft pillows, looking out at the Bay Bridge, listening to good music and reading a good book. (One doesn't have to club it every night....) Also, the room was nice and quiet, but none of the windows opened. I gave the W only 4 stars because I prefer cosy and old-fashioned elegance to the very steel-glass-and-leather style here, and I feel that overall it is too expensive (room service, phone, etc. prices were hilarious).

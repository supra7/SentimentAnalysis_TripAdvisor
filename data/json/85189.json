I came from Tokyo, Japan and I had a strong jetlag over my shoulders, the less thing that I needed was complications by the time I checked in in my hotel, there were 4 people (for me the fantastic four) that made my stay at RH the warmest and finest stay of all, they are Jorge Oliva, Roberto Reyes, Susej and Jose Miguel (MGR), all these people really worried about me and took care of me, giving to me options and the best assistance on every requirement that I had to make more pleasant my stay at Miami. This is a short note to thank you all and to recommend all this site the wonderful hotel that RH has become.

The hotel also has a complimentary shuttle to the Port which is FANTASTIC. However, for a hotel that prides itself on being a common place for cruisers to go before embarking on a cruise, one can NOT print out online checkin materials, such as boarding passes, etc. for the cruise. They have a nice business center, but the computers do NOT have a PDF reader on them so one cannot view, hence print, these imperative materials. BE SURE TO HAVE EVERYTHING BEFORE ARRIVING TO THE HOTEL. The staff is NOT friendly at all. NOT HELPFUL. Pretty rude. Tried asking for assistance with the printing, I was advised, \"oh well\". Also, all of the vending machines were broke (yes, all 5 throughout the hotel) so I was not able to get a water after traveling 5 hours. Once again, I approached the \"concierge\" (notice the quotes), and his suggestion was to walk out and find a store. Mind you, I have never been to Miami before, it was after 11 p.m., and the hotel is NOT in what appears to be a safe area. When I went to check-out, the staff was again very short and rude...abrupt. Didn't seem to care about my conerns or give me the time of day. Again, decent hotel but will probably not stay here again based solely on the service of the staff. Too bad...there is A LOT of potential for this establishment.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel Nice people\u201d", "Author": "none n", "ReviewID": "UR118251580", "Content": "My stay at the regency hotel miami was really great!!! they cancelled my flight and i was not giving a voucher, but when i got to the hotel this young lady name Rose welcomed me with such warmth it was nice ,and when i got to the room i was really happy the people was very nice and i really enjoy each and everyone that helped during my stay if im ever back in miami i will definitely stay there agin great place shuttle great thank you hope to see you guys in the future", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel..\u201d", "Author": "Carlos S", "ReviewID": "UR116545939", "Content": "The hotel is good, nice bed for a good night sleep..

Very friendly and amicable the young man. The next morning i enjoyed a variety of breakfast items, all fresh and tasty.

The staff is unattentive at best. The driver to the shuttle rude and arguing with guests. I saw other hotels pass me three times before I ever saw this guy. When I got to the front desk Mickey looked like he had been partying all night and then put his uniform on. I thought he had been over worked for hours and asked how much longer he had to work he said about 6 more hours. I was given a voucher for food and was starving. I got mashed potatoes ouf of a box. I ordered salad and got two hamburger toppings lettuce, tomato, and onion put on a plate. I got to my room and the sound outside my window sounded like an airplane taking off. I asked if they had another room and they said no but offered me earplugs. I came down to get the ear plugs and they were offering a new guest new rooms. The earplugs did not cover the noise. I woke up on and off all through the night. I was in deep sleep at 8:00AM and someone knocked on the door and was opening it at the same time. Did not even give me a chance to respond. The maids have been so loud ever sense I have not slept. The alarm clock in the room has read 10:43 since I got here and the remote does not work, I have two more food vouchers for this \"hotel\" but will not use them as I will not put any more money in their pockets.

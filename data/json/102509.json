Parking is safe, and the Towers provide passes so that you can go in and out of the parking garage without paying EXTRA cash.You cant ask for a better place to stay while you are remaining close to your loved one. The staff at the Towers were very helpful. We had pre-arranged to have a desent ref-freezer in the room, a microwave and coffee maker. If you stay anywhere else, you have to fight traffic and the like. The hallways are clean as noted above, and the room and bathroom were more than acceptable. This is not a five star hotel, HOWEVER it is not as bad as the other reviews state. I'm in Law Enforcement, and if I thought this hotel was the least a dump, I would not have let my mother(80 yrs old) stay here. The rugs have been replaced by the way, and the beds and the like are great and changed daily by the Towers maid staffing. This is a no brainer when you need to be close to your loved one. While at the Towers, I interacted with doctor's that spent the night on the same floor as I was on, and they had no problem with the accomadations... Your not taking a chance if you stay here.

To watch our favorite show we sat about two feet away from the set. An arm was about to fall off one of the chairs which could be dangerous for an elderly person (and who else stays there?) There was a holder for the hair dryer but no dryer. There are extra charges for refrigerator, microwave, even calling an 800 number! The room was fairly clean and the bed was comfortable but otherwise our stay was terrible. For this we paid the \"patient rate\" of $145 plus tax plus $10 parking. Maintenance said the hospital owns the building and the two hotel floors will be taken over for offices soon. That's good because we'd hate to see anyone else waste their money on this place.", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cBackground on Penn Tower Hotel\u201d", "Author": "vmsPhiladelphia", "ReviewID": "UR7194735", "Content": "As an FYI to travelers, Penn Tower Hotel really is not functioning as a hotel. There are about 1.5 floors out of 21 that are still hotel rooms. The rest of the hotel is a medical center. The hotel does not have room service, has a small coffee bar that is only open until 2:30 in the afternoon and a gift shop that is pretty much like most medical center gift shops. The elevators are crowded and slow, housekeeping is minimal for hotel rooms and the building overall is VERY loud. PennStar medi-lift chopper hovers on the side of the building quite a few times every day, major construction is going on so there is a lot of noise and traffic, there is very little parking and if you can get it, be prepared to pay steep prices and there is at least one fire drill a week. This is the perfect location if you don't care about being pampered since it is close to CHOP and HUP.

It seemed to be so helpful to have a room directly across the street so after talking with a manager I decided to keep the reservation and take my chances. I am so thankful I did. The hotel is old and many things are in need of renovation. It is no longer a full service hotel but the staff is very courteous and helpful. The beds were comfortable and linens were changed every day. The bathroom did need repairs (cracked sink, very slow running water in the shower were the biggest problems) but the tile floor was very clean. The view of the UPENN campus as well as center city skyline was wonderful. The archeology museum right next door would be great for spending many hours if one had the time. Dial up internet is available. The TV is not premium but local stations provide news and weather, etc. They have a hair dryer, iron and board, coffee pot and coffee. There is a coffee shop in the lobby open from 6:30 until 2 PM. The vending machine as well as ice was working and filled every time I checked. Nice gift shop is open until 7 with flowers, snacks, etc. There are plenty of options for food during the day including vendor carts right outside the hotel. Dinner is not so easy but cabs are available to take you to a restaurant if your schedule permits. Otherwise the hospital cafeterias are open for dinner until 7:30. McDonalds is right in the CHOP lobby. Parking is at such a premium that having a parking place was very helpful. There are other hotels on the UPenn campus, but this one is much more convenient to the hospitals. The cost including tax and phone charges and parking was $645 for 4 nights-hospital rate-not cheap but being 5 minutes away from my daughter and grandson was so helpful. I could take her clothes each morning so she didn't have to keep everything in the small hospital room. I could take new things each day for him to play with. She could have taken a nap had she chosen to do so. I certainly will stay there again if we have to be at the hospital overnight.", "Date": "May 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cLike staying in a dorm room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3451769", "Content": "We have stayed at this hotel twice when my child needed medical care at CHOP. We are going to Philadelphia for pleasure on an upcoming weekend and will certainly be staying elsewhere. I didn't find the rooms to be in as poor condition as others who have reviewed it. The convenience to the hospital couldn't be beat and another bonus was that parking was free. I believe we had to pay for parking at the Sheraton. That said the accomodations at the Penn Tower can be likened to a dorm room. It was a place to sleep with few or no amentities, no restaurants/food, no premium TV, none of the little niceties that we often like when staying in hotels. You are on your own here. Bottom line is this hotel is fine if you need to be within very close proximity to the hospital, will spend little time in your room and don't care about having any of the extras. If you are going to Philadelphia for pleasure or will have some extra time on your hands, choose a different hotel.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, KY", "Title": "\u201cDirty run down dump\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1628444", "Content": "In November of 2003 My Father and I stayed at Penn Tower due to it attachment to the Medical Center.

But it absolutely was.The room was in terribly shabby condition. The bed was disgusting in that the cheap yellow \"blanket\" made out of the velour packaging material was filled with holes and was \"crunchy\" over large places as if sticky liquids had been poured on and dried over several years.The celings and walls had terrible dark water-damage stains and discolorations.The television, in an attempt to save money, has its feed piped in directly from the hospital. So, while you get a few basic cable channels, you are mainly watching Penn Hospital channels, with content created for its patients. One of the few channels was (I kid you not!) the blue display screen from somoeone's computer that read an error message \"Read error on Drive D:\" 24 hours a day. You can forget about premium channels or in-room movies.The bathroom is indeed extremely run-down with cracks in the sink, and cracks and discolorations in the tub.Another annoyance is that there are no rooms with queen beds. All have two double beds.In terms of services, there are none. There are only 87 rooms, and they don't offer any room service or have any food available within the hotel building. The drink vending machines on my floor was completely sold out, and when I went all the way down the lobby to use the main vending machine, it was completely sold out too.Overall, the experience at the Penn Tower Hotel is the same as what you'd get at an extremely budget motel that disappointed you. But, the Penn Tower does not charge budget prices, and is usually in at least the $150 range, which is about 5 times more than this hotel is worth. If you would like to be near HUP, the Inn at Penn (a 3 block walk) or the Sheraton University City (about a 6-7 block walk) are much much better bets. I booked through a pre-paid site and paid $453 for my 3 nights there, so I was unable to back out once I saw the condition of the room, but please save yourself the generally grimy experience of staying here.", "Date": "March 28, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Penn Tower Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d102509-Reviews-Penn_Tower_Hotel-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html", "Price": "$104 - $169*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Civic Center Boulevard at 34th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Philadelphia</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">PA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">19104-4385</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "102509", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1a/75/1a75e0af6f1432f4cdf39e1789630f3b1large.jpg"}}

My daughter and i has a 2 room suite, king bed with sofa bed. The king is very comfortable, sofa bed good enough for one adult or 2 kids. The suite has a seating area perfect for 6 adults and 2 babies visiting all day. Restaurant is decent but a bit limited. We requested --and got--a microwave. Coffeemaker in the room is like the Hamilton Beach personal pod brewer, i brought Senseo pods from home and they worked fine. Rooms have a balcony with interesting views of the mountains and freeways, doors are sealed for safety and noise reduction. Nice pool/spa area with fire pit and tables. On Ventura Blvd,.lots of stores and restaurants within walking distance, also a bus route. Parking is $15 day for guests, reasonable for this area.

The full-service restaurant was very good; the menu had the standard hotel fare but included some original dishes that were very tasty.

However, if one looks at a map, one will find that there are almost no hotels in this price range that are not located where they are subject to traffic noise. I stayed in the Hampton Inn on Sepulveda in Sherman Oaks in August and thought that noise was coming from Sepulveda. No! It's the 405. And on the other side of town, it could be any one of a number of different freeways. There is simply no escaping it. We were on the south side of the building 9 stories up and the noise, though constant, would peak in the early morning hours between 5:30 am and 7:30 am. The big trucks on the highway there make a ton of noise. But, since every other hotel in this price range has the same problem, it kind of cancels it out for me. The room did not smell bad. Housecleaning was thorough. Anything we needed, like toilet paper or shampoo was provided almost instantaneously. The lobby is large and nicely decorated. There is a bar area that was very convenient too. The staff at the front desk was always very helpful. When we checked in, there was a slight problem with the room. It was corrected and we were in a different room in less than two minutes. The elevators are FAST. This is especially helpful in getting in and out. We parked and while parking is expensive, again, its expensive everywhere. The parking garage was very convenient. I used the pool and spa and enjoyed it quite a bit. While the noise is always there and you can see the freeway, you can also see some mountains. The pool is heated just enough to make swimming possible in winter. (We were here in January.) The spa was clean and had strong jets. The beds were very comfortable and we had ample pillows. The TV was nice too. We stayed for 5 nights and will stay there again when we go to visit. While the location next to the freeway is not ideal because of the noise, it does make it very convenient to get wherever you want to go--as long as you don't want to go there during rush hour! I would also encourage the hotel to do something about the thermostat. It was frustrating that the unit could not simply be turned off.

The front desk lady, Gema, was very professional & check-in was very easy. The hotel had also noted my request for a quieter room and also accommodated my request for a late check-out.

I always do reviews before I stay or eat anywhere but this is the first time I actually took the time to write a review. PROS: When I checked in staff at desk were very courteous and room key was ready --took less than 5 Min.Although I requested high floor I was given mid range. I was worried because I know in LA rooms are given away without a second thought even when you have reservations this was not the case at this hotel Loved that they had free ue of computer and printer. This was very important to me as I dont' like to tavel with my computer with all the new regulations in terms of flying and paying for luggage. I had to go to front desk twice for just general things --every time I was greeted and helped immediately. Security at parking garage always greeted me with smile, very helpful and seemed genuine. Convenient to CSUN, airport and anywhere I needed to go in the LA area as I am relocating so I was all over the place searching for apt. Housekeeping was very good, when we arrived room was clean and everyday she/he did a good job. I asked for more towels and was promptly brought to my room. I always check every inch of roon when /i check in--bedroom, sheets, bathroom etc all was in good order. Parking is cheap (15 day) and you can come and go as you like with no worries as there is a security guard always on duty and you need a card to access guest floors (felt very safe) Doors locked after hours, need card for entry --again felt very safe Free coffee and fresh cookies both very good and to my surprise the coffee was always hot! Walked to Sherman Oaks Galleria to movies and dinner --very convenient CONS: Two things that are most important cleanliness and condition of the bed and the shower/tub. Bathroom tub needs updating. Paint was chipping, some rust visible and there is no fan in bathroom, In terms of fan it was better than looking up and seeing a dirty vent that is never clean--on the other hand got a lot of steam after shower.

We had asked for a high room and quiet. We were given the top floor (called penthouse) and noticed at once that it faced the freeway but had assumed (erroneously) that the windows were double glazed and would block the sound. We left the room almost immediately upon check in and didn't return until nearly midnight. The sound coming from the freeway traffic was so loud we could hear the trucks shift gears and both my husband and I spent a horrible sleepless night. In the morning I asked to be given a room on the other side of the hotel. The only available one was on the fifth floor and was darker due to a smaller window but that night was totally quiet and provided a good sleep. To the hotel's credit we were credited the parking fees for both nights as we had used Marriott points to pay for the room. The deskclerk was extremely apologetic but I am sure they are aware of the noise problem and we should not have been given a room on that side of the hotel. This hotel has been remodeled nicely since it has become a Courtyard, (was several other hotels prior to being a Courtyard) but is an old hotel with old plumbing and in the first room the bathtub didn't drain. We loved the location and the free Seattle's Best Coffee in the lobby in the morning and the room refrigerators. The other problem is the noisy heating/ airconditioning unit. Fortunately we were able to shut it off entirely during the night. Too bad the plumbing and heating units can't be updated along with the rooms and public spaces. A nice and convenient place to stay IF you are on the side away from the freeway.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earlysville, VA", "Title": "\u201cGood, but some issues\u201d", "Author": "EarlysvilleTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR21491495", "Content": "The staff is friendly and eager to be helpful, without the greasy obsequiousness that so many hotels require of their staff.

Some very fancy hotels will tell you that one will be sent up to your room, and there's no way that you can just *have* one, and that you'll have to wait half an hour. This hotel has corkscrews in a drawer at the front desk. PASS. My room was fine. But I have three issues: 1. The internet connection: according to the internet support desk, the hotel has a 1 Mbps connection. This is grossly unacceptable: you are sharing a scant million bits per second with ALL the other guests. If you're here on business, forget about getting anything done beyond e-mail. It's staggeringly cheap of them, if you think about it: your *home* connection is probably at least four times that fast, and you're not sharing it with a hotel full of guests. FAIL! 2. There's a beautiful balcony. I think most rooms have one. My room faces south towards the mountains, which is cool, although it means that it overlooks Ventura Boulevard, and beyond it, the 405, which is noisy even up here on the 11th floor. The balcony is only about three feet deep, but that's OK. Or it would be, except that, for reasons known only to Satan, the sliding glass door to the balcony only opens four inches. This is deliberate. They don't want you out on the balcony. FAIL. 3. The rooms suffer from a disease common to many, many hotel rooms: very noisy air conditioning. Well, that's OK, I thought. I'll just turn it off, and open the four-inch balcony window.

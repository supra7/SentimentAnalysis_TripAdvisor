We drove the california coast for our honeymoon without a map or reservations anywhere. Pulled into San Fran and started looking for hotel, there was a big convention going on so couldn't find a room anywhere. This wouldn't have been my choice but beggers can't be choosey. Anyway the owner/clerk ripped our heads off the first night at $219, but I guess he liked my husband and gave us half price the next night. Parking is only $10, which is really good for SF, but there's not much of it so not everyone will get a space. Rooms are tiny and old fashioned, but we were never there during the day anyway, just slept there. There is no AC, but we like sleeping with the windows open and going to sleep listening to the seals.The owner/clerk was actually pretty nice and gave us maps and suggestions of places to explore in SF, so all in all we would probably go back.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR876904078", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "teeirons"}, {"Content": "Don't Expect a great place You get what you pay for and this place is a perfect example of it.

We checked in around 7 p.m. We discovered no place to park. We almost parked two blocks away in a public parking lot except my son watched for someone taking off from a spot on Columbus and thanks to cell phone, called me as soon as a spot was available. The manager was rude and unapologetic and did not even suggest any options ( such as the parking lot two blocks away). Rather he told us...This is San Francisco and they don't guarantee paking for hotel guests.I told him my son should have been warned of the parking dilemma as we may have opted to arrive early to compete for spots or go to another hotel ( such as Holiday Inn or Marriott ) which was across from Travelodge. He refused to refund us when I demanded to switch hotels. Since this was my son's first attempt at booking travel for our family, we went ahead and stayed. The room was on the first floor. The room had curtains with a broken rod, the bathroom towel rack has obviously been broken and taken out but not replaced. Taking a shower was dangerous. You could be scalded or frozen. In the midst of a shower, the shower did not dispense the water equitably so that in the middle of the shower, the hot water would come on or the extremely cold water would take its place. One had to hop to the side to avoid the extreme impact of very hot or very cold water and wait until the water temperature was the right one. Thus showers took a long time.No one could sleep ( as we were on the first floor) with thin walls and loud doors banging all around us. There was screaming each night from somewhere in the neighborhood. I could not tell if they came from homeless persons or from residents in homes nearby. I finally made sure I had wine with my dinner on Sunday to ensure sleep and recover what I lost on Satuday night.There was mold in the shower and the sink. The closet was extremely difficult to get into. I do not recommend this to anyone who has the financial ability to go to another hotel. Otherwise, it is in a good location - walking distance to Ghilardelli and Fisherman's Wharf. If this is your only option ( cost wise), arrive early to get a parking spot in the lot or around it.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR143089638", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "batacbabyboomer"}, {"Content": "No Hot Water Terrible terrible terrible!!!

We stayed 2 nights at the travelodge fisherman's wharf in early March. I wanted to stay close to the wharf and I'd gotten a great deal thru Hotwire. The rooms were very basic hotel rooms. Everything was clean, though a bit shabby. We had no trouble getting a parking spot. The parking cost $10 a day, which was very reasonable. The location was excellent, a short walk to the Fisherman's wharf, but I would not recommend this hotel. Inside the closet, the walls seemed to be rotted out at the bottom and on that entire side of the room the carpet was soaking wet. So much so that it squished when you walked on it. It started to smell mildewy in there by the second day. Also, my travel partner believes that housekeeping (or someone) opened and went through his suitcase while we were out.

What a major disappointment! The Travelodge at Fisherman's Wharf is a dump! Not even the special rate of $99 per night was worth staying. No air conditioning in room, just a dirty fan blowing warm air on you. Both beds had lumpy mattresses, and scratchy sheets. The shower stall (no tub) had leaked through the wall so the plaster was moldy. The carpet was so dirty I had to wash my grandson's feet again the next morning before I put his socks on. We had booked 4 nights; needless to say, we checked out very first thing next morning. When I asked desk clerk that night if he had any room freshener spray, he said to ask Housekeeping in the morning. How could we sleep with the mold smell in the room?

Also, parking does cost an extra $10 + tax (and you need to let them know ahead of time that you will require a space), and it was barely worth it for us as we checked in late and had to check out at noon.

We stayed for one night in Dec 2003 (booked 3, but checked out the following morning) and it was dreadful. Firstly, the check-in clerk wasn't at his desk.

He then took about 10 minutes to find our reservation, which I had confirmed by phone earlier in the day. Once in our room, we found we had no heat and on a very cold, wet night, this was a great inconvenience. The clerk dragged out an old space heater that clanged all night and didn't warm the room.

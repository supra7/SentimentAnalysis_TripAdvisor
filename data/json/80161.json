This is now a Holiday Inn Express, no longer a Holiday Inn as of January 2012, even though it is still listed as a Holiday Inn. The property has been recently remodeled and the breakfast only restaurant, has been converted to a HIE eating area. This is a new conversion so not everything is to HIE standards, namely there were no cinnamon rolls or the new pancake machine. The staff is good, and they made the effort to bring me a new room key when mine didn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t have to slog up to the desk or wait long for the bell man arrival. The rooms are average, and the TV has poor reception on some stations, but they have been upgraded to flat screens so it was acceptable but not ideal. The bathroom had two lotions and shampoo instead of conditioner, shampoo, and lotion. I didn\u2019t find this out till I was already in the shower. Just a little disappointment, but a easy oversight by the staff. Again I have found that the bathroom central exhaust is not functioning. It leads to steamy showers, and in wet climates mold.

Previous hotels have been great so we weren't worried. We wanted the area to be close to family and still close to San Diego Zoo, beaches, etc. The other comments on parking are true, but there is a one level garage under the second building next door. Large SUV's won't fit there though. The main building looks like it was added on to 2 or 3 times, at the end. You would walk down the long hallway and pass through narrow doorways and the construction materials (ceilings, etc) would be slightly different. We were at the end of the main hall on the 2nd floor in the non-smoking section. Some of the rooms had an interior stairway to a second level for a private bedroom (we peeked in one that was being cleaned after check out). Our room was one level and actually quite large, but the attached photos will show the water damage to the wall and ceiling. Another ceiling tile in the bathroom area was also water damaged and slightly askew. Also, most electrical outlets were so loose that the plugs for hair dryers, laptop chargers, etc would actually fall out of the outlet. We had to jiggle them and sometimes prop the plug so that it would stay in the outlet. That shows a lot of use, and the outlets should be changed. The A/C is a \"central\" type, with a vent coming out of the wall above the entry way. This vent could not be adjusted, so the bed closest to the bathroom was in the warmest part of the room. Thankfully we always bring a small fan for the \"white noise\" and it circulated the air enough for us. I can certainly understand the complaints about the air flow. The A/C thermostat was very irritating. It is computerized, and the programs can't be changed. The program was set for 76 during the day and 80 DEGREES at 10 pm. No matter how I tried to adjust the programming it would not eliminate the 10 pm meltdown. You could adjust the temperature but it reverted back to broil at 10pm. After 10 minutes of messing with it I did manage to find the \"hold\" function so that the thermostat would hold the temp at a set number. I chose 75 and it held it at that. As a back up measure, I changed the time on it by 12 hours, so that if the damn thing did go to 80 degrees it would do so during the day when we were either gone or awake and could override it. Doing these two things allowed us to be comfortable while we slept but it is stupid to program it at 80 degrees in the first place. Once we got past the ceiling cracks and the weird A/C settings the hotel was okay. Not 3 stars, unless they are very dim stars way far away in another galaxy, but okay. I am glad that I only paid $85 a night through Hotwire, I would be very upset to pay their standard rate of $135 or more for what we got. The towels were very absorbant, but not very soft. Sort of like a free dermal abrasion treatment. I didn't mind, but just wanted to note it. There were also plenty of them. We had no problem with noise or other guests. We were on vacation so we slept in past the free breakfast, but the one time we saw it the room was full and everyone looked to be enjoying it. Overall, an okay hotel. Better than Days Inn, etc. but not a good value at full rate.

I will start by saying that the area is great. It is right up the freeway from everything and really close to The San Diego Wild Animal Park. It is in an upper middle class neighborhood and I felt really safe. It is next door to the Elephant Bar Rest. The staff were nice and I am a stickler for smiles and greetings. The parking is tight but free and we always managed a spot to park our larger vehicle. The room is simple but has a small fridge and micro. We are traveling with kids so having the fridge made a big difference. The beds were ok. Maid service was terrific but the carpet was very dirty as our socks were black on bottom. The satellite TV we had was also free but in the rare days we came back early the signal was weak and went out a few times. The free breakfast was a toss up with my husband and I having different views. The choices were good for a free meal, eggs and bacon/sausage and muffins and fruit rolls, oatmeal juices boxed cereals coffee etc.. By the way the rating is A ( I always look for that too) however... you have to get there early as they close up shop promptly at 9 am and you have to rangle a free table. Be prepared (especially if you have kids) to wait for a while for someone to finish their meal and run like heck to claim the table while the busboy is trying to bus the table. I did not like that but my husband loved it. He remarked that the food was terrific! It saved our family at least $30.00 a day ...The plates are glass ... there are no waiters and no host. We did not try the pool as hubby is picky about pools. I would say that if you go thru Priceline you can get a great rate and for the money this place is worth it.

As we waited to be served another person was complaining that his air was not working(it was hot that day). They told him they would send someone to fix it. This had us worried already. Well we get to the room, entering through underground seedy garage up to our suite!(well I would not call it a suite)Walked down the hall could hear everybody making noise in their rooms. As we walked on the gross carpet down the hall with no air but a window opened. Opened the door to a dark cave where there was a couch ,tv and table. To our delight, not there was a terrible smell and of coarse the air was not working! Well was not happy so phoned down to the front desk to ask to change rooms. But, of coarse we were told they were sold out! Our family had just traveled all day and wanted to relax in cool air. This had us so mad we went into the lobby and used the payphone to call other hotels however there was something big in town and could not find a room. So we decided to stay just 2 nights and not 5 and did the whole San Diego in a day. Later that night when trying to sleep you get to hear the patio and the cars coming and going form the pub across the way which they give you coupons for. Finally get to sleep and was awaked by the room next door Father was having a arguement with his daughter which school to go to. This was through the adjoining door at 12am. When we checked out I told the front desk staff everything and they did not care! Our family travels about 6 weeks a year and we will not stay in a Holiday Inn again!

We got a good price via Priceline, it was a convention weekend so all the hotels closer to San Diego were booked. The hotel itself is fine, exactly what you'd expect from a typical Holiday Inn. The room was clean and the desk staff were friendly, the breakfast was nicer than expected. We focused most of our activities around the downtown area, it was a good 30 minute drive to get there from the hotel. This is a decent place to stay if you want to be outside the city; If you want to play in the city, I'd look for something closer than the Rancho Bernardo area.", "Date": "July 28, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn San Diego-Rancho Bernardo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80161-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_San_Diego_Rancho_Bernardo-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$101 - $144*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">17065 W.

All in all, not a bad hotel if you're looking for a beach front property. This hotel is old and shows it's age, but our room was fine. It was quite small but since it was just the two of us, it worked out perfectly. It also wasn't too pricey but it was off-season, so I'm sure it would have been twice as much during the summer months. We got a room on the 3rd floor in the main building and the view was spectacular. We were able to park for free in the hotel parking lot (a definite plus in PB) and walk to wherever we wanted.

With that being said, I wanted to report that as a single older woman traveler, you may want to rethink some things. My room faced the ocean, and was uncomfortably hot with no breeze. No A/C, I had a fan only. There were people behind me (second floor), so no cross ventilation was possible, hence a hot box of a room. Bottom line: Unless they have a better room, don't bother booking this cell, and it's no way appropriate for two people!! The front desk was sullen but efficient. Not a friendly place, and unless you bring your friends along, you'll likely not speak to anyone for days on end. But, again, this may be what you are after.

The location for downtown and other touristy S.D. attractions is just OK. If you're going to do those things it is probably best to have your own car.

On the second and third floors of the main building, the exterior breezeway also has seating areas outside the rooms. This is pleasant, but I could see that it could be a problem if the other guests are not considerate. If you have the sliding glass door open to catch the breeze, you may hear more of your neighbors' conversations than they intend for you to hear. I liked the location in Pacific Beach.

Not saying it was terrible and the hotel receptionist did get us the quietest room on the block but the room was a little dark and depressing. Very spacious. It was fairly clean and kitchen was reasonably okay but looked a bit like a student flat. The balcony and stairways were a bit scruffy and dusty and cigarette butts on the floor and we had an ashtray full on our plastic table by the door. Had the location of Mission Beach been fabulous we would probably have stuck it out but checked out after one night. Def not worth $200 per night considering what we got for our money for the rest of holiday. Mission Bay is for youngsters and is loud and scruffy. Having said that this hotel is clearly very popular with seniors and families because many were booking for next year so maybe it is not as bad as we think but we were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When checking out they asked if we wanted to pre book for next year and appeared shocked when we said no so it seems quite a lot of people must say yes.

It was a short drive to both Seaworld and the Zoo. The location is adjacent to the boardwalk and beach and the ocean front cottage could not have been nearer. The view from the windows and patio are was fantastic especially at sunset. Pacific Beach itself is a popular area particuarly with young people, it was quite lively but felt safe and was not noticably noisy. Within a five minute walk there was a good selection of resonably priced restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. The accomodation was very welcoming and appeared very family orientated with BBQ areas, table tennis and a laundrette. Our cottage consisted of a living room with dinning table, seperate kitchen with good facilities, seperate bedroom and bathroom with bath and shower. The accomodation was spacious, clean and comfortable. The decor may have been a bit dated for some peoples taste but we found it charming and homely.

We stayed for three nights. The four of us shared an apartment with two queen beds and a kitchen for $135/night (winter rate). The room was very large, and included a sitting area with a couch, chair, and coffee table near the TV and a large dining table with 6 chairs, if I recall correctly. The kitchen was well-equipped with silverware, pots and pans, baking dishes, cups, plates, bowls, etc. There were two queen beds and a decent-sized, clean bathroom. All of the furniture was new-looking and well-kept. The studio apartments (where we stayed) and motel rooms are in the North Building, set apart from the main building where the bigger apartments and cottages are located. The apartments/motel rooms in the North building do not have a view of the ocean, but the rooms in the main building do. Although we didn't have a view of the ocean, this didn't bother us. We could still smell and hear the ocean from our room, and from our room we were only a few steps from the beach. The hotel's location was nice- lots to do in the area without having to drive. The hotel is a quick walk from the boardwalk and pier, lots of bars, shops, and restaurants. Ralph's (grocery store) is right across the street. In the area you can rent bikes, rollerblades, boogie boards, etc. for the day. The area felt relatively safe, though it did seem more of a place for college-aged adults and older than a place for small children and families. I think maybe Mission Beach is more of a family-oriented place... that's just the impression I got. The hotel staff was helpful. When our toilet got clogged, the desk staff sent a maintainence person right away. The room was cleaned each day, and they were happy to give us extra towels.

The apartment rooms are great for a good size family who is on a budget. There is a small kitchen in each room. We very rarely used it, but it was very nice to have. It's stocked with everything you need to make a decent meal if you want to eat in. While on vacation I do not cook, so there are tons of restaurants within walking distance. This is such a great place if you like to people watch. Lots and lots of people. The down side of this place is the bar on the corner. We love to go and have a couple of drinks, but if you are not a partier and go to bed at a decent time, you may be awaken by young kids leaving the bar after 1am.

The two walkers were also happy with the area although we left it every afternoon for other hiking destinations, shopping, or tours. We all loved the many choices of places to eat near by (ex. The Mission for breakfast) or a ten minute drive away (ex Hash-a-Go-Go for great breakfasts). Our cottage was simple, clean, and airy.

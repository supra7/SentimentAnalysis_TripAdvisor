When we got to the hotel the front desk person was helpful and quickly checked us into 2 rooms. Upon entering the first room you couldn't help to ignore the scent of cat urine. It was so filty and not kept up i quickly decided to go check the 2nd room. To no surprise the 2nd room smelled lik 100 pack of cigerates were light all at once. not to mention the bed want even made. I suddenly remembered seeing the sign in the lobby saying that once 15 minutes passes by after check in you cannot get a refund. So i quickly grabbed my fiance and said hurry up I need to get OUT OF HERE!! When getting back to the lobby the front desk person was very helpful in checking us out and giving us a refund. When leaving the hotel i went next door to the Stadium inn and suites were the rate was 20 dollars less and the rooms were 2,000 times better. On the bad note i checked in/out on saturday 24 and its the 28 now and i still have not reecieved my refund. I'm dissapointed because i was reassured i was going to be refunded the next day and not it almost 5 days later and still have not recieved it. I've also tried to contact the manager more than 5 times and still have not spoken to anyone which is very unperfessional and bad business ethics. I would never reccomend this hotel to anyone in there right mind or people that have a descent standard for living. Please do as the title says and run as fast as you can for your own sake!!!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longmont, Colorado", "Title": "\u201c(Really) Worst Place Ever\u201d", "Author": "RLLongmont", "ReviewID": "UR123047136", "Content": "I had a work week in Orlando without my family and was looking for a very economical hotel. I booked this hotel on Expedia. OK, first for the good (and this will be brief). During the week stayed here, I spoke with three individuals at the front desk. Each of them was very pleasant and helpful. Now for the bad. I've stayed in hotels all over the world (and many in the $3 - $5 per night range in my backpacking youth) and this was easily the worst and dirtiest hotel I've ever set foot in. I was on a work trip during which time I was out of the hotel for 16 - 18 hours at a time. If I would have had more time and energy, I would have quickly asked for a refund and found another hotel. The black mold on the tub tile and shower curtain was so thick I purchased bleach spray and almost burned my nostiles one night bleaching every non-fabric surface. You will definitely have to do this if you try to stay in this hotel. Also, I went through a can of Lysol on the floors and beddings because of the incredible level of filth. Even once the hotel was somewhat sanitized, the bedsheets had holes in them and the fitted sheet would not stay attached to the mattress. Every time I sat on the bed or moved after I was laying down, the fitted sheet popped off showing dark brown stains on the mattress (which I also Lysoled). When I got to the hotel the first night, there was trash on the floor and hair on the sink likely from the last person who stayed in the room (not bad, but a few hairs on the back of the sink area and small amounts of paper trash and threads on the floor). When I got back late the next night, the towels had been changed (by the way, the towels were full of spots and incredibly thin from use) but the bed had not been made and nothing had been cleaned. I went to the desk the next morning and asked them to replace my sheets and vaccuum and clean the room. They did this, but the sheets had the same problems. This was the only time my bed was made or the floor vaccuumed or the sink wiped down during the week I was there. Even if I wouldn't have noticed the roach traps in the bathroom behind the toilet, I would have been concerned for my health. Long story short, avoid this place at all costs. Sometimes the lowest priced hotel is just not worth it.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tamuning, Mariana Islands", "Title": "\u201ccamera stolen from room when we were out for new years\u201d", "Author": "satsumasandoz", "ReviewID": "UR91469837", "Content": "do not stay here, when we went out on new years eve from 9p until 2am, we realized the next morning that one of our 2 cameras had been stolen from the room. we filed a police report and when police asked for surveillance video, they had not had functioning cameras for months.

We didn\u2019t have a reservation, we phoned a bunch of hotels. When we got to Kissimmee and everything was booked so our only option was the Best Vacation Inn. We got our room it wasn\u2019t that great it looked so dirty one of the garbage\u2019s wasn\u2018t even emptied from the previous people. I called the front desk and they came shortly after and emptied it. There were beer bottle caps under the beds with lots of dirt. We needed a fridge in our room we had to pay extra for that when other hotels in the area have them included in the rooms. I opened one of the dresser drawers and bugs came running out, the dresser had one clean drawer the night stand had ashes in one of the drawers with some garbage. You had to slam the door to get it to close. I had to do laundry while we were there the washer washed the clothes good but it doesn\u2019t ring out the clothes, I put my clothes in the dryer for two cycles and the clothes weren\u2019t even dry after. I went to the front desk to tell them about the laundry and the lady said that there was nothing she could do and the soonest that they could get someone to come out and fix the laundry machines was the next day.

I was only staying one night and thought how bad could it be. I was extremely pleased with this hotel and I am considering cancelling my reservations at the Disney resort during Spring Break and staying here to save us some money! First off the women working the front desk was extremely pleasant. I was travelling alone with my 6 year old daughter and I felt perfectly safe where I was.When I got to the room I was floored by how absolutely spotless everything was. The carpet looked and smelled as if it was new. The shower had plenty of room and great water pressure. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I had ever stayed in a motel. At first I thought something was wrong with the A/C because the room wouldnt cool. I called down to the front desk and they were very apologetic and told me they would switch my room. But thankfully I did not have to, turns out the A/C was operater error (me)and I finally got it to work. Once it kicked on the room cooled to the perfect level. Even though the hotel is on the main road, you couldn't tell from your room. The room was very peaceful. I am usually very particular about hotels I stay in, this hotel was absolutley not what I expected. My only complaint would be that I prefer interior corridors but with all you get in this hotel for the price it is well worth that sacrifice. It may not have had a free breakfast but the Ihop is attached to the hotel and offers a discount to the hotel patrons. I prefered the Ihop to the so called breakfasts that other hotels have served. Also the mexican restaurant located directly across the street was absolutely fabulous.

It was recommended to me to stay at the Days Inn because it was cheap and had a lot of room. I came from Canada and when I found out I was paying $47/per night I thought this is great. I was told it had a fridge, dishwasher and a stove. I was pretty excited and was looking forward to it. When I arrived in Kissimmee at 1:00 in the morning we checked in and went to our hotel. My first impression is I wanted to cry. I was booked into this dump for seven nights. We walked in and it was very old looking inside. The kitchen table had little bugs crawling all over it. There was at least an inch thick of dust behind the night stand. I opened up all the cupboards looking for the pots, pans and dishes to only find out that it was completely empty. If you want to use these items, you have to rent them from the front desk. There was two t.v.'s in the room. The t.v.'s only had three channels, and one of the remotes wouldn't even work. The next day when we were driving around I noticed a lot of signs advertising rooms for even cheaper than what I paid. We checked some other locations out and we ended going right across the street to the Motel 6 for $20.00 a night cheaper and even had HBO t.v. My family was more than happy to get out of the dump. Oh by the way, I never did use the laundry facilities, but it is true. It is disgusting in there. I wouldn't even try to wash my clothes in there. When I checked out and got my money back, the man at the front counter couldn't even be bothered to ask me why I was checking out. I am sure that they know.

It has a parking lot but the lot is filled with broken glass and you often get blocked in since they overfill it. When drive back to the hotel you have to hope they see you on the camera and open the gate or you have to call them up to open the gate. It was pretty inconvenient.

Having not been to San Francisco in over 25 years, I was not familiar with the various neighborhoods of the city. My instructions were to find a hotel that included complimentary (or very inexpensive) parking, convenient location to the heart of San Francisco, and at a reasonable rate. What I found was the Embassy Hotel. At a room rate of $129 per night, double occupancy, FREE overnight parking and COMPLIMENTARY continental breakfast every morning - I thought it was too good to be true. After booking the reservations, I then found reviews saying that it was sub par and not a pleasant experience at all. Having arrived home just a few hours ago, I am exhausted but compelled to write this review and to report that the Embassy Hotel was a most PLEASANT EXPERIENCE. The hotel is on the VERGE of the tenderloin district but it is closer to the Financial District and directly across the street from the California Culinary Institute. We heeded the advice of friends to not venture down the next 2-3 blocks at night, but during the day it was fine. Honestly it didn't look that bad to us at all, and several mass transit options are available for travel to and from the hotel. The staff was very knowledgeable about the city and extremely polite. The room was very clean and the whole hotel had the appearance of being freshly painted, it was very cheery and an extremely pleasant atmosphere. The decor was that of Art Deco with the pink and black tile in the bathroom, and the room furnishings were very authentic. The beds were extremely comfortable and the entire room, bathroom and closet included were immaculate. I loved the hotel entirely! The continental breakfast consisted of delicious breads, jams and fruit in the adjoining pub. The whole hotel had a very European feel to it which was noted in that most of the guests seem to be European. If there was a complaint to have it was that the walls were a little thin but that is to be expected with the age of the hotel. I would return to the Embassy Hotel every time I come to San Francisco and definitely recommend to all of my friends. For the cost and convenience, I don't think there is a better deal to be had in the city of San Francisco. I trust that you will have a most enjoyable experience.", "Date": "Sep 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR645442614", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "talkchicksd"}, {"Content": "Stay away!!!

The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is one of the worst in San Francisco, which includes pan handlers, transients, prostitutes and drug dealing.  Upon arrival we were greeted at the counter and given an actual key (as opposed to the what seems to be the standard, in today's technology, a key card) We then boarded an ancient elevator, which had a door that needed to be opened from the outside with a door handle. The elevator held only four people at a time and would not operate unless the entry door was closed. (At one point we waited approx 10 minutes for the elevator on the fourth floor, due to the fact that the entry door hadn't been closed on the ground floor.)  Our walk to our room was met with trash left in the hallway (which was still there the next day) by other guests. Most of the other guests seemed to be students of the Culinary Academy located across the street from the hotel.

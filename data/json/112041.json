I did a lot of research into the best value for money in New York, since we're on a budget that doesn't go far in this town, and I think the Larchmont is a great compromise as somewhere comfortable, quiet and well-located while remaining a lot more affordable than somewhere with perhaps more up-to-date bedspreads. Our room was undeniably a touch shabby and utilitarian, but sunny and clean and of a decent size - there was plenty of room to move around the bed even with our large cases open. There was a well-sized chest-of-drawers and wardrobe with robe and slippers. It was very quiet from both inside and out the hotel; there was some noise from the central-heating pipes that sounded weirdly like an animal whimpering at first, until I realised what it was - all part of the New York charm and novelty. I'd specifically asked for a quiet room in the booking submission, and was grateful we'd been granted one at the far end of a corridor on the third floor, with a kitchen no one ever used on our other side. I'm never overly enthusiastic about the whole negotiating-of-shared-bathrooms thing, but this was offset by the convenient sink and mirror in the room, so traipsing up and down the hallway for every little handwashing or makeup-applying was minimised. In three days, I never once had to wait for the bathroom or toilet to be vacated, and they were kept spotlessly clean. They might have been old and utilitarian and covered in decades of reapplied cream paint, but they fulfilled their task. There was a breakfast included in the room rate, which was served across a counter in a small room in the basement by a woman not to be messed with - it was like being at boarding school. The breakfast was pretty basic - pastries, packaged juice, apples - and we used it to take the edge off and then strolled over to Greenwich Avenue to Soy Cafe for real coffee most mornings. We only met the staff briefly, but they were all friendly and helpful, especially the man who helped us upstairs with our luggage and then greeted us whenever we came and went. The cleaning women were pleasant whenever we briefly encountered them. Other reviews have complained about the smell in the stairwell, and I noticed that too, but couldn't really care about it - it's just a characterful old building with over a century's worth of accumulated boiled-cabbage cooking smells.

Being at the back of the building it was very quiet although a bit dark but no big deal as we were out all day. We knew when we booked that we would be sharing toilet and bathroom and would have access to a kitchen. We had no problem with the sharing aspect but what disappointed was the very poor facilites. The shower was over a small narrow bath but instead of the shower being at one end of the bath it was mounted on the wall halfway along the bath. This meant there was hardly any room to turn without catching against the plastic shower curtain. It was absolutely awful so that showers were taken quickly. If the bathroom was bad the kitchen was a total disaster area. It had a large fridge, cooker etc but no pots or pans, no cutlery, no plates or dishes ... but it had a table! However the whole area was grubby and very uninviting. We could therefore only use the fridge. We felt cheated as a result. As others have said the reception is uninviting and the staff there not very friendly. The corridors and upstairs layout is also not appealing although the decor seemed fresh and clean. Then there was the breakfast room downstairs which was pretty awful and the staff unfriendly. The continental breakfast was very meagre with little choice.

We easily found the hotel but of course being in Greenwich Village none was to be found. I unloaded the car at the door and then found a garage about 3 blocks away. $90 + a good tip for a good spot got me 3 days there. Room Check in was smooth although the desk staff could have been nicer. We stayed in a rear third floor room. The room was small but comfy with a queen bed, sink, table and dresser. There was no room to stretch our legs but we were not on the island to stay in our hotel. AC and heat worked just fine. The hotel is \"European\" style meaning the bathrooms are shared. This was our first stay at a place like this so we were a little apprehensive. It turns out that the restrooms were always vacant (only a few rooms per floor), impeccably clean (it always looked like we were the first ones to use them when we did), and spacious.

Breakfast A light continental breakfast was served in the am in the hotel basement which included typical pastries, bagels, coffee, tea and juice. It was a nice touch. Service Other than check in we found the doorman/bellhop to be exceptional. He was knowledgeable about the area and was more than happy to steer us away from touristy attractions when we asked. Maps were provided and the hotel also had internet and printing ability (we had forgotten to print show tickets and they printed them for us). The lobby is small but comfortable, with a couple of chairs. Security In addition to the doorman, each floor was only accessible by the people staying on that floor. The hallways were always quiet.

But you should first know what you're getting - and not getting - for $100 per night. Yes, that's all I paid, in Manhattan, for a small, single room with a twin bed. I didn't need anything more than that. It's in a great location, a nice neighborhood and a quiet street. It's also very secure. Separate keys for front door, hall on your floor, and room. And it's clean, including the shared restrooms. So the basics are covered, with kind of a hostel - like atmosphere. No, I never liked sharing the restroom (though like many reviewers, I never actually saw any of the handful of people who were also on my floor). And in fairness, I did have my own sink in my room so SOME bathroom functions are not in a shared space. I agree that the place is old, dated and a little tired looking (see photos). But most people who come to New York don't plan to spend much awake time in their room, anyway. I ended up doing so more than I planned because it was raining cats and dogs most of the time I was there, which limited the roaming I wanted to do. But I also agree that the restaurants in the same block are great. Loved the Chinese restaurant and Burger Heaven just up the street on 6th Ave. I never tried the breakfast in the basement, but I want to say that the desk clerk was always friendly and very helpful. I had to catch an early morning flight at JFK, and was concerned about trying to get out there on time using the subway with luggage, etc. He put me in touch with a great ride service - Eastern. That is the ONLY way to go. They picked me up right on time and I literally made it door to door from the Larchmont to JFK in about a half hour - not kidding - for less than $70. So this was everything it was advertised to be, and a little more here and there, well priced for what you get, and all that I needed.

One morning, I piled my dirty towels, hotel robe, and hotel slippers into one big lump as usual. No bed linens in the lump this time. I ventured off into the city and returned late afternoon/early evening. I found my room in a state of \"somewhat serviced\". The bed was made but a little sloppily in my opinion. The carpet was not vacuumed so bits of food and random pieces of trishy trash greeted me. My old slippers were placed neatly beside the drawer and a robe was hanging on the hooks near the new towels. This scene was suspicious. Since the carpet was in disarray, I inspected other items for cleanliness. The old slippers should have been carted off with the dirty towels. I had a spare pair as the room came with two clean sets. I eyed the hanging robe and noticed yesterday's stains. I ran my hands across the robe and noticed it was wet. At this point, I was livid and rang the office for service. They're response was prompt and very apologetic. The bellman vacuumed and presented me a fresh robe. He speculated the housekeeping ladies were probably on their phones blabbing with their boyfriends and became absent-minded and hurried. I chuckled imagining his scenario. He apologized once more, asked if the room was to my liking then returned to the office with a promise to notify Housekeeping oof their epic failure.

The front desk staff was polite and efficient at both checking me in and out. The bellman was also helpful and friendly when, after checking out, I needed my bag kept there and to use the bathroom. There are three keys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one for the inside front door to the main part of the building; one for the hallway (each floor seems to have east and west wings); one for your room. Yes, it's not as convenient as a regular hotel where you just swipe yourself into the room, but it felt secure in an old-fashioned way. I had requested a quiet room not on the first floor and away from the elevators and stairs, and got a third floor room about three rooms down from both the doorway to the stairs and elevator and the bathroom/toilet. It faced the road, but as others have noted, West 11th is a side street and relatively quiet for New York (although when people were shouting rowdily outside, I could still hear). When I called to confirm the booking, I asked about internet access, and the person then had told me that with the small single rooms, wireless access was a problem. However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read online that lower floors were better, and on the third floor, I had no problems at all. I only stayed one night, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the quality of housekeeping, but my room was clean and neat when I arrived. I checked the sheets for signs of bed bugs, given a few of the reviews here, but they were clean, and I had no problems. The air conditioner wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most efficient, but it got the job done enough so that I slept fine. The blinds in my room were wide-slat metal, and blocked out the light quite well, better than just regular mini-blinds. I used ear-plugs (which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend), and had a decent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The shared bathroom and toilet were also no problem. They were clean, and I never had to wait to use either. (I only used the shower once, but the toilet multiple times.) As someone else has said, it would have been nice to have a sink where the toilet was to wash your hands, but since there was no towel service there, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a lot of sense. It was nice to have a sink in my room; one large towel, one hand towel, and one facecloth were provided. The bathrobe and slippers came in handy, and the toiletry bag had a generous amount of shampoo and conditioner, as well as a sewing kit, although I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have minded more than one piece of soap (so that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to carry that one piece over to the shower with my facecloth). There was a hair-dryer on the wall, but no iron or ironing board. It would have also been nice, as another reviewer suggested, for a full-length mirror to be placed along the closet door. But generally, I found everything sufficient. I made use of the luggage rack in the closet, the hangers, the desk, and the sink. There were three drawers that were part of the desk, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them. Breakfast was simply toast and various sweet pastries, plus orange juice, apple juice, tea and coffee. However, there are a couple of grocery stores on 6th Ave just north of W. 11th, so I easily supplemented my breakfast with some fruit.

But to save more than a thousand dollars for my week in New York I chose the Larchmont, which is located in Greenwich Village. The area I wanted to stay in, where I grew up. Do I have any complaints? Well, my one big complaint is that hotel fees are so high in New York. In a comparable location in Europe, in Paris, Rome, or Madrid, I know of excellent hotels where I can stay for a hundred dollars a night. In NY - for such a price - you have to walk down the hallway to shower or use the john. I was on the first floor. There were two bathrooms which were quite small, right on the hall. Only a thin wooden door separating the occupant from whomever was out on the hall. Yes, you could hear everything inside. The showers (no baths) were not much different. Tiny stalls right on the hall. One very tight and narrow, the other large and comfortable. But not much space, and, once again, everything taking place within the shower was audible in the hall. The room was clean and comfortable, freshly painted, with a nice small digital TV on the wall. And a bedside radio was available too. But the room was nevertheless dingy. The location of the hotel is excellent, but nevertheless the interior comes across as rundown. Even if the maids do a good job. The staff was helpful, uncritical, aloof in a friendly manner, all in all quite good. The free breakfast in the morning consisted of orange juice (I helped myself liberally - it was good), coffee, muffins, oily croissants, breakfast rolls, and inexpensive fruit pastries. The breakfast room was small, often crowded (many Europeans passing through) and somewhat dingy in spirit. But acceptable. The help was good. This is not a fancy place. If you do not want to hear a gastrointestinal sonata within the john as you pass through the hallway toward your room you may not be comfortable here. Never mind you yourself may make that sonata. My room (with the exception of the clanking of a radiator) was reasonably quiet. All depending upon the kindness of strangers. I could hear my neighbor snore through the wall. But this was only a minor disturbance. And I slept quite well on each of my six nights. The bed was comfortable. So, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, in New York, the price for a good hotel room is astronomical.

Odd, but you'll get the hang of it quick. -Water temp can sometimes vary during a shower, and they're so small it's hard to avoid the scalding/freezing. -This may sound minor, but it's extremely cheap and annoying: the thinnest toilet paper in the world on rolls that lock after a half-rotation and break the sheets. Did I mention annoying? -The breakfast is so cheap, you're allowed to pick *one* bread item only and get a *single* drink refill. It was enough for me, but is this really necessary?

I was the first to arrive and liked the look of the place--a street full of brownstones and little shops--but was a bit put off by the locked door into the reception area, where the staff was encased in bullet-proof glass.

The reception area and halls look vaguely European, but the decor of the room itself reminded me of Florida--a long time ago. I went out for a walk before my friends arrived, and the location IS terrific: between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, four or five blocks up from Washington Square, near grocery stores, shops, bus routes and subways. I bought some things like cheese and beer back, which we kept in the fridge in the little kitchen on our floor (quite a few long-term residents stay at the hotel, all of them very friendly).

We're from suburban Fairfield County, CT; you can understand the need for something other than mall stores. Our requirements:: Affordable, safe & very clean, great location for shops, restaurants. Winner! Very affordable (total for 3 of us for 1 night: double occupancy/ queen bed + $10/rollaway + taxes = $187.10), We were in Room 6E2, with window overlooking street. Check in is 3 p.m. /out 12:00 noon. Can store bags. Other properties in the area but most were pretty expensive or required more than one night's stay. Price also included continental breakfast of O.J., apple juice, coffee/tea & 1 muffin or other pastry. \"Cafe\" located in the basement but was bright and cute; 8-10 a.m. We went down late; they were nice and let us in. The Larchmont is located on \"one of the most beautiful streets in the Village\" (27 West 11th). Very true. March 8, nothing is in bloom, but really is a very pretty street; in bloom, it must be even better. We kept admiring the architecture. Guests have to share bathrooms down the hall w/other rooms. We were assured by the hotel that the bathrooms were kept very clean. Roe was VERY nervous about the situation as she ONLY stays in 4-5 star hotels & only will stay in a B&B if private, in-room bathroom. Jean & I are more intrepid depending on destination and it doesn't bother us to go down the hall for a bathroom, but we've never stayed in a place where we had to share with other rooms. Tthe idea of SHARED bathrooms, kind of made me nervous, too. (We skeeve easily at hair, unwiped tubs, etc.) Happy to say, tiny but spotless bathrooms (shower & toilet only, sink in room), never a wait, we didn't even see anyone else. By 8:00 a.m. maid was in cleaning them again. Clean rooms/nice fresh scented sheets; carpets probably should be upgraded. (Has A/C and TV) Be aware: this hotel's rooms are small, like European ones/or cruise ship. Also, being in a 100-year old building, when the steam heater went on it was a bit noisy \"puuuhfffffftiiittt\" \"shhhhh\" periodically through night). Also, that night wind was whipping so we could feel a breeze through window with a/c. I'm always cold, but with the steam heat, not a problem. Plenty of closet & drawer space. Hair dryer & towels (regular size, not huge, extra big ones, though) in room, cute toiletry kit for each person. White robes/shower slippers (sealed)-like in a spa- for each of us. Prompt, friendly staff -brougt up rollaway & my robe/toilietries/towels right away- stored our bags upon arrival so we could shop. Note: for bigger breakfast, walk to corner & eat at French Roast, is not expensive; good food, very busy. Safe neighborhood; we walked back from Villa Mosconi on 89 McDougall St. at around 10:00 p.m. Noted several European guests staying at Larchmont, which for me, makes it more interesting and fun.

The front desk personnel was professional in checking us (3) in, and were courteous, even though we arrived close to midnight.

I'll admit the radiator took some time getting used to, but once I figured out how it worked, there was no problem with the heat in my room. The shared bathrooms were clean, and always functional during my stay. They are not \"gym style\", so only one person can use the shower or toilet at a time, and there are about 2 washrooms per wing. All in all, I had no problems in getting a w/r when I required one. The hotel also provides a robe and slippers for each guest to use on check in ( located in the closet). Security is excellent. There are security cameras, and due to the set up of the hotel, you need to use TWO keys before you even get to the front door of your room. They provide a continental breakfast, but I did not partake in that, so I couldn't comment. The ONE thing which I had a quibble with is the fact that they do NOT accept reservations electronically. So, once you decide you want to stay here, you have to phone, or fax the dates you want. I recommend phoning your dates, and then having them fax a confirmation.

I didn't bother with the continental breakfast at the hotel. I reserved the small single and was on the 4th floor east. I had read that the small single was a bit like a cell so I was prepared for that. Yes, it was very small but that was OK. Thankfully, the air conditioning was in working order since it was hot and humid when I arrived in NYC. The bathrobe and in-room washbasin were very nice. The room was clean enough but it did have the faint smell of cigarette smoke. I noticed that there was an ashtray in the room and realized I hadn't thought to ask about their smoking policy. I'm pretty sensitive to scents and it didn't bother me too much. There were people in the room next to me and I could hear their tv blaring when I was in the hallway but was very happy that it didn't disturb me in my room. The bathrooms were always available and clean. They're not in the best shape, cracked tile, stains, etc, but they were clean and I felt very comfortable using them. I had no problems with the front desk staff. They were very nice and helpful whenever I had to interact with them.

After reading previous reports on the rooms with the shared baths, I reserved what they have lists on the web site as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Family Room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ($199 & $229, total with tax $492.23), because of the rate I thought the room would be little more than a walk in closet, but for the rate I mentioned, I was willing to gamble. In my humble opinion the gamble paid off in spades, first the positives: (1)Location, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on a fairly quiet street two blocks north of Washington Square Park (which I think is the coolest neighborhood in NYC) (2)A Nice Sized Room, (see photo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) there were two separate rooms both small, with 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ceilings (3)What looked like brand new window AC units (one in each room) and both rooms had ceiling fans. (4)Both rooms a small flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (5) Good size closet with robes & slippers, four sets of towels and extra blankets and pillow And now the negatives (and when I say negatives again in my opinion these are all very very minor issues): (1)They only give 1 set of keys and it takes 3 different keys to get from the street to your room (2)The rooms only had 1 twin bed and 1 single with a roll out under it (3)Small chest of drawers (but a decent size desk with drawers in the front room, but all furniture seemed to be new and in good condition) (4)There was construction going on right next door (started a 9:00 AM) (5)It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little bit of a hoof to the subway stations (3ish blocks down on 6th or 4ish over to Union Square park) The bathroom: (1)Small but adequate (see photo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) (2)Good supply of toiletries (good quality soap, shampoo, conditioner & sewing kit) (3)Instead of a small little shelf or having to use the toilet tank as a shelf they have a full size mirror medicine cabinet over the sink The staff: (1)Other than check in/out (we got to the hotel at noon expecting to just drop the bags, but they had the room ready and checked us in) and having to ask how to find my room and how the locks worked (god did I feel like and idiot) I did not have any contact and cannot speak of any rude behavior (2)Chamber Maid, did a nice job on my room (clean and neat, no complaints) (3)They do offer a continental breakfast (did not partake so I can not give an opinion, but it did sound a little goofy that you had to go to the desk show your key and then they would take you to the breakfast room) Again, in my opinion there is no reason not to stay in this hotel, as in previous post I would stay away from the rooms with shared bathroom, though the price is attractive.

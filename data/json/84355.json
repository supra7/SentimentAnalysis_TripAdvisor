Excellent activity schedule with movies on the lawn, indoor and outdoor pools, Tiki Bar for adult beverages too! Would recommend to families- not a posh resort or world class furnishings, but a good cleam family oriented hotel. Location on beach was excellent and is directlya cross the street from a grocery store- very convienent! Ask for Nroth Tower room if you have a small family- having the kitchen will save you money.

It has taken me 40 years to bring MY husband and children back to Perry's (mostly because the price always seemed too steep.) Anyway, we just splurged for a 3-night stay over Labor Day and it was every bit as fun as I remember! We had a gorgeous view from our 6th floor South Tower balcony all the way up the beach. Our spacious \"kidsuite\" room was perfect for us because my husband and I had a king bed, and the kids had their own space (no door, but their own TV!!!) The bathroom was tiny, but the shower and Bath & Body Works soap products were great! On Friday night Perry's showed \"Despicable Me\" as a \"dive-in\" movie in the indoor poor area. It was awesome to be able to watch a movie from the pool and hot tub (be aware...the dj announced that it was the last movie night for the season until March 2013.) There were several children's activities offered each day (arts & crafts, bingo, coloring contest, basketball game, etc...) but we didn't try any. We spent each day going back and forth between the pools and beach - it's very convenient that they are so close, and if one pool is too crowded you can try another. The beach here is gorgeous, and although cars are allowed on the beach we didn't have to dodge any to get to the water. I was happy to see there is a lifeguard right on the beach in front of the resort. There is a Tiki Bar serving food and drinks on property right between the pools. One day we ordered lunch (salad $8, BBQ sandwich & fries $6) and smoothies and ate at one of the many umbrella tables all over the grassy property. The food was delicious and it was great not to have to even dry off to get lunch. The resort was full for a holiday week-end, but not packed (except for the parking lots, and the homemade donut breakfast...go early or the donuts will be gone. They were as yummy as I remembered, and saved us from having to bring breakfast food.) There were lots of large, multigenerational families enjoying the week-end, and it could be a little loud by the pools at times, but I bet many of these families had been coming to Perry's for years...everyone was very friendly and having lots of fun. Perry's has lots of character, and that makes it unique and charming, and different from the big chain hotels! Try it, you'll love it, too!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lockport, NY", "Title": "\u201cIt's just OK...won't be back\u201d", "Author": "jendalessan2", "ReviewID": "UR139370133", "Content": "We've stayed at some nice places, this place was barely OK.

If you want a fancy smancy place--Perry's is not for you! But. . . if you want an old Florida type place to stay that you'll feel at home in, this is it. I almost hate to tell everyone about it, afraid that it will be overrun with people! Perry's is comprised of four types of accommodations: The original two-story motel/hotel is located in the center of the property with about 1/3 of the units being oceanfront. The other 2/3 are garden front. All in that building face a beautiful indoor pool surrounded by trees and plants and also a huge jacuzzi. That's the oldest building, but still very nice. The next building built was the six- or seven-story South tower. All of those rooms are oceanfront and have a resort kitchen. Or you can pay a little extra and get a room with a full kitchen, or a children's bunk room or a spa room. There's a second pool (outdoor) just off the balcony of those rooms. Then, the newest building is the North tower. It's also six or seven stores and all oceanfront. All of those rooms have kitchens included with another pool just outside your door. There are also some cottages just north of the North tower for people with pets. They're cute and nice, but you can't open the windows, so I don't stay in them. They offer children's programs in the summer and other things all year round, like water aerobics or bingo or various other crafts and activities. There's a Tiki Bar on the beautiful lawn and a breakfast/lunch place on the property also. But you must try the homemade donuts every day in the lounge. It's not a place for swinging singles, but a great place for families or couples or even singles just wanting to appreciate the beautiful ocean. Just step out onto your balcony or patio or sit at one of the many tables on the wonderful lawn and you'll think you're in heaven! Did I mention that I love this place? Can't wait to go back in October (my 5th time this year). Hey, some people stay there for months and one lady has been living there for about 10 years!

There's a basketball court facing the ocean, a volleyball court and the kids love to play on the shuffleboard courts. They have a great indoor pool with a jacuzzi and 2 outdoor pools which is great if you hate crowded pools and want some variety. We also look forward to the homemade donuts. It's another thing that sets Perry's apart from every other hotel. The Perrycation package is something to look into.

Yes, Perry's is an older property, so any one who reads this review and wants an ultramodern newer facility, DON'T COME TO PERRY'S! However, if you want an ultraclean, ultrafriendly, traveler friendly place to enjoy your vacation, no matter how short or long, please give Perry's a try. You'll be more than happy that you did. One of my favorite stories when I first went to Perry's about 20 years ago - I had my first introduction to bocce ball. When I saw those elderly gents and ladies, some of whom were actually in walkers, I almost felt sorry for them - until they cleaned my clock! Competitive bocce ball is a rude awakening for the novice. But I eventually learned their strategies and have grown to love the game. In fact, now that I live in Nevada, i actually run the bocce ball program at the local parks & rec facility. But I regress - back to Perry's. The staff is very friendly, the organized games and activities are family and senior friendly, the free coffee and donuts are top-notch, and the indoor pool and hot tub are refreshing. Shuffleboard courts and two outdoor pools add to the quality of your vacation. Unlike most hotels/motels, you will make new friends if you take part in the daily activities. And many of the seniors have been coming back for years and years. Says something for the joint, right??? Did I mention that Perry's is also reasonable, close to a supermarket if you want to eat in occasionally (nice kitchenette), a fairly close drive to many local eateries (don't miss Aunt Catfish's), and very roomy with two queen beds and a foldout sofa. The balconies make for a fantastic end of the day as the sun is setting on the ocean, and windows on both ends of the room make for incredible fresh breezes. Again, for those of you who are only concerned with newer facilities, don't come to Perry's and then complain about it. Perry's, although an older property has been thoroughly maintained and ultraclean. The room service is friendly and thorough. All in all, not only a great value for the money, but a more enjoyable and relaxing stay than almost any other hotel in Daytona Beach.

My husband and I were traveling alone to Daytona and decided to stay in one of the White Caps cottages because we were traveling with our dogs (both terriers). We had stopped at Perry's to check on a pet friendly room the last time we were in Daytona (last March) and were told that two dogs were no problem at White Caps (Perry's adjacent sister property), and the pet fee would be $25.00 per dog for the entire stay. We ended up staying somewhere else but knowing that the two dogs wouldn't be a problem, I made the reservation for our stay in October. Upon checking in, I was given a pet policy that stated that only one dog was allowed per room and the weight limit was 20 pounds when we had previously been told it was 25 pounds. I don't know if the pet policy changed between March and October or we were misinformed, but since we had just traveled 21 hours by car, we took a chance and stayed with our two dogs (one 19 pounds and the other 25). Our dogs are crate trained and very obedient and we took them with us when we left the property except when we were at the beach (no dogs allowed on the beach) and then we crated them. We noticed later that there were other people with dogs even larger than ours in the cottages so we felt better about sliding under the radar. As always, the staff was friendly (especially housekeeping) and the cottage was clean and comfortable. Sure, they're a little worn, but they are an older style as are the motel rooms that are part of White Caps. The rooms at Perry's are a little nicer but it's great to have a seperate cottage, especially when you are traveling with a pet (or pets!). We made use of the kitchen and the grills outside the cottages by purchasing fresh seafood at King's Seafood Market and some sides at the Winn Dixie across the street.

However, when we arrived all we did is ask nicely if there was a chance of being upgraded and they put us in a bigger, oceanfront room with a little kitchenette. We were very pleased about this. The room was warm when we arrived, but we figured it was because the air had been turned up for a while. After all, the management didn't expect to use it. We turned it way down (the fan would not blow on high) to get it cool and headed for the beach. When we returned it was cool enough for lounging but still a bit too warm for 4 people getting ready to go out for a nice dinner since the bathroom end of the room was not cooling down and there was no fan for venting the humidity. Note: We did NOT leave the door open to the balcony, so this wasn't a factor. In fairness to the management, however, we did not report this as we didn't realize until the next day, when we were getting ready to actually check out that it was indeed a faulty unit and not our hurried preparations that were causing the warm room (411). The beds are full size (we like queens) but they were comfortable enough. Tip to management: extra pillows on each bed would be a plus. There was a nice table for 6 in the case that you would want to save $$ on meals and eat in the room. The bathroom is small and the whole thing is in need of remodeling. I also noticed a bit of an odor in the room. There were also some night time noises that I cannot explain that must have been from the adjoining room (our party was not using). I'm pretty picky but none of these negative comments would keep me from returning because of the benefits to the grounds! Perry's has 3 pools! Practically ON the beach, it has a putting green next to this pool and in between a grassy area with nice round tables with umbrellas, chairs and GRILLS! This is a very fun family hotel!! Family reunions would be a total blast here!! They also have shuffle board, an indoor pool and hot tub and another outdoor pool that I didn't see. The beach here is drive on so you can load up your car and find an entrance drive to the beach if needed but it's really a nice place right there at the hotel. The beach is what we Floridians call sugar sand. It's very soft and brushes off easily after it's dry. The water is clearer the farther south you go but these waves are very consistant for surfers! BRING BINOCULARS because in the AM when the water is glassy you can see dolphin fin for a mile out if you have a good eye or binocs. I saw shapes (it was almost to the horizon) coming way up out of the water and splashes that had to be a school of dolphin in the AM while watching my kids surf from the grassy \"patio\" area. I also watched one dolphin completely clear the water not 10 ft. in front of my son while he was trying to catch a wave. There are rental places that rent 4 wheelers, chairs and umbrellas and the hotel has a tiki bar for burgers and even omelets! Between 7AM and 10AM they serve homemade donuts (all you can eat), OJ and coffee in the breakfast room on the second floor of the main building. It thought the donuts were really wonderful! If we had paid over $100 for a small room facing the indoor pool I would think the price unfair, but we were upgraded to an oceanFRONT room so I was very pleased with our stay, just wish I had not to fight the heat to get dressed to leave.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Family Beach Resort\u201d", "Author": "Chadton", "ReviewID": "UR115583918", "Content": "Everything about our stay was exciting; check-in and check-out; the room; the view; the beach; the donuts; icecream on beach; swimming pools were great; surrounding restaurants and attractions; everything was super clean; and staff were all friendly and accomodating.

I immediately called only to be told that housekeeping was gone for the day and to call back at 10:00 on Monday. I did. They told me they didn\u2019t find anything. That wasn\u2019t good enough for me. I called back again, this time asking for a manager. I talked to the manger who said that house keeping had a bag, but they couldn\u2019t find it and that the house keeper for that room had the day off. She later called me back to confirm that the bag was not from my room\u2026 Hum, can I just say\u2026. 1. I did indeed leave my stuff in the 2nd drawer. 2. Why didn\u2019t the housekeeper find it after cleaning the room, if they do indeed clean room? 3. Where did my stuff go? 4. Oh, yeah, one of the shirts is a Coors Light halter top with lace on the back\u2026. it\u2019s one of a kind, since I made it\u2026. so if anyone ever sees that shirt\u2026. well, it\u2019s mine!! 5.

My husband was attending a convention held at the Ocean Center & hosted by another hotel. As it was also our 20th anniversary, we decided to book the oceanfront Jacuzzi suite in the north tower. Perry's even provided the champagne - a \"romance package\" still in affect from Valentine's day. We loved it. Can't imagine a better view on the entire strip. Not only do you get the view from your balcony but in the jacuzzi suites you have an entire wall of windows on one side of the tub. All you have to do is open the shutters & there is the ocean. Everything everyone else has said is right on the money. HOWEVER, you have to realize that this is a LARGE place and it was hit by the hurricane last year. So, not every room is renovated yet. There IS a parking garage with several levels but it seems everyone wants to park right at the doors. I am in a wheelchair. My van will not fit in the parking garage (too tall) and I need room to get my chair out. That's why handicap spots are so wide & long. Yet, every night, we found every handicap spot taken by those who did not have handicap plates or placards. One night I went in to tell management & she sent maintenance around to the offenders rooms immediately. Overall, Perry's really should let people know how handicap friendly their place is. Walkways from building to building are ramped - no steps. There is a ramp down to the indoor pool. They even have a automatic transfer seat for those in wheelchairs to get in & out of the pool! I didn't explore the back \"lawn area\" too much as it was winter & I had no use for the outdoor pools or tiki bar. But I did manage to ride off the walk way & on to the grass & recline my chair to lay in the sun when it was 86 degrees our last day there. There was plenty of room to maneuver my chair in the office, public areas, elevators & in my room (which is actually one of the smallest rooms they have). Bathroom, however was tiny. I could not take my chair in there. Luckily I can still take a few steps without it. Anyone with a cane, walker or rollator should be fine though. So, don't be afraid to bring grandma & grandpa along with the rest of the family. They will get along just fine. Oh, almost forgot - Daytona Beach offers free use of beach wheelchairs at the life guard stations so if your chair will not go in sand, you don't want to get sand all over yours OR you just have a hard time walking on sand there is no need to worry about that either. They will even deliver the beach wheelchairs if you need them to.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDishonest advertising\u201d", "Author": "kdolson", "ReviewID": "UR101879418", "Content": "The hotel's on-line advertised \"Best of House\" rate is a farse.

My friend and I found the buses to be clean, cheap, generally on time, and easy to navigate--handy, since we didn't have a car. The fresh-made donuts were delicious and came with coffee, tea, and orange juice. The outdoor pool/courtyard area would have been lovely if the weather hadn't been cold while we were there. The indoor pool and hot tub area was quite nice, though. Not quite as big as it looked online, but very clean and pleasant with lots of towels and pretty plants.

At first, they were going to put me into a street level room in the parking lot, but I complained that I had a reservation for 3 nights. Why would they stick a female traveller on a street level room when they were clearly not full \u2013 and had better rooms on the ocean front? Do they not want me to recommend my stay to anyone else? Because I complained, they moved me. On the way to the room I noticed the elevator was dirty. Hand prints all over the doors and the floor needed new linoleum (those hand prints were there for the duration of my stay). The room had a nice view with balcony, but the carpet felt damp. I guess this is due to the general mugginess of Florida and the fact the hotel is on the ocean. Use of the room safe was an additional $5. There was a 7-11 and Winn-Dixie across the street, but I have to admit, at night both places had a general Daytona Beach sketchiness. Is there another reason I may not be aware of, that people hang out in the parking lot? No restaurant on site. On the plus side, the hotel is on the beach, so you just step off the property and you've got a good ten-mile stretch. Pool looks inviting on a sunny day. Parking is free. I did not see any bugs and did not leave with any bites. You're not in central Daytona Beach, so it is quieter (not that November was particularly busy anywhere). The Best Western is right next door, so you can eat at a reasonable price. Come to think of it, that hotel may be a better choice.

Although we enjoyed the aminities, especially the heated indoor pool/hot tub and fast elevators down to the beach, I was MAJORLY DISSAPPOINTED with the room this time. First, we had difficulty opening the door to the room, and then we couldn't get out of the room until my husband used some serious \"Hulk\" force on the door. Once outside the room again, we couldn't close the door, which delayed us from the beach. We eventually called the front desk and they sent a maintenance guy--who arrived fairly quickly and readjusted hinges/replaced door parts. Worked fine after that, but our neighbors, who apparently had the same door issues must not have called for repair because we listened to them slamming their doors open/shut our entire stay. The thing that most dissappointed me was the pigeon poop on the oceanfront balcony. I could deal with the old, wooden porch charis, but not the massive amounts of pigeon poop that was all along the railing of the balcony, under the chairs and heaped in the corner (I'm uploading photos). At night, at least 10-15 pigeons nested in the corner of our balcony and made noise. Had I known that the \"free upgrade\" to a 6th floor room with a full kitchen would cause me to lose the use of the oceanfront balcony that I paid $138/night for, I would have declined the upgrade. We couldn't sit on the balcony the entire trip, let alone put our beach towels out there to dry! Stay away from those 6th floor rooms----Poop Palace!!! As has been our usual experience, our bathroom was clean--no mildew anywhere & the linens were clean and the pillows were fluffy. Staff is friendly enough--we were always greeted nicely. However, the room itself had a mildew smell that I believe was caused by the old, dirty, damp carpet. Also, under the beds could use a thorough cleaning - vacuuming out. My daughter's sippy cup fell and rolled under the bed. I was so grossed out that I didn't bother to wash/scald the cup, we just tossed it in the trash and bought a new one. Our television required a few presses to get it to turn on---it would spontaneously turn off. Maid service was rather slow and the language barrier was a challenge when requesting items that she forgot to replinish. Parking can be a nightmare after dinner time, so plan to use the overflow lot across the street (very dark and unsecured).

Because of my research, all of the wedding guests stayed at Perrys. Everyone agreed that Perry's was \"very adequate\". For $99 per night, no one left disgruntled although very tired from disruptive sleep. None of of us had high expectations. The motel definitely feels old. To use the words \"newly remodeled\" on their website, I am certain they added a fresh coat of pain and new bedspreads. The mis matched carpeting and orginal bathrooms certainly create an old feel to the room. I walked the beach for several miles in both directions and concluded that Perry's is one of the few motels that hasrooms with direct ocean front view. Most motels are built perpendicular to the ocean and the room face the building next door and/or their parking lot. Because Perry's faces the ocean, I rated the overall experience higher than I would have based on the quality of the room. There is a fine line between old and dirty. I didn't find anything glaringly dirty, but the dingy old tiles in the bathroom and the old formica didn't have a shiny, clean appearance (although I am sure it was clean). I am recommending this motel with hesitancy--to those who want a large ocean front room for a reasonable price--and keep your expectations low (it definitely is not a Westin, Hyatt or Four Seasons!) We drove 1 hour north to St. Augustine and enjoyed a trolley tour of the city. A great side trip. I wasn't impressed with Daytona--too many tee shirt shops, fried food and nothing to do other than hang out on the beach. Won't be returning to Daytona.

We rented two rooms in the North Tower from July 10th through July 14th. We have stayed at Perry's probably 10 - 12 times over the last dozen years. We almost always visit during the busy summer months so we can enjoy the ocean water and outdoor pools. We have NEVER needed to change rooms or had problems parking. Although parking does get tight during peak periods. During our most recent stay (second time in N. Tower) our room was ready when we checked in around 2:00. Room has two queen beds and a fold out couch large enough for two small kids. Room includes regular size fridge, stove, oven and plenty of dishes for each day . Bathroom stocked with towels, soaps and lotions. Second vanity area with it's own sink and large mirror help make the room feel spacious. BEST part is the awesome view from the room along with it's private balcony overlooking the outdoor pool and beautiful Daytona Beach. Our balcony included a couple of chairs and small table. Still had plenty of room for our large ice chest and water toys. Room was serviced each morning with fresh towels, soaps, lotions and all dirty dishes were cleaned and put away. Other family members in the second room (right above ours, as we requested) was just as clean and spacious as ours with the same positive feedback. HOMEMADE donuts with coffee and juice (about 6-9 each morning) will start your day on the right track. Add some fruit and maybe a cereal bar and your good to go until lunch. A grocery store is located right across the street. The Tiki bar serves good burgers, ribs and cool drinks. Gift shop on site carries the basics you will need at the beach, swim wear, sunglasses, water toys, etc..VERY convenient if you lose your sunglasses to the Altantic Ocean like I did. Check out went fine with no problem charges. A couple of \"tips\" we have learned over the years, hope they help: 1. LET PERRYS KNOW YOU ARE RETURNING GUEST - they appreciate loyalty. 2. Plan early and reserve early. 3. Be specific in your room request. The N. Tower rooms have been redone and are worth the extra few bucks. 4. Perry's has a FAMILY atmoshphere and not for honeymooners or romantic getaways. 5. Stay away from slow elevators. Suggest staying on second or third floors. Still great views. 6.

I have always enjoyed it but this year I began to notice some changes: 1. My room in the North Tower at the price of $195.00 a night including taxes was a bit of let down. I do not think they are maintaining the place at the same level any more. First of all, I had a missing chair from my dining set. I was fed a line of bull the first time around. The second time around they scrounged around until the found me another chair. 2. The wood double seated chair on the balcony that has the table between was broken. The webbing was broken too and it was filthy with green mold. 3. The tub was not clean...there was hair in it when I got there and the trash can in the bathroom had not been emptied. 4. The elevator to the North Tower needs some serious work. It hesitates and is extremely slow. The stairwell stinks like someone urinated in there. It is just a shame because the concept of this place is wonderful. They are not keeping it up now. It is going down hill fast. The price for this place is not worth it anymore. 4. There was one ice tray in the fridge but they did send me two more. 5. What I am really mad about is the indoor pool. The chemicals were so strong that my 5 year old granddaughter broke out in a horrible rash with bumps. We had to seek out medication and two days later she still has the bumps. Also her skin is really dry and looks kind of white. Also, her hair was literally burnt. You could hear it crunch. She has such beautifully soft hair. The more I think about it the madder i get. In addition, the same thing happened to the 8 year daughter of my niece who was staying with in another room. Her rash came a day later.

If you're there to hit the beach, then you won't be moving your car much anyway. Many families take advantage of the in-room kitchens and patio grills, leaving the property to get more groceries. We just walked across the street to get our munchies at the grocery, but then we only stayed the weekend. We saw lots of coolers and picnics going on in the patio area. Burgers on the grills smelled good. We ordered pizza and had it delivered near the pool area. Those pizza delivery folks were busy Saturday night, but we got our Stavros pizza in 20 minutes. They are just a block away. Several other reviews commented on the great staff. They have a lot of staff and they were all so nice and working hard.

I was looking through Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz. Then I called the hotel to ask about amenities. I told them the best rate I got through Travelocity, and they immediately gave me a lower rate. the other advantages are (1) that I didn't have to pay more than one day in advance and the rest is when I check out which is better than travelocity which asks for the whole amount in advance, (2) that they gave me a king-bed room which was not available through Travelocity because the hotel has only few of these. - The check-in is as easy as it gets. -I booked oceanfront room and it was awesome. -The free internet access is convenient. -They have free donuts in the morning until 10 am. We ate there when we were not super hungry and we went to Denny's down the street when we were hungry. - It is located in a nice part of Daytona beach, not very crowded bot not deserted either. - We enjoyed the swimming pools which were always clean and warm. - There is a nice grocery store across the street and an awesome ice cream place two blocks further.

Our room while clean is not 3 star, its more like 2 or 2.5 star. Its out of date. When we first walked into the room, I immediately felt a sense of regret. We could have upgraded for a fee but just decided to just stay in the same room. I did get the opportunity to look into the ocean front rooms...they are much nicer. The north tower rooms have flat panel tvs and are bigger than the south tower rooms but otherwise both towers are equally up to date and clean. The front exterior of the hotel, hallways, and atrium area are all dated although maintained and clean- I would say they appear more like a 2 star hotel. On the other hand, the outdoor pool areas and the ocean front rooms deserve the hotel's 3 star rating. So, I would say if you are used to 3 or 4 star hotels/resorts and/or your home is up to date and you are used to that kind of environment, be sure that you choose an oceanfront room or else you wont be happy at this hotel. The good: ocean front rooms are up to date, outdoor pool areas very nice, Winn Dixie across the street, my kids liked the indoor pool, family atmosphere, if you're in to donuts they have free ones in the morning along with coffee and OJ, they have lots of friendly warm staff- all employees were great, there was plenty of sunning chairs on the grass and pool areas, The bad: no coffee in the room (I had a kitchen with utensils, a coffee pot, etc but no coffee), atrium rooms are out of date, hotel is out of date other than the ocean front rooms and outdoor pools, the fitness room is scary looking, the pool towels (located only in the indoor pool area by the way)are so small!! they are like hand towels and are rough, each person had to take 2 towels to dry off and the garbage can filled with new towels kept running out of towels.

A family-run, reasonably-price, family-friendly beach resort. Stumbled across this place on the internet when looking for a place to spend three days on the beach in Florida in March when we got good price on flights in Daytona Beach. Was sold on the idea of a room that opens right onto the indoor pool, plus amenities such as outdoor pools, beach front access, volleyball, shuffle board, putting green, boccie ball, etc. We were not disappointed. Had a second floor room with kitchen that opened onto a balcony overlooking indoor pool. Pool was warm and clean - son had a blast all day long in and out and up and down to room. Lots of lounge chairs around for adults to rest while kids have fun. Spa tub huge and hot - seems to be new. Outside activities free and accessible. Outside tiki bar small, but friendly and drink prices not outrageous. Found folks that had been coming back for 30+ years - some who had gotten married there and were coming back to celebrate. Some families that grew up going the Perry's and now bringing their kids back. Fresh, home-made donuts every morning. Laundry facilities on site. Restaurant on site for breakfast and lunch. Walking distance to local restaurants and a grocery store across the street. Free wi-fi access. Really did not dislike anything at all, except perhaps small, think towels in the bathrooms. But we could live with that! Have already booked for next year!", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Centre Hall, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAwesome \"Breakation\"! ...We DIDNT want to leave.

This was our first time at Perry's, and overall it was a great experience. This is an older hotel that's had a lot of upgrades and additions over the years. We found the staff friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, and maid service was fine. I only had one complaint. The website said that rooms had hair dryers in them, and they did not. So I looked like Medusa all weekend. Which was actually ok because I was on the back of a motorcycle all weekend anyway. But if the website says they have it and they don't, well......

We live on the other coast, and this is just a few hours drive to a nice getaway with the entire family.

Perry's had much more than a perfect location to offer. There are 2 outdoor,(not including the children's pool) and 1 indoor pool with a large jacuzzi. They have a few planned activities for the kids to do for a nominal fee each day. Outside there are gas grills for barbecuing and shuffleboard for those people staying longer. The complimentary homemade doughnuts in the morning are a real treat as well.

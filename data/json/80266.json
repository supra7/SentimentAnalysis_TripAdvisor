All tolerable except for the fact that the second morning of our stay - when we were finally allowed to eat breakfast on the rooftop, we were told that we had to join others at tables for 6 (only 4 were set up) or cram the 3 of us onto a tiny elevated cocktail table. All that would have been tolerable, had they not had all the other tables set up in the beautiful rooptop, stained glass windows etc. restaurant, which they were only allowing people to use part of! I thought it was extremely rude to deny guests a comfortable, private breakfast table when they were already enduring the mess of the re-model. After complaint on my part , we were give 1 nights free valet parking (A $15 value and there is plenty of free parking available on the street). Then they finally gifted us a \"20% off coupon for our next stay\" and only at my insistence gave each in the party a coupon. Also, breakfast service included dirty plates and 1 salt and pepper shaker that had to be shared by the entire room! We did see a newly remodeled room and none of us were big fans of the somewhat kitchy lavendar and silver color theme.

The Inn is right beside Balboa Park in the middle of Hillcrest, which is an ideal location for visiting all of the Balboa Park attractions. The property has a roof-top terrace with 360 degree panoramic view of the city; the rooms are very large, with high vaulted ceilings and apartment-style layouts, with kitchens, living rooms, etc. The lobby and restaurants are all top-notch (albeit a little dated, until renovations are complete). The entire property is undergoing a remodeling, having recently been acquired by Shell Properties. Shell is investing in upgrades that will restore and enhance the property. The new suites are stunning. We are delighted that Shell has acquired this property and are pleased that Shell is retaining the character and charm that this property has sustained, but is giving her a new look that reflects the property's origination, with modern enhancement. We arrived, pleasantly surprised by the elegant quality-service of the staff, to enjoy the Friday evening happy hour on the rooftop, which was like stepping back in time to the gay roaring 20's. It was fun to see the twinkling lights of the city among the locals who were enjoying generous libations served by vivacious bartenders. We dined in style at the restaurant that not only presents a well-rounded continental menu, but also offers entertainment each night by local musicians. The singer we heard was superb - singing jazz and playing piano. He took us back-in-time to the Sinatra era with songs like, \"Come Fly With Me,\" and everyone in the bar joined in singing, making it a a rousing dinner experience. We dined on crisp calamari, a very generous plate with honey-mustard and the traditional marinara sauce; slow-cooked ribs with vegetables and mashed potatoes; and a French-dip roast beef sandwich. We complimented our dinner with tasty cocktails - like a pear mojito with muddled mint and fresh pear. We will come back to this property again and again.

I went to reception and spoke to Rob who checked us in and said, that I booked a room with a kitchenette and he replied 'we are doing up the rooms and that the room we were in was a room with a kitchenette'. I was tired and annoyed so I went back to my room, and on arrival back in my room, the phone rang, and it was Rob telling me that they were going to change our room in the morning and give us a room with a bigger kitchenette, as there were none available that evening. I wasn't happy that he lied to me as 110 is not a room with a kitchenette. The next morning it was dealt with and we packed up our luggage and at some point during the day our luggage was moved to our new room, which which handled very well.

I would say that the staff at the hotel were very good, and I was very impressed with Robin the lady from reception, she was very helpful.

I spend a good part of the day trying to find a good hotel for good value using a plethora of travel site. I ran across this hotel since I filtered valet and parking for less than $30( it seems the norm in SD is having $35-60 a night valet). Even for hotels who have outside parking lots.. So after a long exhausting search I found this place. It seemed like a great place from the reviews I read. Since we were going to be there 4 nights I went to the property website and they actually had a special stay 4 nights and get the 4th one for free. So it came out to about $120 bucks a night, A steal for this area. We got to the hotel and were greeting by a very professional valet and front desk representative. The rooms are very vintage and swanky. We are simple people and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the most lavish of amenities and we actually appreciated the old school feel of the rooms, and bathrooms. The beds were amazing (and huge, I'm 6'3 230 Plus) and after all the running around we did in the city for 4 days we had no problems passing out. We had a king size suite on the second floor facing the valet parking lot. Noise levels at night were fine and we slept with the windows open to let the cool breeze in the room. We complimentary breakfast in the morning is on top of the restaurant with breath taking views of balboa park and you can see clear into the city, airport, and Coronado on a clear day. We utilized this pretty much every morning and the menu'd food was very filling especially for touristy duty. Very good selection for the price. The restaurant bar and lounge is great, Friday and weekend nights they have a Piano playing and someone singing, or someone can take a stab at karaoke. The food was amazing as well. We decided to head here toward the tail end of the trip as we were tired and just wanted to wind down with some wine and good company. I think what we loved the most about the hotel was the location to everything and how quiet it was around the hotel. It was literally no more than a 10 min cab ride to anywhere of interest in the Gaslamp district. We had a rental car but we used cabs more than anything. I think we spend on average 25 bucks roundtrip to get to all the restaurants/ bars etc for the nights we met up with friends etc. Living in Sacramento and frequenting SF/ Bay Area regularly we love cabs especially with parking and the frustrations with that. We loved the Inn At the Park so Much we decided to have the wedding party and close family stay here during the wedding. With the roomy 2 bedrooms suites with kitchenettes we figured this would be a great place for family to stay for 4 days plus since if they decide to not eat out they can cook foods and etc. We also will stay here whenever we come to San Diego. Like I said we have stayed at 5 star hotels, the W's, etc and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always get that feel that they are happy you are here, we feel like cattle get you in and get you out. Here we actually felt like we were welcomed and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want us to leave.

The only solution -- air out the room by opening all the windows. Please note: no AC in the room. Since I was on the first floor, the opening of the windows increased the noise level in the room due to traffic, requiring me to up the volume on the aged TV to nearly maximum levels to hear the program. The room was quite large, but was in need of some major renovation. The carpet was worn and dirty, the bathroom outdated, and the furniture (couch, chairs) were uncomfortable and seemed to come from a garage sale. On the plus side: the bed was large and comfortable, and there was a large amount of storage for clothes, and there was never a hesitation in getting hot water in the shower. Upon checkout I was informed that they are in the process of renovating the entire hotel, expected completion date of June 2012. Breakfast was typical continental and not bad for being inclusive. Hot breakfast items were available for about $7. NOTE: breakfast is not available until 7:00 a.m. and you can not get to the top floor until they activate the elevator! The staff was very friendly, especially the valet gentlemen. The room rate was good for the area (about $125/night) but add in the taxes and $15/night for parking and I wonder if there weren't more reasonable locations.

I would suggest getting a paper copy if you really need the bill as you can not verify the detailed charges without it.

The water pressure in the shower was really good and the bed was very comfortable.[not too soft and not too hard] Parking was free and even though the lot was full one night street parking was easy. The Bad The entire interior of the hotel from the rooms to the rooftop ballroom are very dated and need to be redone The radiator heating system is very noisy at times, as was street noise and noise from the cleaning staff in the hallway. My biggest complaint was our room had an adjoining door to another room and on the second night of our stay guests moved into this room. The lack of privacy between the rooms was very invasive as you could hear every word said by the people in the next room. It was as if they moved into your room.

I will say that there are several areas that could be updated a little but quite frankly, I think if it changed too much it might alter the quaint, comfortable appeal the hotel has now. The service was great, everyone was extremely friendly. The free wireless internet worked really well and I never had any problems. One of the BEST part of our stay was the locale near The Hillcrest area and of course Balboa Park which is literally across the street. As for my one bedroom suite, I LOVED it and could have lived in that space indefinitely. The beds were amazingly comfortable and all the windows opened which was nice because the fresh air was great. My bathroom had been updated (the front desk told me they had remodeled many of the bathrooms and were working on all of them eventually). Housekeeping was great, they were in there immediately upon calling down for cleaning and one day I left for an hour and they had already come in on their own.

The hotel is in the Hillcrest area, which is filled with wonderful restaurants. The hotel itself is gorgeous on the outside. The lobby is inviting. The staff were kind and helptful.

So, the Park Manor looked wonderful on the website. But, when we got there and arrived in our room, we were greatly let down! The tiny bathroom had tried paint spots on the floor. The living area had a large piano in it with a clamp on it. The bench was shoved to the side. It appeared as if it were being stored there? The furniture wasn't antique; but rather, it looked collected from local garage sales. We felt dooped by the web pictures and presentation! We began trying to find another hotel right away! The hotel manager herself showed us two other rooms, before we chose one that we could tolerate for four nights. We will say that she TRIED to accommodate us. We just didn't care for the rooms. I felt like I was back in college, living in my studio efficiency with donated furnishings and cheap wall hangings. The WORST part, aside from an uncomfortable mattress and pillow, was the STREET NOISE. When we were there, it was warm, so much so that we needed air circulation. The hotel rooms don't have AC. We stopped counting how many sirens went by, how many late-night conversations we were privy to, and the number of trash trucks, etc. kept us awake! Our vacation of rest didn't turn out that way! We left tired and irritable. We wish we could say the free continental breakfast was better, but it wasn't. The juices were cool at best. The fresh fruit sat atop (and stuck to) a paper doily. Fruit flies attacked the pastries. After two mornings of this, we began to find breakfast elsewhere. Free internet in a \"business room\" was provided. However, one day we had to wait two hours to be allowed entrance due to a meeting in the same room. We were trying to get travel info, and we were held up.

I had booked what I thought would be a romantic meal on the Sunday night at the Inn on the Park due to it being advertised as having a musical night with guest singers.Imagine my surprise when on entering the restaurant the place was 95% full of gay males all over the age of 40. There was no notification that this was a 'GAY' night and we had to watch males dancing, groping and kissing each other whilst eating which was not the type of entertainment that I expected to see. This is obviously a regular occurrence as a lot of the males were known by 1st name turns by the waiters and the singers. So if you book a meal at the Inn on the Park and you are not gay you might want to ask who the clientel are before booking.

Management decided to switch to a regular hotel many years ago. This gem of an old-world lodging is not for those requiring cookie-cutter, hermetically-sealed, corporate tiny boxes. It is for anyone who seeks excellent service, quirky charm, fabulous location, wonderful food, and a place to stay that can be a destination in itself. Yes, there is no air conditioning. This is San Diego; open the windows, turn on the silent and efficient ceiling fans, if you need to, and enjoy the fresh air. The steam heat is more than sufficient to warm the rooms if you need heat in the cooler months. My first stay in late Spring '06 revealed a warm room that cooled down in minutes once the windows were opened. I've not been in the same room twice in three more visits over the past three years and my experience was the same each time. My spouse and I were married here in '08 and the other five members of our wedding party all stayed here. Each room is a unique decorating experience with an eclectic blend of vintage or antique furniture including pieces the former owner collected throughout his lifetime and spread throughout the hotel. Our small, intimate wedding dinner was given the same high level of care and attention to detail as the large weddings held in the penthouse the same weekend. The food was exquisite, the service extremely professional, and everything from the flowers to the cake to the complimentary bottle of sparkling cider in our room after the wedding dinner was perfect. (We are non-drinkers, so our preference was honored. Sparkling wine or champagne would be the standard fare, we were told.) My spouse and I returned last spring for a getaway weekend and were pleasantly surprised that the staff remembered our names and greeted us like old friends. I've noticed this do this with all their guests and thus is revealed a high level of training, competence, and professionalism; not always present in either less-pricey or more-pricey corporate travel boxes. Our getaway was spent enjoying some of the wonderful Balboa Park museums and the Hillcrest neighborhood. Hillcrest is also eclectic, welcoming, and full of great restaurants and shops for every taste. Oh, yeah, it's the \"gay\" neighborhood, whatever that means anymore. Walk around, enjoy the park, take in the local color, find cuisine from Afgani to traditional delicatessen, from sushi to down home comfort food, and coffeehouses that aren't cut from the Seattle cloth (although there is indeed a Starbucks if you require homogeneity in your caffeine delivery system). The complimentary breakfast on the rooftop is more than enough to get you started and includes views of the city down to the harbor and over Balboa Park and Hillcrest. Bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, juices, and coffee are among your choices to accompany the bracing dose of fresh air in the morning. The wifi worked perfectly; no drops, delays, or glitches. I teach online courses and was able to accomplish my daily postings, grades, comments, and email without a hitch; access to one school's VPN was flawless, as well. We returned for an anniversary weekend with my maid of honor and her husband this fall. We shared a two bedroom suite. One room had a balcony, one did not, but each room was spacious with a king bed that was very comfortable. The only real challenge came in sharing one bathroom, but reasonable people can always work this out. The bathrooms are small in this hotel, but how much room does one really need? I prefer the spacious living room, bedrooms, and kitchen to a cavernous bathroom, anyway. We have already reserved our suite for next year. At the time of our wedding, I required a cane to walk (post-cycle crash). I had no difficulty getting around and would recommend this hotel to both seniors and people with disabilities. Yes, the building is old. Whatever. But, it is in good repair and is truly unique. It has a history and sense of place that the chain travel boxes will never possess. If you prefer the aromas of outgassing plastics, glues, and other synthetics to fresh air, then stay in a corporate chain hotel and breathe deeply. We prefer the fresh air this old building lets us let in or not, out choice, not some accountant's. The old-school piano bar is a treat. It is not unusual for patrons to join in whether they can sing or not. If you want high polish and glitz, go to Vegas. This is one of many neighborhood bars with all that means. When we were here for our wedding dinner, the pianist/singer stopped by our party to solicit requests which started off her next set. Our response to the pianist's inquiry about special occasions this year was greeted with applause and offers for drinks from the regulars. It was just one more feather in the cap of this very unique, hidden secret of a hotel as hotel lounges or bars are far too often joyless, dreary places. To sum up, the Park Manor retains the ambience and charm that hotels provided in gentler times past; when travel was more arduous than it usually is today and when people routinely lived in hotels. It is a reminder that San Diego's year-round climate has always been an enormous part of its appeal and that we can live quite well without stomping about with enormous carbon footprints. As a place to jump off to the rest of your San Diego adventure, it is unique, welcoming, professional, and very calming.

This is okay because San Diego weather is very temperate, but you will let in a lot of street noise (like the garbage pick up in the morning!). The room may be hot the first night if it has been closed up before your arrival (it was for us). The suite we had was roomy with a small kitchen. The bath was okay, but with the shower, sink, and toilet all in one room, it took some shuffling for two people to get ready. The breakfast was sufficient with fruit and bagels, cereal and yogurt, coffee, tea, and juice. I've seen better and worse and this was fine. Can't comment on the restaurant since we never ate there. The hotel is adjacent to Balboa park along 6th street and about 3.5 miles from the airport - an easy drive. Sixth street is the ambulance route, so expect 1 - 2 siren runs each day/evening. The S.D. Zoo and a large number of musuems are in Balboa park, so you can spend a lot of time there. The Zoo is a good mile walk, maybe a bit more. Carry your own water bottle. You should know that the Hillcrest area where the hotel is located is the GAY community section of S.D. You will find the \"friendly\" hotel staff (they really are) leans in that direction and you will encounter gay couples as well as straight people at the hotel. If that bothers you, then I suggest you look for another location. A local straight friend (male) says he gets hit on regularly in the area. The hotel probably does more business as a leisure hotel on weekends because it did not appear to be full of business travelers during the week. It is not convenient to the business district.

I booked a 2 Queen suite for two adults and two teens. My parents, brother, sister and her family also stayed there in separate rooms. I picked this place because of location, large room size, and the full kitchen. These were all big pluses. LOCATION: The manor is located directly across from the balboa park. We walked to the museums and the zoo. It took about ten to 15 minutes to get to the museums , and another 5 minutes to get to the zoo. The walk was too long for my parents, and they drove. Park Manor Suites is close to great restaurants in the Hillcrest area and also close to downtown--without the downtown prices. ROOM SIZE, FURNISHINGS etc: The suites are over 500 sq feet with lots of drawers and closet space. We really liked the extra space. The one bedrooms are around 750 sq ft. The beds were comfortable, no one in my family had any complaints. There was peeling paint in a couple places in our room. KITCHEN: We had a full kitchen-- gas stove w/ four burners, full size refrigerator freezer, microwave and table w/ three chairs. Everything worked. We also had lot of cupboard space, which was nice. The kitchen is furnished with pots, pans, flatwear and a few utensils. It is fine for preparing simple meals. The manor was built in the 20s, and this shows most in the kitchen. The manor is located about a mile from a big supermarket and a trader joes. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was a typical expanded continental breakfast: 4 types of cold cereal, fruit juices, yogurt, fresh fruit, bagels and cream cheese, instant oatmeal packets, hot chocolate, tea, and coffee,--no eggs or waffle maker. The breakfast room has a great view of the City. PARKING: Parking was included and we were always able to find a spot except for one night when my sister had to park on the street half a block away. We did not stay out late, and were back by 9:00 about everynight. Parking may be more of a problem for late arriving guests. GENERAL COMMENTS: Everyone in our group seemed fairly happy with the rooms. There were a couple complaints: 1) no way to adjust the temperature for personal comfort level because of central heating. 2) You can hear sirens from time to time, but not while we slept. There is a computer room for guests, which my teen liked. I used it to print off boarding passes. The staff was wonderful. Originally, I was not going to stay at the manor because their website shows prices jump up for the week end. Because my sister and I each stayed a week, they charged us the regular nightly rate on the weekend but we needed to book my phone.

We immediately opened all the windows and enjoyed the fantastic San Diego weather. The room is definitely old as others have commented previously, but the subtle nuances of a historic place such as Park Manor Suites draw your eye more than the somewhat shabby carpets! I do enjoy vintage items and perhaps that's what allowed me to cast a not-so-critical view on the entire place. The continental breakfast every morning at the top of the hotel provided ample sustenance and beautiful scenery. I was wowed every time we stepped out to enjoy our bagel, fruit, and coffee! The hotel sits on the edge of Balboa Park and though you can hop on a trolley to take you into the main area of the park, my boyfriend and I prefered to explore by foot and found the walk to be more than doable and the views stunning.

The hotel is a mix of good, and not so good so I'll try to give both sides. First, we stayed during a period of warmer than usual October temperature (80 F / 26 C) so the most apparent downside to staying at the hotel was the lack of air conditioning. We were on vacation with friends so we occupied a 2-bedroom suite (which had 2 king beds, a balcony overlooking the park, a queen-sized sofa bed in the living room, a dining room and a kitchen. There were 3 TVs but we never turned them on (too busy). Our friends stayed in a 1-bedroom suite which had similar features but in place of the sofa bed was a standard sofa plus there was a \"murphy' bed (fold out bed, that was stored in a compartment in the wall in the living room. Both our rooms had whisper-quiet ceiling fans that did an excellent job of keeping the rooms at a comfortable temperature during the day. When I went to sleep, however, I turned my ceiling fan off (since the breeze from it was disturbing me in bed). There was a different fan (mounted on a pedestal) that was in the closet that i could have used but I didn't bother. As it turned out, on all three nights, I awakened in the morning with a \"soggy pillow\" (so to speak) as the temperature had risen a little during the night (probably from the heat rising from the lower floors of the building -- we were near the top). I could have plugged in the pedestal fan on subsequent nights but I didn't bother -- so, it's up to you. All in all, it wasn't a huge problem. The only other negatives would be that the baths and kitchens are showing some wear. The room was immaculate but the kitchen cabinet doors were a little warped in places, the grout/caulk in the tub had small areas with a little bit of black on them (as someone involved in property management, I can tell you that it's difficult to remove these types of black marks once they \"set in\"). In addition, there was an occasional rusty spot on some of the old hardware. To me, I didn't consider the room \"dirty\" because of these small stains but i know there are some that would feel differently. The decor was pleasant, if not a little quirky in places. We noticed a couple of prints in one corner of the living room depicting a woman and a goose in a rather unconventional pose. (Don't get me wrong. It wasn't licentious -- just a little strange! I think they called it \"art\" in the 1920s/1930s. Our 2-bedroom suite had large rooms: both bedrooms had king beds. There was a sofa and a couple of wing chairs in the living room and the dining room had a table and 4 chairs. The balcony overlooking the park was small (you could stand maybe 2 people) but it was a lovely view. The kitchen had a stove, microwave and refrigerator. I can''t say enough about how great the service was. We were three friends coming from 3 different cities, arriving at three different times and the hotel was great at recommending appropriate room sizes, getting us oriented, suggesting restaurants, etc. Especially outstanding was Joe at the front desk/reception. There was a business center with a PC that you could use at no charge. The rooftop (7th floor) was a restaurant / meeting room / dual balcony areas where complimentary breakfast was served (great views) as well as lunch (extra charge). There is a Friday night party between 5 pm and 10 pm that is open to the guests as well as the public. The hotel does not advertise the party but it is well-known and has been going on for years. It is mostly attended by gay people in the city but my friends and I (as well as other guests we spoke to) felt perfectly comfortable at the party. It takes place on the northeast patio of the roof as well as in the inside penthouse meeting room so there are spectacular views. My \"alcohol heavy\" mixed drink cost $6 -- a buy. (I'm told that the bartender at the outdoor patio bar pours the stiffer drinks; I guess I got lucky). My friends and I both had rental cars and we had no problem parking in the parking lot (included) even on Friday evening during the party. The parking area is NOT open to the public (in spite of a prior reviewer's allusion to the contrary) but the hotel did explain to us when we checked in that there are not quite enough spaces for all of the rooms but since some people don't have cars it is unlikely that there would not be parking. In any event, except for Friday night, there appeared to be ample parking adjacent to the hotel. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. Literally steps to Balboa Park. There is a free tram that picks up every 15 minutes adjacent to the hotel that stops throughout the massive park. The Hillcrest neighborhood is within walking distance and has plenty of eating and drinking places. Getting to the airport is a snap (I did it a bunch of times, picking up and dropping off my friends). You just drive south on Park to Laurel, turn right and take it to the end. (About 10 minutes) We got to the Wild Animal Park, Pacific Beach and Coronado Island with no difficulty. There is a piano bar and restaurant on the lower level (below the lobby, a tiny bit below street level). We didn't eat there but we heard good things from other guests.

It was an apartment building built in 1926. It has been converted to a hotel. The location by Balboa Park is convenient to park attractions with a trolley to the park only a short two block walk away. With a car many attractions are within a couple of miles - downtown, Mission Valley, Fashion Valley, Hillcrest, SeaWorld, Airport, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach. The rooms are large OLD apartments with some nice furniture. We had a one bedroom suite. The living room must have been 20' x 12' with a couch, 2 wingbacks a coffee table, Secretary chest,, Murphy bed (double) and sofa table; the kitchen was small with stove, microwave and old refridgerator in need of defrosting, and a table with four chairs; the bedroom was about 10 x 12 , King bed that was substandard, with a separate dressing room and lots of closet space; the spmall period bathroom was in dire need of attention: a bit of mildew, missing sealant, poor toilet mechanism and venetiona miniblinds in the shower window, which ws not frosted; a period bathroom brought into this decade in quality and maintenance would be nice - this was not. If you don't mind an old apartment this could be a great place to stay for an extended stay. A family would enjoy the extra room, kitchen and living space. The biggest drawback is a lack of air conditioning - after all this is in a desert. This required that we keep our windows open, which alllowed the noise of slowly departing drunks to disturb our 10PM bedtime. The heat appears to be old radiators. I'm sorry for not taking pictures, as it would hlep you all a lot. Be aware that this hotel is a gathering place for gay me especially on the weekend. It may be too much for conservative tastes. Parking is free, a plus in most city hotels these days. The staff was very friendly and helpful. For someone desiring a lot of room with low cost this presents a good value as long as your willing to accept the time warp back to my grandmother;s apartment. Daily compimentary continental breakfast on the top floor, a former penthouse, begins at 0730. To bring this wonderful old building into the 21st century would require a drastic gutting (but please preserve the great lobby!) and refitting and finishing.

Food: They have 2 restaurants - a rooftop patio which serves free continental breakfast and (not free) lunch. We did the breakfast most mornings - it has the usual continental breakfast fare. The food is fine, the view is better. The other dining option is a piano bar on the main floor. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an excellent dinner and I'd highly recommend it.

Its directly across from Balboa Park, which takes at least 2 days to walk through and includes many museums & the San Diego Zoo. You can also walk to Gaslamp district and the Hillcrest community; both have great restaurants, shopping and night life. We rented a car but found that we could have easily just walked to all of our tourist location from the hotel. Cautions: There is no air conditioning. We were in San Diego during some fairly warm weather and it wasn't a problem since there are multiple windows and a ceiling fan. Also parking is tight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we found a spot each every day but I think we got lucky. Parking did fill up each night. Overall, we had a great time at the Park Manor Suites.

Let me just turn to some other's comments that stick in my mind. The location is fine if one has a car. Naturally it can be reached by taxi. Once there it was possible to walk to a busy area around Sixth and University. From there one could take buses that connect with the city's good transportation system. I must admit I drove to Old Town where I could park free all day, and from there I could take trolleys even to the Mexican border, to Petco ballpark or other areas around the city. If you are unfamiliar with San Diego and driving I would recommend a GPS system will be very helpful in getting around. The complimentary breakfast is very good. I actually went away feeling I had overeaten. There was cereal, juices, fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, sweet rolls, bagels, English muffins, coffee, milk and other things I have forgotten. The view from the top of the hotel where breakfast is served was very pleasant. If the hotel is rather full then parking at night in the hotel lot can be problematic, but there are many available spots on the streets right around the hotel. The presentation of the food in the restaurant is first rate, and my dinner of prime rib was good, but I somehow felt I was in the hands of a young chef who was trying very hard... The room was spotless, including the kitchen. The bed was perfect. The couch was a tad thread-worn on one pillow (I must find something negative, right?). The Wifi in the room was a bit weak at times, yet I could always get on-line.

We found the reviews herein to be quite accurate and very informative. Essentially, the hotel is older and is a \"character\" or heritage-style property. If you are seeking modern, sleek accommodations - this is not it. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, however they are a bit dated or \"tired\" and rather old. Think of it as staying at Grandma's for a few days - out of date but comfy and functional! The service is quite reasonable - we never lacked for anything we requested and found the staff all to be pleasant and welcoming. Parking is limited and could be a real challenge in late evening. However, we always found a spot (squeezing in some tight spots the couple times we were back late). They are open about this and the reviews all mention it so take this into account if it's an issue for you. The property is conveniently located, close to downtown, Balboa Park (we walked to the Zoo w/ stroller). Breakfast was fine for us - bagels, pastries, fruit, cereal, juices, coffee/tea, etc. If you were there for weeks it might get boring but we liked it. I've read reviews where people complain (no omlettes etc.) and I simply say - if you want that you end up paying for it so go to the $200 a night places to get your darn omlette station! American travellers tend to be a bit food obsessed anyway, so take those reviews with a grain of salt! It's a functional breakfast and if you need more - you probably ought to think about dieting! This is not meant to insult, rather a commentary on the obscene portion sizes in the States. It's no wonder there is an obesity epedemic!! There is no a/c (we knew that in advance) but it was not an issue at all. The ceiling fan works well enough and it was never an issue the whole week we were there (and I'm a Canadian who struggles iniitally in humid heat!). If you are a conservative American, typical Republican, or \"redneck\" - consider staying elsewhere! This is a gay-friendly property and you will encounter homosexual guests and/or staff. It was totally fine with us (it's not contagious people:), but again, if you have an issue with this don't [--] that nobody warned you! We weren't the only family there either - this hotel is great for budget conscious families who need space and would rather spend $$ on fun than on a fancy hotel. All in all, you get what you pay for - and considering the excessive hotel prices in San Diego , the Park Manor is a great value for the dollar.

Working in the hospitality industry for over ten years I completely understood. Within minutes of arriving and calling, we received a call back letting us know that there was a room available right away. After breakfast with the friends and their kids we checked in... Now the photos online do not do the hotel justice. A hotel built nearly 100yrs ago was dilapidated apartment building transformed into a kitschy, luxurious and affordable hotel during the 70's.

The kitchenette was a nice feature of which we would've gladly taken advantage of a little more than we did if we had stayed longer. One thing that did scare me when booking was the lack of a/c in the room - turns out it wasn't even needed!

My holiday here was great. We arrived very tired after an exhausting journey that included flying to Tijuana, walking in the desert, crossing the border by foot and then taking one hour (!) for a bus to transport us 20 blocks to the hotel. The location is decidedly not centric: for under-21s like us you do have to walk, buses are scarce, and maybe you can't just walk out and find a huge scene. Yet the hotel was an oasis: the lobby, with its old-world elegance was almost surreal. Check-in was quick but the staff couldn't find us an under-21 car to rent. Once there, we just smiled and jumped when seeing the room. The beds were huge, with very generous and 'puffy' bedding and extremely comfortable. The room didn't have A/C but, even in very hot weather, we found we preferred it that way (the fan more than sufficed). This hotel has modernity where it's needed. As opposed to the supposedly very XXIst Century W chain, here you get free at-room Wi-Fi access with zero hassle: no password, no key, no nothing. Quality was good enough to call home by Skype every day. We had a small kitchenette; it could have used a dusting but it was all such a piece of Americana memorabilia that you couldn't believe it. It was great to just bring over leftovers from huge American-size servings and then heat up 'at home'. Staff was always attentive and nice. The bathroom wasn't the newest but was comfortable. We had a walk-in closet in a normal room! View wasn't precisely great (parking lot) but was countered by the great sights during breakfast. Breakfast was served at the top floor. The view was great and you could sit in a very agreeable terrace; the buffet could have been better attended and one of the two toasting machines didn't work throughout our stay. But the food was very good, with excellent onion bagels and generally well stocked. There was also a breakfast venue in front with delicious Mexican and American fare, served very abundantly. For transportation there were some bus lines downtown, we checked online before leaving to make sure everything matched. We rented a bicycle and it was a truly memorable experience! There's also free parking for both cars and bicycles, right next to the main door. We didn't have a chance to try the restaurant. The decoration is just amazing, and I can't really express the feeling and ambiance in this great hotel. Avoid if you need a sterile room that's been half-made in China. All the little details were astounding, and even more so when you realise they are all authentic.

The bathrooms could use some upgrading and are small, but functional. The mattresses are definately on the firm side, but not uncomfortable. The kitchen and dining room are more than adequate and the living room is large and spacious, with plenty of seating room. There are plenty of closets. The area is safe and easy to walk. We walked to dinner and back most nights at some of the restaurants in Hillcrest. The breakfast was generous with a nice view of the city. Although the parking lot is small, I had no problem parking each time I returned to the hotel. The bar is very small and delightful with a live piano player an singer almost every night. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant, because I am into trying the variety around town, but the restaurant is adjacent to the bar and seemed to be very nice as well. On Friday evenings there is a rooftop gay coctail party from 5 until 10 pm. Happy Hour prices are very low and the crowd is very enthusiastic. It is one of the most enjoyable events I have attended.

As I admired the complete and full sized kitchen and the kids sunk in to the comfortable furniture, my husband marveled at the fact that the windows actually opened. The suite was huge, as hotel rooms go. The separate bedroom alone was larger than our previous hotel room. Some reviewers have complained about the plumbing and such but, heck, it's a hundred years old! Personally, we loved the old world ambiance and imagined the buggies pulling up in front and unloading their steamer trunks. Aspects that might seem distasteful or in disrepair in newer hotels gave this hotel it's character. We easily cooked all our meals in the kitchen, saving big bucks for a family. The maid service was impecable, even putting away our dishes that were left out to dry and arranging our children's stuffed animals on their beds. The location was perfect for Sea World and the Zoo.

Before I left Austin, Texas, I called the hotel to make certain that the accommodations were going to suit my needs. Kelli, an extremely amiable front desk clerk, listened very carefully to my requests, and I was later shocked to find that my expectations were far below the wonderful reality that she had waiting for me. Built in the mid-1920s, the hotel is adjacent to Balboa Park, and reflects the elegance of the era. Great care has been taken to preserve the art-deco European style of the establishment, and it abounds with large gilt mirrors, marble floors, bronze statues, and period furniture. The roof has a restaurant, whose atmosphere is reminiscent of the Queen Mary, with cuisine to rival. The entire rooftop, surrounded with twinkling lights, is dedicated to the gourmand, and has a happy hour every Friday night, whose local and tourist/sightseeing clientele understands the meaning of fun, food, acceptable behaviour, and value. The rooftop restaurant provides a charming Continental breakfast every morning for guests, and ground floor has a pub open daily to the public. My room looked like something from a 'Travel Europe in Style' guide book. I had chosen a mini-suite with two double beds; but was amazed to find - in addition to a bed-sitting room - a full kitchen, a dining room, and a dressing room with a gigantic mirrored double-closet, dresser, dressing table, and an ironing board with iron. I must have taken 6 baths in 2 days in the oversized bathroom tub, soaking up to my neck in total relaxation. (And believe me, after the stress of the trip there and the impending functions I had to attend, I needed it!) Dwight, the front-desk guest services manager, was attuned to my every need, and greeted me by name, as does the rest of the staff with all guests. The perfect man for the position he holds, he personally insured that every possible accommodation be made to make my stay at the Park Manor as comfortable as possible. Area maps are available at the front desk, in order to provide guests with directions to personal rendezvous' or to nearby services. My reason for being in San Diego was to attend my son's wedding at the Japanese Friendship Garden in Balboa Park; but, to be honest, the Park Manor has given me reason to go back to San Diego... period. My friends and relatives, after seeing my hotel and my room, were horrified to think about what they were enduring at more well-know establishments (and paying more) when they could have stayed at the Park Manor, dined, relaxed, slept in luxurious comfort, AND have paid considerably less. I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a truly unique experience. This is not a cookie-cutter 'knock-off,' nor is it a 'trendy-for-now' establishment. After traveling all around the world (literally), I can honestly say that the Park Manor is the 'real thing', making a statement of its own, and making it well.

The architecture and decor are very reminiscent of the South's grand hotels, but on a much more intimate scale. The reception area is beautifully appointed and tastefully decorated, with an excellent restaurant and a comfortable club room and business center just off the lobby. I arrived two hours before the 3:00 PM check-in time, and was immediately shown to a beautifully decorated bedroom with all the amenities one would expect in a luxury hotel. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, the sitting area inviting, and the hotel very quiet. On Wednesday evenings, complimentary hot and cold appetizers, sweets and drinks are served in the club room, and offer an opportunity for mid-week refreshment and relaxation with live music. The staff members are friendly, helpful and responsive to every need, and free shuttle service is available within a 3-mile radius of the hotel. There is a small public garden and park across the street, and several excellent restaurants are within easy walking distance. The hotel is also easily accessible via public transportation - I took the DART to and from the airport (Love Field) for a total of $3.50. It's an elegant gem of a hotel in the heart of Dallas that you'll be very glad you discovered.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hurst", "Title": "\u201cMarch 30 and 31st Stay\u201d", "Author": "Regina R", "ReviewID": "UR127617094", "Content": "My daugher was married on March 31, 2012 at the Room on Main venue in downtown Dallas, Texas.

Very clean hotel, friendly and courteous staff. The beds were comfy and I slept like a happy, quiet, dead log every night. The hotel room that I had (2 queens) had almost no available floor space (see photo with review - sorry no natural light, daylight makes the room look MUCH brighter and cheerier) and the TV in the room was smaller than the monitor that I have on my desk - otherwise the room and furnishings were clean and everything worked properly. Interesting thing to note: there was no furniture in the room with drawers to store anything, and there wasn't any kind of rack to stow a suitcase. Closet space was provided in the bathroom with ample hangers so it really wan't an issue for me since I was flying solo on this trip. I would absolutely stay here again if traveling by myself. The combo of limited floor space and no storage makes me question how great it would be with 2 people in the room for a week. I can just see my wife and I bumping into each other like 2 of the 3 stooges (assuming all the rooms are similar)! Decent location: I walked to my business destination down in the Museum District in about 15 minutes each day. The hotel also provides a free shuttle that will drop off / pick up in a 3 mile radius. If you walk to/from this hotel to/from the west end, use Elm and avoid Pacific. Restaurant: Indigo has a dining area on the ground floor. By 7am each day they were pretty packed so get there at 6:30 when they open. On check-in I received coupons for breakfast and for a free drink at the bar each night (bonus!). Hot breakfast options were simple but very good for complimentary fare: eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, pancakes, oatmeal, etc. The service seems to take a little while to make it's way around. After the first day when no one came back to fill up water glasses and coffee (30 minutes in the restaurant), the next day I simply asked for 2 glasses of water the first time I saw the wait staff and it was fine. The gym was very small and limited, however - for $5 per day, I highly recommend that you simply take a 2 minute walk over the 2nd floor sky bridge to the Elevation gym and get yourself a day pass.

I was so disappointed in the cleanliness of the room: The light-switches were caked with grime, which came right off when I wiped with soap and water. There was a coffee cup with a crust of yellowish residue left near the coffee maker. The walls of the bathroom were dusted with sticky hairs from dozens of men shaving, and even the ceiling of the shower had hairs stuck to it. The mirror on the bathroom door was covered with smudges. The duvet bedding also had hairs of varying lengths from previous guests. There is nothing more unfriendly and depressing than a hotel room that is littered with organic material from prior occupants. I agree with some of the other comments that the walls are quite thin - I turned on the fan in the room to drown out the sound of TV and chatter from the adjacent room. The heat and cooling system was very good and it's nice to have wood floors. The towels were okay and the Aveda bath products were nice. They gave me three drink tickets and three coupons for $15 breakfast. I used the coupons to stock up on beverages in the morning and they also have a hot breakfast menu to order from. There was a manager's reception on Weds night with hors d'oevres, wine, beer, and soft drinks. There are several restaurants around the area, a 7-11, and Neiman Marcus is close by. This hotel has a lot of potential but they need to get the rooms clean. That is the foundation of any hotel property. I would rather stay in a clean room at Motel 6 than a filthy suite at the Ritz.

This time, I booked a regular double room and was pretty disappointed. First, we arrived on Friday night and had trouble valeting our car. The guy didn't seem to be in a hurry even though there were 3 cars in line for valet (we were car #3). Since we were checking in, we were told to wait for valet rather than handing off our keys at the front desk. We sat outside and waited our turn only to have the valet guy pass us up and go inside where he took the keys of the guy in line behind us. The valet staff on Saturday and Sunday were MUCH better (and professionally dressed while the valet guy on Friday night was not). My second complaint is that, on our first night, we received a phone call from the front desk stating that they had received a noise complaint on us. This was disturbing because we were honestly just sitting in our room discussing our plans for the next day. No TV, no radio. Just talking...without any laughter. We were informed that the walls were very thin. Later, we realized just how thin they were as we could hear entire conversations taking place in the hall. My last issue with this stay was the toilet. Every time it was flushed, it made a high pitched squealing noise. Other than those issues, the hotel is bright and cheerful. Beds are reasonably comfortable. Shower pressure is great. And they have a nice casual restaurant in the lobby.

They offered strawberries and champagne for the inconvenience of the room change, then were so late on the promised delivery time that we had to leave without them. I asked the front desk for a food recommendation for after the hockey game we were in town for, and she pulled out a large unorganized file box and told me to go through it and call places to see when they closed.

The walls, well, we could actually hear the conversations our neighbors had, normal conversations, not yelling! Paper thin walls. Gaps around all the doors so the light & noise comes in there too.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. My room (#1013) was right across from the elevator which worried me some as I didn't want to hear the noise all night long. Upon entering the room, I found that it was a suite. The living room area was actually quite large with a sofa and a love seat. A desk was against the far wall. Behind the door was a microwave and a sall refrigerator. The room was capped off with a flat screen TV and a wall of windows. There is nothing to the view from this room as you look out at other rooms. The entire unit has hardwood floors which was actually a nice touch. The bedroom is spacious with another flat screen TV. The clothes closet is in the bathroom along with an ironing board and several wood hangers. The shower and toilet is in a separate room. The shower has a removable handheld head. The shampoo, conditioner, and lotion are all Aveda. The bed is amazingly comfortable along with the bevy of great pillows. There were many mornings that I just wanted to stay in the bed. So much for the good, here's a few negatives. The noise from the elevator and noise in the hallway is very loud if you are in the living room. If you are in the bedroom with the door closed, the noise isn't noticeable. The A/C is digitally controlled by the panel in the bedroom. However, it is a little loud when it kicks on. It is also mounted in the roof above the shower. The shower had a strong sour smell the first three days I was there and the shower floor had a slimy feel every day. I can only hope that it was drainage from the A/C unit which had an open pipe right above the shower. You can tell that the building is old. All you have to do is look at the trim which is beat up and has been horribly painted over. The lobby is a comfortable place to relax. The Phi restaurant is also in the lobby along with a bar. However, the drink prices are very steep with a bottle of beer running $7 which is almost as much as an entree. The hotel is within walking distance of several restaurants on Main and Elm Streets. Many residents in the area take their dogs to the dog park which is directly across the street. The shuttle will take guests anywhere within a 3-mile radius which includes a Walmart and a Target store. The bellmen were great as was the shuttle driver.

The bedding is of a 1-2 star hotel quality - not 3-3.5 star. Sheratons, Marriotts, Hiltons and Hyatts have MUCH better beds. The Indigo did not have a down comforter but rather poor quality sheets and pillows, and a bedspread - not what I'd expect these days from a 3+ star hotel. I realize it sounds picky - but if you're used to a bed at a 3+ star hotel, this doesn't cut it. I'm a bit surprised that a fairly major chain would choose such haphazard design and poor materials. In addition, here's the deal with the cleaning (I stayed 2 nights); I had a note under my door that housekeeping tried to stop by around 9am, but I was still in the room with the do not disturb sign on. It said that if I wanted my room cleaned, to notify the front desk. All well and good. I did so when I left around 10:20am (notified the front desk I'd like my room made up). When I returned around 2:30, the room hadn't yet been cleaned, so when I left again around 3pm, I asked again to make sure my room was on the list to be cleaned. I was told by a different person that it would surely be done. When I returned again around 5:45pm, it was not yet cleaned. I left at 6:15pm and told that same person again that it hadn't been cleaned, and that I was leaving for a few hours and they assured me it would be cleaned. I returned about 11:15pm and it was not cleaned. I told another front desk person who finally sent up new towels and toiletries, and also took my phone # (I mistakenly assumed I might get a call from the manager because of this); I left the hotel at 4:30am the next morning to catch a flight - and have not heard from anyone. I realize I could have conserved towels and soap and shampoo, but again, at a 3.5 star rated hotel, I just expect that my room will be made up, new towels put in place, and frankly even when mistakes are made, a bit of responsiveness from hotel staff (THREE different people!)", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleton, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cDon't recommend\u201d", "Author": "NormanClan", "ReviewID": "UR122615629", "Content": "I stay here due to price and convenient location but the hotel is mediocre at best.

The hotel is cute and comfortable with a bar and restaurant and fitness center (which we did not use). Wireless is free and there is a nice lounge area downstairs with couches and a big screen TV. The hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants. Parking is valet only but there is a parking garage right across the street. A negative is there is no street parking which made drop off and pickup difficult since the girls had so much luggage and we simply could not schlep it down Main St. from the parking garage--my husband ended up having to illegally park on the street and rush in. Check in was smooth and friendly. There are several free (slow) computers for use in the lobby. The decor is all pastels but not garish--I thought it pretty but wondered what my husband would have thought of it. We chose a Queen Suite to sleep 4. I thought the room a little small and the big coffee table in front of the pullout sofa a nuisance. The tiny bathroom had 1 sink (but nice Aveda products). It wasn't exactly what I think of when I hear \"suite\" but it was cute and comfortable and had a microwave and fridge which was nice. The queen bed was comfortable and both the living area and bedroom had flat screen TVs--which were outdated, no HD and the one in the living area looked to be going out very soon. The bedroom had a private door--but it was hard to open and close and was so noisy we couldn't close it because if someone had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night it would have woken up everyone. The hotel itself was quiet though even though we were right by the elevator. The only noise was street noise which I got used to. Overall I would stay here again for this event as it was quiet and comfortable and in a good location. But I thought the rate high as there was no HD television or pool.

I was unfamilar with the Hotel Indigo brand but after the first night I was in love! I felt like I was on the beach- so it was a big let-down to walk outside and feel the cold November weather.The rooms were very clean beds extraordinarily comfortable. Probably my only complaint was that by being an older hotel, the room and bathroom were both pretty small. Not like anyone can change that, not without major renovations and some seroius knocking down of walls. Since I was sick due to the pregnancy, I was pretty confined to the room. I did however manage to check out the lobby which was large and also very beautiful. I also noticed a small bar/restaurant that looked pretty cozy.

This trip was my second trip to Dallas, and this time I was attending the \"Woman Thou Art Loosed\" conference at 'The Potter's House,' and was able to get a one bedroom hotel at a great price. I was very impressive by the style of my room; I love the painted background in the bedroom behind the headboard and the colors went together so beautifully. I was also happy to be able to plug in my Laptop & utilize the hotel's internet connection. I almost consider my room like a mini-apartment room, & I love the hardwood floors (so much better than dirty carpet). The only bad critique that I will give the hotel is concerning the valet guy on today (Sunday). I had just come from church, and I had to check out of the hotel asap...I didn't have any small bills to tip the valet guy (I had been tipping everyday for valet) to come upstairs with the cart to grab my luggage so I grabbed the cart myself and brought it upstairs to load my luggage myself. One of the valet guys saw me with the cart, but he didn't offer to help at all. Once I made it back downstairs, I guess he figured that I wouldn't tip him b/c I got my own bags, so (again) he didn't even offer to put my bags in my car!! I was appalled. He sat behind the little wooden stand just looking at a woman load up her car with luggage. I thought to myself that it's really sad that these valet guys will only move or operate off a tip, and not provide good customer service. When he saw the cart rolling towards my car, he ran and grabbed it, but at that point I was disgusted and thinking, \"It's too late to help now!\" Nevertheless, I enjoyed my room...it was peaceful & relaxing.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel for a weekend with the girls!\u201d", "Author": "kmnorton63", "ReviewID": "UR84329791", "Content": "My best friend and I decided to meet in Dallas for her birthday.

My first stay with the Hotel Indigo was in December 2006. The Hotel Indigo is located across the street from our Dallas Office and connected with an enclosed sky-bridge, making it especially convenient during inclement weather. Making a long story short, six months into my 3\u00c2\u00bd year venture, our Dallas office relocated four city blocks away and across the street from a four star hotel in direct competition with the Hotel Indigo. One would think that that is where I would be staying, particularly because of the new found conveniences and at no cost to me since my company picks up the tab. However, my loyalties belong to the Hotel Indigo. The entire staff is the friendliest I have ever encountered in my travels for both business and leisure. From my first stay in December 2006 though today they have all treated me like family. For example, in April 2007 I spent my first birthday away from home. To my surprise upon my return at the end of the work day from the office, the staff at the hotel greeted me at the front desk with a birthday card and my very favorite, chocolate cake. I was wowed off my feet at the pleasant surprise. I am affectionately referred as the Chicken Man. It has been my pleasure to return kindness with kindness, so whenever I arrive at the hotel on a Tuesday evening, I try my best to make a fried chicken run, my treat, for everyone. Fried Chicken is a fond childhood memory that I have. For years my dad worked two jobs and when he had a few extra bucks he bought fried chicken for dinner but only on Sundays. I can still recall those evenings when my brother, sisters, mom and dad sat around our 13\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd black and white television set watching the Ed Sullivan Show eating Church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fried Chicken. Well I have created new fond memories with the staff of the Hotel Indigo with lessons learned from my dad. Thanks Pop!

The Host Hotel was 'The Sheraton'(Big Box Hotel Chain). As a result, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting a good price on the room, and I decided to shop. I usually skeptical of lower priced hotels that are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Name Brand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but I decided to try Hotel Indigo. I actually was able to book my whole trip including air/hotel for less than it would have cost to stay at the host hotel. I must say I am delighted I was willing to try something new. The hotel has a stylish boutique design and feel, and the room was very cozy. Not to mention that the feel was different than any other hotel stay that I have ever had because of the Night Manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201cTrina- that checked me, and did whatever she could to make my stay the best. Now you may just think she was doing her job, but I felt as a hotel guest that she went the extra mile, and even made me feel like I was a local business that really appreciated my business. As a result she remembered my name, and kindly would inquire how my meetings for day were going, and if there was anything she could help me with. I know people say we are in a recession, but I believe we are in a period of weeding out, and survival of the fittest in our economy- It are businesses like the Hotel Indigo, that will build a reputation for being the best small and service oriented hotels, that will be in business and going strong for years to come as a result of taking care of their customers. Side Note- as I left the conference on Sunday, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice the long lines of people that stood impatiently waiting to check-out and check-in at the host hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Sheraton, and all I could do was laugh since I not only stayed at a better hotel- but It was by far best VALUE. If I ever have a conference again or know of someone coming to Dallas for business, and they want the best service, and best value to choose Hotel Indigo- and support the businesses that spur this economy! If you decide to stay there as a result of this review...Be sure to tell Trina, the Night Manager---That Mr. Lee reommended you stay there!", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Staff!

The Majestic Theatre is just around the corner, which is where the performance took place. We couldn't have picked a better hotel or location. Their entire staff was friendly, however, certain members really shined and certainly went well beyond what we expected or have ever experienced during our frequent travels. Gerardo at the front desk made us immediately feel welcomed, as did Trina and Katy. Each of them should be the envy of the numerous hotel chains in the downtown area. Hotel Indigo is fortunate to have a staff second to none who make their patrons feel like family instead of a room number. Early, who works in the restaurant as a bus boy is a true gentleman. He too went well out of his way, even to help us with the Valet parking procedure. His smile is infectious and matches his kind heart! In fact, that description fits each of these individuals, and seriously, they deserve top pay and then some! We absolutely will stay at Hotel Indigo again when we're back in Dallas. I would be willing to bet they'll remember us by name and give us the same 5-Star service once again! For example; Checkout time was 12-noon on Sunday, yet the Jesus Christ Superstar performance wasn't until 1pm. We didn't want to keep our luggage, laptop other valuables in our vehicle during the performance, nor did we really want to have to move our car to another parking garage. I spoke to Trina about this and she said they would be delighted to store our luggage, laptop and other items in a secure area, giving us a claim ticket for each bag. Furthermore, she said our vehicle was not a problem, and they would not require us to move it even after the checkout time. What a relief!

Didn't think much of Dallas overall but this hotel was great for the price. The rooms are very comfortable. The beachy decor is a little odd - I kinda felt like I was staying on Cape Cod rather than downtown Dallas but it's not offensive to the eye or anything and it grows on you the longer you stay :) Microwave and fridge in the room. Awesome shower! The beds face each other which is a new one for me. Not a problem except the TV was to the left between those 2 beds so if you are planning on staying in the room and watching TV from bed then this probably isn't the place for you unless you like having neck strain! But then again if you wanted to do that, you could just stay home! Loved the fact that there was a restaurant downstairs with reasonably priced food that served Starbuck's coffee. I would recommend the fruit trio. Avoid the eggs, not that great but my friend recommends the pancakes. The room service menu looked good and prices were cheap compared to other hotels I've stayed in but didn't get a chance to try it out unfortunately. Also highly recommended by my 2 friends is the Stirling merlot in the hotel bar. For those who need parking, there is a garage directly across from the main entrance. It costs about $5 in/out (or $10 depending on the cashier's mood!) and it was never even close to being full when we stayed. Staff at the Indigo were very helpful and friendly during our stay even mailing postcards at no cost for my friend when we were checking out. For a three star hotel in downtown Dallas, this is a really great option.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita Kansas", "Title": "\u201cVery cool and would stay again.\u201d", "Author": "Dinrbear", "ReviewID": "UR24700266", "Content": "The hotel was nice, clean and different.

This hotel is a good two blocks away but a world away in service and room amenties. Hot water was always available, no matter what time of day or night. The internet worked every time I tried to log on. The business center with two computers was available when I needed to print something. There was not an extra charge for using the printer nor the internet. The room was crammed with furniture but it was nice to have a sofa and a chair to sit on instead of only the bed. The decor was bright and cheery. The bed was perfect and the blanket was encased in sheets. The shower had a choice in spray type--hard, pulsing, or gentle. The staff was super friendly. I flew in early for the conference and dropped off my luggage at Hotel Indigo without a hitch. The East downtown transfer station is only one block away if you want to take the bus anywhere. I took the local bus from the airport to the hotel door for only $1.25. It sure beat waiting for the Super Shuttle to come or riding the van around and around the airport waiting on more customers before it left for downtown Dallas. Downside: I walked the two blocks from the Adams Mark to this hotel every time I wanted to go back to my room for something. The shuttle was available if I needed it which I did when I got caught in a downpour. There is only one restaurant in close proxiity for breakfast. At night, you need to take the bus or tram down to the West End to find food. Most everything closes at 3pm in this area for food. Make sure that you bring your walking shoes if you are going to attend a conference over at the Adams Mark. The distance from rooms to conference to food or bar is huge.

They also got us a fan, iron, ironing board, and glasses, at our request. The rooms were small, but very clean, no signs of any malodors or mold and mildew.

Free WiFi is always a perk, signal was nice and strong. Lastly despite being on the 3rd floor and sleeping with the window ajar (on the night New Years Eve no less) we fell asleep with no problem when we returned to our room at 3:00am :) The negatives, and for $89 (taxes & fees included) on NYE night in Philly this is REALLY nit-picking: Very small television (didn't even turn it on so who cares I don't go on vacation to watch TV, no individualized climate controls (temperature was fine in building once it was lowered), minimal bathroom counterspace (only stayed one night), no elevator (thankfully we're young and strong), no ice machine (this one was harder to adjust to but alas there is a bar downstairs where you could prolly get ice in a pinch.)

I booked this hotel - despite the sometimes- shall we say - dodgy?!- reviews it seems to attract - because it was half the price of anything else and right around the corner from a venue we came to town to attend - The Tin Angel. It has to be said one of my friends cancelled her own booking there based solely on the bad reviews - and moved to the Best Western which we could see from our room window. When we arrived the signs - literally! - were not good! The bar downstairs - much maligned for keeping guests awake? - was closed for renovations and up on the wall was a \"For Sale\" sign. (we presume - for the bar!) It all looked very rundown and deserted - We eyed the Best Western with a sigh! But never fear. Rang the Hotel bell - was immediately answered by friendly lady who assured they were open for business - and she mentioned how as we had asked for an extra bed for our friend for one - night - she had set it up - IN THE LOUNGE! We have a suite?! I had emailed this request - and received no confirmation. But all was well. And a real bargain. - $20 I think extra for an extra head. We indeed had two rooms - the small double bedroom and the twice-as-big lounge area with two sofas, coffee table, tv - and well made-up extra adult cot - and a small but functional connecting bathroom (shower,sink,loo) between with Jack and Jill doors. We asked for extra towels for our friend - which were immediately provided - clean and fluffy! The rooms are indeed basic. But very clean - no bedbugs!! (mattress cover!) - the shower is hot - it's all we needed. There are broken ironing boards in cupboards and decorating tools in corners on landings - but nothing that feels unsafe or dirty and you do not come here for luxury or to hang out in your room. The corner location for bars, restaurants, clubs, shops and historical sites - is fabulous. The choice of eateries is great and yes - the streets will be NOISY!! LIVELY and BUZZING! - until 2am. - which is when the bars shut and then very shortly afterwards - all will be quiet. Don't fight it. Join them :-) They seemed to be trialling a \"New!\" (proclaimed the whiteboard) breakfast service. Not appealing! - There was a coffeepot and packs of cookies. But also a pretty much empty fridge with a bit of milk in it and the staffs leftover lunch! Go out instead - We found an excellent diner in Bridgets - a bracing saunter away. There are a couple of ancient computers available. I think. I never saw them on! - But you are provided with the hotel internet password - so perfect for me and my iPhone.

It looked great but wasn't the correct place. My secon cab drive then drove right past the Soceity Hill Hotel, that's how obscure and unknown it is. - I arrived in the evening, a single female, and found that there is no front desk. I had to \"check in\" at the adjoining corner bar but then go back outside in the rain and enter thru another door for those staying in the hotel rooms above. - Throughout the hallways, there were huge patches of dark mold on the ceiling and walls. It was filthy. - I had booked a \"suite\" lol, and found that it meant you enter the room through an incredibly tiny space, with a large hole in the wall. Seriously. Then you walk through the bare-bones,dated bathroom to a really small bedroom that looked like it hadn't been updated (or cleaned) in 40 years. (I didn't even undress and chose instead to sleep in my clothes on top of the bedspread.) - The bathroom had no cup or glass so in order to take an RX, I had to walk down a couple of flights of stairs, out into the rain, and into the bar to request a glass for water. Then back out onto the dark, empty street to re-enter the hotel. - I was there in Winter and it was both rainy and windy. The room's only window had a window air conditioner but there were large gaps between it and the edges of the window so that wind was actually blowing, not leaking,into my room. I took the rags that were supposed to pass as towels and stuffe them in the spaces to cut down on the chill from exterior air. I also ran the shower from time to time to generate heat to try to warm the room. - The bar was closed in the morning when I was leaving and after some effort I was unable to find a single hotel employee so there was no \"check-out\" and I just left. (Forgot the free breakfast that was supposed to be delivered to your door. It didn't happen but after the night I had, I wouldn't have wanted to eat anything there anyway.) That also meant no assistance getting a cab in an area where they were not frequent. I had to just start walking with my rolling suitcase and briefcase. - A few blocks later, when I did find a taxi, I started telling him about my experience and he started to laugh. According to him, the rooms above the bar were more for quick hook-ups after happy hour than overnight guests. Whatever. Yeech. - Forget getting a refund.

Walking into the hotel, the slight smell of cigarettes were in the air. As I walked to the room I was ready to see mice and dirty sheets but none of them were there. The bed was neatly made and the sheets were clean, I lifted the bed up to check for mice but nothing, checked the closet and nothing. I did find an iron and ironing board in the closet though along with extra bedding. I did get the cheapest smallest room so I wasn't expecting much, first off the TV was TINY! To me this didn't matter, I barely watch TV at home as it is. The room was quite cold, it seemed as if the heat wasn't turned on, not a good thing when the temp outside was a brisk 45 degrees. The bathroom was quite small, and it was not shared with another room as someone else mentioned in an earlier review. Shower was tiny, the sink was also small. There were clean towels and 2 rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom. Overall I would rate this hotel a 3.5 out of 5,its definitely worth the price, there is a best western about a block away that was charging $200 per night! Save you cash and stay at this place its nothing like everyone seems to make, now if your traveling with kids this place isn't for you, singles and couples looking for a place to stay at for the night stay here and save some cash. Breakfast was delivered promptly, not the best breakfast but it did the job to hold you up till a snack later on during the morning. Now the few issues I had:no cups, no soap, no ice machine or even a fridge. And did I mention it was COLD!!!!

The ceiling tiles were stained, warped with some caving in. Small rooms are not a problem for us, but it was hard to feel comfortable in a room that had been so utterly neglected. The carpet had stains, the mouldings contained a nice layer of dust and dirt, and the mice left their calling cards each night on the couch, table and floor. The toilet paper holder had been ripped off the wall, the toilet lid fell off each time it was raised and the shower tile and surrounding drywall were crustily swollen. The shower barely drained, so even the shortest shower left you standing in two inches of soapy water.

Based on the hotel's website, and the menu of the accompanying restaurant, we decided that the motel would indeed meet the description of being \"old, yet charming\". Unfortunately, it is only the \"old\" part of that description which is appropriate. The rooms are ultra small, and ours had baby blue paint throughout. The furniture was early Salvation Army, and at least two hairs, not belonging to us, were found in our short stay. In saying short, I am not exagerrating. Upon entering our room, we were overwhelmed with a mold and mildew odor. We opened the windows, believing it might air out, and then went out for some Cokes. On return, we realized it was not any better, and, after about 30 minutes, we decided we absolutely could not stay the night in such conditions. Having intense allergies to mold, I began to feel the effect in a short time. I realized a night in such a room would make me deathly ill. We went down to the bar and told the attendant (the motel owner is nowhere to be found) of our dilemma. She seemed not the least bit surprised, and recommended another hotel in the area.

All of the things that made me choose to stay here were either extremely exaggerated or just plain not there. No fresh flowers or fruit, no free drink at the bar, the 'fresh' breakfast consisted of canned fruit cocktail, warm juice, and a little debbie wrapped coffee cake which was delivered hours before our specified delivery time. The room was hot as could be, and the bed was just terrible. The owner/manager apologized profusely, but did nothing to compensate us for our awful stay.

I am writing this review from room 203 of the hotel. The rooms are small, and the hotel service is decidely part-time, as per a bed and breakfast, but there is nothing so decadent as being able to enjoy the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, and the other sites of Philidelphia, and then walk a block or two to your hotel, enjoy an incredible meal, then just walk upstairs to your room. Then maybe walk back downstairs for a few more drinks. The new bar/restaurant is owned by Chris Conover. He's been a waiter in Phily for 20 years in the top restaurants in the city, and now he's opened one of his own. Along with it, he brought in the best chefs, waiters, and recipies he found from his 20 years and brought them all together. You won't find Coors Light on tap here. Instead, he pours the best beer of each style (light, amber, dark, etc) that he's ever had and put them all on tap. The food is the same way. The menu changes slightly every day, and more radically each month. Ask Chris to add Chicken fingers to the menu just to see his reaction! Truly, the food is out of this world. And, they serve it as it comes out. So, while everyone might not get their meals at exactly the same time, each meal will be perfect.", "Date": "January 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2800222", "Content": "The only thing good about this place was the location - only 2 blocks from main attractions. The rest was very disappointing. When we drove up, we said \"This can't be it\". Unfortunately, it was. The restaurant down below (closed temporarily - with windows covered in newspaper), the construction going on next door and across the street, and the dingy appearance all were turn-offs right away! Inside, there was a cheerful proprietor (however, you could never find him when you needed him after that). We had to climb 3 flights of stairs(no elevator) to a tiny, not-so-well kept room. It was not quaint; just old. There were no fresh flowers as advertised, and the guy in charge had no idea about internet connections which also were advertised. The breakfast too was a disappointment. One muffin and canned fruit cocktail. At $110, it was a real rip-off. We're not difficult to please, but this definitely was not a place we'd recommend.", "Date": "November 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value & Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2695433", "Content": "This b&b has superb location and met expectations.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hated it! WOW! Where do I start? I stayed in the Residence Inn and find the staff and their attitudes toward their guests to be reprehensible. There is a lady named Tonya at the front desk who should stay home on most days because she appears to be very unhappy with herself and only smiles when the General Manager is on site. One of the older female workers in the cafeteria started a verbal argument with my 13 yr. old in front of many guest because she asked for milk 5 minutes after breakfast was over. I was confronted by the so-called Front Desk Manager, Big Martha ( former housekeeping manager lol!) about a charge I had previously paid. Apparently my payment had not been properly documented. Sounds like theft to me. Thank God for receipts. The workers all appear to be busy when everyone knows their motive is to go outside for a cigarette break and to talk about upper management all during the day. I know because they have voiced their complaints with me while I was having a cigarette break. LOL. On more than one occasion my room has been entered into without so much as a knock. My phone calls were blocked for no apparent reason. The front desk is often abandoned during their so-called social hour and breakfast so the employees may gorge themselves in that slop they call food. I witnessed the handyman picking up the POOP bags out of the waste basket and head directly to the food bar and helped himself. Don't even ask me if he washed his hands. On another occasion I happened to be checking on my little girls to find two grown engineers that worked for the hotel doing a TELEPHONE WIRE repair. Security is so laxed that people who aren't even guest show up for happy hour and breakfast. Not to mention I was informed of a death in room 304 by one of the hotel employees. A man fell to his death outside of my hotel room while painting a piece of this God forbidden hotel. He was on a tall ladder with no harness. To top things off I was charged a $250 room restoration fee for a smoke smell in the room when this smell existed LONG before I got there. God knows how many people have paid this fee for that same room time and time again. I am forwarding this as a formal complaint to their corporate offices , as well as, listing on every review database imaginable because I gave them fair warning after the first couple of incidents. I no longer take my complaints up with management because they seem to perpetuate this bad culture.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR513528288", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MrandMrsNewOrleans"}, {"Content": "Nothing Bad to Say       pool", "Date": "May 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR343399146", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "dolphnlvr6"}, {"Content": "No,No,No Never Stay Here This hotel is a dump.

I was traveling with two teen daughters and my wife and I felt this would give us the space we needed. We didn\u9225\u6a9b want to have to go out to eat ever time we got hungry. I also was attending a play in town at the Convention Center and this hotel was supposed to be conveniently located by the Convention Center. That ended up being a long unsafe walk also. The rooms were large the beds were too small. Both rooms came with doubles in them. While the suite was clean the furnishings were well below the standard of other Residence Inns I have stayed. If you are hanging out in the Quarter you do not want to stay here unless you are catching cabs. It is too far and too unsafe to walk from this hotel. I found myself driving even to the Casino and parking there. I was told by a desk clerk I could park on the street Friday thru Sunday free. I received a $40.00 ticket on Saturday morning. Given the correct circumstances I would stay at this hotel again. With planning it can be accomplished. I would however under no circumstances stay at this hotel if I were not traveling with children.

It was built (or actually transformed from a warehouse) about 10 years ago and it needs a facelift. Maybe it's a victim of low-price contracts with recovery personnel since Katrina, because service was minimal. Our suite didn't get cleaned until afternoon each day. The carpet was worn, the hardware on the bathtub falling off. Complimentary breakfast was generous but inadequately staffed. They would run out of food and take much too long to re-stock. Newspapers were in short supply, and tables weren't bused often enough. The afternoon happy hour was a joke. Only available weekdays (I think the same is true of breakfast), it lasts only an hour or so and consisted of cheap, awful wine and stale beer in pitchers and a single, cheap dish such as lasagna each evening. There was nowhere else in the block or across the street to eat or get a drink, though the warehouse/museum district is full of hotels and restaurants. Worst problem: parking, which was across a dark, narrow side street. There was one street light, no exterior lighting on the side of the hotel, no valet parking, no convenient handicap parking.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR752589931", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "CCTramp"}, {"Content": "OK The building the hotel is in is pretty cool -- it's a converted warehouse. Catwalks lead between the upper rooms. But the coolness ends there. The rooms are typical (but very worn) Residence Inn. They're huge, which is great.

The courtyard has a pool which is looking a little murky and a basketball court. It's usually full of kids, which is great if you have kids. The breakfast is fine, but nothing to write home about, it's a typical buffet breakfast, but nice that it's free. I prefer not to eat it. The cleaniness is the biggest issue. Our bathroom wasn't clean, the maid forgets to replace things. We are here at a really good price $75, so it's one of those you get what you pay for. Front desk staff is pleasant.

The first thing we noticed was the moldy smell of the room, which stayed unless the AC was running extremely cold. We found black mold on the soap dish and were told by the maid it couldn't be cleaned because they weren't allowed to use bleach. Later maintenance came up to caulk over the offending mold. (Yeah that helped) The rooms were big enough for three, although, in the one bedroom suite, the bathroom was inside the bedroom, so those using the sleeper sofa had to go through the bedroom to the bathroom. SO much for privacy. They did have a nice breakfast each morning, and it was a challenge to keep everything up, but they managed. I liked the Belgian waffles. The evenings manager reception had warm beer and wine, and cold food. On hotdog and hamburger night they ran out of hotdogs in the first 10 minutes. My wife had mold growing on her hamburger bun. When she brought it to the attention of the staff, they thanked her and threw the offending bun away, but didn't check the other buns in the basket to see if anymore were moldy ( I guess that was our job). Most days housekeeping came by, one day they came by at 9:00 a.m. to et the towels and bedding, and came back at 4:30P.M. to see if wanted our room cleaned. Three out of five days they didn\u9225\u6a9b refill our coffee basket, twice we had to ask for toilet paper. We used valet parking, were told \u9225\u6ddbust call down with your ticket number and the car will be brought around\u9225? Every time, we had to ask again when we got to the desk because \u9225\u6de3obody\u9225?told the valet. The beds were decent, the bathroom was okay (if moldy), and the rooms were large.

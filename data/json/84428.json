The owners and staff are all like family, we actually miss them when we travel back to Australia. They're always helpful and ready to do anything they can to help out. Carlos the groundsman even washed a mark off my car for me and changes the lightbulbs if they blow. If anything is wrong in your room, Carlos is the man! Gloria makes the best waffles for breakfast. Breakfast is in the office area and is the BEST!! They have waffles made fresh when you ask for them, bagels, toast, mini muffins which are delishious, apples & banana's, 3 different cereals, juices and tea and coffee. So enough to keep you going until lunch time, I always put on weight when I leave this hotel as I end up having the waffles each morning. At home I would normally only eat toast or cereal. We stay in one of the studio rooms to the left when you pull in the drive way, the rooms are huge and there is also a dressing room area, king size bed, table and chairs and a sofa & coffee table. I've had friends that stay in really expensive hotels and all they get is a small square room with a queen bed, it might be flash and made of marble but I prefer the extra space and furnisings. One thing I should mention are the beds at the Days Inn, they are seriously the best beds I've ever slept in, in the world, the mattress's are so comfy and the pillows devine, I sleep more hours here than I do in my own bed. I can't say enough about the beds, this hotel has gone out of its way to make sure they have the best in comfort. Another bonus is they have free parking and if you don't drive there is a bus line right outside Ralphs which is across the road. Ralphs is a huge supermarket. There is also alot of restaurants and shops all within walking distance. The wifi is free and super fast, much faster than our internet back in Australia. The owners are super nice people and this is definitely our number one place to stay each time we're in Los Angels recording.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money\u201d", "Author": "oscar888_10", "ReviewID": "UR120480636", "Content": "I have been in this hotel several times when it was under the Days Inn banner, now the name is different but it remains the same, in fact it has improved several things are changing including new flat TV screen just started to be installed, service is friendly, rooms are good size and clean, I know it is not a 5 start hotel but it is good for business stays and families", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, nice room\u201d", "Author": "missmattie", "ReviewID": "UR119501524", "Content": "We chose to stay here because it was close to a highway which meant we could get to many of the attractions in LA/Hollywood easily. The area felt safe even at night. There is a Walgreens/CVS or Ralph's in every direction from the hotel, but you definitely need a car. Room: - It was an old room but it was very well maintained and very clean - We had one king size bed which was very comfy and the housekeeping did a great job - The room is spacious, there is a separate dressing area where there is a large vanity mirror, counter space, coffee maker, fridge & lots of places to hang clothes up and store luggage. (see photos) - The TV is an older model, but it worked and we were barely watched TV anyway - Washroom is older but everything works fine - Shower head is very low. I am 5'2\" and it was just right. If you're any taller than me, it's going to be a challenge to shower. - One morning we could hear the neighbour on the phone. We're not sure if it was coming through the wall or somehow through our phone - kinda wierd! Hotel Common Areas: - Parking is limited so if you are staying over a Friday or Saturday night, you might have to park on the street if you get back to the hotel late - The driveway divides the larger section of the hotel from the other side (where we stayed). I found it fairly quiet, even when there were kids in the pool or down in the courtyard. - No elevators so if you have heavy luggage (or a lot of it), request a room on the main floor - Breakfast is great! It's not extravagant but it's just right - good muffins, cereals, waffles, juice, coffee, etc. They don't have a large selection but what they have tastes good - Front Desk staff was very courteous. I had booked a non-smoking room but for some reason my reservation said smoking. When I explained it to the man at the front desk, he was more than happy to help me and tried to get me a corner room (because we were worried about noise) - If you want a late night snack, Domino's delivers and they must be close by because they brought our order in 20 minutes!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Room & Location\u201d", "Author": "Tampa3", "ReviewID": "UR118634852", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay here very much while in the Los Angeles area.

The contractors were painting and Gardeners replanting flowers in the courtyard. Rooms are no frills, but have all the basics. Bathrooms are very antiquated in need of new tiles and plumbing. BEWARE hot water will heat up and burn you if you are not careful it turns itself up when someone flushes the toliet or turns on the sink faucet.

This is huge because many of the hotels in the area charge for this. Cons: The main con was the bathroom. It had no bathtub, only a shower, and seemed dated and in need of renovating (room 205). There is no exhaust fan either, so be prepared to crack the small window because the glass completely fogs up. The window also faces apartment buildings so you may not want to crack it open TOO much! It also has the electric outlet to the right of the sink, making it impossible for one to use the sink while another does their hair. It also is kind of dangerous. There is only a thin countertop to put things on as well and many cracks in wall tiles. Our room also faced the pool, which, for some reason, has a very loud motor or something that makes a loud noise. We were so tired and the beds so comfortable though, that this didn't bother us too much. All in all, it was a decent place to stay at a bargain price- comparing it to others in the area, that is.

When I checked in I had a handicap room -( I'm in a wheelchair) which they gave me but there is no way in hell you can park a car if you are by yourself - the parking area is down an extremely steep hill behind the hotel. Even with help you couldn't push a wheelchair up the hill and would probably be killed if you tried to go down the hill in one. Also to get to the handicap room you had to go through the pool area that was always wet and very slippery. The ramp from the entrance into the pool area had so many drink machines next to it there is really only half a ramp that you would be lucky to get a baby stroller up. Upon checkin in I had a special travel agent rate confirmed and I had it in writing. The idiot at the front desk wouldn't even look at it and just said unless I paid 4 times the price I could go elsewhere as they had no intention of honoring it. He said to talk to the manager the next day. That moron also refused to honor the rate even when I told him I had already called the headquarters and had filed a case report on them. Room was barely okay - metal between room and bath was so poorly put in I ripped the side of my foot open on it and there was always a parade of little bugs coming out from under it as it stuck up about 1/2\" from the floor. Shower was a walkin but NOT wheelchair accessible as it had about a 5\" ledge you had to step over. Also tile was like stepping on ice and is an serious accident waiting to happen (luckily I brought a small bath mat with me). The free continental breakfast was also a joke -- it consisted of nothing but lukewarm coffee and the cups were so small they were like children's Dixie cups. If they put out any food it must have been so little it was gone by the time the first one or two people got there. The ONLY good point was the room maid (I think her name was Cecilia or Celeste) She was great - did a very nice job on the room and was very friendly.

This hotel satisfied all of my above requirements, though I would preferred a paper other than USA Today. I arrived in LA with a packed itinerary, and was mostly concerned with getting around town and seeing stuff. Whatever the shortcomings of this hotel, it wasn't that big a deal for my purposes. It was clean, quiet and free of cockroaches. (As an aside, I highly recommend the $11 weekly pass from Metro, which allows you to ride any bus or train within the Metro system. From this hotel, you're about a five or ten minute bus ride from Universal station. Once at Universal, the trains can take you to various far-flung corners of LA faster than you would in a car. Also, I found the Metro organization very helpful in my pre-planning.

Liked the rate, but as they say, you get what you pay for. For some reason our room had the most pervasive musty/moldy odor I have ever experienced in the West. Perhaps the room has had a history of being flooded. They tried to mask the musk with various sickeningly sweet scents, but it only made the room smell even worse. To add to the problem, the main window would not open. We kept the door open as long as we could with the air going, but were very uncomfortable even as we slept, and got up at 6 am so that we could air ourselves out and try to change rooms. I had to wash all my clothes, even those in my suitcase, as everything took on this strange awful odor. I got sick about 3 days later, the first time in 3 years. Whether it was coincidence or not I could not say. The management was ok, but not really interested in our complaint about the room's terrible odor and no other room was available there. One other odd thing about the place is that it has a u-shaped driveway that goes around the rear of the complex. The 'exit' is padlocked shut, so if you have a large vehicle and the lot is busy, you have to back all the way around and out of the driveway.

They offer a very basic cont. breakfast of coffee, orange juice, tea, packaged danish (that they keep frozen and put out partially thawed as needed), frosted flakes and cheerios. Here are the problems: 1. They advertise an airport shuttle on their website. I got off a 5 hour plane trip with my 8 yr old at 8pm, call the hotel for the shuttle, only to be told \"Oh no we have no shuttle - you take taxi cab\" and got hung up on. The cab ride cost me $27!!!! I was not impressed. One of the reasons I chose this place was because of the 'free shuttle' offered on their website. I have since found out via the head office that I can get reimbursed for my return taxi fare because it was false advertising on the website. I have to now file a claim for the money back. 2. The pool is FRIGID. They do not heat it. It also is only open 9am-9pm. After a long day of travelling, we arrived at the motel at 845pm. My daughter desperately wanted a quick swim. They locked the pool at 9pm and would not allow her to have even a 5 minute quick dip - in which we promised to be very quiet. Nope. No way. There were kids running around until 11pm each night making noise, yet they could not have the pool open until 11pm. Made no sense to me. We later found out how cold the pool was, so she probably would not have gotten in that night anyway, but its principle. 3. The front desk clerk must be the owner. He is always there. He is also very rude and doesn't crack a smile. When I checked in I paid with traveller's checks. He held them up to the light and was inspecting them like I was giving him counterfeit money, and made me feel very uncomfortable. He then wanted nearly every piece of id that I own and did mention he 'prefers' cash. I am sure he does, but 'I' prefer travellers checks. I never give a credit card at places like this because it never fails that charges seem to get added on somehow and you have to fight to get the money back. 4. After our 2 days in Studio City, my daughter and I headed to Disneyland. We did this via amtrak (no rental car). Once in Anaheim I realized that I had forgotten to get a couple things out of a drawer. One of them being my $300 prescription. Due to long distance charges, I quickly called my mom (who lives in Vancouver), who in turn said she would handle it for me so we could go have fun in Disneyland. Off we went to Disneyland thinking that the motel would stick the few small things (some hair clips, the pills and a bracelet) in the mail, and I would pay the postage. I checked in with my mom later on and she was livid. She said that the man refused to mail these items to us. He said that things left behind had to be picked up only, or they became his property. I had no way of getting back to that hotel at that point. I did not have a rental car, and was quite stuck. My mom had said to him that we would pay the postage and even send a self addressed envelope, but nope....he would not do anything about it. He was rude and arrogant and I think he was looking to keep my stuff. We had been at the motel with a couple of other families who were checking out that day, so my mom asked if they were still there. He said 'I cannot give you that information'. She then asked what was there besides the pills and hair clips and he said 'I cannot give you that information'. We looked into having the stuff fedexed to us in Anaheim, and it was going to cost about $50. I was willing to pay this at that point (as I needed my prescription), but he said he would not package it up for fedex. He said it must only be picked up in person. Luckily, my mom runs a HUGE and very popular discussion board on the internet and asked if anyone lived near this motel. Someone replied that they indeed did, and was able to go and retrieve my belongings, which are now in the mail to me. I have never left anything behind at a motel before, and I have sure learned my lesson to not do that again. 5. Website claims to have microwaves in some rooms, yet in the 7 rooms that our party occupied, not one of them had one. 6. Website claims that there are morning newspapers delivered to all rooms and that was not the case. I do not really care about it, but thought I would point it out if that is important to someone. 7. Website claims to have iron/ironing boards in the rooms (which is something I could have used - ended up steaming my clothes by turning the shower on hot and closing the door), and there were none available. 8. Blow dryer did not work, and when I asked for a new one I was told to keep trying the one we had. Took me 3 tries to get a new one. I will NEVER stay at this place again. Yes, it was clean, close to things (there is a strip mall and a Ralph's across the street with lots of dining choices...bagel place, mexican fast food place, starbucks,etc...), but I would rather give my money to a motel that deserves it and treats customers properly. Customer service is worth a couple of extra bucks to me. Also, with the money I spent on the taxi, I could have used that money to upgrade to a nicer hotel that was one block down that did offer a free airport shuttle.", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherman Oaks, CA", "Title": "\u201cClose, Clean, No Frills\u201d", "Author": "CaliforniaNative", "ReviewID": "UR3209814", "Content": "The Days Inn is very ordinary, but well-kept and clean.

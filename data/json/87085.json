It has been a week since I left Four Ambassador Suites. I miss it already. Thank You so much for the Remarkable Stay at Your Hotel Suites. I was very impressed with the Service, Cleanliness, Courtesy of the Staff, the Over All Quality of the Suite. Though I only used the Fridge for keeping Beer and Water Cold everything there was in fantastic order if I needed it. I was surprised at the total price I paid. I was expecting a Heck of a lot more. My Room was 766 everything was in working order and the View was Fantastic. I hope to return soon. I hope to get the same room.

We waited until the last minute to book our hotel and found that availability was extremely limited and hotels were grossly over-priced. The Four Ambassadors provided us with a clean (albeit rustic) room that was large enough for our entire party at a very competitive rate. The room was clean, spacious, and charming. The view was beautiful, the grounds were well kept, and the hotel employees were friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to my family and friends who were traveling to the Miami area.

This is a condo complex where one tower is short-term or hotel style rentals. The neighborhood is nice and relatively safe, on the edge of the financial district. Both of the units we stayed in were quite clean, but getting a bit shabby around the edges. Since there were two and adults and two adult-sized teens to be accommodated, we opted for the deluxe suite, which gave us tons of room and was cheaper then paying for two \"regular\" hotel rooms elsewhere. The only major complaint was that in neither unit was the sofa bed really in usable condition. My son was a good sport about it both nights, but then he can fall asleep sitting up! Even though there were four of us expected, we had to call for extra towels both stays (there were only two complete sets in the entire unit). The housekeeping staff spoke very little English, so it was a good thing that I was able to dust off my high school/college Spanish. Many permanent/long term residents apparently Cuban--so I suppose language problem a non-issue for many people. Nice little deli, coffee shop, Intenet cafe, two specialty restaurants. We got supplies for quick breakfasts at the deli both stays (our units had complete kitchens), which probably saved some time and money. Intenet access was easy and cheap at $2.50 for 30 minutes and $5.00 for an hour. Previous review had indicated that it was only a short/cheap taxi ride to pier, Sobe, etc. The closest and cheapest taxi was about $6 to the Bayside Marketplace. It is about a $12 ride to the pier and nearly $25 to the heart of South Beach. Something tells me that the higher gas prices have driven up the taxi fares since earlier this year.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot Bad - Huge accomodations\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3445166", "Content": "Three of us stayed overnight prior to a cruise embarkment. Its an apporx. $5-6 taxi ride to the Port of Miami. The exterior: very attractive. Four tower condos. The Lobby: Huge beautiful lobby. Communial space for all four towers.

Location: Not bad. 10 min. walk to shopping on Flager st.. Now, the room. The Four Ambassador Suites are condo size accomodations for sure. The room was huge. They are apartment size accomodations. Very spacious with two closets for storage. A kitchenette w/stove, microwave, toaster, and sink with gliding shutter doors to close it off from foyer. The room size and view gives this an above average rating. The view is absolutely stunning. You have a full view of the Miami river glistening at night. Breath taking! (you can see the Mandarin Orential across the river). The rooms decor; however, was very bland. Wood head boards to match the dresser-nothing pretty. There was a small round dining table in the bedding area. Bathrooms were clean. Staff was incredibly nice. We received a really great price on a website. Can't remember which one.

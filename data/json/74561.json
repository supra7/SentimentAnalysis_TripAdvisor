The ice machine was broken but under the circumstances I really needed a drink. Drove across the street (never walk here!) and got ice.

I drove up and it seemed to be a decent place for the price. When I went inside the lady at the front desk was dressed in shabby clothing and was completely rude to me. I ignored the fact that she was rude since I was tired and just needed a room after a long drive from Sacramento. I paid in cash and was given the key to the room. When I went up to the room it was in terrible condition. The door was open and when I had peeked inside I saw the room to be a complete mess. It smelt of urine and the bed looked slept in. I went back down to the office moments after renting the room and explained to the lady that the room was a reck and that I do not feel safe staying there. I simple just wanted my money back so I could go elsewhere to feel safe. She completely refused to speak with me and told me I must leave the office at once or she would call the police for harassment. Shocked and not sure what to do at this point I left. My son and my nephew both tried calling to reason with her and she simple said there is nothing to talk about and hung up. I called the next day 12/21/2007 to speak to a manager. The person on the phone sounded like the same person from last night. She would not give me her name but stated she is a manager and said that she would not give me the money back nor would she talk to me concerning this matter. After a few minutes trying to talk to her she hung up stating \"There is nothing more to discuss\". I do not recommend staying there. I would suggest that your better off sleeping on the streets or in your car then staying at the Sterling International Hotel.

Boy, was I sorry! I should've come the next day, when the event was over and I could've chosen another hotel. By the way, they term it a hotel, but it's actually a cheesy motel! I checked in and discovered that my room was filthy--the carpet was so gross I wouldn't take my socks off and I wrote my name in the dust on the table! Get this straight--my home is not so clean, as I have 4 dogs and 6 cats, and I was disgusted by this motel! There was no welcoming literature of any kind (what to do and where to eat in Phoenix, welcome to our hotel, etc), no Internet service, no remote for the TV, and no speakers in the TV! There was an ironing board, but no iron. I had to visit the office twice to obtain one. Speaking of the office, the three young girls I encountered there were all wearing hooded sweatshirts (one of which was visibly dirty with holes in it)--very unprofessional! To top off my stay, my card was charged twice for one night!

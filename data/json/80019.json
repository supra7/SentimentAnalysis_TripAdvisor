Reason was we requested a non-smoking room top floor. We got that but it was actually right next to a smoking room and we could smell the smoke through the walls and people would smoke out on walkways in front of room doors. Also the toilet stunk, must be the sewer system they use is old. If people come in late to their room and are talking on the outer walkways you can hear them as if they were in your room. Woke me up several times. The building must have gone through an earthquake since the walkways and room floors had a wave to them, kind of made us nervous about the integrity of the building. The room was clean, and beds seemed new as did furniture. TV was LG flat-screen and nice. The breakfast was good, but the breakfast room was small- basically at the back end of one of the three buildings they converted two rooms into the breakfast area, and if you wanted water with your breakfast you had to go next door to workout room to get some. We also wanted to bring our sm 10lb non-shedding hypo-allergenic dog, but yet stay on top floor. We were told they do not let dogs on top floor so that guests that are allergic to dogs have rooms that have never had dogs in them. Well we paid for someone to watch our dog at home, and it turned out we noticed two rooms on the top floor that had large shedding dogs in them. When we pointed this out to them they told us, well if they sell out of rooms on their first two floors, then people with dogs who check in late can stay on top floor. I find this very unprofessional that they give preference to those just driving by and checking in versus us since we made our reservation a month in advance and was told twice absolutely no dogs allowed on top floor.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gilbert, Arizona, United States", "Title": "\u201cLock up your Stuff!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Heather P", "ReviewID": "UR122461957", "Content": "We stayed her for New Years for our annual Seaworld New Year Trip.

That was changed right away and we were put in a non-smoking room. The room was clean when we got there and everything worked except some a lamp. The lighting in the room was dim, but I can deal with that. We went swimming in the heated pool and hot tub that evening. The pool was good temperature and overall the pool area was clean. Only one of the jets worked in the hot tub, but all I cared about was the soaking in the warm tub. They had a towel area at the pool area and it had towels every time we went to the pool. So we enjoyed the pool area. The first full day that we left the room, we can back to a missing cell phone. I called the front desk immediately. They said that they would check with housekeeping and get back with me in the morning. NO ONE called me in the morning. I had to call them. They told me that they have never had a stolen item reported....and that was the end of that conversation. I kept the DND sign on our door the rest of the vacation and did not have housekeeping come in the remaining 2 days of our trip. I did file an incident report when checking out. The breakfast was better than the usual free continental. They had waffles, donuts, cereal, coffee and juices. Along with fruit. They had a hot selection that was different each day.

We booked the family suite (King + bunk beds + sofa bed) which is oversized, well furnished and very spacious. Arrived in late afternoon to a polite greeting at check-in which was quick and efficient. Room was well-appointed with microwave, fridge, coffee maker, and flat screen TV with a small but very functional work desk with electrical outlets in a fixture on the top of the desk so I didn't have to crawl beneath it to plug in laptop, phone chargers, or iPod. All the beds were reasonably comfortable as were the pillows. Due to the soccer game schedule, we did not have time to sample the free continental breakfast. Plenty of free parking between the \"courtyard\" lot surrounding the pool/spa and the overflow spaces next to the hotel. Location was just off I-5 and within walking distance (across freeway overpass) to Mission Bay Park. Again, due to soccer schedule we needed a late checkout and the front desk person was more than accommodating - even though I was not sure we would need the extra night I had reserved - I was allowed to keep the room until we found out if we would need to stay the extra night, which as it turned out, we did not need and were not charged for it. The housekeeping and maintenance staff were as friendly and efficient as the front desk and management folks. The only \"negative\" that I can recall was the flush toilet in the bathroom was loud, but apparently it wasn't loud enough to wake anyone during the night.

Cleaning fluid was not a nice addition to our breakfast. Also check your credit card when you leave the hotel - my card was charged an extra $10 3 days after leaving the hotel. After we queried it we were told the extra charge was due to use \"upgrading\" to a non-smoking room even though i wasn't told about the extra charge at the time of checking in or out. The charge was refunded to my card though.

Basically when you select the general vacinity you are interested in they can and do place you on the very outskirts of that area. All to say that I was not looking foward to staying at this location but I thought I would make the best of the situation to avoid a legal battle with Priceline ( I will NEVER use them again). I knew that the hotel was known for being a family location so I purposely called ahead of time and asked to be on the third floor.

I arrived at the hotel after a long journey to discover this hotel was located on the side of the interstate. The hotel front desk told me that nothing was within walking distance - despite the advert on the website implying most attractions were. When asked how guests without a car manage I was assured the public transport system was easy to use. I was given an information sheet on the attractions and how to get there by bus etc... To get to the bus stop I had to cross a dangerous interstate. I was told the buses were every 15 mins and I needed to change twice to get to downtown san Diego (where I was recommended to visit). This was incorrect. In the daytime the buses were every 30 mins and I actually did not need to change at all. To make matters worse in the evening the buses were less infrequent - every hour- and none actually went near the hotel. I then spent an hour on the bus to be dropped no where near the hotel. I was nearly attacked and had to call the police for assistance. I then had to call 15 cab companies before one would come to my location to collect me. I am a stranger to San Diego and am a 26 year old single female. I had never been so scared in my entire life. Upon arriving to the hotel -after also requesting a quiet room, I heard the neighbor a few doors down having a party with 10 people in the room. I complained to the front desk as it was now 1230am and they said they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear anything and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t investigate. I complained the next day to the general manager. All she offered me was 10% discount on my stay. My whole vacation has been ruined. I have been left witha horrid image of San Diego and actually cut my trip short by a day and checked out early.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cIt's not like the Hilton @ Mission Bay, but it was almost half the cost!\u201d", "Author": "dcsjeeep", "ReviewID": "UR5028441", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights and were very satisfied.

It was depressing to have it so dark, and the decor doesn't help, but you can't have everything.

The pool and hot tub area is small but my kids and hubby had no complaints. It would be nice if some parents of some teenagers would control their children so they don't run wild and act like hooligans, but that was no reflection on the motel. The staff at this motel were the best we encountered on our trip, and any requests were dealt with immediately and professionally.

When we arrived at the hotel, it was very easy to see that it wasn't in the best of locations. It may be very close to Mission Bay and a few minutes drive from Sea World, but even the nearest place to eat, besides a Jack in the Box, is a few miles away. But the hotel itself was clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, and it was nice having a pool, even if it was in the middle of the parking lot! (tip-when everyone is heading to the beach, the zoo, and Sea World in the morning, head to the pool for a few hours. We were always the only ones out there enjoying the water in the morning instead of having to deal with the crowds at night.) Because it is a family hotel, if you plan on sleeping in mornings passed 7, get a room on the third floor and not by the stairways or elevator, which are heavy traffic areas. The complimentary breakfast is the same every day (cereal, muffins, fruit) but it saves time and money. And because the rooms are equipped with a refrigerator and a microwave, you can stock up on drinks and snacks to bring with you during the day or for downtime before going out at night. Also, grab the brochures from the lobby and 'dining area'. There are so many things to do in addition to Sea World, the Zoo, and the beach. They have information on parasailing, Old Town, jetskiing on Mission Bay, and dozens of other adventures. We had one of the best vacations, even if we did get ripped off by cab drivers. If you are traveling without a car, with a group of friends, or a couple, stay in Old Town. There's a nice Best Western there, and you are right near shops, restaurants, and nightlife. (For real, authenitic Mexican food, go to El Agave Tequileria.) Plus there are trams that run out of Old Town to Downtown, the beaches, and other great areas. Unfortunately for Best Western on Mission Bay, location is important in San Diego and that is where this hotel is lacking.

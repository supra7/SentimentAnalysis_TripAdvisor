When we checked, we found that the small print on the booking form said that room type could not be guarenteed, but if a hotel has a 3 star rating, which it did, we presumed that a bathroom would be included in the room price - not so (in this day for goodness sake!). So it was a shared bathroom with who knows who. Then there was the smell. A huge amount of air freshner or something highly scented made it horrible to breath - for someone with asthma a real trigger for an attack. We had to leave the window wide open to deal with the smell (was it covering something up - this was hard to tell). Luckily the weather suited having the window open as it was not too hot or not too cold outside. There was also no air con that we could see, so the heat would be dreadful in the summer.

This year, we decided to return for a winter theater/shopping weekend. We got a rate of just under $500 total for three nights in a queen room with a seating area that included a small sofa and desk/chair, and you really can't beat that rate for New York even in the off season. As I said before, the Hotel Newton does not try to be a luxury destination. It tries to be the best at what it is -- a budget hotel. Our room was small, even with the seating area, but very clean. The bathroom was also small (I had to leave the door open while drying my hair or my elbow would hit the door) but very clean with quality products in terms of the shampoo and soap. We were on the second floor this trip, and the room was definitely darker than when we stayed on the seventh floor, but the lighting has clearly been upgraded to recessed cans that provided more than enough light. We also had a flat-screen TV in our room (I see some people have complained about old-school TVs in other rooms), along with a mini-refrigerator and microwave. During our last trip, the diner next door to the hotel was closed for renovation. It's now the Manhattan Cafe. We only ate breakfast there, but the food was great and the prices reasonable for New York. We also ate at Long Grain, a Thai restaurant on the same block as the hotel, and at Telio, a Greek restaurant a few blocks down Broadway that we loved. That's one of the great things about its location -- lots of great neighborhood restaurants within walking distance. My only complaint this trip, and it's minor, is that the weather was bitter cold and mounting around the window air conditioner in our room was definitely letting cold air leak into the room that diluted the effect of the radiator heat. I had to put an extra blanket on the bed at night.

It was my first time at the Hotel Newton and I selected the location to be near my granddaughter's school which was just a couple of blocks away. My daughter and granddaughter stayed with me so I was a solo traveler but a hotel guest with a family. The hotel exceeded my expectations in almost every respect. The staff was super professional and attentive. The room was very clean and comfortable, for the most part. My only complaints are 1) the radiator heat can not be controlled by guests and 2) the television had white vertical lines always present. With respect to the room temperature, we were so thankful we could open the window but that, of course, allowed more street noise in. My daughter retrieved a fan from home and we were able to use that for circulation and \"white noise\" for the rest of our stay (5 nights total) but most people will not have that option. As far as the television goes, it was certainly tolerable and most folks will not be holed up in their room watching it. We were told that all television sets in the hotel had the lines (see photo). Yes, the elevator is slow but I've experienced worse in Europe. Since we were on the second floor we usually took the stairs. We paid $5 a day for internet - - free would have been nice but no big deal. I booked my room through booking.com and missed a great deal offered by the hotel. I probably should have realized that after the holidays something like that might have been available. The neighborhood had everything we needed and I felt totally safe moving around on my own. Unfortunately, my granddaughter became ill while we were there but even that was manageable with an urgent care location a couple of blocks away and a drug store next door.

Yes, the room was small, the ac sounded like a B52 and it wasn't exactly cheerful, but it was more than adequate and certainly worth what we were charged. We would have stayed here again. My following comments are made with hopes that the hotel might better train their staff and that perhaps I can keep the next traveler from making a costly error. We needed to arrange to get to the airport for our flight home. Our previous experience with shuttles has been adequate if not wonderful, and we prefer a cab. Our discussion with the staff at the desk of the Hotel Newton led us to believe that a cab would overcharge, and as the weather for our flight day was going to be rainy, it would be difficult to hail a cab. (Forget that they have a door man and that is part of his job!) The staff recommended the shuttle service they advertise on their desk, Airlink. We requested the hotel desk staff check our department time which they did, and they booked our shuttle for the next day. They didn't give us choices of pick up time nor did they apparently realize the airlines suggest that you get to the airport two hours prior to departure. The desk staff told us our pick up time and that they needed $5 per person cash to hold the reservations (the rest was to be paid in cash to the driver when we were picked up.) Once again, we asked if the pick up time was going to give us enough time to make our flight. They assured us it would. Due to the staff's lack of information or willingness to share, we missed our flight and consequently missed our connecting flight home and had to spend the night in Atlanta at our expense because of the mishandled shuttle reservations. (There was an earlier shuttle pick up at the Hotel Newton and if we had been given that information that would have solved everything.) Here are my suggestions. If you are going to use a shuttle, book it online and use a credit card. Check the reviews of the shuttle company. Make sure it will get you to the airport with plenty of time to spare. Leave yourself at least an hour in the shuttle just for pick ups, plus travel to the airport (JFK being one hour from Manhattan). We were lucky that the airline was able to get us on a later flight and book us on a morning flight the next day without charging us for a new ticket (at a cost of over $400!).

I remembered the Hotel Newton, checked it out some more, and decided this sounded like a good location and a good deal as well. My husband and I reserved a Superior Queen as did his older sister and her partner. The younger sister and her husband and two teenaged daughters went with the Deluxe Double. When we arrived those of us who had reserved the Superior Queen rooms were upgraded (at no extra cost) to Deluxe Queen rooms. We were on the 8th floor but I can't remember the room number. The Deluxe Queen rooms were very roomy by NYC standard with plenty of room. We had a nice flat screen television and a good sized closet. Rooms were very clean. The bathroom was a bit small and the only thing I found weird is that there was a window in the shower itself that wasn't privacy glass. As our room faced the street with other buildings across the street I felt a little uncomfortable as the window would show everything from about the waist up. Maybe it was one way glass? Our family members traveling with teenagers ended up on another floor and their room was considerable smaller than ours, especially with two teenaged girls and all their stuff. They had a problem with their air conditioner not working but when they complained it was promptly replaced with a brand new one. Yes, the elevator is slow and there is only one but as we were never in a hurry that wasn't a big deal. Front desk staff was great! Location is good in a nice family neighborhood. When walking on a back residential street we even came upon a little girl and her dad with a lemonade stand. We also spotted actor Matt Dillon one night! Depending on which subway lines you are taking the station is either very close or a bit of a walk.

Besides, there are 8 floors, each seemingly with one shared bathroom per suite of rooms. So, if your floor is in use, you have 7 more to try. The clientele is a largely European crowd attracted by the bargain prices. Obviously this place is touted in European guidebooks of America. The clientele is quite varied in age, but mostly quiet, patient and travel-savvy. And best of all, you are in New York City, a walk away from some attractions and a brief subway trip away from almost all the major places. The Newton is just across the street from the IRT line 96th Street stop. OK...so what do I mean when I say you get what you pay for. Well the rooms are very small...probably equivalent to a 2 star hotel in Paris. In our room, the closet was not too ingeniously placed right next to the front door, so you couldn't open your closet and the front door at the same time. Plus, the closet was placed where the bathroom would have been...only big a problem for very drunk guests in the middle of the night who forget there is no bathroom. Let's see...one morning at checkout time the only elevator broke down. This was no problem for us at a lower floor, but I feel sorry for guests who had to lug their belongings down in the extreme heat from the upper floors. To be fair, the Hotel staff was quite willing and able in assisting guests with that task. There are two computers for guest use in the lobby (For a price...20c per 15 minutes...not bad). Naturally one of those computers was out of order. And the worst part...while rooms are non-smoking...the previous occupants of our room had ignored this rule. Cigarette smoke clung to everything in the small room. Despite the fact that we kept the very efficient air conditioning blasting for our 2 day stay, the stale cigarette odor never completely washed away. The Upper West Side neighborhood near the Newton is largely residential with the usual array of shops and services that grace a good residential scene. There has been a moderate uptick in panhandling over the past couple of years, but the neighborhood is well policed and largely hassle-free. There is the problem of finding a good comfortable neighborhood bar/restaurant in this area. \"The Regional\" with decent, sturdy Italian cooking and a really fine bartender comes closest to meeting this need. Otherwise, there are 2 taverns in the area which literally names themselves \"dive bars\"...which,unfortunately, in my opinion...is an all too apt description of those 2 establishments. You need to walk about 10 blocks up into the Columbia University neighborhood to find the right kinds of pubs. Again, since this is New York, I don't have to advise you on where to go to find anything and everything you want. But in this particular neighborhood, that walk to Columbia is worth it. The campus architecture and the whole atmosphere of the place is quietly outstanding. It is also cool to walk through Riverside Park at 95th Street and make your way to \"Hudson Beach\" a sprawling outdoor cafe of random tables overlooking the river. Sunset there is especially eye-popping. Children and dogs and all kinds of recreational venues add to the festival atmosphere. The service is slow, so avoid the Cheeseburger unless you enjoy stiff and lifeless cheeseburgers that failed to make their way from grill to your table in anything approaching a normal time.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood ... with some surprises!\u201d", "Author": "SaminBayat", "ReviewID": "UR114717985", "Content": "+++ Positive: 1)The hotel is in a good location and it is a two minute walk away from subway station that gives access to subway lines 1, 2 and 3 which can directly take you to Times Square. 2)The hotel and its room are clean and relative to the price you can get good service. 3)The staff were polite and kindly offered to keep our suitcases for free (you have to pay for lockers) on the last day of our stay, before we go to the airport. - - - Negative: 1)The first surprise we had was the size of our room.

Don't worry if you forget anything on your trip, because everything is at your fingertips. The staff at the hotel was very accomodating.

Everything was clean and the rooms that my family and I stayed in had large refrigerators to store drinks and food that we bought. The hotel has tremendous character. You can take the stairs (there are two stairwells) or you can take the elevator. Since this is an older building, the elevator is small and runs at its own pace, but we found the stairs just fine. The bathrooms seemed to have been redone recently and were very nice. We checked all of the beds and linens upon arrival and all were very clean. In the hallways, there was a smell of smoke by only one of our rooms, but we weren't bothered at all as we travel often and there were many people from around the globe. There was a Hertz parking garage around the corner which offered a hotel rate at $27 a night. Given the fact that we have parked often in NYC, this was a bargain rate.

It was excellent value for money. We cannot understand why this hotel is not rated among the top ten New York budget hotels. LOCATION: Broadway between 94th and 95th streets. Broadway is a boulevard, with uptown and downtown buses stopping a block away. The subway station 96th is half a block away. It is an express stop for trains 2 and 3 in the red line as well as the local 1 train which stops at all stations. Taking an express train from Times Square brings you to the hotel in under 8 minutes (only three express stops). From Times Square you can take the S (shuttle) subway one stop to Grand Central Station and from there you can connect with almost all the subway lines. The red line takes you all the way to the north tip of Manhattan (215th st) and the Bronx and to the southern tip of Manhattan (Wall st) and Brooklyn (directly to the Brooklyn Museum of Art). If you use the subway, as you get off you must walk to the end of the platform in search of the elevator to the Mezzanine. Once there, look for the exit to 95th st and use the elevator to get to street level. No need to lug heavy suitcases up the stairs. To the sides of the hotel you will find: two restaurants, a laundry, a pharmacy with an ATM, a gourmet deli and a newsagency and small convenience store. Opposite the boulevard is a pharmacy that develops photographs, a Chase bank with ATM, a MacDonalds. Next block, going downtown, two telephone booths for local and international calls (buy a phone card from the vending machine on the 2nd floor of the hotel: for US $ 5 I was able to speak half an hour to Argentina). Round the corner is a Gristede's supermarket with take away cooked food. Opposite the subway exit is another supermarket. Riverside Park is 3 blocks away, to walk along the Hudson River with the New Jersey coast on the other side. Central Park is 4 blocks away. If you want to go across town, to the east side, there are buses on 96th that cross Central Park. COMFORTABLE ACCOMODATION: We booked a Double Deluxe and we got it on the third floor, looking on to the back: brick building with fire escape stairs and brick wall. Two double beds, a chest of drawers on which was a coffee make, a cabinet containing the microwave and the fridge, a newly refurbished bathroom, toiletries including body lotion. The size was comfortable for two, but the room was not huge (you could step out of one of the beds and into the bathroom as there was little space between the bed and the bathroom door). However, there was a good space between the beds and the fridge and microwave cabinet, so we were able to place our two suitcases at the foot of the beds). Heating was excellent (and it was a cold February). No noise whatsoever (advantage of looking on to a brick wall). No noisy neighbours, fortunately. The LCD screen on the wall saved space and was perfectly located to watch TV from the beds. Alarm clock, telephone, good reading lights, closet with iron and ironing board. Clean. SERVICE: Reception staff friendly and helpful. We did not have any special requirements but we were pleased with the attention we got whenever we asked about something. As we left early in the morning and returned late at night, we never got to see any of the cleaning staff, but room and bathroom were always clean when we returned and the free coffee, tea, creamer and sugar/sweetener were always replenished, holding enough for 4 servings every day. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The hotel is suited to all budgets. We chose a mid-price option. There is a smaller ensuite room with only one double bed for a lower price, and if you are really tight, there is a room with shared bathroom for even less. If you want to splurge, there is a junior suite. You will certainly find what suits your pocket best. And you can't go wrong (provided you keep in mind that the lower the price, the smaller the room). The two computers in the lobby with internet access were always available (for US $ 1 every 5 minutes: you had to put in a $1 bill and keep adding bills according to necessity). On the 2nd floor there is an ice dispenser and a soft drink vending machine as well as the international phone card vending machine. BUDGET MINDED TRAVELLER TIPS: I cannot emphasize how important it is to have a microwave, coffee maker and fridge in the room. Eating out in New York is expensive because you must add a 8,8% tax to all menu prices + 17% (twice the amount of the tax) as tip. This means that for a $20 meal you will end up paying $25. Figure that out for breakfast too. So you get to make important savings by returning every day from sightseeing and making a stop at the supermarket to pick up your dinner and next morning's breakfast. We did not try the MacDonalds (which offered good bargains) because we preferred to try out a new dish/breakfast fare every night getting it from the supermarket. You can also try the Gourmet Deli next door.

Hotel Newton fit the bill perfectly. No one should come here expecting a lot in amenities--the furniture, decor, etc. are dated (I had a tube TV in my room) but the room, linens, and bathroom were very clean. In fact, the whole place smelled faintly of soap to me, which is not a bad thing. Service was minimal, although the desk staff was perfectly friendly and helpful when I had questions. As a solo traveler, I opted for a room with a single bed--the room was VERY small but fine for purposes of just having a place to crash for the night. I can't speak to the shared bathrooms because my room had its own. I concur with the other reviewers that one of the best things about the hotel is its location at Broadway and 95th Street. It is steps away from the subway line that takes you directly to Times Square and the theater district. Penn Station is on the same line, so the hotel is super easy to get to if you are coming into the city by rail. One subway stop from the hotel and a quick crosstown bus ride will get you to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There are plenty of cafes, drugstores, shops, etc. nearby. My only real beef was a bit of confusion over the room rate. When I called, the desk attendant said he had two options: a room with a double bed and shared bathroom, or one with a single bed and its own bathroom. I thought I heard him say he would give me either for the same price, $85 a night. I opted for the single bed, but when he transferred me to someone else to make the reservation, that person said no, the single bed was $100 a night. I told him I would see if I could get a better deal online, and lo and behold, I got the single bed for $85 a night on the hotel's own website. I have no idea what that was about, but I didn't ask because I just wanted a cheap room, not an argument. I wouldn't let that stop me from coming back, but I would definitely do my homework to get the best rate. Also, I HATE being charged for wireless internet service, and Hotel Newton charges $5.00 a day. That certainly pales in comparison to some other places, though. I'm the kind of person who would rather spend my money on seeing the sights and eating good food than on paying for expensive hotel service.

Now the negatives - The bedding looked to be on the older side and the mattress was pretty hard Some of the rooms in this hotel evidently don't have an ensuite bathroom. My room did have an ensuite bathroom but the communal facilities were right next door which made for a pretty noisy night. The corridors are extremely narrow which also contributes to the noise - there seemed to be a party in the adjacent (bathroom-less) room which lasted all night long. Also the hotel only has 1 elevator (for guests and staff) which in an 8-story building means some pretty long waits.

I have never written on one of these sites before, but think that the Hotel Newton is a real gem of a hotel that everyone should know about! I have stayed here on 2 occassions now, once when I was travelling to NY on my own and this year with a group of 4 friends. On both occassions, I have had a wonderful stay and found no problems with this hotel. For the price you pay, the hotel is great value. It is clean, the staff are friendly and the rooms are of a good size. This year we had a double room, which was spacious with comfortable beds, flat screen tv, coffee maker, fridge and a microwave. The bathroom was a good size and always clean, with new towels etc. The hotel does not have a restaurant or bar, but let's be honest...you don't really eat at your hotel when you have the whole of NYC to explore!!! (We did eat at the diner next door and the pancakes were fab!!) The staff are friendly and were particularly helpful during our stay as it was during the time of the snow and blizzards, and therefore our flights had been cancelled. The best thing about this hotel is the location; it is far enough away from the tourist hustle and bustle, but has a subway stop right outside which means you can be in Times Square in no time at all. It is a few blocks from the park and also located nearby are Mcdonald's, Starbuck's, a pharmacy, diner, grocers, newsagents etc. I think this is a fab hotel and have recommended it to friends and family. I would definitely stay there again.

Check in was a breeze thanks to the friendly, efficient staff who always had a cheery greeting when we left or entered the place. The room (7th floor) was more than big enough for the two of us, and was spotlessly clean every day. The aircon was slightly louder than we are used to, but as we stayed during a heatwave it served its purpose well, and kept the room nice and cool. Good sized bathroom, with plenty of hot water and good pressure (handy when we were returning to shower and change two or three times a day thanks to the heatwave) The Microwave and fridge hardly got used, but came in handy when they were. Somewhat disappointingly, the Key West Diner next door had just closed for renovations (if you look at other reviews, this place gets brilliant reviews and comes recommended by the Newton), but the hotels location meant there were several alternatives nearby, including the City Diner (Key West's sister establishment) a few blocks south, however, if you leave the hotel, turn left and go one block there is a great food cart that does the best egg and bacon rolls, along with other things, for $3 - a great way to start the day. The lift has been mentioned numerous times in other reviews and, perhaps, rightly so. It was quite slow to get to your floor, didn't hold a lot of people, and was out of order one morning; granted it was fixed quickly, but we had a several storey hike down the stairs. There's probably not a lot the hotel can do to upgrade the lift, so while it was a slight downside to the stay, it's not something anyone should look at when considering a stay here. Internet access is available for a fee ($4.95 per day if memory serves) which, when a lot of hotels now offer this for free, smacked a little of 'penny pinching', but once connected the wireless was one of the more stable connections we've had in a hotel. The location was a double-edged sword for me, as there was a subway station half a block away (1,2 and 3 lines) and a couple of bus stops nearby but returning to the hotel (after shopping, or for the aforementioned shower/change pitstop) took longer than what we would have liked, or if we had stayed more midtown. This can't be considered a criticism however, as it reflects more on what we wanted to see and do, which seemed to be more in the south of the island/in Brooklyn, so we maybe should have considered location more carefully.

We had a junior suite on the 8th floor for a week, and one on the 4th floor next to Broadway for 3 days. Both were a good size and very confortable, but had slightly different characteristics. The 8th floor room was better designed, but the A/C was very loud. We couldnt turn it off as it was hot and humid in NY at the time. However, it did had an advantage. The room was not very soundproof, so it drowned out the noise of the hallway and other guests. The 4th floor room was not laid out as well, but the A/C was a lot quieter and the location at the end of the hall was also a lot quieter. I was aware of the lift situation before I booked. I used it as a character building excercise and tried to think of the money I saved staying here, but I have to admit that after 1 week of putting up with it, I was a bit fed up. The lift is slow and is busy often enough to require tolerance. However, it is not enough to stop me from staying again.

The hotel location is great, right next to the subway and in a good neighborhood. Hotel is very clean. There is only one elevator that is really old and slow and hot, not awful but not great- take the stairs if you can. The room was very small but delivered on what was promised- double bed, flat screen tv, microwave, fridge, dresser, desk and private bath- not much room to walk around. The bed was ridiculously firm. Service was fine, we didn't have much interaction with the staff other than checking in and out. The diner next door is typical but service is lacking- eat somewhere else. My only issue was on our last day, we called the front desk to get a cab. I was told the ride would be $65 to go to the airport (JFK) even though the ride to the hotel was only $45 plus tolls and tip (tolls were $5.50). The cab the hotel called was a private cab not a NYC yellow cab so the price was higher- I had to ask, the information was not shared with me. We were unsuccessful hailing a cab on our own outside so we just went with it. I asked again about the price and the front desk assured me the cost was $65 flat. We get into the cab and pull away to find out the cab was actually $70 plus tolls and tip. I told the driver what the front desk told me and he got upset stating \"This is why I hate picking up from this hotel because they don't tell the truth.\" He proceeded to tell us this wasn't the first time this had happened and that the hotel actually charges him $10 to pick up people from the hotel (we saw him go in to pay the desk so I don't think this was a lie). We could've jumped out and hailed a yellow cab but the price of two cabs would've been about the same, so we just dealt with being ripped off. Then I asked to be sure the cab took credit then he informed me it would be an additional 10% fee to use a card. Ugh! The driver was nice enough to pull over at an ATM so I could get cash and avoid the fee. I just wish the hotel was more up front with us. I'm sure the hotel would blame the driver but I really felt like the driver was legit. Anyway- give yourself extra time and walk 5 blocks to hail a yellow NYC cab- save yourself the cash and stress. I recommend this hotel if you can't really afford anything else. We picked it for the price and the fact we didn't have to share a bathroom.

I can say that things because a few day after, when we came back to New York, after a trip to Washington DC, we spent two nights in an other hotel in the theatre district (49th with 8th) and it was a terrible experience comparing with Hotel Newton.

I had a Superior Double room, which was probably the smallest hotel room I had ever been in (my first time in NYC; I understand that's the norm there). The room was very clean, and was straightened up daily. The bed, while kind of hard, was OK, and I slept fine (after walking all day!). I had plenty of clean towels and soap and shampoo. The bathroom was obviously recently renovated, and the sink, toilet, and bathtub were very nice and new. Again, the bathroom was very clean. I really enjoyed having a fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker. The staff were all very courteous when I interacted with them (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to spend as much time talking to the staff as some other reviewers do). The neighborhood seemed quite safe, although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk around at night. The Key West diner next door has good food and I ate several meals there.

The 96th St. subway station is close, which allowed me to get up or downtown easily, and there is also a crosstown bus on 96th St. that goes across Central Park to the Upper East Side and Museum Mile.

Before booking I emailed the hotel on several occasions regarding the room sizes as we needed a room for me and my husband and a seperate room for my mom. On every occasion that I emailed,the reservations manager responded very quickly and I was very impressed with the service. We booked 2 superior double rooms. We arrived at the Newton approx 6pm on the evening and was greeted by Landry and Charles who were very friendly and helpful. We went up to our rooms and was very impressed with the cleanliness and size and it had all amenities we could need including fridge, microwave, coffee maker and TV. The bathroom was a decent size, very clean and had a lovely shower. Maid service everyday, beds were comfy and rooms were warm. Ok, so there wasn't much of a view but we were only in the room to sleep and get ready and the rest of the hotel made up for this. The reception area was welcoming with internet and was decorated nicely. As it was christmas, we wanted to go and see the tree at Rockefella Centre so Landry pointed us the right direction telling us where to get on the subway and where to get off. The subway was very close and convenient and we used this every day to take us to Times Square (42nd St). The Subway journey was approx 5 minutes. Next to the hotel was Key West Diner. This Diner was fantastic. Service was excellent and we ate in here every morning for breakfast and had an evening meal. All food was lovely. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and by the 2nd day, they knew our breakfast order!!! Whilst in New York we purchased the city Sights 3 day bus pass. This was excellent and value for money. You could hop on/hop off the bus wherever you wanted and had a tour guide on every bus telling you all about New York and the places you were passing. The pass also included free entrance to Top of Empire State Building, statue of Liberty and Ellis Island along with some money off vouchers for shows and restaurants. The ticket is purchased from men in yellow coats who are all over the place in Times Square. The hotel is conveniently located with shops, restaurants, 24 hr drug store and snack bars all outside the door. It is also within walking distance to Central Park. Overall, we had a fantastic time in New York and would definately return. It was all we imagined it to be and more. We hope to return next Summer and will 100% be staying at the Hotel Newton.

The added bonus was the convenient subway stop (right at 96th street which was also serviced by express trains and as a late night stop on the red line) just a second away. We felt safe getting back and forth. The other plus was an in room air conditioner and microwave. Also, I forgot $100 in my drawer one day and the cleaning staff were trustworthy (I can't say as much for another much more expensive hotel midtown who stole a picture frame from my room) as when I returned, it was still there. There is shopping and convenient diners nearby, plus a starbucks on each side of the street as well as Tim Horton's, McDonalds, etc and much more little places on the periphery. Two bodega's where you can buy beer / etc and a drug store practically downstairs. The only downfall is the older elevator which broke twice when we were there and the 9th floor was a long walk. However, they were prompt in getting it back in service. The major plus was the convenience, bathroom and cleanliness. I'll stay there every time I return based on those three points. The most important being clean...just because you are on a budget, there is no reason anyone should have to deal with bugs of any sort...and the Newton definitely takes cleanliness as a high priority. The room was small but I was happy for that sacrifice as the furniture was in good shape and it had ample storage for our 3 huge bags as well as an iron and ironing board. We just took turns getting ready in each room. We stayed in the Superior Double. If I were to make one small recommendation, it would be to update the bed covers with a microfibre duvet and this would be a superior value. We visited friends who were staying at the Plaze and paying 10x our price and when compared to that scale of difference, we were extremely happy with the value for our money.

Though the price was right, I feel an obligation to share my disappointment in this hotel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that the location of this hotel is ideal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s across the street from the subway and conveniently located next to banks, drugstores, diners and cafes. To the point, if you are given an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc07\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, switch! Even though we had requested a room with two single beds, we were given a room with one double bed, which wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a big deal if the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so small and run-down. It was no joke, maybe a foot larger than a king-size bed. Not only that, this room had not been updated like the rooms in the photos you see posted by other guests. The carpet felt damp, the wallpaper was stained, the bathroom could only fit one person in at a time and it felt all around dirty. We even found hair in our bed which made us think the sheets had not even been changed. We were so tired from moving that we unpacked anyways and settled in for a very uncomfortable night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read that the a/c units were loud, but this one sounded like a semi-truck revving its engine every 15 minutes. Needless to say, we did not sleep well and requested a new room the next morning. When I first asked about switching rooms, the front desk person who had originally checked us in told us that they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all booked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When I asked to at least be changed for the 3rd night, he proceeded to generate two new key cards for us and told us that we could move into a new room right away. Our first feelings were of relief as we moved next door into the room with the two twin beds that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been expecting, only to then realize that this room had been available all this time and that he had lied to us about being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all booked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard of this being a hotel practice, but it left us feeling enraged and very much ripped off. As we returned our original keys, we made a point to the front-desk person that the rooms were very different from each other and should not be considered of equal value. Instead of apologizing or offering some cheesy customer service line, he told us there was no guarantee, implying that he was doing us a favour by changing rooms. It was not the reaction we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been expecting and left us with a bad taste in our mouth for the rest of our stay. If you do decide to stay at this hotel, be prepared for the following: - poor service by the front-desk - slow elevator - no in-room safes - thin walls (you can hear your neighbours wake-up calls) - dirty and dated hallways - small bathrooms (though we were pleasantly surprised by the heated floors of our new bathroom because of the location of the hot water pipes) - limited bellman service - 30 minute walk to Columbia (or 2 stops on the subway) In the future, I would look into staying elsewhere, possibly at a hotel chain.

It is walking distance from few things, but the location's best because you're a block and a half from the 96th st station, which will take you downtown pretty quickly on an express train.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "g0ldstein", "Title": "\u201cThis is a find.\u201d", "Author": "cohendiane", "ReviewID": "UR29544878", "Content": "Enjoyed recent stay.

The room each time for me was small, but I always mistakenly reserve a single bed. I see that the manager reads these reviews so I wanted to give some constructive comments. The first is that there was no blanket on the bed. Only the thin bed spread. Not sure if this is the case in all rooms, but I did not enjoy that. Also when I was being checked in by Landry, it really felt like I was doing him a favor. He was more interested in talking to his coworker about how he would like to go to Texas and stay with his parents and sleep for a month. He is not an asset to your hotel. I read most of these reviews and it appears the majority of your front desk staff is very pleasant. He was not. I did encounter another front desk clerk in the evening who was quite nice. The last comment is that I was on the third floor and there were roofs and ac units that could accomodate a possible intruder. I could not for the life of me get the windows to lock. I was a single woman staying alone. So that concerned me some. But not enough to call for assistance. The situation could possibly have been remidied by staff. As stated, I will stay here again.

The Newton Hotel is situated on the Upper West Side in such proximity to the subway, Central Park, restaurants and cafes as well as good shops that it is hard to wish for a better location. Anyone who wants to stay in a safe neighbourhood should consider this hotel: they will not be disappointed. Secondly, accommodation. I had a double room on the 2nd Floor overlooking the Broadway (I got what I requested at the time of booking) which was clean, comfortable, warm and spacious. Don't get me wrong - the room was not big but not tiny either: just a good size for a single traveller. I guess it might be on a smaller side for 2 people but it was perfect for just one. As mentioned in previous comments, I found the coffee machine with free coffee sachets extremely useful. I also appreciated the fridge and, although I never used it, I am sure other guests appreciated the fact that there was a microwave oven in the room too. Overall, I had an impression that whoever designed the rooms had the guest and their comfort in mind first and foremost. Bathroom was small and somewhat awkwardly designed but very clean with good shower and good quality towels. It was cleaned every day (not that I made any mess!). Also, the shower curtain was superbly clean, or I might have been lucky to have gotten a new shower curtain altogether! The furniture was not luxurious but functional and (important) did not look like it was picked up from some discounted store just for the sake of having some sort of table and chairs in the rooms. Basically, the furniture was simple, relatively new and practical. I wasn't sure about the bedsheets though: some days I would have the nice and crispy sheets, and the other day I would end up with the old and somewhat worn out ones. It would be great if the old ones were discarded altogether and the newer ones used all the time. Also, a couple of times, a change of sheets would constitute the top sheet being put on a mattress and the mattress sheet used as a top one - this I didn't like at all... And last, but not least, the staff. I wouldn't say the staff, overall, was very friendly but everybody was very efficient which, in my book, is really important. Of course, efficiency combined with genuine, courteous friendliness would go a long way but maybe it was just the winter blues that some of the staff members were affected by. In any case, I did not have a problem with it... it's just the atmosphere could be a bit lighter and more welcoming with a few smiles here and there. And finally, I would definitely stay at The Newton Hotel again.

Every day we had to go through the process of asking for more. The maids also turn the air-conditioner completely off after room-cleaning, which left for a very hot room after returning from sight-seeing. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!

The Newton looked like the best of the bunch, and overall, it delivered. I booked the junior suite for the extra roominess. It comes with two double beds and a refrigerator and sink. The bathroom was fine, although the shower was divided from the rest of the bathroom only by a shower curtain, so you ended up wetting the entire floor. (Judging from the photos on this site, most of the bathrooms aren't designed this way. Maybe it's just the suites.) If it bothers you to stand at the sink while the floor is wet, bring flip flops. And what everyone says about the towels is true -- they're little bigger than hand towels. Management may have been trying to save money, but I don't think towels are where I would have skimped. Unfortunately, my room looked out on the adjoining building rather than the street, so there was very little natural light. On a bright spring day, I had to turn all the lights on. The room was just too depressing and dark for me, and it wasn't helped by the dark carpet and furniture. As a result, I spent as little time there as possible. If I'd known that in advance, I would have booked a regular room and saved a bit of money. I liked the neighborhood far more than I was expecting. It's a (relatively) quiet residential area with nice restaurants. I can recommend the Aix Brasserie on 88th and Broadway, but some of the restaurants on Amsterdam Avenue also looked interesting. This hotel is fine for the money. If you just want a place to lay your head, in a quieter neighborhood that's still convenient to the rest of the city (thanks to the excellent 1,2, and 3 subway lines), you could do worse. P.S.

The city has definitely bounced back from 9/11 and the hotel rates certainly reflect that. Having last stayed in the city in 2003, I was amazed to see what hotel rates are going for these days. I wanted to take my girlfriend to New York City but wanted a quiet neighbourhood hotel on the Upper West Side for her first visit to the greatest city in the world. After much research and tracking the reviews for the Hotel Newton on this website, I booked a room in mid November 2006 for 7 nights through their website. I chose a room with 2 twin beds and I was not disappointed. After taking the subway in from JFK airport after our arrival (a story unto itself, but worth it at only $2.00 one way!) we arrived at the Hotel Newton at 8:30 a.m. I was happy to learn that even though check in was at 3:00 p.m., the room was ready and we were able to check in and get a few hours sleep before we hit the town. The room was clean and neat, bedding changed and fresh; plenty of fresh towels and a good sized room for Manhatten which contained a desk and a TV with plenty of channels. As I mentioned, the room was large for NYC and we had plenty of room in the 7 days we occupied it. What I first noticed about the hotel is how quiet it is! I began to wonder if we were the only ones staying there and at night I was never woken up in the middle of the night by a door slamming or people returning to their room after a late night. Another good thing about the hotel is that it is non-smoking which is great. Our room did not have that lingering odour of years of smoking. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of making up the room each day with fresh towels and a through cleaning of the room. The hotel staff was cordial and spot on about responding to requests - even dealing with the toliet be clogged one day. The room rate was good at $210 mid-week and $250 a night on weekends - good for this part of the city. The location, as mentioned, was superb. The subway for the 1 train is half a block away; there are plenty of good diners in the area; a newstand is right next door (so you can buy your copy of the New York Post and read it over a good cup of coffee and a bagel across the street at the Euro cafe!). Also there is a Duane Reade drugstore on the corner for everything else you might need during your stay. Needless to say my girlfriend fell in love with the city and commented on how nice eveybody was. She can hardly wait until she can return.

I would rate it between average and above average. I am a AAA member and only go to their \"approved\" facilities and this is one of them. It is for those who want clean, basic accommodations and intend to use the room for sleeping and not doing a lot of \"hanging out\" in the room. Yes, it is old and the elevator (only 1) is slow. I stayed in a single room and it was the smallest room I've ever seen. Having said that, it was a lovely room and had everything I needed; single bed, actual closet (not just a rack in the room), night stand with the usual and a small bureau with 3 drawers and the TV on the top. The bathroom was quite modern with bath/shower comb, hair dryer, etc. It was very clean and no problems at all. The employees were very pleasant and helpful. For the price, you can't beat it. I paid $160 plus tax per night for the single with bath. It is on Broadway between 94th & 95th Sts. with the bus stopping 1/2 block away and subway about another half block. The bus runs every 7 or 8 minutes even at night and on Sundays. there are lots of stores to buy snacks, soda, drug store items, restaurants, etc. There is a great fruit/vegetable, grocery store half block away. You really get the \"feel\" of how the Manhattan people live. It was, at most with bad traffic, 40 minutes from mid-town, and usually only 25 minutes. It was ideal for my needs which were sightseeing and plays in mid-town. I would definitely return again. I can only comment on MY experience and it was very good.

We booked the room after reading about it in a Frommer's Guide (listed as a value property) and checking out all the Trip Advisor reviews. We reserved about a month ahead of time and the hotel was full when we were there. We paid $200 for Thursday evening and $275 for Friday and Saturday evenings. We normally would have thought this was exorbitant, but after finding virtually every other hotel over $400 a night, we decided this was a steal. Originally we wanted to stay in the Times Square area, but we're so glad we didn't. We loved the neighborhood feel of this area, and it was so easy to get anywhere in the city on the subway. This was our first visit to NYC and we walked and took the subway everywhere without any trouble. As women and girls, we felt perfectly safe walking around the hotel, even when we took the subway at home after the theater on Friday night. There were always lots of people out and about. We had two adults and two teenagers in a deluxe queen room with two queen beds. It was quite a large room with an ample size bathroom, a fridge and microwave, and an ironing board and iron. Our room overlooked Broadway, but it was not noisy. We did have trouble getting hot water one morning, but that was our only complaint. I guess the beds were a little hard, but we were always so exhausted when we fell into bed that we didn't notice! We arrived about noon on a Thursday and our room was already ready. We also made use of the storage lockers to store our luggage on the last day. We flew in and out of the Newark airport and took a town car to and from the hotel. With tip and tolls, we paid close to $100 but we would have had to pay $14 each for the train plus subway or taxi fare from the train station to the hotel, tote our luggage around, and endure some waiting time. This was about 45 minutes door to door, the driver was very pleasant, and he pointed out sites on the way. It was definitely money well spent. As I mentioned, we loved the neighborhood. While we had plans to dine at a number of restaurants that were recommended to us around the city, most evenings we ate near the hotel because it was just easier, quicker, and cheaper. Plus there were so many restaurants around. We loved the diners because there were so many options. The kids could have pancakes if they wanted while I could have something Greek. There are also a number of fast food type places around for breakfast or otherwise--Starbucks, McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, and a great bagel place a few blocks south. We also hit the ice cream place a couple doors to the north when we came in at night. I think it was open until 11:00. There are pharmacies and grocery stores all over the place, so you should be able to find anything you need. Central Park is just three blocks to the east and we spent a very pleasant afternoon wandering all through it. We would definitely stay here again.

We have both been to NYC several times before and wanted to avoid Times Square and find a neighborhood that was more \"real\" New York. We also didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on lodging. We booked Hotel Newton after research on TripAdvisor and couldn't be more pleased. Trying to stretch our three days, we flew in on the earliest and out on the latest flights we could book. When we arrived early (10-ish) at the hotel we were pleased that a room was already ready for our check in. When we left, we were pleased to find self-service luggage lockers where we could stow our luggage while we shopped. We booked a Twin-Twin, which had two twin beds. We paid $130 for the first night ant $150 for the second. We were pleasantly surprised with what appeared to be a freshly remodeled room and bath. The room had a flat screen tv and large in-room fridge and microwave, ironing board, etc. While small, the bathroom was top-notch, with marble walls and floors, brand new fixtures. Everything in the room and bath was squeaky clean. We liked the intimate size of the hotel; we felt safer than in a huge hotel. Despite being right on Broadway, it was incredibly quiet; we heard sirens if emergency vehicles went by, but no regular traffic and no honking. The only \"noise\" that bothered was was a rapping noise on the second morning which we suspect were expanding radiator pipes. Wasn't bad enough to wake us up, but once awake we couldn't go back to sleep. The hotel has two computers in the lobby for checking email. $1 for five minutes. The hotel is in between 94th and 95th, which is fabulous because 96th is major subway stop (with express and local trains) and 96th also has a cross-town bus to take you through the park to the East Side. We used our feet and the subway to go everywhere. Easy stroll down Broadway to Zabars, H&H, Filene's Basement, etc. The Key West Diner next door was a lifesaver when we were looking for a late (11 p.m.) supper one night.

You should be forewarned that It looks very unimpressive from the street -- all of what must have once been the front rooms of the hotel's ground floor have been let out to various street-level businesses, so all you see initially is a canopy stretching out towards the street, followed by a long hall leading back to a small but attractive reception area. (And don't imagine that there's any pull-off driveway from the street -- you just park at the curb and unload your bags there.) Once inside and checked into our room, however, things were quite pleasant. We had two queen-size beds, a completely modernized bathroom, a decent-sized refrigerator and small desk. We found the hotel to be quite clean. The room was certainly more spacious than the postage-stamp size quarters you'd get at most budget hotels in midtown. The location, one block from the 96th Street stop on the red line and four blocks from the 96th Street stop on the blue line, proved quite convenient. There is an ample selection of casual restaurants in the area -- we, too, had breakfast most days at the Key Lime Cafe, just outside the hotel downstairs -- and Central Park is four blocks away. And now for a few minor caveats. If you're bringing a car, the hotel has no parking of its own. It does have an arrangement with a nearby garage, but when we arrived at 1:00 p.m. on a weekday, that garage's long-term parking was already fully taken. We found long-term parking at another garage two blocks from the hotel, but there we were warned in stringent terms not to even think about asking for our car before the scheduled date of our departure, four days hence. Once we got the parking, it ran $35/day, which we didn't consider unreasonable for NYC. The hotel is readily reachable if you have your own car, by the way. From the GW Bridge, take the West Side Highway down to the 96th Street exit, go a couple of blocks east, make a turn on Broadway, and you're there. The hotel has no restaurant, but there are plenty nearby. Almost nobody on the hotel's desk staff speaks anything other than heavily accented English, and they were not especially friendly or helpful. Don't slip up and leave the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the oputside of your door -- the cleaning staff treats this as an iron commandment, and your room will not be touched.

The main and only problem I had was with the door key which only let you into the room when it felt like it!! This was particularly stressful in the early hours of the morning especially after a few drinks!! I would strongly recommend the diner next door for breakfast, as the service & quality of food there is excellent.

To be honest we were very annoyed with expedia as when we first arrived the consierge told us that we only had one double bed, even though expedia had 'promised' us that we would get two queen beds(- I love my mum, but not that much!) However, the hotel was very happy to offer us an extra bed, which i was going to sleep in but, being considerably taller than my mum-although, not that tall (5ft 8), my legs came way over the side and so, I got the double bed! The lobby is nice and cosy but we were slightly pecimistic when we got up the stairs to our corridor as it had been decorated in a gastly green colour. We were still keeping hopeful though and when we got into our room it seemed to pay off. We had ordered an en suite bathroom, and I must say, it was very nicely decorated. It was actually a walk in shower but that suited me fine, it was nice and spacious. The actual room was okay sized, and we found we fit the extra bed in just fine. There were around 38 TV channels and I found a lot of them very entertaining, they also had 2 Spanish channels. The bed was nice and comfortable, perfect for when you're knackered from walking around endlessly all day! My mum's was probably even more comfortable because it seemed to suck you in to the mattress! There is a wardrobe which was large enough, but could have done with a few more hangers. There were plenty of draws for putting other items of clothing in as well. We got an ice bucket which came in very useful as we were staying on the second floor and the ice machine was right outside our room. The situation of the hotel was perfect as well, the 96th Street Station was right outside the door: just turn left, walk across the road and you're there! The train line (1,2,3) goes right down to the South Ferry, where you can go across to the Statue OF Liberty and Ellis Island. There are also, stops for Times Square and Penn Station along the way. Once you get used to riding on the subway, it just becomes so easy, and you'll realise how easy it is to switch trains. Buses were also good for getting as if you just head a block toward central park, there are bus stops all along the avenue. The consierge were very helpful and prior to leaving, arranged a shuttle minivan to take us to the airport, costing $21 each which I didn't think was bad at all. Also, when we first arrived they offered to place our valuables, such as passports, in their safe behind the desk free of charge, which I thought was very welcoming. They also gave us plenty of maps of the city, the subway and bus routes, and sight seeing brochures. I recommend also picking up a copy of the city guide on the desk as it has a lot of useful information inside, and also money-off vouchers. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay: The bedroom was nice The consierge were very helpful The cleaners did a wonderful job every morning These things make for a great accomodation and one of which I am proud to recommend to anyone!

Room came with iron and ironing board also phone and tv, must leave deposit for international calls, but buy a phone card and use the payphone on the second floor (its cheaper) Get a metro card for $24 for a week u cant lose and get the NUMBER 2 express train to times square (2 stops) around 7 mins, this line also covers rector street for the WTC memorial, Chambers st for Greenwich village and south ferry for liberty and ellis island ferries, so if youre prepared to use the subway location is fine, just make sure you get the express 2 train to times square its soo much quicker than the local 1 train (calls at all stations) beware of the subway at weekends we waited nearly 30mins for a train and couldnt get on it, albeit from times square. I recommend the strand diner which is just around the corner from the hotel found this better than the one right next door, just turn right outside the hotel walk to 96th street and turn right again its about 50 yards on youre right they do a lovely english brekkie although its called the irish breakfast on the menu!!!!!! for uk persons speak slower they understand u better, theres a comedy club around the corner at weekends which was ok and an irish bar on 86th street, scruffy duffys bar near times square was great as well. there is a factory outlet place about 60mins by bus, i didnt go but was told this was the place to shop for jeans, nike world etc (ask at reception) ...... if not century 21 is ok, store is opposite WTC memorial.....

We complained and they did take care of it (they told the ladies they would be told to leave if they smoked in the halls which wasn't even allowed). That was the only problem, but they fixed it immediately. Would recommend to stay there and would tell you to try to get the suite w/kitchen and bigger living area (on off-seasons it's about the same we paid for ours $160.00). Be prepared for a subway trip b/c hotel is on upper west side away from main bustle of city and attractions. That would be the only reason not to stay again.

Plenty of storage space for clothes and baggage. Decor was a little old in the room and quite dated out in the halls. The lobby itself had obviously been re-done in the last few years and looked very inviting. Bathroom was to be honest sub-standard. Basin was not secured to the wall, taps on the bath tub were coming off - and on the last day couldn't be fully turned off, so there was a steady trickle still coming out. Toilet over-flowed twice during our week stay. Having said that, these problems were rectified very quickly every time we reported them. Our room was a little noisey all the time (even in the small hours) as we faced right on to Broadway. But hey, what were we to expect? It's the city that never sleeps! STAFF & SERVICE (****-) The reservations manager Emilio was incredibly helpful by email before we even arrived at the Newton. He is a definate asset to the Empire Hotel Group. Staff were always very attentive and polite (as was everyone who served us in any capacity in New York City). Safety Deposit Boxes, Baggage storage areas, information rack, internet access, longe area and elevators all present and working. Cleaning was absolutely fine, although for one morning our towels were not changed, just re-folded up on the rail. Room was always cleaned upon our return from a day's sight-seeing. IMMEDIATE LOCATION (*****) Coming out of the front door of the Newton you have a small newsagents immediately to your left. Three doors down is a 24 hour Duane Reede pharmacy (sort of like a Superdrug for those in the UK). This does most things you may need, including snacks and drinks. Turning right out of the Newton's front door is the Key West Diner, which is the ideal place for breakfast. This place also does cocktails etc. if you want somewhere close by in the evening to have a few drinks then stumble back to the hotel. Next to this is the Lemongrass Grill Thai Restaurant - excellent food and service, and therefore highly recommended. There's also a Chinese restaurant one further door up, although we never tried this. Opposite (and easiest accessed using the subway underpass) is the Commerce Bank - ideal for changing up those travellers cheques. This is a very friendly and pleasant bank. There's also a Starbucks and McDonalds right accross the street, as well as the Symphony Space music venue. Nearest bar is the Dive Bar ('Dive' as in diving, not hovel!). This is up 2 blocks, turn right down to Amsterdam Avenue, then on your right. It's a small crowded bar, but has plenty of atmosphere. CONNECTIONS TO DOWNTOWN (****-) 95th Street is a little way from the classic sights of NYC, although you can easily walk in to Central Park in 10 minutes. 96th Street Subway station actually stretches about 2 blocks underneath the street (as do most subway stations), so the nearest entrance is actually out of the hotel door and turn left. It's a minute's walk - you'll see it in front of you as soon as you turn left. 96th is a Express stop, so if you time it right you can get down to a Midtown stop (42nd / 34th) in just over 10 minutes. The 1 / 9 line is actually very well connected and stops will take you very close to most of the areas you may want to visit. Even taking the local train down to South Ferry for the Statue of Liberty was only about 35 minutes. That's 3/4 of Manhattan island you're travelling there! Lastly the subway in NYC is in general cleaner, more reliable and LESS imposing that the London Underground. We only encountered one beggar on the train who did not actually make us feel uncomfortable and we did not feel threatened once. Note however that I can only comment on Manahattan island 110th street and further south, and the Brooklyn Heights area. FINAL RATING (***--) Using the average of the 4 scores above gives the Newton 3.75 out of 5. I'm going to mark it down rather than up based on the hotel itself, although it is a close call and required some further thought. I would still however recommend the Hotel Newton to anyone after a budget hotel that's aa little way from the main areas, but still well connected.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tacoma Washington", "Title": "\u201cWhat a surprise!!\u201d", "Author": "bostonretiree", "ReviewID": "UR3266299", "Content": "I traveled to New York for six days with my family (three rooms) and was looking for a hotel which would not break the bank.

I found the place to be clean and the staff polite. Check-in and check-out were both easy- without waits or complications. The elevator did seem to be a bit slow, but I was fortunate and never really had to wait. The room itself was clean with the basic amenities. It was not plush, but it was certainly nicer than I had expected. I found the staff to be accommodating. For example, we asked for extra towels and received them right away. I booked a double/double room. I was a little freaked out by the \"shared bathroom\" concept, but I called before I made the reservation to assure we would have our own bath. One morning after two hot showers, our third guest had cold water. She just waited a few minutes, however, and the water was warm again. Our beds were firm as mentioned in other reviews. After being on my feet all day, however, my back welcomed it. My response to the complaints of previous reviewers about noise outside the windows, thin walls, rattling heaters, etc. is- it's New York City! The buildings are older, you hear things. I just moved from NYC two months ago, and I found the building to be very similiar to my apartment and the apartments of other friends there. We are all professionals- college graduates, many with masters and doctorate degrees, with decent standards of living. I feel as if any noise issues at the Newton might be encountered anywhere else in the city. You aren't on a trip to the farm or the beach, it's a city and it's not a quiet place! All of that said, I slept like a rock (as did my two friends from quieter places who have never lived in New York). If you need complete silence in order to sleep, bring earplugs. You might still hear noise at a posh hotel downtown. As far as the location goes, there is an express train and a crosstown bus only a few feet away! You can't ask for much more than that. If you are concerned about the distance from Times Square, take the 2 or 3 train downtown and you will be there in two stops. You can get most anywhere you need to go quickly with that close proximity to a subway. If you want to go to the East side, you can take the M96 crosstown bus. Your metro card works there just the same, and you get one free transfer from bus to subway and vice versa. Check out hopstop.com if you want advice on public transportation routes, or ask anyone. Most New Yorkers are more than willing to help you with directions. I personally prefer to be where people live, not in the middle of the tourist chaos in midtown. The Upper West Side is a nice neighborhood. Many celebrities live there. As far as restaurants go, Lemongrass Grill a few doors down has good Thai, and Mama Mexico on Broadway between 101st and 102nd is a fun, festive Mexican restaurant. I hear Carmine's is a a good family-style Italian place on B'way and 91st. Somewhere near Carmine's is a Tal Bagels, for a good, authentic New York bagel. Tom's Restaurant is on Broadway and 112th. It is where Suzanne Vega wrote \"Tom's Diner\", and you might recognize it from all of the outside shots of the restaurant in Seinfeld. The food is nothing spectacular there, but it's \"pop culture historic\". I also like Cafe Con Leche (Cuban/Dominican food). I have been to their other location on Amsterdam b/t 80th and 81st, but I noticed they also had a location near the hotel on Amsterdam b/t 95th and 96th. If you don't find any food you like around the hotel, go down one or two stops to 86th or 79th. There are plenty of restaurants in the \"80s\" block along Columbus or Amsterdam. My out-of-town guests always liked Cafe Lalo on W.83rd b/t Broadway and Amsterdam. It was featured in You've Got Mail. It's a cute place, and they have quite an extensive dessert menu. (Go there for dessert, not a meal.) In conclusion, if you are looking for a luxurious place to stay in New York City, don't stay at the Newton. (But expect to pay at least twice as much per night.) If you want a decent, clean place to sleep in a good location in Manhattan, I recommend the Newton. For what you pay for it, it's a great deal.

The elevator, as some have said, is slow, but when you are on vacation who cares about spending an extra minute waiting for it. You could walk down the stairway no problem - right next to the elevator. My room was right next to the elevator and I did not notice it at all. My room, as all say for NYC, was very small. 2x4 meters with a single bed, one window with air condition and a relatively decent size bathroom. That one was very clean and had a great surface for laying out all the toiletries. There was a small closet, TV worked great and some drawers that I had to de-dust before I put something in. But besides that the rooms were cleaned every day. I always take slippers with me and felt that I needed them. That may be just me. Soft drink machines are only on the 2nd floor. But I preferred going to one of the many drug stores, some of them being open 24h. They are right across the street and even at night did I not feel uncomfortable walking about by myself. There was a downside - my room was right above the Key West diner (which I agree is not that special) and so early in the morning there was a distinct smell of fried bacon in the air. I could not get that out of the room with anything. But it woke me up and made me get ready for town. Only trouble I had was the bed. I like sleeping on the side and for my taste (and my hips) the bed was too hard. I tried stuffing something under the linnen to soften it a bit, but it did not help much. It was a small bed too, just about 1m wide. Enough. All in all, I felt that little room was just enough because I was there only for sleeping anyway. The location is great. Really go for it - being that much on the upper west side doesn't matter at all. Right a few meters from the entrance to the hotel you find the express subway station which takes you downtown in just 10 minutes. It is a good line that will take you all the way to battery park if you like and sort of stops along the way of so many attractions. When I left, they let me store my bags. And a bonus - when taking the shuttle (blue van which I would recommend) - the hotel is the first they go to and the last to pick up poeple - more or less. So good location for that as well.

Agree with other posters who liked the location; it's pretty far uptown, it's true, but very close to subway stations, and we liked coming back to a reatively quiet neighborhood after the frenzy of midtown. I don't share others' enthusiasm for the Key West Diner, but we loved other restaurants in the neighborhood, especially Carmine's and the Lemongrass Grill, a Thai place next door to the hotel. Our room was very clean, comfortable and in our opinion an adequate size.

Considering the rates were so cheap (a little over $500 for 4 nights is cheap by NYC standards) we were a little apprehensive and were expecting the worse. We were pleasantly surprised. The lobby area was immaculate and although not the cheeriest of people, the front desk staff were efficient. The room was small but very clean, and had a good sized bathroom. The bed was comfortable and immaculately made up every day. The location was not a problem - it was only a few stops to Times Square on the subway and walking distance to Central Park. Overall, we found it to be good value for money and much much better than the Hotel Pennsylvania where we stayed the previous year.

It was a very good deal. The rooms were clean and well-kept. The staff was polite, courteous and helpful. While it was a bit far from some places, the subway was very close by and it really did not take long to go anywhere we wanted to go. We both run, so being close to Central Park was a plus. Up the street was a good bagel place, a very reasonalbe (and good) Chinese restaurant (I think it was called the Empire), and a \"Gourmet Garage\" -a nice, but small grocery store. A week later we stayed at the Hayden Hotel, which was in the same price range. While it was closer to Central Park and was probably in what many would consider a nicer area, there was really no comparison. The Newton was much, much nicer and a far better deal.", "Date": "October 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kettering, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value\u201d", "Author": "Ellis40", "ReviewID": "UR2792051", "Content": "I booked the hotel on the strength of reviews on this site and then became a little concerned when close to the date of my stay a few bad reviews appered. However I had nothing to worry about. The twin room was large (I'm not american so don't have high expectations!), it was extremely quiet and all the services worked (we were in an en suite). To say that the hotel is away from the action is unfair as the metro stop is only 50yds from the front entrance and if you catch the express train (for which we never had to wait more than 3 minutes) you are two stops away from Times Square. Even going to catch the Statue of Liberty Ferry took no more than 25mins. There are lots of restaurants near by and it was never a dodgy area. For a good clean stay I couldn't reccomend it more.", "Date": "October 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield, CA", "Title": "\u201cNew York was great, hotel was not\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2771276", "Content": "The room was ok, clean if not small. But they put us on the second floor facing Broadway. The Flags flapped all night and the street noise was unbelieveable. A \"shoe shiner\" had claimed the hotel's front door as his prime location for \"shining\" and he carried on conversations with whoever would stop quite loudly all night. You could hear the garbage trucks outside the hotel, so noisy. The elevator was so slow we just walked up and down the stairs even with our luggage upon check out. On the second morning of our stay the hot water didn't work. The maid was nice, but that's about all the nice things I have to say about this hotel. Plus it would be nice to be closer to the action, this was too far up the west side. lower is better. After a full day of site seeing, its worth it to pay more for a better place to get some sleep at night! This place was cheap but you could tell why once you see the building in person and actually stay there. Definitely not worth the money you save on this place.", "Date": "October 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at the Newton\u201d", "Author": "EMAMOM", "ReviewID": "UR2758239", "Content": "I was a little apprehensive about staying at the Newton, but my sister and I got a good deal on Expedia and decided to chance it for a two day trip.

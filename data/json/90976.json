But did frequent the Starbucks attached to the Hotel often. Staff - loved the front desk people. They were super friendly and helpful when we asked for directions, info regarding airport shuttle, good steakhouses, etc. As well, the valet guys were also very friendly. It did sometimes take more than 15 min to get the car but I guess that can't be helped. Value - excellent for this ideal downtown location.

We usually stay at the Courtyard Magnificent Mile, however that hotel was full. We chose this Courtyard because of its great location! Very near to great restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. Also fairly near Navy Pier, which was good for us as we had tickets to the Shakespeare Theatre. Our arrival was great, the valets were very polite and friendly, the desk staff were friendly and efficient. The elevators were a bit slow and of the 3 elevators, one seemed to be perpetually stuck on the lower level. The room was pretty standard, king size bed, small sofa, desk, decent size bathroom. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We were on the 7th floor, so you would think it was high enough to not hear the street noise. However, I did not sleep at all. The windows were very thin and we faced State Street, which is very busy. Also there must be a fire station or it is the route to a hospital because as other reviewers have mentioned, there were sirens at least once an hour which kept me awake. I could not hear other guests at all, which was nice, but the outside noise was bad. The State Street bread company and Starbucks were very convenient and the breakfast was good. Another thing that bothered us had to do with housekeeping. Check out is Noon and we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. At around 10:00 there is a knock on the door...housekeeping. She didn't even wait for my husband to get to the door before trying to open it!! What is the point of having the sign on the door if they are going to ignore it, and it was 2 hours prior to check out. I could understand if it was close to noon or after noon and maybe they thought someone had accidentally left the sign on, but we still had 2 hours. The positives are that this is a great location and the valets and front desk staff were very pleasant and efficient. The noise from the street really does this hotel in, and we will probably not stay again.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Andalusia, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAll around good place when visiting Chicago...\u201d", "Author": "RobHarley", "ReviewID": "UR123798446", "Content": "I had not stayed at this location before and was pleasantly surprised.

The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet. There's really no much more to add, because that is all I am looking for in a hotel room. As an added benefit, the room setup was a little different that in standard hotels in the the bed faced out towards the huge picture window... a welcomed change. The decor was upscale to the point that I forgot I was in a Courtyard, but rather in a small, privately-owned hotel in Key West. The internet worked, and it was included in the price.

There are a ton of restaurants in the area within walking distance. I had lunch at State Street Bread company and although i felt it was a bit expensive, it was very good. Also had dinner one night at the restaurant. The burger was good. The bartender has a great personality and is very friendly. I was on the 11th floor not facing the street and I still heard the sirens loud and clear. But I must have been pretty tired because I didn't hear anything at night. There is a Starbucks on-site and there is a small convenience area where you can buy drinks, snacks, toiletries and beers. I did order room service one night and my food arrived promptly and hot. O'Hare is a 45 minute train ride from the hotel on the Blue line, which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Very convenient. Midway is about 35 minute train ride on the Orange line, but that's not very close to the hotel. If your traveling to or from the city during either rush hour period, you definitely need to take the train. The traffic is HORRENDOUS and will take easily an hour and a half to get to O'Hare and an hour to get to Midway and vice versa. Wired internet connection in the room I found to be extremely slow. That was quite annoying. The A/C worked like a charm. And as you'll see in most of my reviews, the pillows left something to be desired. I just like them firm. There was a love seat and an ottoman in the room which was great for watching TV. There is an area in the lobby that you can use to check in for your flights and print boarding passes. Love that hotels have these things now in case the airport doesn't have mobile boarding pass capabilities. There is a 7-Eleven right across the street as well in case you need to pick anything up.

I was on the 8th floor and I could hear people on the street talking at 2AM like they were right in my room. The sirens were going all night long too. NOT a good nights sleep on any night there. 2. As others too have said, good luck finding a working ice machine. Mine did not work and I called the desk and they said it would be fixed right away. Needless to say it wasn't and secondly another reviewer made that comment over a month ago. They should put a sign on it is so people know instead of pretending this is new information. 3. Pool / Fitness center. Not sure who designed this one but they put the hot tub right in the entryway to the pool and fitness center. So, if you enjoy a steady stampede of people walking by you was you try to relax, then you are in luck!! I did not see one person using it the entire time and I suspect that is why. The fitness center was AWFUL. First of all, there was no airconditioning. The 76 degree air from outside was actually cooling the place down. I called the front desk and they said someone would come right up. An hour later, no one was there. All three days I was there it was sweltering, smelly and stuffy. The free weights often had no match ( the 10 lb weight just had one ) and the place was DIRTY. I know that dried sweat sitting on machines for days is not up to the Marriott standards. Last issue was cell phone use. For some reason ( the hotel staff couldn't quite figure it out ) you can't get a signal in the lobby or most of the rooms. 3 people I was traveling with with different carriers had the same issue and the front desk told me that I had to go out by the road to make a call.

First, the good: The location was great for nightlife, restaurants, and getting around Chicago. I had no problem walking to various train stations to get around the city, and the hotel is a two minute walk from Michigan Avenue and only slightly further to the Loop. The hotel was immaculate and my room cleaned quite well every day. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly, as were the bellhops and housekeeping staff. Perhaps the best part was the room itself was super quiet; I could not near my neighbors at all, which is rare. I really appreciated that! The bed was also very comfortable! You should sleep very well here. The not so good: The internet is incredibly slow, as other reviewers have stated. There were times it was so slow it was unusable. When I needed to get some work done and answer some emails, I found this very aggravating. Another irritation was I had a daily credit at the State State Bread Company on site. The food there is very average, although there is also a Starbucks. When I checked out, at first the credit had not been applied to my room. It is a good thing I looked closely to make sure they applied it to my bill. None of the front desk clerks were very knowledgeable about the credit. I think they should be taught all the various special rates available online to help them answer questions and make checkout smoother. The people working at the State Street Bread Company all seemed unhappy to be there, and on the weekend they are very slow--don't waste your time there, get out and find something yummier and cheaper (or at least yummier!).

Maybe it was from the pool on the 6th floor (we were on 7th), or maybe the AC couldn't handle the heat wave?

There is a sun deck just outside the pool and there are 2 BBQ grills out there as well. The fitness center is impressive with a half dozen treadmills, a half dozen elliptical machines and an impressive array of weight lifting machines. Only one exercise bike though. The hotel shares its fitness center with an adjoining condo, but I was able to use the equipment without waiting.

The view was, well, uninteresting. I was in a room at the back of the hotel, and could only see the other wing of the hotel and the office building across the alley. The ventilation was a little too responsive: I turned the thermostat down when I was going to bed, and instead of the room cooling off by itself, the A/C came on. The workout room, although small, was a real gym, not just a couple of machines installed in a storeroom. (It was shared between the hotel and a residential building) And there was a Starbuck's and a small restaurant (breakfast and lunch only) just off the lobby. A couple of precautions: This is a busy intersection, and there was traffic noise, including sirens. If you are bothered by that, this hotel may not be your best bet.

This was a work trip but being from Indy, I drove and took my family. Check-in was very friendly, as were the bellmen and doormen. The hallway had a bit of an odor but the room did not. The room was nicely decored and good sized. Beds were comfortable but only had down pillows (I hate down pillows, just a hangup I have). Climate control worked though it was hard to cool down the room even when cranking the A/C all the way. Room amenities included a coffee maker, mini-fridge, cheap hair dryer, iron, and ironing board. No room safe. Wired internet was free and worked well. Hallway noise was not good and I was awakened a number of times by people in the next room talking and coughing. The toilet was what I call a EuroFlush \u00e2\u20ac\u201c powerful, industrial-strength flushing that sounds like a 747, often seen in Europe but rarely in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could be heard through the walls. Cleanliness was neither bad nor great. An assortment of hair of various colors was pasted to the shower wall and even the ceiling. Corners of the shower and floor were grungy. Walls were stained and discolored in places. Caulking was messy. The shower room had no vent, so condensation collected on everything. Hotel amenities include a small pool, hot tub (which had some unidentifiable funk on the bottom that looked like sand or salt), and a nice outdoor deck with barbecue grills. A small business center had equipment that was all out of order. There is a lounge, a small commissary, a Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the lobby, and a restaurant called State Street Bread Company with surprisingly good food. Situated on the corner of State and Hubbard, the location is very good and only about a block from the intersection of Michigan Ave and Wacker Dr, from which you can see what has to be one of the most phenomenal cityscapes in the world. It is a short walk to much of what downtown Chicago has to offer. Like all of downtown Chicago, parking cost is an absolute nightmare and if you are driving you have to factor this in. The Courtyard charged $45 (self-park was $37) per night. Unlike many of the shameless downtown parking extortionists, the hotel does not try to trim more money off you by charging for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in and out privileges.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not familiar with this concept, it is the practice of charging you an exorbitant sum to park and then charging $5-10 each time you want to use your car.

Igor at the front desk, who checked us in, assured me the sofabeds are always made up. I had asked for a refrigerator and a \"feather-free room\" and Igor assured me both were taken care of as they had assigned me - at my request - suite 1515 that overlooks State Street.

We also noted the A/C unit wasn't responding to our lowering of the temperature on the thermostat so I called the front desk to ask for both linens for the sofabed and for an engineer to come fix the A/C problem. Housekeeping didn't show up for :20 minutes and brought only linens and one pillow. It took him another :15 minutes to bring the extra pillow and the engineer came at this time.

There is a Subway sandwich on the side of the hotel, and across the street was Shaws seafood restaurant, very good. Sears Tower was great, Field Museum is a must, Lincoln Park Zoo and the Lakefront area were fun. The Blue Man Group had us smiling the entire time. The Navy Pier has tons to do. The line at Shedd Aquarium was so long and it was very windy on the lakefront, so we didn't wait. Shoppers galore on Michigan Ave, don't miss the cool Lego store! So much to see that we missed.

At no time did we wish we'd booked elsewhere... \"but\", you are downtown. In Chicago that means several things you might not consider. Chicago appears to be in the midst of a 'crime wave', publicized in the local news, and this results in 'all night long' emergency vehicle sirens and horns. We resided on the 8th floor and heard those noises that are common to 'downtown' locations. The room was quiet overall, we could hear 'loud' noises, a slamming door for instance, from other rooms but not normal noises. Additionally, large buildings use large refuse dumpsters and those are changed out at night, late night. These big, metal dumpsters are noisy and you will be made aware of that fact, unless you are a very heavy sleeper. Common big city downtown issues. But present... The room is neither spartan nor luxurious. We found it a little small but effective use of space made it very functional. Desk and computer connections were fine. TV was large and clear, limited channels but overall okay. The bed was very nice, king in our case, and one of the most comfortable mattresses we've experienced in hotels (even B&B). The bathroom was fine, decent space, usual amenities (dryer, iron, etc) and decent tub with 'rain shower' type shower head. That mattress, gotta give it five stars, so comfortable. Many good restaurants are found within a six to eight block distance, easy walking and the sidewalks are traveled by many. It is a social experience. We enjoyed the Grand Lux Cafe for dinner (wild place) and Tempo for breakfast (the in-house restaurant can get pricey!). Unos famous Italian 'pizzeria' was very entertaining and boasts a good menu and reasonable prices, a few blocks north and west. Of course, Starbucks is in the hotel and busy. A block away is Ruth Chris Steak house and directly across the street is Shaw's Crab House, reputed to be a nice experience. You will not starve unless you stay in your room... and there is room service! And talking about service? That is one area that shines. From the moment we arrived, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Peter (at the door and doing 'bellhop' duty) was very agreeable and gave great advice! He made our stay much easier by helping with directions that were correct and suggestions that were well stated. The desk was pleasant and responsive to our needs. You cannot help but notice when folks are just 'plain' friendly and it makes tipping a pleasant experience. Finally there is an 'in house' exercise room to help burn off those restaurant provided calories. Most hotels have a few cardio machines and one or two resistent based stations. Not this Courtyard. You will be greeted with a pretty complete gym. Free weights, about 12 machine stations for all muscle groups, six treadmills, four elliptical and two bikes. They even have a \"Smith Machine\" (if you exercise in a a good gym, you'll know what that is), surprising and clean, maintained well. Lap pool, whirlpool and a nice dry sauna top off the fitness area.

It was my birthday weekend so there were a total of 4 of us (me and 3 girlfriends). My husband & I have a travel club so we're used to staying in condo only. Check In: We didn't check in till about 2am or a bit later. There were 2 people at the front desk. I walked up to the one guy that wasn't on the phone and he pointed to the guy on the phone. So I waited for him to get off the phone & he checked me in. I requested 2 double beds. I had booked a king room on price line for $92 per night & when I called at 1pm earlier that day the guy told me that when we checked in if there were 2 double beds available we could switch. When we were about 1 hour away from the hotel I called anonymously to ask if they had any rooms with 2 double beds available and we were told there were several. The guy at the counter acted like since I booked through priceline he was doing me this HUGE favor by switching us to a 2 double bed room. But he gave off the impression that he could work some magic and get me what I wanted. Since I had read the reviews on here b4 we booked it I asked for a mini fridge & microwave. He told me that he & the other guy were the only ones working at that time of night, so he could have a mini-fridge to us in the morning, but there were no microwaves left. I said ok, no problem. The Room: The room was rather small for the price. The TV wasn't impressive. Flat screen, but not the thin plasma style, maybe about 27 or 32 inches. The sink outside the bathroom was pretty small, little counter space for 1 person (and there were 4 of us). The bathroom was a good size the shower curtain & rings were very nice. The towels were low quality and smell a little too strongly of bleach. There was a small coffee maker on the sink along with a few packs of coffee, but there wasn't enough sugar or cr\u00c3\u00a8me. There was a nice cushy chair w/ ottoman in the corner. A thin tall desk w/ a keyboard on it. was in the other corner with a firm swivel desk chair w/ a high back. Now on to the best part of our stay... the bed. WOW! It was amazing. Fitting 2 people into a double bed normally would be rather uncomfortable. But this was a cloud from heaven. On top of the terrific mattress & box spring there was a feather bed overlay. It was amazing. You sink right in and don't want to move. Other reviews said they had a problem w/ the feathers poking them, but I had NO such issue. The bedding seemed to be a higher thread count and was very nice. The pool was closed & we weren't tired so we went to look around the hotel. We stumbled upon a room that said 'authorized personnel only', but it was unlocked & the door was ajar. In this room were piles upon piles of microwaves and friges. I can't believe that guy lied to me!! So we used the dolly that was sitting there and wheeled our own fridge & microwave down to our room. NO Breakfast???: The next morning we were looking forward to fresh fruit, muffins, bagels and make your own waffles like I had read about in the review. I called down to the front desk and it rang for almost 1 minute and 40 seconds. I asked where the complimentary breakfast was located. They said there is only complimentary coffee. I was so pissed. If I pay $92 per night I was expecting at least cold cereal or danish or doughnuts or something. I can stay at a hotel for $40 a night and at least get stale doughnuts & coffee & tea. They have a full Star Bucks & a little cafe that serves a buffet breakfast for $15-16. Again I was really angry. Parking: They offer valet parking for $41 per day, BUT you can park less than 1 short block away for $12 per day. Walk out the front door of the hotel, turn left walk about 1 block, maybe 1.5 block and there is a lot that has a guard there 24 hours. Checkout: Check out was speedy, but the woman didn't ask how my stay was, so I didn't say anything. I figured I'd write to the company. A very very very nice bellhop loaded up all of stuff onto a cart and wheeled it down to our car 1.5 blocks away. He was awesome, but I can't remember his name. We tipped him well. Overall, I wouldn't stay here again for the price. I expected more. Maybe I expected too much, maybe I'm spoiled by staying in condos when we travel. This is just my opinion.", "Date": "September 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wake Forest, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGood Location.

A block from the El station and down the street from Pizzeria Uno, ESPN Zone and other restaurants. For a free continental breakfast, it was very good. Fruit, juices, cereal, bagels, muffins, homeade waffles. My only negative was the size of our room. We had a queen sized bed, non-smoking room. The room was small. We did not plan to spend much time in the room, so once we adjusted to it, it worked out fine.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay at the Courtyard\u201d", "Author": "kkoene", "ReviewID": "UR8420036", "Content": "I spent a week here for business, and I was really impressed with this place.

I also enjoyed the free USA Today delivered daily to my room. This hotel is within walking distance of the House of Blues, ESPN Zone, The Webber Grill, and Redfish bar and grill. Also right on a bus line that will take you to Navy Pier and the Mag Mile. Only complaint I have about this hotel is that there is no wireless available.

While I went down to get our things my husband found a half-eaten smelly old hamburger behind one of the nightstands. It looked to have been there awhile. We were both too tired to even complain about it, so we just left a note for housekeeping (after my brave husband put it in the trash).

For the price I paid, it was well worth it. However, the advertised price that you would pay on the Marriott might not be a bargain for this older property in a limited part of town. There are older homes on one side of the hotel directly behind the parking and a closed Schlotzsky's deli on the another. If you are looking to dine out nearby, your options in the immediate area are a small, unimpressive selection of places like the Waffle House and Denny's . However, downtown is just a 12-minute drive away. You do get free wifi, free parking, free breakfast and a free airport shuttle at this hotel. The breakfast was well appointed from healthy cooked oatmeal to yogurt, a waffle maker, fresh fruit, English muffins, toast and more. (Jimmy Dean sandwiches are also available.) The room was clean with a comfortable bed. The air conditioner had an odd smell but everything from the bedspread to the curtains appeared fresh. The small pool was clean but showed some signs of cosmetic wear. The staff had standard bath towels laid out at the pool for use after a swim. All the staff were friendly and helpful.

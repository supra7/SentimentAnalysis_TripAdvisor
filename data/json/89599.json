There are places to see, shop and eat within walking distance. The staff is great. The first time we were there, we had a regular room.

China town and Quincy market within 10/15 mins walk. 4/5 Irish Pubs within 5mins walk. Downtown Crossing Station is 5mins also and it will take you everywhere in Boston. Tip: Sign up to the Omni loyalty program and recieve free Wi-Fi together with free USA today. We took a taxi from Logan Airport for $25, on the way back is on $20.

We booked online and nothing we read about the hotel gave us the impression that we were booking a terrible room and that moreover the staff would do absolutely nothing about it except give us excuses. Our room has 1 double bed that's too high for me to even get into! There's only enough room for one side table turned sideways! The bathroom is larger but there are no shelves, hooks, tables to put anything on which means we put everything including our towels on the floor in order to reach them. The sink is just a sink - there's not even space for you to put down your toothbrush! These may sound like small complaints but add them all together and it makes for a very functionally challenged room! In addition you can't open the curtains because you can see right into the rooms in the adjacent buildings. To top it off the clock in our room had not been changed to reflect the time change so we were an hour behind to start our day thi morning. We told the front desk staff that were not happy with all of this (and I have to say my husband was very nice) and the result was either we take a worse room or we take a table that they woul put in our room.

Sign up to be a select guest (no charge), and you receive complementary wifi, a turn down service in the evening, and a complementary morning beverage for 2 delivered right to your room at a time you designate.

However, I managed to utilize the shelves above the toilet, and because we were out and about all day and most evenings, we didn't need a big bathroom. I might caution someone with very small children since it's nearly impossible to fit more than one person in there at a time. Also, there's no pool or self laundry facility, so if that's a requirement (it used to be for us when our boys were small), you're out of luck. But, again, for us it was fine.

The room was also tiny (and we are from NYC, so we know what small hotel rooms mean). It was not comfortable for a family of 4 at all. If we wanted to move around, we had to rearrange ourselves so we could get by the furniture. Finally, the bathroom was so small, we had little room to get ready and it needed refurbishment. With all that negative, there were some highlights. The location of the hotel is excellent - it is right across from the Old North Church and a block from Boston Common. Easy walking to some great restaurants and very near the T. Also, there were a few front desk attendants who were very nice and accommodating (especially at check out). We had one problem with our TV not working and they addressed it extremely quickly and took very good care of us. Overall, we will probably try another property the next time we are in Boston.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "suffolk", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful .....wouldn't stay anywhere else\u201d", "Author": "Sarah B", "ReviewID": "UR125086903", "Content": "I am so shocked by some of the previous reviews for this hotel, it's so sad that the hotel is run down for the small bathrooms and old decor. It's an old hotel, the oldest in Boston I believe, people must realise that it has probably had the bathrooms added in later years hence the space, but perfectly adequate I have to add. The decor is in keeping with hotel, we had all mod cons flat screen TV and the most amazing bed, best couple of nights sleep I've had for ages, you had to actually climb up onto it it was so sumptuous. Also the hotel staff were all really friendly and made our stay wonderful, even the guys outside on the street and we hadn't even tipped them when we arrived. We also ate in Parkers restaurant which unbeknown to us was where JFK proposed to Jackie, food was very good but large portions. Great breakfast with a choice of buffet or menu, for a couple of dollars more the buffet was great with unlimited juice and coffee and the chef cooked omellettes to order. This hotel is in the perfect location, near shops and restaurants and the freedom trail starts right outside the hotel. Lots of historic buildings all around and the park just minutes away.The stop for the trolley tour is just up the hill so perfect for everything. Just one piece of advice if you go to visit old Ironsides in the dockyard you need photo ID to be allowed on. I did join the loyalty scheme before we went and we were given a top floor room with choice of free drinks in the morning. We were travelling from Boston to New hampshire to go skiing and the staff were very helpful with information and there even is an Omni hotel up in the white mountains which looks fantastic.

The antiquity, the lobby, the location, all of it combines to make a stay here perfect. We arrived on a Friday and stayed two nights. The first thing I noticed was a lack of fan in the bathroom. I called Housekeeping, which informed me that \"none of them work.\" Whoa. Okay ... Then I asked to have an Engineer show us how the heating/cooling system worked. They guy showed me the wall thermostat that could be adjusted and that was good to know. However, you cannot get the fan to stay on. It goes on to either cool or heat the room. I was up three times at least, adjusting it in the dark because the noise in the streets (sirens) and in the halls (bon vivants) kept waking me up. The beds were completely comfortable, high off the ground with a mattress topper and lots of duvets and comforters. On and off they went, depending on the room temp. After a great shower (very good pressure), I went to dry my hair. All heat and no fan. I thought it might burst into flames. Called Housekeeping. They sent up a hair dryer. This one was all fan and no heat. I called the Front Desk to ex(com)plain. \"You want a third?\" she asked, good-naturedly. Nah. The mirror in the bathroom, which is not spacious but adequate, is tiled at an angle, I guess to allow a fuller-length view of the body. However, it then blocks the light from above unless you think to move the top of the mirror back. Just odd. So, although this hotel should be a five-star experience, it ended up average for me because, at bottom, a hotel is for sleeping and that is not what we ended up enjoying the most. The second night I used ear plugs. My daughter, however, complained in the morning that it was too hot in the room and that she woke up sweating and throwing off the blankets. Again, a room should be absolutely perfect for sleeping and this one was not. Also, despite my complaints, nothing was offered to compensate and that is truly no one to engage customer loyalty.

I have stayed in many many top star hotels thanks to Priceline and the Onmi lived up 100%. As a former Boston cabbie I recalled the location but had never stayed there before. Reading up on TripAdvisor I was a bit worried: some rooms have only one bed (3 people?) and views in some rooms look at a nearby wall. I wrote about our plans and threw ourselves on mercy of the Manager and heard from the Insurer of Loyalty assuring me all would be well. Our room when we arrived was great. Two beds and a view down the street towards Gov. Center. Friends: it pays to write nicely to the boss. We were happy as can be. The hotel is dead center for the waterfront, theatre district, commons, Beacon Hill, downtown, Faneuil Hall, etc. etc. The hotel: oldest continuous operating hotel in the USA, very well maintained and history kind of drips out of the place, cool genteel lobby with bars, cafe and restaurant, JFK proposed to Jacquie here, Boston Cream Pie was invented here, Parker House Rolls too, Dickens read The Christmas Carol for the public the first time here, etc. etc. And from the front door you can see the tower where Paul Revere saw the lantern that started our revolution.

Smallish bathroom but I always love and appreciate the curved shower rods for extra room. Lots of towels and great \"products\". Big flat screen TV etc. etc. Lots of pillows! Anyway: I cannot say enough how nice the room was, how well placed the hotel is, how much of a great time we had there. Walls are thick: no noise. Oh yes: They invented Boston Cream Pie here so we ordered it up from room service at 1:30AM! Pie party. Okay it was 36.00 for 3 with the tip but that's called living it up and making it rain!

Not so at the Omni Parker House, where they give you one full size bed. The Omni will tell you that a full size bed comfortably sleeps 2 people. I don't agree. They didn't give us the option to upgrade, but did say that MOST people would find this acceptable, along with a pointed glance at my mid-section, which I took to be a hint that I could stand to lose a few pounds.

Well, it was a very small room w/ a very small bed facing the back alley and clearly was not for two people so I called down and spoke w/ the manager. Have got to believe this was a staff room. Ugly conversation w/ the on duty manager and he ended up threatening to escort me out and verfied that it was a sell up policy but I should have booked it differently and it was all my fault. I offered to split the upgrade, he kept shouting at me that I was changing his words so I just caved and gave up. Too embarrasing... he kept summarizing position which I had not staed and it was a very unnecessary conflict. It was clear this was a sell up. We actually ended up habving a great dinner at a nearby restaurant, a wonderful walk @ Boston and a great breakfast at a nearby coffee house. Good trip but certainly marred by this exchange. The issue was that the manager made it so nasty, that I started noticing the peeling paint/wallpaper in the room, the too small bathroom w/ no room to even put your bathroom essentials, the thin walls where we got woken up in the morning twice by hallway exchanges, the mini bar on a basket in the room rather than locked away and all the little things that spoil a good hotel visit. Would have liked to say that all the little things saved the visit after such a disappointing management response but it was all downhill.

Outside of that, the room was clean and had all the things you'd expect a hotel of that caliber to have. The one not so great thing was the food offered. They had a nicer restaurant called Parkers or something like that that was a little too expensive for what I could expense on the company. The other food option in the hotel was at the bar/pub...and I must admit that the choices didn't look that appealing. That being said, you're in Boston and there are plenty of other great restaurants within walking distance.

Our stay was for one night during the Xmas-New Year's week. Upon arrival, the check in agent asked us if we wanted to wait for a room with a great view, or take the room they had available. We said we would wait, dropped off our bags, and headed off to the Museum of Science/Bunker Hill etc. Agent/Bellman etc all very nice. They have little back packs for the kids also that are a very nice touch. Got back, tired, went to room - and - uhhhh - well basically there was no view. Now I'm not a pain in the neck about this kind of stuff, but given that we were told the wait would yield an amazing view, and it didn't (unless you like looking at office buildings) that was dissapointing, but not a hige deal. The room itself was on the 9th floor - next to a suite. Nicely furnished, ample space in fact better than expected given other reviews i've seen. Beds were VERY Comfortable. Entire room was clean and updated so no complaints at all there - in fact surpassed expectations. Now here's the two (only) issues i had with the hotel. First - the room we stayed in had two doors to enter/exit. We entered the room, latched the door, and left through the other. No big deal right ? Well yeah it kinda was. Apparently we were not supposed to leave through the other door (which would have been extremely useful information) because upon return, our keys would not work. It's ~9pm and I have a tired family.......so working on borrowed time. Call down to front desk, person was less than sympathetic (only person i encountered not really nice) basically asking me how this happened - ummmm it's your hotel i just want to get into my room. I was forwarded to front office whoc sent up a bellman with new keys - guess what - they don't work either (was apologetic) and asked me if i was told not to use this door......uhhhhhh if I had been I wouldn't be standing here with you :) So he stays up there - calls security who comes up and uses his master key - guess what - doesn't work. So they now need to call maintenance (again everyone was nice) who asked me the same question about using the door. Now I'm a pretty even keeled guy, and I kept my cool - but they could tell I was at the end of my rope on patience. So eventually we get back into the room after about 30min which was unfortunate, but let me reiterate the experience was not made worse because the staff were quick to arrive and tried to be helpful. The other note to mention is the sundries store downstairs, big sign says closing at 10pm - it is 9:15 - we walk in to buy water and were told rudely \"We're closed\" uhhhhh okay but your sign says 10pm, response was \"well it was slow\" I mean all we wanted were bottles of water, but hey everyone has an off day i guess. To their credit - the hotel staff overheard this - apologized and brought us some bottles from the check in desk which was nice. The breakfast buffet was really nice as a side note, the hotel lobby and areas were clean and nicely done - the hotel has a lot of charm. I'd suggest this place as a stay, but if there are two doors - always use the one you came in originall ;)", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "kansas28", "ReviewID": "UR122362660", "Content": "We stayed here in September for a long girls weekend.

We walked to the Prudential Tower one morning and even that only took about 30 min. The cool thing about the surrounding environment is the fact that you will run into alot of locals and not just other tourists. The property meanwhile, is clean and well maintained. Decor is classically elegant and rooms are quaint and nicely furnished. Nice touch with the scenic channel and music as part of the turn-down service. Heating / cooling was fast to respond. The rooms that offer a city view provide for sights of the Old City Hall, Granary Burial Grounds, and high risers. However, the rooms are generally on the smaller size, which is understandable considering the building's age. Even though there's not much that one can do about this, it does have to factor into the overall rating. I definitely recommend grabbing a drink at the bar - wide selection of spirits and nice street view for people watching. With regard to service, the Omni did not dissapoint. Service usually carries the most weight for me when rating a hotel and our Loyalty Ambassador, Kate C, was awesome. I had talked with her / her staff six months prior with information about the trip (my fiance's 40th birthday) and it felt like they took alot of notes, because alot of thought was put into the welcome package. The best part for me, was the hand-written / signed Birthday Card. Kudos to Kate for this one. House-keeping, front-desk, and lobby staff were all very pleasant as to be expected.

This area of the city also seemed to be very safe and as a lone female traveler that was very important to me. Having arrived extremely early (about 9 am) I was checked immediately into a room which was than immediately stripped of all down and feather products (due to an allergy). Not only that but they offered to hold my luggage if I would have rather waited for a room to be deep cleaned if my allergy was severe.

Sorry, got carried away for a minute! Check in was very staright forward and we were given a room on the 12th floor with a king-size bed. The room was not massive but more than adequate for our short stay. The bathroom was small and a little old-fashioned but clean and warm. Some reviews comment on the small rooms but this is the price you pay for staying in on older hotel. The location is fantastic and as Boston city centre is quite compact we were able to walk everywhere. The freedom trail is a must and my wife downloaded an app to her i-phone which gave you information as you walked round. The Boston Bruins (ice hockey team) were playing one night. We went to the stadium before the game but the cheapest tickets remaining were $90 each! We were so pleased that we went to Boston, it really is a lovely city with some great history. We were even more pleased that we chose the Omni Parker as our base.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cStay here for its history & location\u201d", "Author": "TerrySisk", "ReviewID": "UR121852239", "Content": "Never have I traveled from an airport to a downtown city hotel in so little time.

As a 23 year-old, this is a little disconcerting, especially since we had to spend a lot of time there due to all the sleety, snowy icy mess outside.

What appealed to me on booking this hotel was the short distance from the airport which is around 10-15 minutes in a taxi and cost between $18 - $25 dollars each way depending on traffic and how much in extras the driver decides to add before setting off. As in previous reviews the standard rooms are a bit on the small side. However a quick chat with the reception staff and a lot of computer clicking and moving people, we upgraded to a suite for not much more per night. This room (1106) was a nice sized room. Lounge area with a sofa and big TV, desk with internet / wifi access, mini-bar and a bit of a view to one side. The bedroom was a good size with a comfortable bed and en-suite. If I had to be picky the bathroom was a bit small and decor wise it let itself down a bit, but was spotlessly clean which is the important bit. I personally found all the staff to be very friendly and approachable and could not fault the service and assistance we had. I also liked the fact that tips wern't expected as in some hotels we have stayed in previously. If they were expected it was hidden very well, and tips given were gratefully recieved, which makes it a much more plesasant experience for all involved! It is an old hotel so do not expect glitz and glamour, and you could be mistaken for thinking it needs renovating. We did use the restaraunt on Thanksgiving evening and had a very tasty meal. Good food portions, served hot and very nicely cooked. Obviously not the cheapest meal as it was hotel prices, but still very nice. Again very good service from polite, friendly and helpful staff. Another nice touch that the lady (Sheri) on reception did was on finding out the trip was a belated birthday present for my wife,sent a personal hand written card with a bottle of fizz and some chocolate covered strawberries up to the room. Again not requested by me, just a nice touch from her, which was a nice gesture, and if she's reading this review thank you again! Location wise we found it to be very good as china town and theatre district were a short walk away, as was Fenuile Market and North End which has a load of very good Italian Restaraunts. We ate in both China Town and North End and had very good, well priced meals with a ton of food in both. Also from a shopping point of view Macey's is just around the corner and the main shopping areas of Newbury Street, Prudential Building and various other streets are about a 15 minute walk across Boston Common. The Common is a nice green area with an ice skating rink and some good buskers if music is your thing. It can also be used to get to Cheers bar which is the one used in the TV show. We had lunch there on Thanksgiving day and had a thoroughly nice meal with good and friendly service, so worth a look in my opinion.It also has the set and a gift shop upstairs as well. One note on thanksgiving if you are planning to visit for shopping. All the shops are shut on this day as it's the equivalent to Christmas day here, although there were convenience stores and restaraunts open, so eating and drinking is not an issue. However, once thanksgiving is out of the way the shops open at ridiculously early times with some good sales/bargains to be had even in these times when the \u00c2\u00a3 / $ exchange rate can be poor. These opening hours on this day are very handy for us Brits and the time difference who find themselves wide awake at 4 in the morning! Boston is a very nice, clean city and all the Bostonians that we encountered we found to be nice, friendly and helpful. From a shopping point of view I think New York edges it, however it's not as manic as we found New York, although we both enjoyed our previous stays there as well.

If you are a planning a stay here you MUST join the loyalty scheme before you travel. It is probably the best and most valuable piece of information I have received from reading other people's reviews on Trip Advisor apart from the obvious \"don't stay here!\" . We joined the scheme which offered complimentary morning drinks delivered to the room, express check in and the services of a loyalty ambassador (booking reservations etc) We were contacted a few days prior to arrival, by their loyalty ambassador, Kate Casey offering to complete any reservations etc for us. I was amused by us sharing a surname and even more so when she informed us that she had a sister with the same name. I explained that we would be celebrating our second wedding anniversary whilst in Boston and would like to book a table in the restaurant for the Monday evening, which was booked for us with a request for the table at which JFK proposed to Jackie (I don't know if we got it, as there were no table numbers and to be fair, by then we didn't care too much!) The loyalty ambassador excelled herself as on arrival, we had been given a lovely room with dual aspect and partial views overlooking Boston Common. Having read some of the other reviews I know we were really lucky to have these views. (When you stay at the oldest running hotel in the US where the city has grown up around it, views are something of a rarity!) But not only we were allocated a lovely room with the biggest, comfiest bed ever- waiting for us on arrival was a chilled bottle of bubbly and some chocolate covered strawberries! We were thrilled. We also had a room with a full bath and a huge walk in closet for our clothes and bags. We were hugely impressed with the service we received from all the staff in this hotel. Everyone from the luggage porter to the concierge were helpful and accommodating. We had been checked in on arrival, we were able to check pick up locations for a tour that we had booked (the concierge telephoned to confirm for us saving us a fortune in overseas call charges) restaurant staff were pleasant and service was good. I know we may have been spoilt during our stay here and may be a little biased having had such a nice surprise on arrival, but the hotel was beautiful. We loved the age and the history of the building and admired the faded grandeur and sense of old fashioned glamour in a building that had hosted (and at times employed) so many famous people. The location of the hotel was second to none, providing easy access to Boston Common, where we walked in the gorgeous October sunshine (We were blessed with fantastic weather too, which always helps!) and to Quincy market where we shopped and ate. The food in the restaurant was excellent, although we filled up on Parker House rolls and really rather regretted it when we couldn't finish our delicious meals- In fact, we didn't even have room to sample the famous Boston cream pie! We always felt safe and well looked after in and around this hotel and the hot drinks being delivered to the room was a godsend! (We followed our stay here with a trip to new York and powdered milk in the first cup of tea of the day is just not the same!) and while I appreciate our stay here may not have been typical, we absolutely loved this place. The only thing we were not happy about was having to leave and if we were to return to Boston, we would undoubtedly stay here again. Thank you to all the pleasant and hard working staff from whom British customer service providers could learn a lot!

Now there are a few things that you will need to know before you decide to stay here. Yes ... the rooms are small, however, the hotel is 156 years old and unfortunately they cannot update the shape of such an old hotel. Although the rooms are small they are very cozy ... the beds were amazingly comfortable and the shower had great pressure. The tv's were updated to flat panels and they had a radio alarm clock with an aux cable for your ipod. I just want to remind everyone that when you are on vacation how much time do you actually spend in your hotel room??? not much!!! so why does it matter how big the rooms are? Unless you are trying to fit a family of 8 in one room this hotel and it's room sizes shouldn't affect your decision. The history alone that this hotel has is enough to want to stay here. I do recommend signing up for the Omni rewards (you get free wifi, beverages and newspapers) ... it's free to sign up and if you don't you will have to pay for wifi. The location of this hotel is right on the freedom trail and it's about a 5 minute walk to Quincey Market. We were able to walk to Newbury Street and Fenway from this hotel and it wasn't that far. The service was 5 star!!! We arrived at the hotel at 10am and although check in was not until 3pm ... they had a room ready for us. The bellhops and the front desk clerks went out of their way to make our stay an enjoyable one. They found out it was my husbands birthday and they sent us up some complimentary champagne and boston cream pie (which were delish). They also held our baggage upon check out so that we could go to the Bruins game before we had to fly out (at no charge). Overall, you cannot go wrong with this hotel.

Ghosts. If you ask at the desk, they have a list of reported ghost sightings and ghost stories about this grand old hotel.

I stayed there in October 2011 for an education conference. My \"haunted\" room was one of the very small single rooms with a window that faced an air shaft. It was nicely appointed with a decent sized walk-in closet big enough to keep my ironing board up. Bath was really, really small, but pretty typical for an old downtown hotel in a large city. As part of the conference, we had breakfast and lunch buffets in the hotel for three days. Every meal was delicious. Service was good, but the servers seem to be highly trained with excruciatingly good etiquette. I have pretty good manners, but I was actually corrected a couple of times by the banquet staff when I was about to use the wrong coffee cup or fork. Wine list was amazing. The location is perfect. Right on the Freedom Trail, very near Boston Common and lots of shopping. Boston is a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd city and I felt perfectly comfortable walking around in the evening alone or with a few other women. Now about the ghost. The hotel is on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ghost Tour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was a very entertaining nighttime tour of old graveyards and sites of gruesome things like Boston Strangler murders. The hotel is on the tour and the guide explained about a guest that was found dead in my room. I thought he was put up to it by my travelling companions, but when he found out I was in that room, he turned dead serious (couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist that one) and told me to ask the desk for the list of ghost stories. The front desk happily turned over the list and my room absolutely was on the list. Staying there alone, I would liked to have known that earlier. Fortunately, the cigar smoke I was supposed to smell from the long departed guest never materialized and neither did the ghost.

The place itself is very ornate and well-built - typical for an old hotel. You can tell it's been updated over the years so the rooms are fairly modern. The bathroom is tiny, but I doubt many hotels in Boston have super large rooms/bathrooms. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is just that there are some parts that look a little neglected. The hallways to the rooms look a little worn out and in the dining room there is a ton of dust, for example, on the ornate crown molding at the top of the pillars. Not a big deal obviously, but one of the things we truly appreciated at the Omni Mt Washington was the service and attention to every last detail.

The next day we inquired about this and we were told that it would cost $50 extra- this is because we didn't book through the hotel directly. We decided not to opt for this, but were disappointed that a hotel of this standard and caliber wouldn't give us a room with 2 double beds (I personally do not call this an upgrade- 1 or 2 beds in a room are standard at most hotels). If the Omni Parker House believes third party booked customers not worthy of the same treatment as other guests, then why even use a third party at all?

The rooms are pretty well updated - the small size of the room is to be expected from such an old hotel. Unfortunately our room had a view of a wall, so it was dark, but we weren't really in Boston to spend time in the room, so it didn't matter too much. We also enjoyed the large hotel gym in the basement. Despite all the good things we can say about this hotel, we were struck by the poor and seemingly stuck up service provided by the front desk and concierge staff. On the other hand, housekeeping and maintenance staff were always kind and considerate. When it began to rain when we were there, we noticed people outside walking around with umbrellas provided by their hotels. Probably about 8-10 different hotel brands on the umbrellas and many of lesser quality brands than Omni. So the next morning we asked the concierge if we could use an umbrella for a couple hours. The answer was a simple \"No, we don't have many and they go quickly\". Did that mean they don't have any left today? None left because they went earlier in the season and were stolen? Hotel staff didn't order enough? They were reserving them for others? When we asked where we could get one, we were told that there are many stores in the area that will have and maybe the gift shop. And then she moved on to other business. We were somewhat surprised by this terse response, but went to a nearby store and purchased one anyway. On our final day, we had an afternoon flight and asked the front desk for a checkout of 12:30 instead of 12. Again, a terse response albeit simple: \"No, we can't do that\". We were told that the hotel was fully booked and despite it being a part of the Omni Select service (and a general offering that has never been refused to us....ever!). We questioned the gentleman to try to use logic to explain that it really didn't make a difference if we stayed 30 min longer since not everyone was staying later, so there would have been ample time to have the room cleaned before the next batch of guests checked in at 3. He said no again. We asked for the manager to explain further and within minutes the same gentleman came back and said ok with such a negative attitude. No explanation, apology or anything else to say. By the way, the reason for our delayed checkout - we were spending an extra $75 in their own restaurant! Personally we would not stay at this hotel again based purely on the attitude of staff, but at the same time we would still recommend the hotel for its history and location if you can get a decent price.

I can understand that as the oldest hotel in the US (perhaps) this is normal. Although I noticed that this room assigned to us is a handicap accessible room so the bathroom is very large, almost the size of the room. given that the room is a 240 SF size room, it lefts very little room in the actually living space. Also, my wife and I also brought our 8 months old son with us so obviously we need a crib in the room as well as a fridge. This is why I actually contacted the front desk before our trip to Boston to ask if a room with fridge and a crib available. The answer was yes so we came. However, with the crib and the little fridge, the room is packed and there is even no room for us to walk. The only place to put the crib is either block the door or right by the AC unit. The AC is quite noisy and it is too cold for the baby. Given all the difficulties my wife went downstairs talked to someone at the front desk and asked if there is a room that we can switch to. She was told that all rooms are sold out and the only option is we just wait until the next day. I thought it was not reasonable since it is really hard for us to manage so I went down again to talk to the guy at the front desk. I was a bit frustrated with the situation so I expressed my frustration to this gentleman. His answer was: well, as we are the oldest hotel in the US, we would like to keep the historic characters to it so even though you think this room is small, sir, actually we already gave you the largest room possible in this class. It is 240 SF, and normally it is less than 200 SF. blah blah blah, none of these helps my situation. He then told me that if we wait till tomorrow we \"MAY\" get an upgrade to a dulex room but not promised for an additional fee of $50. I thought this is not reasonable so I asked can he just cancel our reservation and get a refund. He said: Sir sorry I cannot do that, you do know that you booked from a third party right? If you booked from us directly I can just let you go right now. but you can also choose to talk to your third party agent I cannot help. I felt pretty offended but in order to get our situation improved, i tried one more time to explain that we do need to switch. He then searched again and said that he found a room of 295 SF at the same class but not cleaned yet. I asked when we can move he said that he can give me a call. it was at around 1pm and it is already late for our schedule, and our trip is not to just stay in the hotel, so I have to just compromise to this. I thought we could get the room before or at around 3pm as 3pm is the check in time for most of the rooms so we changed our plan and waited for about 2 hours in the hotel since we cannot just leave and come back and move to another room. But nothing happened at 3pm.We cannot wait and left. I forgot when but very late I got a call and said this room is ready when we were away from the hotel in Cambridge. The voicemail basically told me that i need to verbally agree to hold the room by 6:30 otherwise it would be released. However when I got the voicemail it is already 7:40. So I missed it. When I came back and talked to someone at the front desk and they told me sorry they cannot find anything any more. I didn't argue and just left and dealt with our situation. In the end, we didn't get any decent sleep as the baby was just not comfortable so we have to move the crib into the bathroom or by the door. The baby also got a terrible cold from the AC unit in the room. Thursday night when I got some food back to the room, because it was so small and nowhere to sit, I had to eat my food on the toilet. I hope you can imaging my feeling at that point. This trip was a disaster and I don't even want to mention this trip again. Thanks for your kind email and I do understand the small rooms but I do not understand why there is no consideration of a family of three especially I got a handicaps accessible room.

The room was large and quiet and the air conditioning worked great. Saw some of the reviews saying small rooms and tiny bathrooms so paid a little extra for the executive room and it was worth it. Very spacious room with two double beds, two nightstands, desk with chair, three person sofa, arm chair, foyer, and good-sized bathroom with bathtub, but only one sink. Pillows were not good though. This room is also all the way at the end of a hall all by itself so it was very quiet. You can't expect views in a downtown city hotel, but we got them anyway: a view of the Prudential building and the old and new John Hancock buildings. The hotel is gorgeous and elegant, yet not intimidating. Every staff member was friendly and helpful (except one waitress in Parker's Bar who would just run past our table and I had to call out what we wanted). Even though Boston is a great city with great restaurants, you would never have to leave the hotel if you didn't want to. Beautiful and elegant restaurant; sports bar (Parker's) with views of King's Chapel and Old City Hall; and a more elegant bar (The Last Hurrah) where you can sip a cocktail and people watch as this one faces the street. A bonus was that the bars served Plymouth Gin which is very hard to find. The food was excellent and reasonably priced (at least in Parker's Bar where we ate and restaurant week was going on so you could get a three course meal for $33 in the restaurant). My husband and I split a clam chowder and each had a lobster roll that came with an abundance of crispy french fries which he couldn't finish and I didn't touch as we were stuffed. Much more reasonably priced lobster rolls here than any other place we went (and better than Neptune Oyster House in my opinion). Highly recommend the clam chowder, Parker House rolls, lobster rolls, and Boston Creme Pie (different than the traditional, lighter). We felt like royalty when the hotel left a Boston Creme Pie and bottled water in our room on our first night and delivered hot coffee every morning along with the newspaper. All at no charge as we had joined their loyalty program. There was a coffee maker in the room as well. If it is not being used for a private event, grab a drink at one of the bars, go up to the 14th floor, turn left out of the elevator, up the stairs and all the way to the back of the small cocktail lounge where you can go outside and enjoy your cocktail under an awning with tables and views of Fenway Park and the Charles River.

From the bell boys, to reception, to the bar/waiting staff ( of which there were plenty in all areas), the attention to guests was superb !... Down side was the size of the room (which I expected after reading the reviews) but the bathroom had to take the biscuit, you all probably know the saying 'to swing a cat' but you couldn't even get a cat into the bathrom, let alone swing it!!!!!!. lack of storage space also meant that the hairdryer was hanging (in a bag) on the back of the bathroom door. Also found the mattress on the bed extremely soft and I personally prefer a more firmer bed but still had a good nights sleep. Also liked the fact that there was bath robes available in the closet in the room but USD7 for a 1lt bottle of water was a bit excessive !..

My room was directly across from where all the room supplies were kept - sheets, towels, water, etc. and there was non-stop foot and trolley flow back and forth as they worked from dawn til dusk. It was a big downer and I would strongly recommend people ensure they are not located in this spot. Also, the hotel is very big and often hosts parties, weddings, meetings, etc. The lifts were often very full and I found myself in a perpetual holding pattern to either go up to my room or come down. I think one day a wedding, meeting and party were all occurring simultaneously at the hotel. It took me 9 minutes to exit my room and come down one day, as I had to wait for a lift that wasn't full to capacity. I definitely prefer the smaller, boutique places that aren't quite so chaotic.

One complaint about housekeeping- our ice bucket was not emptied after the first night and the milk bottles they delivered with the cookies were still there after the room was cleaned. The elevators were often full in the morning but since we were only on the fourth floor we took the stairs. It would have been more of a problem if we had been on a higher floor.

It's the oldest continuously operated hotel in the country. It has a fantastic story and many claims to fame, being home to the original \"Boston Creme Pie\" just one of them. Beyond all that, its location couldn't be better. It's situated right in the middle of the theatre district, across the street from Boston Commons. Boston is such compact city with so much to see, most sights and attractions are well within walking distance of the Parkerhouse. The staff was increadibly pleasant and helpful. Knowing it was our wedding anniversary, they sent a complimentary bottle of champaign and chocolate covered strawberries to our room shortly after we checked in. We aren't drinkers, so they graciously took the champaign away and brought us a selection of soft drinks instead. Very nice! The last night of our stay, there was a water main break somewhere in the city. The entire area was on a boil order. The hotel staff quickly responded to the situation, bringing extra water bottles to our room at no charge and allowing the use of the water from the mini bar at no charge. If we needed more, all we had to do was go to the front desk and ask. The suite was beautiful, well appointed and spacious. The bathroom sink area was just a free standing pedistal with very little countertop space. Understanding that this was such an old hotel, I wasn't bothered by this. Some of the other rooms are on the small side, but again, it's the oldest operated hotel in the US, and things were built differently back then. The one disappointment we had was the view, or rather the lack of a view. I was hoping to have a room overlooking the park or the skyline. Ours looked at the side of hotel itself. It was literally 4-5 feet from our window. Not great, but we didn't go to Boston to look out the hotel room window!

From the hotel, it is a 10-15 mins walk to the entertainment district (check out Shear madness, hilarious murder mystery play with improv mixed in, highly recommended) and Chinatown (check out the noodle house, forgot its name but there's always a line-up). Now on to the hotel itself. Upon entering, you notice the great woodwork and subdued yet elegant feeling of the lobby. Front desk and concierge were both very helpful when we needed them. We got a room on the 7th floor, overlooking another building, not the best view but it certainly was quiet. The rooms are smallish but this is to be expected in an older hotel. Not to say that the hotel looks old, far from it. The furnishings in the room were top notch and the bed (queen size for us) was very comfortable, at par with the Westin's heavenly bed in my opinion. Bathroom was a bit small (can't quite have 2 people at the same time in there) but that was no issue for us. Climate control inside the room was efficient. The room comes with Wolfang Puck coffee, which was a nice touch. Hotel has a quite a big exercise facility, mostly cardio and Atlantis-type workout machines. 2 public computers are available, internet is around 7$USD for 15mins of use, but black & white printing of up to 4 boarding passes is complimentary which is a very nice touch. Wifi is available in the rooms at 10$USD for 24 hours. All in all a very nice hotel with a great location and very reasonable prices. ps.

The decor was great, very high quality and stylish. A nice touch was that there were games in the bunk-bed area (Monopoly, Sorry etc) which kept our teenage boys occupied later on in the evening. Only downside about the room was we had absolutely no view (literally a brick wall 3 feet away). However, we were mostly in the room at night so this didn't particularly bother us. The lobby is spectacular as well, very ornate. We had dinner in both the Last Hurrah and Parkers. Found the service in both to be excellent, and the food also good. The real stars of the show were the cocktails in the Last Hurrah though (fabulous - especially the Boston Cream Pie cocktail!). The hotel is very centrally located - 50 yards from the main crossover subway station (Park). We bought a 7 day subway ticket for $15 which was great value. We even used it to get to the airport when we left, saving the usual big taxi fare. It's right on the Freedom Trail and 15 mins walk from the Aquarium. Lots of history about the place as well, it's a tourist attraction in its own right. I've heard the standard rooms are very small - treat yourself and get a suite. If you have kids the Freedom Trail Suite is fabulous. They even brought round complimentary cookies and milk for the boys every night.

The T station is right down the street, literally a 2-minute walk, not even. Many trolleys have a stop close by, maybe a minute further. The lobby is gorgeous, with plush, comfy chairs and couches. We booked an executive room, which has a separate living area, and it was more than big enough for me and my daughter. The beds were comfy, the a/c worked great. The bathroom was tiny, but everything worked just fine and, in addition to the separate living area, there was a roomy alcove where the closet was that had a vanity table with mirror and chair, where we would get dressed and dry our hair, etc. Room service staff was fantastic and wake up calls were cheerful and on time. Parker's restaurant was amazing - awesome food and service and our server, John, treated my 10-yr old daughter like the grownup she thinks she is. Checkout was convenient and timely. The Bad: As a loyalty program member, I should have been brought my USA Today in the mornings, but it never came. The wait for elevators is atrocious - allow extra time to get out of the hotel or back to your room, as we waited a ridiculous amount of time for elevators. Our view from our room was of the brick building next door. We had to keep the shades drawn at all times, so no one could see into our room. But then again, I didn't ask for a nice view, so c'est la vie. The Ugly: Check in was unacceptable. We did arrive 30 minutes prior to check in time, so that half hour is totally forgivable. However, when our room still wasn't ready an hour after check in time, I started to get very testy. My daughter and I were forced to wait in the lobby after a long drive and we really needed to get to our room and get ready and get back out, as we had plans that evening. We were repeatedly told that our room was dirty and there was nothing they could do. They refused to give us another room because they said it would screw up the milk and cookie turndown service for the next night, which I thought was ridiculous. We were offered an appetizer to help make amends, but I wasn't going to hang out in the bar with my 10-yr old so I could have a free appetizer. That certainly doesn't get me in my room any quicker. We weren't the only ones, either - there were so many people waiting in the lobby, clutching their luggage, there wasn't anywhere to even sit. And we observed the same thing the next day, when we happened to be going through the lobby about 90 minutes after check in time. They seriously need to get their act together on this issue.

After trying to get a refund from price line which is impossible we were stuck staying there. Which was not the hotel's fault it was price line policy. Don't be fooled this is not a 4 star hotel my any means. It is historical with a great location but it is dirty and is in desperate need of renovation. The staff are rude especially the people at the front desk. Apparently most price line customers are disatisfied because of the bait and switch that occurs.

It was 634 sq ft. or so with an alcove with bunk beds. There was a map of the Freedom trail, one entire wall of chalkboard, dress up clothes, milk and cookies the first night. We booked this room through our Entertainment book. It allowed us to pay $267 per night instead of over $500. Very convenient to attractions. Just a few blocks from the Commons. This is the oldest hotel in the city(maybe even in the country). JFK proposed to Jackie here. Inventor of the Boston Creme Pie (although I didn't care for their version, plus it was $8 dollars for a round slice. I would suggest finding it elsewhere). Other stories too. Our rooms had a modern/new feel to them. However, very tiny bathroom. That drove me crazy with no room to set things. Anticipate being able to hear noise through the walls. Our room faced a wall. Not excited about that, but definitely cut down on the city noise. Not my favorite hotel, but if you like a hotel with history this is a good place. We ate at a deli and The Hungry Traveler. Hungry Traveler was across the street and down an alley. There are a lot of shops etc. down alleys around the city, so don't be afraid to check them out. We also took the Freedom Trail guided tour. The tour guide is dressed up in time period clothing. We felt this was very helpful for details about people and events. The gravesite has famous people buried there. Worth going back to look more at the tombstones. The oldest we found was 1679. Recommend doing the Freedom Trail. You just have to follow the red line around the city. Didn't feel Paul Revere's house was worth the money. Very small house and I think you see 3 rooms and you are done. However, definitely go back behind it through the gardens and see a statue of him. Boston is not nearly as busy as New York City. Sidewalks can be narrow at times. People are very nice. It is illegal for them to cross a crosswalk if a pedestrian is there, so lots of people allowed us to cross, even if there wasn't any crosswalk. It is supposedly illegal here in MN too, but no one is usually that nice. Use the T when you get tired, We bought a 7 day pass, even though we were only there for 3 days and it paid for itself when we were tired from walking. To be honest, the city looks big on the map, but is actually very doable on foot. The T is hot and smelly. We ate at Sail Loft with friends the first night. It looks \"well worn\" from the outside. But, we had great food and sat on the water. Best Boston Creme pie on the whole trip. We ate twice in the North End. Fabulous food. So many restraunts, so little time. Fun to walk around. We were told to avoid Salem street. Many side streets to choose from. We never made a reservation, just walked in. This was a fun trip. Wonderful to show your kids the history. Might be better for older kids, so they can stay concentrated and absorb the info. Don't bother renting a car while in the city. You can easily walk. Plus, it would be crazy driving around there. Please, try to make the trip up to Maine. It is only 1-1 1/2 hrs. to York where we stayed. Skip going along 1A through New Hampshire, which is along the ocean. It took us an hour and 1/2 to go 7 miles. Make it more than one day in Maine.

Other wonderful perks were... quick service....anytime you asked for anything, they were at your door within minutes. There is also free internet, free morning beverage, and free upgrades and late check-out (the latter two for their platinum/black members).

Called to have my mother's graduation attire pressed, and unfortunately they sent her clothes off to dry cleaning instead when she had no dry cleaning form filled out and we had clearly said it was a complimentary select guest pressing and put it in their laundry bag. She had to go to Marshalls the next day to buy an emergency outfit to attend graduation. They gave us a substantial discount off our stay that more than made up for this.

I am a seasoned traveler who spends over 50 nights a year on the road so I think I know what a reasonable request is and mine were reasonable. I was here for a conference and upon check-in asked for a room with a king/queen bed as opposed to two doubles - the answer was no. So that's fine, I understand, it is a busy week. Now when I was given a room on the 4th floor I asked for a higher floor, again, the answer was no. I was concerned about traffic noise at night and my concerns were justified as everything from trucks to two-stroke motorcycles roared outside my window each night. I know this could have been accommodated because a colleague who checked in after me (with no elite status either) was asked his preference for a high or low floor. I checked in on a Monday evening, Wednesday afternoon the hotel's digital television stopped working and is still not back up as of Thursday night. All guest rooms were given a notice that it is due to \"system upgrades\" and a reminder that PPV TV is still available. Now I've never heard of a 36+ hour system upgrade, especially when the hometown Bruins are in the Stanely Cup and unavailable on any analog staion. So I called the front desk and suggested that guests be offered one-free PPV movie to compensate for the trouble, of course, you guessed it, the answer was no!! Those are the big things, but there were also little. I asked the concierge for a dinner recommendation one evening and she obliged, but indicated I may not get a table unless she went ahead and made a reservation for me. I let her make the reservation only to get there and see every table open. She clearly only wanted the tip, which she got, but I felt that was very disingenuous. The rooms are indeed small and the bathrooms smaller, but I knew that going in so could have overlooked it if the service was better. And just tonight my hamburger that was ordered via room-service came undercooked, but I don't care at this point to send it back and ask for a credit because I know the answer - NO!! There were a few positive notes. The location really cannot be beat for either business or sight-seeing in Boston. There are some nice Select Guest Perks, like free beverages in the morning, turndown service in the evening and free wifi. Although the wireless printing does not work and the hotel was no help (had to call 3rd party tech support). So I really hope the Hotel Manager does not respond and only mention the few positive remarks because I was overwhelmingly disappointed and will not be returning to this property. I know my Platinum status at Marriott does get me a certain level of service, and I did not expect that here, but I did expect some common courtesy at the very least.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney,Australia", "Title": "\u201cA great choice in Boston- plus good extras for Select Guest members\u201d", "Author": "farawaymum", "ReviewID": "UR112190488", "Content": "We have stayed here twice in the last 2 weeks(a 6 night stay and a 1 night stay) , booked a suite months in advance and got it for a great price during a special for Select Guest members- the suites are absolute luxury and located in the corners of the building so you have multiple windows (and nice views from higher floors).The suite consists of a lounge room and a bedroom, they are really spacious- the bathrooms are quite small but very nicely appointed.

To preface, I have never written a complaint before and over the years I have used Priceline for many of my hotel reservations. The experience that we had so greatly contrasted anything we have encountered before as in the past, every hotel we have booked through priceline has been wonderful - accomodating, nice room, and most importantly, the establishments' claims of the room offered being able to accomodate two people, per contract, has been absolutely upheld without question. We stayed at the Back Bay Hotel in Boston April 30th-May 1st and could not have been happier - wonderful room, staff, etc. - since it was my husband's birthday weekend (May 1st), we decided that we wanted to stay in the Boston area for an additional evening. We bid on a room on Sunday, and since we had never stayed at the Parker before but have stayed in other 'four star' hotels in the city, were thrilled when our bid was accepted and were anticipating another wonderful stay. From the initial call to the concierge to the greeting from the doorman, we were thrilled - friendly and kind, the staff overtly indicated that they would be making sure our stay was wonderful for his birthday. When we got to the front desk, the attendant even looked at the computer and said, your room is not quite ready, but again, happy birthday and we are making sure that you have one of the larger traditional rooms. He asked that we wait and give a cell number so they could call when our room was ready. Happily, we waited and then checked in and went to our room. Upon walking in to our 'larger' room, it was clear that something had gone wrong - not only was the room tiny, but if anything it definitely was probably one of the smallest rooms in the 'traditional' group at the omni and overall one of the smallest rooms we have ever stayed in ever. Now, I understand that it is an older hotel and the rooms may be smaller, but what was disturbing was that the Omni was clearly not fulfilling their end of the priceline contract. They gave us a 'full' sized mattress which lengthwise looked even smaller than a traditional full. No hotel has ever had the absurd audacity to even try to offer a room that is clearly only comfortable for one person and try to pass it off as contracturally sufficient to 'accomodate two people'. This is when things went from annoying to outright insulting and we feel, discriminatory to us as priceline customers. We called the front desk and really, because of the sheer size of the mattress, we thought an error had been made. We told the attendant that we had mistakenly been given a mattress for one person and there had been an error. Immediately he said that the full mattress was sufficient for two adults and that if we wanted to have a bigger mattress, WE would have to pay a 30 dollar upgrade fee. Again, after the years I have been a priceline customer, I have never encountered such an absurd or insulting situation nor asked for an upgrade fee for a normal sized mattress. It was as if we rented a standard mid size car and we had a rental company trying to give us a clown car trying to convince us it was a standard size. Further, we have had instances of a couple of less than up to par rooms (dirty bathroom for example) in other hotels, but the difference here is that they switched our room without any complaint or complications. I asked to speak to the manager and she was condescending to say the least and repeated that with priceline, they had given us what is ''required\" for two people. She then went on to say, they can't just 'upgrade' every priceline customer. At this point, I was in tears and have never felt so insulted. No hotel has ever made me feel like a less than average guest just because I am a wise consumer who uses Priceline discount services. Ironically, this is supposed to be a 'four star' hotel. I have stayed at two star hotels with better customer service. I said to her, \"We are NOT asking you for an upgrade. We are asking you to fulfill our contract. We have paid for a room that is supposed to accomodate two people. It is absurd that you would even think this tiny full sized mattress is sufficient for two adults to sleep in.' She responded (and in a canned way that more than led me to think that she has had this conversation before) that we can either take the room or pay an upgrade. Which would it be? Unbelievable. At that point, we had to pay the extra 30 simply because we would not have been able to fit on that bed to sleep and a cot was not even offered. To say that this left a bad taste in our mouths is an understatement. It is not about the amount - even if they said 10 dollars it would have been about the principle of the matter, and the glaring difference between their behavior and anything else we have ever encountered from any hotel, ever, whether it was a two star of a five star. The Omni Parker is acting discriminatory in my opinion to their guests who have chosen to bid through Priceline. We will be alerting the Omni Parker management of the situation. My husband's company works with many managers in the Omni group and it is important for them to know that this is happening. It goes without saying that we will never stay there again, and are disturbed if Priceline continues to endorse this hotel who are treating people this way. I am glad that I have been such a frequent Priceline customer over the years, because I have so many experiences (good) to compare this to to further see what a glaring injustice this was. The fact that it was my husband's birthday made it even worse. We are two professionals who travel very frequently and we have never been made to feel this way by a hotel. Later, we did get a bottle of champagne and a 'famous' cream pie in our room and we thought, 'Hmm, you nickel and dimed us for 30 dollars - how much did this cost you?' So, priceline customers, just know that at the Omni, their 4 star philosophy is that if you dare try to be a smart consumer, your standards of a hotel stay and mattress sized should be much lower than the average guest. What I found amusing is that aside from the history, and the ornate lobby, I have stayed in countless hotels that far surpass their facade - from the worn down rooms and old bathroom fixtures to the paper thin walls.

This was our first stay at the Omni Parker House and it won't be our last. As others have mentioned, the location just can't be beat. Great restaurants nearby, Quincy Market, the Commons, an easy walk to the subway. We love this City and have, quite honestly, always stayed in the Copley Square area. Not anymore though! The hotel itself is a lovely historical hotel. So elegant went you walk in, it's truly impressive. Customer service is so obviously important to them - we were greeted and treated so well. Though we didn't eat or have drinks at the hotel, the bar areas and restaurant were lovely. We will definitely check them out next time. There are other reviews that mention tiny rooms -- that confuses me a bit and can easily be avoided. Go right to their website and check out the room sizes before you book them. The descriptions are accurate. We paid just a little bit more and with the AAA rate, were more than pleased with the Premier Suite. Absolutely lovely and a corner room. Plenty of room for us and so comfortable. The bed and bedding was heavenly! Yes, the bathroom was small -- but who goes to Boston to stay in the bathroom?! I must mention that we did have an incident Friday evening with the room next door to us. A group of women were having a party with loud music, way too much alcohol, yelling, obscene language, very out of control. We politely asked them twice to please quiet down because it was so loud we couldn't even hear our television! After no cooperation from them, it took 3 calls to the Front Desk and Security before it was resolved. We were disappointed with the turnaround time resolving the issue. Guests should not have to tolerate or wait significant amounts of time in a high quality hotel for resolution. That being said, I would agree with others that the walls are pretty thin. If possible, perhaps ask for a room that isn't next to a group. It's the only issue that makes me consider other options in that area of Boston and the only reason the Omni Parker House didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. The walls can be thin -- but it's how disruptions like this are handled that create impressions. All in all, it's a lovely hotel. Read the room descriptions and spend just a little bit more for the beautiful Premier Suite. You won't be disappointed.

The GOOD: Overall we felt the counter, lobby, house cleaning staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The lobby was beautiful and the rooms were more spacious than expected...although still small for two double beds. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and we had no problem sleeping. We only ate one meal at the hotel...breakfast which was good... so I really can't comment too much on the dining experience. Now THE BAD: the bathrooms were extremely small and the toilet was positioned in a very strange position. The bathroom was also very small. The room was not very sound proof and we could clearly hear every noise from out in the hall. We could also hear the room above us. We also experienced a very unpleasant incident at the hotel which will likely keep us from coming back out of principle. My wife and I were coming back from restaurant when we were caught in a heavy rain and sleet storm. We luckily found, so we thought, a side entrance to the hotel that was clearly marked as an entrance with the Omni overhang and lighting. We ran for the door, entered the building, only to discover a very indifferent Omni employee that stated the entrance was for employees only. I explained that we were guests of the hotel, that we were cold and getting soaked, and requested to cut through to the lobby to avoid further bad weather. The employee refused and sent us back out into the rain/sleet; even after I told him that there were no signs prohibiting us using the entrance and since it was not marked for employees only. Heck, the overhang and logos were ornate and similar to the one at front and other side of the hotel. Anyway, we ran back into the rain/sleet and to front entrance which was a long ways away. I subsequently spoke to the evening on duty manager who apologized but said that the entrance was in fact for employees. He didn't appear to care that were upset and unnecessary water logged guests... and even admitted to guests being allowed to enter the hotel under similar circumstances in the past. We had been to a casual restaurant and were wearing jeans....makes me wonder if I was in one of my nice suits if we would have been granted access. Anyway, I strongly feel this incident shows a strong indifference by the hotel to customer service and to going the extra mile for their guests; as well as a lack of service oriented training for staff. I was appalled with how we were treated and I doubt that I will ever stay at the hotel again as a result.

We did upgrade our bed arrangement from a full to two full which cost a little extra but was well worth it (we knew about this before we left). Another nice thing they did was get us a room with a great view (I called in a couple of days early to do this). The Parker House is the home of Boston Cr\u00c3\u00a8me Pie and Parker House Rolls, both are great. Getting there: We were able to take a free bus to the Subway terminal for the Blue line.

See the public library (it is really pretty) If you have a rainy day or days consider the city pass ($48 for 4 or 5 attractions). Skip trying to use the busses.

It's free and the perks are awesome. Free wireless, free drinks in the morning delivered to your room, a 'secret' room service menu with much lower prices than the 'public' menu, cookies and milk for the kids the night of arrival, express check-in. The program is free to join and they stay true to their promises. I read all the reviews and based on the number of complaints about room size we opted for a \"premier suite.\" The room (2 rooms really) was HUGE. My wife, 2 kids, and I had plenty of room. King bed, pull out couch, 2 tv's, decent sized bathroom, plenty of plush chairs (4?) and a large desk. For a few dollars more it was most definitely worth it. No other hotel (we stay at A LOT of them) has ever made our children feel so welcomed. A man at the front desk ran out back as soon as he saw them at checkout and handed each of them a bag filled with neat little toys. They LOVED the little flashlights and other trinkets. What a great way to treat kids! Some hotels we stay at seem like they would rather not even have kids as guests and the OPH went out of their way to let us know they are valued customers too. It is obvious that the management has instilled a 'culture' of great customer service in the staff and it is very much appreciated. Also, the crib we requested at booking was in the room when we arrived. Very rarely (if ever) does that happen, we usually need to remind them at check-in or call down when we get to the room and see it is not there. Very nice touch. There was ALWAYS someone standing in front of the elevators greeting guests and asking if we needed help or asking questions. What a great service. We always had a dumb little question of some sort (where is the workout room, which way is Quincy Market, where is the nearest Starbucks...) and we were always treated to a smile and a knowledgeable answer. The fitness center was top notch. Brand new equipment, rolled up towels, filtered water. One thing others may want to know is that the valet parking is $42 a day which is about what we usually pay at similar hotels (we paid $65 a night in NYC once..). We love valeting the car since we have small children and it is so convenient but there is a public lot around the corner if you felt inclined to use it you could probably save $15 - $20 a day.

We have travelled a lot with the kids since they were born, and this is without a doubt the best hotel family friendly suite we have stayed in. We now can't understand why other hotels don't do this type of accommodation. We can chill out in our very comfortable king suite bedroom off the living room, kids are sound asleep from all the excitement of the room, the bed is so comfortable, as everyone else has mentioned. We went for a walk this afternoon and it is so close to everything, however we had to come back, as the kids wanted to play dress ups! . There are books for us to read, wifi is great ( we joined the loyalty program, it's free and you will not be disappointed), room service is really prompt and the kids got a cookie and milk as well. Every member of staff has been helpful, and just so friendly. As we have been traveling now for five weeks and moving often, this is such a welcome respite. We can't wait to tell everyone we know about this little gem. Even though we haven't finished our stay, I'm sure we would have even more good things to say after our six days, but I want to make sure I capture this amazing place so others know about our positive experience here.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cWhen can I come back.....\u201d", "Author": "Anna27-2", "ReviewID": "UR99244122", "Content": "My husband and I have just returned from a four night stay in this wonderful olde world hotel.

Our room which was on the 12th floor was a king room, good sized and very clean and comfortable.

The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and we had no problems with noise etc. The hotel is very well situated beside Boston Common and on the Freedom Trail, there are lots of very good restaurants and shops nearby, and the subway is only about 100 yards away. As I said before, the staff are second to none and nothing is too much trouble to them. The concierge, Joseph, was more than helpful to us both before and during our stay - before, as I contacted the hotel the week before we arrived to enquire about shopping outlets in Boston, and he organised that for us and had everything ready when we arrived, and during the time we were there we found him to be very knowledgable and informative.

They did bring a good iron and I was able to iron it at this point (noon the next day). Fortunately, my meeting was not until the day after.

I booked the Omni through Priceline. We use Priceline a lot and have never had a problem or been disappointed with our hotel room or location. Upon check-in, I was informed that we were to be put in a room with ONE full size bed. When I mentioned that I booked through Priceline and that they guarantee a room with either 2 doubles, 1 queen or 1 king, I was told that the hotel was \"completely booked\" because of the Valentine's weekend. I said one full size bed was unacceptable and that I would call Priceline immediately. I was than informed by the woman that Priceline buys blocks of rooms with 2 full beds and that's it. (so why are you trying to stick me in a room with ONE bed?) The classic \"bait and switch\" was taking place here. Even though Priceline buys blocks of rooms with TWO beds, they were trying to put us in a room with ONE bed and only after I told her I would call Priceline, did she miraculously find a room with 2 beds. Another woman at the front desk said \"our full beds are larger than normal\". NOT true. I was than told we could \"each sleep in a bed\". I told her we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and didn't want to sleep in separate beds. Isn't that romantic? I had phoned the hotel on Monday the 7th to request a room with a King bed and was told that \"shouldn't be a problem\". The woman at check in told us to \"go see the room and decide if it was acceptable\". We already paid through Priceline, so our hands were tied. There was no apology, no offer of \"have a drink on us\", nothing. So disappointing. The room was small, barely enough room to walk around the beds, the bathroom was even smaller. There is little to no drawer and closet space for your clothes. We were in a corner room (526) so the bathroom wall is cut off at an angle. It reminded me of a cruise ship bathroom. How this hotel is given a 4 star rating is beyond me. The walls are PAPER thin. Other reviews about this are NOT exaggerating. I've never stayed in a hotel with such a lack of privacy from room to room. There were 4 guests in the room beside us and we could hear their normal conversation....CLEARLY. That evening they came back to their room about midnight. We were awakened by loud laughing and carrying on. After about an hour of this, I banged on the wall and they're response was \"what the @#$! was that\" and than they continued to party loudly. Finally I phoned the front desk at 2 a.m. and told them what was going on. They sent security up. So here I am in one bed, while my husband is in the other because there is no way that 2 normal size adults will fit in one of these \"full\" size beds. And as I'm lying there listening to the people in the next room, I'm thinking this is no way to spend our anniversary weekend. Do not book this hotel if you want a romantic weekend with your significant other, because all of your neighbors will hear exactly what's going on in your room. I'm shocked that this hotel is rated 4 star based on this alone. There are ways to fix this problem but obviously the Omni doesn't feel the need to guarantee their guests the privacy they deserve. So basically, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. I'd like to thank the management at the Omni for ruining our weekend. The Omni has a lot to learn when it comes to satisfying their guests.

The hotel were under no legal obligation to do this, as we had received an extremely favourable rate and the hotel rates had increased quite substantially during the intervening period. Even though we had paid 1800 hotels and again had to pay the hotel (paid twice for the rooms) it still worked out less expensive than if we had to pay their October rates or those of any other hotel in Boston. Thanks to the Management taking this decision we were able to enjoy our stay in Boston, I know that others caught in the 1800 situation in other locations were not as fortunate.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio Rancho, NM", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, fine hotel, very cramped, not a good value\u201d", "Author": "celicagtlover", "ReviewID": "UR86101431", "Content": "The lobby is amazing, the location and bed were nice, but beyond that, we wish we would have stayed elsewhere!

The rooms are small but this is Boston, so let's not fault them for that. They're small in NY and Chicago, as well. Toiletries are nice, but they only stock the typical stuff like soap and lotion. If you forget something, like a toothbrush, just ask for it. I only have very small complaints. First, it would be nice if they gave you slippers with the robe.

The staff at the Omni Parker House was wonderful - very friendly and helpful with dinner recommendations and for assistance in Subway (T) stops and directions. There are three T stops very close by. I chose this hotel in part because it was on the Freedom Trail and it's location is one of the best in Boston. It is close to Boston Common but also a short walk to Quincy Market and all the shops there. We also walked to and from a dinner in the North End Italian Restaurant. It is easy to learn your way around the city and very convenient to be so near everything. The lobby of the hotel is gorgeous and while we did not eat any Boston Cream Pie in Parker's Restaurant we did stop in Parker's Bar for an after dinner drink and it had a very nice atmosphere and attentive wait staff.

We had passed through Boston on a few occasions a number of years ago and had always talked about actually staying for a few days and exploring the city. Before arriving, I was a little concerned reading previous reviewsabout the hotel, especially regarding the size of the bedrooms as we had booked just a double room. However, the room was more than adequate. Yes, the bed is high and I am not a tall person so had to \"climb\" onto it at night. From our window we also looked into another room and so had to keep the blind down so as not to embarrass either ourselves or the people in the room opposite. However, everything else was first class. The room was cleaned every day and towels replaced when requested. I had joined the loyalty programme before arriving at the hotel mainly so that I could have the complimentary internet access from my room. I was a little concerned that I was asked each time when logging on to agree to a payment of $9.95 per day so I checked this out with the Receptionist. She was very obliging and checked my account and told me that although I was listed as being a member of the loyalty scheme because I had booked through a third party this had not been recognised. She immediately changed the record in my account and charges already incurred were waved. It was a very hot and humid week when we were there and coming into the lobby of the Omni Parker House Hotel was like walking into an oasis sometimes! Yes, it is a very busy hotel but the staff always have time to be polite and everyone is treated exactly the same - whether in the business suit with briefcase or shorts, t-shirt and flip flops!!! I can't recommend this hotel highly enough - we had a wonderful time in Boston - it lived up to everything we hoped for. The situation of the hotel is ideal for exploring the city and I would advise anyone who is going to be staying for a few days to purchase a \"Charlie\" ticked for the subway. Excellent value for money and makes it so easy to move around the city.

The room was still small! However, given that, it was very nice. All the amenities are packaged and tucked away in accessible but out of the way locations. Minibar, flat-screen TV, bowed-out shower curtain, lots of pillows all made the stay nice. Internet access is free if you join their loyalty program - which is also free. Otherwise, it costs. The loyalty program also provides free morning beverage - I chose to receive both a cup of hot tea & a glass of orange juice every morning - that was nice. Finally, you get the newspaper. I would recommend joining the loyalty program online prior to arrival. Food was very good. I attended several conference events where breakfast and lunch was served and everything was great.

Room however small, pokey,and beds unusually high. Me being only around 5ft found myself having to clamber on. For a twin room there is little room for moving around / packing/repacking- and with such high beds for a heavy suitcase I found it difficult to maneouvre. The shower dial in the bath was back to front - after 20 mins of turning to hot and not getting hot water i turned to cold and miraculously hot water appeared - a silly and frustrating inconvienience. Window looked out onto someone's office in a close proximity which made me feel a little uncomfortable having only discovered this AFTER a bath and wondering round in a towel simultaneously watching someone make a call from their desk. Bath uncomfortable and small. To top it off My friend was sure he'd lost his bank card in the hotel room , and had left it on the nightstand. We called and were told it was not there. Fair enough, we may be wrong. We asked if someone could just check behind the night stand for us just to be on the safe side and eliminate this as an option. They promised to do so and we arranged for a call back the following day which we did not receive - I might add we were still in the U.S.A so it was not a case of not being able to make long distance calls. Despite giving our new hotel and room number and cell phone number nobody bothered. Although I accept fully that the lost bank card was not their fault/ problem when a call back is agreed at a time by themselves, you'd expect them to honour it.

For the first few days of our visit, it was quite warm so the A/C ran continually, which was a bit loud at night. Also--and this is a pet peeve of mine-- I would expect a hotel that averages over $225 a night would have better towels. Ours were like sandpaper. I've stayed at $69 a night chain hotels that had better quality towels! Another result of reconfiguration is that some bathrooms are almost microscopic. Our deluxe category room was very spacious and comfortable, but the bathroom was so small it could only house a pedestal sink, and had no counter space at all. A curved shower curtain rod had been installed, which caused the shower curtain to extend out into the middle of the room.

The room was small, very nice, very clean. Could've had cleaner windows that I could get open, but as they looked out onto an alley, not a huge loss. We signed up for their preferred guest club & got free Internet (wired), and free beverages (2 each) delivered to the room every morning. Added some bagels to that, and a nice continental breakfast for 2 for $10. The desk had two 110 AC outlets built into its side. As an older hotel, the AC is a retrofit--big unit stuck in a window--and was as noisy as these always are. The strike plate on the door was not real solidly anchored to the door jamb, and the door itself didn't fit snugly--light came in from the hallway. The honor bar fridge only cooled down to about 60 degrees, so we improvised an ice chest to hold leftovers. The hotel lobby and restaurants are beautifully done in dark polished wood, the lobby is spacious. The hallway (second floor, anyway) had a nice wallpaper. The room doors may be old, but had laminate on the hall sides, and looked sorta cheesy. We'd have preferred older-looking doors. And the transom windowes are still there, I think, but all sealed shut. Staff was cordial and very attentive--4 offered to take our bags up to our room! And on checkout, when I asked where the express dropoff was, a bellhop took the keys from me and handled it. We ate dinner in the hotel twice. The first night we ate in one of the bars, and I ordered a club sandwhich which turned out to be almost as big as my head. Very tasty--even the next day (see leftovers, above).

On leaving, here I was a petite female carrying a large luggage down the entrance steps, plus a laptop bag, my purse, and 1 other small bag. Two managers stood and stared as my luggage flipped over and did nothing to help. The bellboys are outside, so no help until I get down the stairs and get through 2 sets of doors. Outside, a captain hails a cab for me, and openly asks me for a tip! Wow. Also, since I was a select guest I was given a free pressing, so I took advantage of it. I got the garment back in my closet, and didn't take a close look. The morning of the conference, I checked and it was so badly ironed I had to redo it, making me late. If you're going to do a bad job, then please don't offer complimentary pressing. It is an older hotel too so it does look a bit worn. But that's ok, sometimes that's charming.

I am hardly ever one to complain but after having just returned from a two-night stay at the Omni Parker House for a special Valentine's Day weekend with my boyfriend, I truly feel ripped off and misled. I booked through Priceline and was \"upgraded\" from a 3-star to the \"4-star\" Omni, but I am sure I would have been better off not being \"upgraded\" at all. Firstly, the advertised pictures were very misleading. The lobby was certainly beautiful but the room itself was HORRIBLE. The first thing I noticed was the strong smell of cleaning supplies, which lasted my entire stay. Then I saw how tiny the room was, barely fitting one double size bed and some squeezed-in furniture -- extremely close quarters and uncomfortable for two adults. Now, I've stayed in smaller hotel rooms before, but at least there was a queen or king size bed and a well-designed interior to make it feel a little more open. The bathroom was also very small -- you couldn't actually be in the bathroom and have the door open at the same time. Additionally, I did not expect to have any sort of special view, but this view was atrocious. We look out onto a rooftop covered in trash and could see right into peoples' apartments (and I'm sure they could see into our window). As much as we wanted to open the curtain to feel a little less claustrophobic, closing the curtain was really the less offensive option. We then tried to connect to the internet on an iPod Touch to plan our evening. We called the front desk to ask for assistance and apparently \"you have to purchase internet for $10 a day, but you could get it for free if you sign up for a rewards program but he wasn't even really sure how it worked but no matter what you have to go down to the lobby to do it\". Huh? We didn't even try after that explanation. Happy to get out of our room, my boyfriend and I proceeded to get drinks in the bar area of the lobby. While it was definitely a cozy atmosphere, we could not fully enjoy it because we were flat-out ignored by our waitress. After taking nearly forty-five minutes to flag her down to pay for our ridiculously expensive beers, we decided it was time to leave the hotel altogether and enjoy the local area. We asked someone at the front desk if he could suggest any fun places around, to which he responded, \"I'm not sure if I can help you because I'm not sure of what reservations are going to be like this evening so I'm going to ask you to ask someone else.\" I translated this as \"I don't know\" or \"I'm too lazy to help you\" or \"you don't look worth my time\". So we asked another gentleman at the concierge to help. We were looking for somewhere in walking distance that had food and maybe some music and dancing. Since he immediately suggested a place called \"Fajitas and Ritas\", we trusted that this had to be a great local spot. Following the Concierge's directions in the freezing cold, we ended up nowhere near the joint and ended up going into another hotel to ask for directions, and they quickly pointed us in the right direction. We finally arrived at the restaurant, and although it had potential to be a fun place, it was practically a Mexican food dining hall for college students. Literally, the entire place was packed with college students. We ended up having an OK cheap meal and a few margaritas but the place closed only an hour after we arrived. Honestly, I was slightly offended that the Concierge at the Omni would suggest such a place that did not contain any of our criteria. Perhaps he was not knowledgeable about the area or maybe assumed we were college students. Either way, it was a huge disappointment and totally nothing like what we were looking for. The next day while passing by the lobby we noticed two different couples complaining at the desk, having similar problems we had, particularly with the room. Our room specifically was right across the hall from the Housekeeping closet, which caused a few issues for us. We were totally unable to take a brief nap in the afternoon because Housekeeping was quite loud in the hallway, but that was understandable since it was in the afternoon. But what was really infuriating was being woken up in the morning by extremely loud chatting among the Housekeeping staff. They were literally yelling at each other right in front of our door (which had the Please Do Not Disturb sign on it) early in the morning. After about 15 minutes of this, my boyfriend had to ask them to please quiet down. They apologized but even their continuous talking at a low volume could be heard through the walls, in addition to the rustling of bags. There was certainly no going back to sleep for me. I briefly and totally non-aggressively voiced my complaints at check-out and barely received an apology. In fact, the woman at the desk seemed to get quite defensive. We left with a very poor taste in our mouths. While the experience wasn't disastrous, the Omni Parker House is certainly not half as nice as any other \"4 star\" hotel I've ever been in and I feel a duty to warn people not to get their hopes up or spend any significant amount of money on this hotel.

I literally could not have rolled out of bed due to the wall being 2 inches from the edge of the bed. Our window opened into a derelict dead space in the middle of the building which comprised of several old air conditioners, a massive amount of bird droppings, rotting wooded and rusted steel walk ways, and just a hint of sky. The room was located right next to the ice machine, so all night, I was awaken to the sounds of ice buckets being filled. Additionally, my fellow hotel guest, staying in rooms off the same hall, were highly disrespectful of sleeping hours. The first night, I was awaken on several occasions to drunk men in the hallway yelling, banging on doors, and getting ice. The next night, teenage girls talked on their cell phones just outside my room. The last night, a family, which seemed to be departing, did so quite loudly. Aside from that, the room was very clean and well maintained. The bathroom was small, yet usable. The closet was, compared to the room, very large and came with a safe.

Really, I can't go on without mentioning the size of the room. Some other reviewers have noted that the rooms weren't substantially smaller than anything else they'd experienced in US hotels - I'd strongly disagree - my room was so small that I was extremely grateful I was on my own. If I'd been with my girlfriend it would have been a nightmare - the bed was so small it was barely bigger than a twin, and the bathroom was miniscule. The room itself was largely taken up by a desk, the bed, and an armchair and there wasn't much room to move otherwise. I honestly could not believe my eyes when I saw it for the first time. As another reviewer has also noted, the walls were really thin, and you could hear people talking to each other or on cellphones. Luckily none of my neighbours made louder noises, but you could quite imagine that if they had, you would hear in graphic detail. Positives - I joined Omni select guest while at the hotel and as a consequence got free internet, and two free drinks delivered every morning, which was great. I also thought it was a really nice touch that their business center allowed free printing of boarding passes. The building is obviously a nice old building too, and the lobby is nice, but I didn't really think that spectacular. Location - I couldn't really decide whether it was bad or good. It's only a $20 cab ride from Logan, which was nice, and you could walk everywhere, or go down to the subway a few blocks away. It was also very near Boston Common. But it's also very near the financial district and that becomes very deserted at night. I felt safe at all times in Boston but I can imagine some people becoming unnerved by how quiet it can be around the hotel. Personally if I was to come to Boston again I'd aim to stay in the back bay area, which is a bit more lively, and the hotels there are nearer more shops and restaurants, although Omni Parker House is near Faneuil Hall. So basically this wasn't a bad hotel and I wasn't thinking, get me out of here, but I wouldn't go back unless the price dropped significantly or the rooms were massively enlarged.

My husband attended meetings while I enjoyed exploring. The hotel is in a safe area. I walked everywhere and felt safe whilst on my own. The hotel is located directly ON the Freedom Trail.You walk out the front or side door and you are right on the painted red path. This is such an enjoyable undertaking - walking to as few or as many of the points on the trail. Get a free photo copy at the consierge or buy a Freedom Trail booklet ( 4-7 usd) at the Public Gardens info booth. Go left out the front door - 5 mins to booth in Public Gardens-the trail starts here. Read the booklet and start walking. It is delightful to check off the places that you see. I found it to be a good educational pastime.One can read a bit in the hotel room, walk to a few, read some more, explore some more. I did one or several -depending on time/mood over several days. One could do them all in a day but given the perfect location of the hotel,you can chose the pace that works best for your schedule.

Our room was well decorated and had a regal feel to it. Nicely furnished and great linens. While it was not large in size, it was not too small either. Not to worry given all the reviews in this regard. We found it to be well-laid out with lots of storage space. The only unfortunate comment about the room was that the air conditioner blocked any view out the window. Here is where modernity meets an historic building. So no problem. There was still lots of light coming in to the room and given the 90 degree heat outside, we were glad for the A/c rather than the view.Overall we were most pleased with the room.

We arrived at approximately 4pm and all we had to do was show our passports, our room keys were waiting for us behind the desk and the whole thing took no more than 2 minutes. The rooms are small as is to be expected for such an old hotel, but it was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The walk in shower had good pressure and there was never a shortage of hot water. The bathroom could do with a little more shelf space. A couple of criticisms are the corridors could do with a bit of decoration/freshening up, on the Tues. night all the ice machines on every floor (I checked them all) were turned off, presumably for cleaning and there was a bit of a stale odour outside our room (5th floor), possiblly coming from an air vent nearby. We didn't eat or drink at the hotel so I can't comment on the facilities but there are plenty of decent eateries nearby. Overall I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would definitely return. And as I said earlier the Omni Parker House Hotel has THE BEST LOCATION IN BOSTON. TIP - if you want to save a few dollars take the Blue Line shuttle bus from the airport terminal to the Blue Line T (subway) station. The T costs just $2 one way.

The Omni was the only one we could find with these qualifications. We splurged on the Freedom Trail suite (only available on their website) and were SO glad that we did. The kids (age 2 and 5) did not want to leave the room to go out to the aquarium or other sites ! The suite is more than as advertised. First, there is so much room compared to what others noted in the reviews! The living space is larger than our first apt in DC. The kids had a nice quality bunk bed, a table with kids' chairs, a whole wall to color with chalk, dress up period costumes (which seemd to be VERY clean much to my happiness and appeared washable), and books about the area. They also received a fun backpack (cardboard with real straps that they both wore for 48 hours straight minus bath and sleep time) with a canteen, flashlight, and a few other items at check in. They also got milk and cookies delivered to the room the first night. They were in heaven! I was very pleased with the suite because of the adult bedroom which was luxurious and came with about 10 books to read about historical Boston. So nice to read while the kids were winding down. The noise of our kids for other hotel patrons was not a problem as the air conditioners had a nice white noise effect. The hotel of course is ideally located and has all the amenities you would expect at an Omni. I was just so pleased with their attention to the kids' needs and thought our dollars were very well spent! As a note, the valet parking was costly, but easy when we arrived during rush hour. There is a garage around the corner that charges about $20 a day if you are organized and can get your luggage to the hotel by yourself (not possible when traveling 10 hours in the car with two small children and no DVD).

This of course resulted in us grabbing our clothes running, running down 4 flights of stairs. One time during a stay I can completely understand and excuse, but 3 come on! When asked about this after little to no sleep, the front desk said this wasn't common and that someone off the street had walked in and pulled the alarm-3 times? very comforting.

The elevators were small and constantly packed with an uncomfortable number of people. And, our room was literally the size of a shoebox. It was nicely decorated and furnished, but it was SO small we could barely get our suitcases open! There was also virtually NO window! The entire wall was taken up by a loud, annoying air conditioner, and what was left of the wall was a tiny peephole window that was about 5 feet off the ground.

We did the Freedom Trail package and it was a good bargain. Room is originally $453 per night but we got it for $280 and it came with buffet breakfast every morning for 5, freedom trail tour (only for 4), backpack activities for the kids and an executive suite with 2 doubles, sofa bed, and we got an extra roll away so all the kids got their own bed.

He took us down the hallway and then down a smaller hallway to a door that said \"The Joseph and Rose Kennedy Suite\". My husband and I looked at each other, surely they made a mistake, we didnt book a suite! We were lead into a very nice decorated room with flat screen tv, couch, chair, otoman, desk and small fridge. Off to the side was our bedroom with a King size bed - the room was much more than we expected. Like the bellman said, we did like it! Since we only had about an hour before game time, we dropped our bags and went off to find the T. Back down in the lobby we asked how to get to Fenway and were directed to the train (about a block away) - the game was ok, they lost, but it wasnt a complete waste cause hey... I was at Fenway! We decided to walk back tothe hotel since it was a nice night out and less than 2 miles away - we walked down Commenwealth and around Boston Commons (next block over from the hotel). Upon our return to the hotel we were surprised to find a bottel of Moet in our room with chocolate dipped strawberries! Next to the bottle was a card from Guest services congratulating us on our 23rd anniversary and welcoming us to the hotel! We were so surprised - we go away every year for our anniversary and this was the first time this had ever happened! We decided that whenever we come to Boston this was our hotel of choice!

Oh and my husband wants all the night owls to know that after an evening out with friends to come back to the room and order room service at 2am is awesome!

After browsing the many hotels Boston has to offer, I chose the Omni Parker House mainly for it's location and price. We chose to pay the 21-day advance purchase price and believe we paid $210 for the night. We had a two double bed room on the 6th floor. We made excellent time driving up in the morning from Philadelphia and arrived at the city earlier than expected. Around 11am, we pulled over at a rest stop and called the hotel to inquire about early an check-in. The friendly receptionist informed us that while our room was not ready, we could still check-in to another room, but we would not get a room with a view. She told us our other option would be to come and check-in, store our bags and then come back when our room was ready. We decided to stop at Fenway Park (awesome) first and wait to check-in to the hotel. We still ended up getting to the hotel earlier than stated check-in time, but our room was ready. The very friendly staff checked us in and stored our car. We used the valet parking, which cost us $40. We had to pick it up by 1pm the following day, but we decided to pay the $12 fee for keeping it there longer while we did our final tour of the city after we checked out. We found our room perfect for our needs, and we were very excited that we held out for our room with a view. Our room's view was of School Street and Old City Hall. It was fun for us to look out our window and see the hustle and bustle of the busy city around us. The central location of this hotel to the touristy areas of downtown was my favorite thing about it. The walk to Faneuil Hall took less than 15 minutes. We took a trolley tour on Sunday and were amused that the Omni Parker House was one of the attractions, although our tour guide informed us we were \"doomed\" since the hotel was said to be haunted! :) Make sure you stop by the front desk for a print-out of the alleged ghost stories! The room itself was quaint, not small. Three women had no problem getting ready for a night out in the room, which I think says a lot! Our room had two double beds, a lounge chair a desk and a mini-bar with a nice flat screen on it. The bathroom was clean and again, large enough to accommodate our needs. We didn't hear any of our neighbors the whole time we were there and we hope they didn't hear us either! The air conditioner worked great and we cranked it up and were welcomed to a frosty room everytime we came back from our sightseeing. The beds were very comfortable with soft, clean linens and blankets. The lobby of this hotel was beautiful. My friends bought some fun stuff at the gift shop and although we were too exhausted to try it out, The Last Hurrah bar seemed like a great spot to unwind and hang out with friends. The elevators were easily accessible, except for Sunday's check-out time, but that's to be expected. We just hoofed it down the stairwell with our bags because we didn't feel like waiting. The elevators and hallways were very warm, but I'll take the warmth to stay in a hotel of this historical value. All the staff were very helpful accommodating our varied needs and everyone was very friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to be in the heart of the city. All you have to do is walk out the front doors of the hotel to be in the midst of our nation's history, and it's great to stay in a hotel that is part of that!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "milwaukee, wi", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location, Perfect hotel\u201d", "Author": "sicilianmum", "ReviewID": "UR35016916", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Parker House on a 10 day leisure trip to Boston.

In addition we received a discount card and coupons for many attractions throughout Boston for booking through the VB. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful.

Of all of the hotels I have stayed in, both in the U.S. and out, the Boston Omni Parker House sets a standard that will be hard to beat for a 'city' hotel. It is quite obvious that the manager of this establishment holds customer service as a priority. From the bell captains meeting us at the curb for our luggage, (on a rainy day, one offered to lift me over a puddle!!), to the front desk staff who made check-in a breeze and immediately asked what we had planned and showed us a map showing our destinations, everyone had a smile and offerings to assist in any way. The gentleman who brought our luggage to our room showed us where everything was, from light switches to who to call for for any reason. I had mentioned at check-in that our trip was to celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday...imagine her surprise when we came back to the room after exploring the city to find a birthday card and chocolate covered strawberries! Their loyalty ambassador, Kate,and front desk staff are very attentive! We reserved a suite and it was well worth the extra money; the room was very large, with two dreamy beds and a sleeper sofa. Other reviews complained about the hotel rooms' bathroom size; I didn't see other rooms, however, ours was smallish but very up to date and had a large walk-in shower. So what, if only one person can get ready at a time in there; personally, I don't invite my family into the bathroom with me at home; I don't have congregations in the bathroom at a hotel either. Location: Perfect. The location does NOT get better for staying in Boston. One block down is the T station. The Parker House is ON the Freedom Trail, one block from Boston Common. The hotel is across the street from King's Chapel. Just down the street is a great bagel bakery called Brueggers. Two blocks down is Washington Street...hello Downtown Crossing shopping! A few blocks down and an intersection over...Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market with tons of shopping and restaurants. Cross the street from there...the wharf and yummy Legal Seafood. The restaurant inside the Parker House...delicious. The hotel's breakfast buffet was excellent. The staff was so friendly. (Made to order omelets from a very personable chef were soooo tasty!). To summarize......the hotel is so wonderful....upgrade to a suite, you won't regret it. The staff.....they deserve a raise....in a world that is sorely lacking in customer service, this hotel sets the standard on 'how' to do it.

The room was spacious, with a well furnished sitting area, large flat-screen TV, and the most comfortable hotel bed in which we've ever slept. There was plenty of room for our son's blow-up bed, with ample room for him to play as well. The bathroom was small, but the suite did have a dressing area with a lighted vanity table that was perfect for stashing our toiletries. I was surprised to read other reviews that complained about noise; the hotel seemed rather full, but we found our room to be noticeably quiet. From the moment we arrived, the service was friendly and attentive. Every person we encountered, from the valet, to the bellhop, to the front desk staff, had a pleasant greeting for us and our young son (who was thrilled with the child's gift pack he received). Everyone was helpful with suggestions and information. At breakfast, the restaurant staff went out of their way to be gracious and accommodating of special requests. We asked that our room be made up before noon so our son could nap after lunch, and we were so pleased when we came back to a freshly-straightened room after a busy morning. Finally, the location of this hotel is spectacular. Quincy Market is just a couple of blocks away, and there are many historic sites nearby.

The staff was polite and courteous, which was great to find after a long travel day. The downside of our stay was that the Omni Parker treats its \"traditional rooms\" as rooms for two adults -- even though they only have a double bed and are quite small. Both our room and bathroom were cramped. We're used to New England hotel rooms being slightly smaller than rooms in the Midwest or on the West Coast, but this was small even by those standards. Not a huge deal if you're not planning to spend a lot of waking hours in your room, but probably not the best if you're planning to hang out at the hotel during your trip. You can book a bigger / more expensive room through the hotel directly, but sadly, because we booked this hotel last minute on Priceline, we did not have an option to upgrade. Ideally management will stop listing their \"traditional\" rooms as rooms fit for 2 adults on Priceline and only use their queen / king size bedrooms instead. The location is very nice though, especially if you're planning on seeing historical sights and walking the freedom trail. it is only a 3-minute walk to the subway station at Park Street and has little conveniences (Starbucks, Bruegger's Bagels, CVS Pharmacy, 7-eleven) nearby. Because we were mainly in-town to see friends / celebrate the 4th, the good location and comfort of the hotel were worth the trade off for room size.

I remember thinking to myself, I hope those things were not supposed to be there yesterday and that they will bill me for them later on. And sure enough, when I got my check-out bill, I had 58$ worth of junk food, snaks and drinks charged to my bill which I had never consummed. I called the front desk to tell them that this was a mistake and that the server was already empty the day we arrived.

Anyway, luckily the nice guy by the name of Marc whom we had chated with the day we arrived, was the one working and he took care of removing the unfair charges on my bill. And lastly, when I finally got my credit card bill, they had once again charged an extra 10$ for I dont know what. All I know is that it wasn't on the final bill I agreed to, which included all the parking fees which were hi 40$ the first day and 25$ every extra day.

(Oldest continuously operated hotel in America, home to Parker House Rolls & Boston Creme Pie - the best!) Plus the list of people who stayed and also worked there are impressive! The staff was exceptional! We found the entire staff to be the best we've ever experienced anywhere in the world - including compared to the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons! We did a lot of driving during our stay - we actually had 2 cars - and the in and out valet was extremely convenient! We had the breakfast and park package for a family of 4 and found it to be a great value. We received breakfast each morning for our family and also had in and out parking priviledges for one of the cars. The buffet breakfast was great - eggs or omelets to order with fruit, lox, bagels, sausage, bacon, pancake or french toast, cereal, rolls, danish, juice and coffee in the beautiful parker dining room. The charge would have been $20 per person, but it was free! Because of the large breakfast we skipped lunch! And the charge for valet would have been $40 - very price competitive compared to other Boston parking. (We got charged $36 for a couple hours at the Prudential Center) Also the beds were unbelievably comfortable, but small. Depending on party size and need, I would recommend staying there. As per the previous reviews, the doubles (2 double beds) are extremely small! We are a family of 4 with a 16 and 12 year old. Based on previous reviews, we tried to get another type of room, but it wasn't available. And, the room size was unbearable for us. After one night they were able to provide us with a larger double, but 2 double beds for 2 adults and 2 teens is still a killer. If they could not accomodate us with a larger room, we would have had to check out, because it was unbearable! Also, the counter space as noted by a previous reviewer is a killer! I took her advice and used the ironing board for additional counter space. There is absolutely no counter space in the bathroom - they could have minimized the problem by installing medicine cabinets! Also, outlets are tight - only 2 usuable in the room. If you bring a power strip (and maybe extension cord) from home you at least might be able to charge your cell phones, plug in your laptop(s), and maybe even get your blow dryer near a mirror so you can see when you blow dry your hair. Not an issue if you're traveling with 1 person. But if you're traveling with multiple people or a family, You cannot blow dry your hair if another person is taking a shower. If the size of the rooms were bigger, there is no doubt in my mind that this would be the number 1 rated hotel in boston! Definetely stay there if you are 1 or 2 people, but beware if you need to put 3 or more in 1 room. By the way, register as a select guest before you go - it's free and you get free morning beverage service delivered with your choice of newspaper.

After reading here, we got a suite and booked through hotels.com. One potential problem was that the reservation through hotels.com said we had a suit with a king size bed. I called to make sure this was correct and was told that it was NOT and that we would get (2) double beds. Always call in advance to be sure... A lot of discussion and finally the on duty manager agreed to change my room to a King. One other note (unlike some other online booking sites) Hotels.com allows you to change/cancel your reservation before the Hotels \"own deadline\" for cancelling without penalty. I would have cancelled if I couldn't get a king room as my reservation said I was confirmed with. Also the Hotel said that your room type isn't actually confirmed until you arrive. This isn't convenient when you are flying 800 miles to stay in a city like Boston :) The hotel: As others have noted, a suite is the better route to go as the regular rooms are small but understandably due to the age of the hotel. The suite isn't a \"suite\" as you may normally expect (little awkward design, bathroom very small etc.) but it was very well kept and clean! The hotel is very nice, lobby etc. are very historic feeling and charming. The location CANNOT be beat. Right on the freedom trail, walking distance to nearly everything you may want to see/do in Boston. Even the \"T\" is 2 blocks away at Park Center. In my case going to the Red Sox/Yankee's game at Fenway was only 5 stops away which was the furthest we really ventured away from the center where the hotel is. If you get a moment go to the \"M\" level and walk the hallways of the hotel (near conference rooms) there are a bunch of old restaurant menu's framed and other historical pieces hanging on the walls that are VERY interesting. I am so glad I got to see this information as it made me personally admire the hotels and the history of the hotel even more! I hated that this stuff wasn't more prominently displayed in the hotel so that ALL guests had an opportunity to see the excellent pieces of information. The hotel bars (both) are very nice as well and had good offerings. Only gripe about them is that they were not open very late on Friday or Saturday night as we may have wanted to have a drink and unwind after arriving back at the hotel. We ate breakfast room service (2) times and both times while expensive, the food was excellent, hot and delivered in a timely manner! Also would mention the king size bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very dark with the blinds closed. In the absence of an alarm we slept in one morning past 10 a.m and we both are normally 6-7 a.m risers :) Last point.. the room we had and at least (2) sides of the hotel view from the windows of your room is going to be of a wall 15 feet away. So there is no real view of the city. Of course if you have been to Boston you already know this isn't really important anyway as being on your feet in the city is what it is all about :) Other complaints about noise levels here on Tripadvisor, I never heard a peep while we were there and the hotel was nearly full. Concierge services were also excellent.. used them for several things and they were great! I would stay here again in heartbeat.

I said yes, but one relies on the implication that if you risk losing your money with a nonrefundable 21 day advance its because that is the lowest rate ever and it's not right that had I not given you my money 21 days in advance, I would now be free to cancel and rebook at the cheaper rate. It went on and on until finally I hit upon a technicality. My e-mail confirmation said I could cancel until the day of my stay in the year 2011. Obviously a mistake. How could one cancel two years after they stayed there, but I grabbed on to the cancellation language and it was only then that she put me through to a supervisor. He was very nice and agreed to credit the difference in price. We laughed about the 2011 cancellation language and he said it was glitch and hoped I would not hold them to it and cancel. I said no way, that I was satisfied with our results. Omni people: Do not ask a guest to give you nonrefundable money 21 days in advance unless you gauge the market better to make sure that the price offered is really the lowest price possible. After all, why else would anyone accept these terms when you can otherwise book and cancel at anytime? If you do need to drop the price, be gracious and credit the guest. You do not have to refund a nonrefundable deposit, just credit the difference so that the guest doesn't feel she locked herself in just to lose out. Enough said. As to the hotel itself, I liked it very much. We checked in around 1 p.m., I approached the desk and stated I had a reservation. Before I could give my name, the lady said \"you must be Ms. ...... \" Now this is a big hotel and she must have had a lot of people checking in so I was very impressed that she knew my name. How she knew it I don't know. Maybe I was the only party of three with a child, but it was impressive. My room was not ready and she immediately tagged my luggage so we could walk around. She asked for my cell number and called me as soon as the room was ready. Not a biggie since we were walking around way past check in time. When we did come back, she saw us and before I even made it to the desk she quickly came to give me the keys and said she'd have the luggage sent up. The whole time addressing me by name. She was so nice and gave such personal service that I felt like a movie star. The entire staff was great. The bellmen, housekeeping. Always asking what they could do for you. Our room was extremely clean. Nothing old or dated looking. Nice new looking fabric for sofa, cushions. I know because I had curtains made in my home with the same fabric as the cushions and it was material that had just come out less than a year ago. Only issues were that the bathroom was really, really small and for a suite we had a not so great view, but nothing major. That night someone came to the door with cold milk and a big chocolate chip cookie for my son. Another nice touch. Yes, I had heard stories about the hotel being haunted. No, I did not encounter anything. The guy who sold us trolley tickets told us that there was one room which was supposed to be haunted and because of this the hotel had turned it into a supply room. He gave us the room number and everything. Was he pulling our leg? I don't know. I have had experience with 2 other hotels which also claimed to have some haunted rooms so I was curious, but as I said nothing happened. However, our room had a painting of a man in 17th(?) century attire who had these black piercing eyes and my DH and I had a laugh when I told him the guy freaked me out everytime I looked at his eyes. We did not eat at the hotel restaurants, except for getting some Boston cream pie one night for dessert. Boston cream pie was supposed to have been invented at the hotel, so of course, I had to try. I had the pie and my son had a chocolate cake. Both were kind of small and I thought it kind of pricey since without tip both came to a bit over $17. The pie was not that good either. I had another Boston cream pie the following night at Legal Sea Foods and found it much better, although I do not recall the price. The last point is the hotel's location. You can walk to almost anything, although at night I did not like the area. We encountered many drunk/drugged out people. The first night going to dinner we encountered this man approaching people with kids saying he wanted to buy the kid. When he got to us, he started yelling to give him our son and he'd pay $200. He kept following us yelling he wanted my son and then he left. Normally, one does not pay attention to these things, but my son is autistic and became quite alarmed to the point we had to coax him every night after that to leave the hotel because he though the man who wanted to buy him would be waiting. The last night as we walked to Legal Sea Foods, we heard this horrible crash. Turns out a guy had kicked in a glass window in a commercial building. This was on the opposite side of the street maybe twenty feet from us. The guy then crossed the street towards us and he was obviously drugged. My DH says that's what you can expect in any major city, but I disagree. I have been to many major cities and this seemed to be worse, although that is hardly the hotel's fault. Overall, they made to feel special and very welcome. I would definetely recommend this hotel, just keep your guard up at night.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cFading old world charm\u201d", "Author": "tito_nyc", "ReviewID": "UR28579425", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for the Easter weekend.

We love the sense of atmosphere in the place, especially in the bar - the Last Hurray - and the reception area. Last year refurbishment works were ongoing. The hotel boasts that its the oldest continuously operating hotel in the States. Unfortunately, some of the things that could have been dealt with were not. The heating/air con in the rooms is a external wall mounted unit. To say they are noisy is an understatement and we found that we had to switch the unit off during the night as when it kicked in it woke us up. Another noise issue is the sound transfer through dividing walls. This is made worse by connecting doors between some rooms (presumably so that they can be used as suites). Again, I would have thought some work would have been done on soundproofing of the doors but this does not seem to have been the case. We had a lady next door who had a bit of a winter cough - when she coughed it was as if she were in the same room. This does not reflect her ailment but the failure of sound proofing. Normal conversations could be easily overheard through the wall. The rooms are all (from our experience) well maintained and cleaned by friendly and helpful staff. However, there is a great variety of sizes. Rooms on the 'School Road' elevation although sold as 'deluxe' rooms are particularly small and if you are on the third floor you will find that your window sill is 4' 6\" high although the view over the Old Town Hall is good. Alternatively, the rooms on the back are generally larger but have no view at all. Rooms have a good coffee making facility. Apart from its historic looks the hotels greatest asset is its workforce.

Full size sofa, flat screen TV, Mini Bar, Bathrobes, Vanity dressing table,etc. The price was $359 per nite, not too bad for Boston. The Parker House Bar, Last Hurrah Bar, and the Dining room was great. I would definetly recommend this hotel. It is the oldest running hotel establishment in US (I think). Anyway, lots of history and beauty. Book the Junior suite, you wont be sorry.

Shower has low shower pressure and took forever to figure it out. Even noticed a bug in the bath. Bed was comfy enough but we did not sleep well. We felt the room was in the middle of the hotel and everybody was walking around it.

The bell hops and the men who help with your luggage, were some of the nicest people we came across while in Boston. The front desk staff and also the managment were very rude to us a majority of the time. I'm not sure if it was because we were always dressed in jeans and t-shirts, and we weren't the \"upscale\" traveler or business person. The resturants at the hotel are quite expensive also. It is not a good idea to eat there if on a budget. The food was definately fantastic though. My husband had an omlette that was so big, even he couldn't eat the whole thing!

Both my stays were last-minute extensions of business trips, booked through Hotwire for a very competitive price. In both cases I booked a \"standard double\", which may be the key to my mild disappointment. On both visits, I found myself in a small room, somewhat oddly shaped, with either one or two windows overlooking a dingy, depressing air-shaft view. Both rooms had tiny -- but well-appointed -- bathrooms that suffered from one unforgivable trait: absolutely no vanity counter space to place shaving implements. In the end, I balanced my shaving kit precariously and hoped my toothbrush wouldn't end up on the lovely old Deco tile floor. Another nit: technology. Omni dudes: it just doesn't cost that much to provide free wireless internet to guests. Trust me, I don't want to check my email badly enough to pay to use your wired connection. That's the bad news. The good news is, the room, tiny as it is, is well-appointed, with a comfortable (double) bed, cushy mattress, very nice linens, and a stunning array of pillows and bolsters. Somehow, they managed to jam a desk/dresser combo into the room, and it was topped by a very nice 42\" LG flat-panel TV, which, in a room this size, is like having your own movie theater on tap. Once in bed, with the lights dimmed, you definitely feel like you're in the lap of luxury. Too bad that opening the thick shade in the AM and peering out into the airshaft brings it all crashing back down. The Parker House is a venerable property in a great location, close to Boston's small financial district, an easy walk to Quincy Market, the Boston Common, and countless historic sites. I can well imagine -- in a bigger room -- this would make a great base of operations for a family vacation.

Not only are the rooms tiny but they are extremely badly planned; there is nowhere to put toiletries in the bathroom; there is only one chair in the room and it was like an assault course working your way from one side to tbe other. It is to be expected nowadays that rooms will include PC connections but the number of wires littering the floor was a real hazard.

So I went onto Priceline and was assigned the Parker House for a very reasonable amount of money. When one stays at a historic hotel in downtown Boston, New York, Chicago or DC, one knows that the rooms will be smaller than a new building and that parking will be extra. In fact, $38 a night for parking (which is what the hotel charged me) is on par for the area, so they're not taking any kind of advantage here. So I drove up to the Parker House with the expectation of a small room (particularly with a Priceline reservation!) and that I would pay for parking. The valet parkers were professional, but didn't smile or greet me - just a quick \"what's your name\" and then \"these are the charges\" and that was it. Somewhat curt. And I had just a rollaboard and a briefcase, so I wheeled my own luggage in - didn't want to try to navigate the revolving door with it, so had to pull open the door on the side and maneuver myself in. It was kind of tricky - and the valets and bellmen were standing there watching traffic while this all occurred. I think it's because I declined help with my luggage, so then I was on my own - they could use a doorman there. Then up the stairs to a very elegant lobby area and on to check in. I'm an Omni member, but since I had booked through Priceline, I didn't know if it would benefit me at all. The very cheerful desk clerk told me that they had already applied my number (that's very efficient, because it means they reviewed all their reservations that day to see if any of them matched their frequent guest records) and that they had upgraded me to a deluxe room in a quiet location. Up to the room on the 12th floor - very comfortable room. Comfortable and upscale furnishings, very clean and just overall very nice. Yes, it was on the small side, but that matched my expectations and they've made a great use of the room space, with two double beds, flat screen TV, desk, armchair, dresser, all well arranged in the space. Small but well appointed bathroom, again making excellent use of the space. Very nice spa amenities with the nice touch of cotton swabs and cotton balls in addition to the standards. The bed was extremely comfortable - I would have slept later than I planned, except I had requested breakfast in the morning, so had to be ready to get the tray. Omni member get complimentary coffee and juice (or tea, etc.) delivered to the room in the morning, and one can add breakfast items for a fee. And they have this wonderful option: they will leave the tray and knock - so one can wait a moment and then pull in the tray in one's pjs. Very civilized. The location is just fantastic - walked to the waterfront for dinner with friend and then walked Beacon Hill the next morning before checkout taking pictures. Check out was effortless - as I left the room, a chambermaid asked \"are you checking out?\" - I told her \"yes\" and then she replied \"well we hope to see you again soon\", a little thing that impressed me. Since they clearly tell you up front that it takes about 30 minutes to get your car from the valet (they use a local lot), I called down half an hour before I checked out. Went to the desk, again, efficient and personable service, walked out the door and my car was waiting. All in all, a very enjoyable stay.

This hotel is SO convenient right near Boston Commons and the T (subway). It is wonderfully renovated and decorated--defintely the 3-4-5 stars it has (depending on the review site you see it on). Yet when this southern girl arrived in my comfy shirt, jeans, and birkenstocks--the bellhops were so gracious to get right out to my cab, get my luggage, and get me in the lobby. (It is on a semi-busy street, so there were safety reasons to do so--but I did not feel rushed.) The hotel is a step back in time to another era... the lobby area is beautiful and distinguishing. Very inviting still and not imposing as if it were a museum and you can't touch anything. The front desk was warm and welcoming. Check-in was fast and gracious. My room was on the 8th floor. Now mind you...there is a lot of construction around the hotel. And this is a downtown hotel, so only so many rooms have a \"view\" of the street. So my \"view\" was on the side of the building and I was looking at another building. Nonetheless, the windows had shades, and I was grateful for the sunlight that came in. If you want a \"view\", stay elsewhere...but this hotel has location location location. The room was clean, tasteful, and classically decorated. Bathrobes are furnished and the amenities are wonderful. In a day when hotels are cutting back, they provided a sewing kit with pre-threaded needles. That sold me!! I had to make a repair, and it came in so handy. (I'm definitely coming back if they pay attention to such comfort down to this detail!) The bathroom was wonderful with a huge, well-lit vanity mirror. There is a fridge in the room to store munchies and there is an in-room bar if you want to dive in -- (The red wine and toblerone were tempting, but the half-bottle was $26...that killed the temptation.) In my room, there was a good sized walk-in closet with iron/board, nice desk, and dresser with the TV, fridge, and drawers all in one tasteful unit. Room drawbacks: limited TV channels if that's important. They have HBO and all local channels, but just about 30 overall covering the major cable channels. No free wi-fi/internet in the room either. You can hookup via a cable they provide for $10 or so per day. There is free wi-fi in the lobby though, so I just headed downstairs and took care of my stuff there. Now for my personal experiences: (1) I went out with a galpal from high school that I haven't seen in 15 years. And...well, we had a lot of fun. I saw her home to her place near Cambridge in a very residential section of Boston. So after midnight, I had no idea where I was in relation to a T or Bus station/route. I called the Omni and asked for the concierge...it was so late that they had already gone home. I explained where I was and the front desk person looked up taxi numbers for me on the spot. I made it back inside of an hour and thanked the folks at the front desk. And, well after my fun, I asked about breakfast. The same person took my breakfast room service order at the front desk for me which was promptly delivered when I requested it. (Breakfast by the way was delicious --get the parker house rolls!) (2) Concierge is so helpful! They have T directions written out ready for you to point you in the right direction. And ladies, they know where the H & M is. (3) They have a late 12 noon check-out which was wonderful. I didn't have to be at my actual destination until 4 pm, so they have luggage check available to hold your luggage so you can explore Boston. Overall...a wonderful experience!

I finally got my chance this June when my husband and I stayed for 3 nights. First off, be prepared to spend $40 a day for parking, second the room service is astronomical. It was a $68 bill for a hamburger, sodas and some ice cream. I had to get surgery in town and was not able to leave the room much so I was relying a lot on the service (or lack there of) the hotel was supposed to provide. The \"deluxe\" room is the size of a broom closet, although accomodations are not that large in Boston our room is abnormally small. We requested a 5:15 wake up call with a 15 minute follow up for the morning of my surgery. I awoke at 6:15 to realize the wake up call had never come. It takes the valet 30 minutes to retrieve your car so I almost missed my scheduled appointment time, what a nightmare that was. The hotel had never put us down for a wake up call and all the front desk could say to us was \"sorry\" which I thought was a little unacceptable for the inconvenience they had caused us. Housekeeping came very late in the afternoon on the first day, around 2 pm. The second day they didn't bother to show up at all and my husband had to call for someone to come clean our room. The location in Boston is great and the beds are very comfortable. The shower had very poor water pressure and the door opened awkwardly into the toilet. Our \"mini bar\" which was supposed to be replenished daily was never re-stocked. If you are not an Omni Member you have to pay 9.95 a day for internet access but it is free to become one. There are no DVD players in the room which was very disappointing for me being laid up after surgery.

We stayed in a Suite in the hotel. This hotel is all about history and character. The lobby is beautiful with a strong English influence and ornate, dark wood paneling; the hotel lobby reminds me of an old inverstment bank in London from the early 1900's. There is also original art on the walls. The hotel has a lot of history - this is where John F, Kennedy proposed to Jackie and the first reading of the Christmas Carol by Dickens occured. The Omni is on the Freedom Trail across the street from the old City Hall, which is an excellent location. It is in the middle of the action with easy access to the 'T' subway system. The service was friendly. A bell hop walked over to us and snapped a photograph of my wife and myself without being prompted. The rooms are smaller than in more modern hotels. You can not get around the fact that this was built in the late 1800's. Even the Suite that we stayed in was small . The bathrooms are also tiny. In my first stay, the walls seemed like cardboard, you could hear everything all around. In the Suite during our most recent stay, it was much quieter. The rooms are also in need of a remodel. You should only stay here understanding these limitations; otherwise, you will be disappointed. This is a difficult hotel to rate. The Omni certainly has character and we had a nice stay, but it is not practical for families with children. They will quickly overwhlem the tight living quarters. The location is fantastic, but the new Nine-Zero is next door, with more up to date amenities. I would really rate it 3.5 stars if possible.

No call so I called them. Different manager. DOUBLE UGGH. No room and the GM had supposedly reviewed call to reservation center and there was no discussion of a 2nd night.

There are many prior positive reviews, so if your interest is in flat screen tv's, having a bed with 7 pillows on it (for your seven heads?) or just enjoying the general appearance of luxury then you will be well- served by reading those reviews. As someone as much into quiet and cleanliness than superficial comfort and obsequious staff, this was clearly not the hotel for me. As with many aging hotels, a lot has been retrofitted, and the focus is definitely on appearance more than substance. Room temperature, for instance, is controlled by some horrifically ancient heating/cooling unit under the window. This thing would kick in every few minutes with an astonishing amount of noise. I know ventilation/heating isn't always quiet, and i am accustomed to having to turn such things off at night in order to be able to sleep (irrespective of the resulting temperature change), but this was easily loud enough to drown out conversation during the daytime, and with a 5-10 minute duty-cycle was incredibly annoying. As with most hotels, they seem to have not fully considered sound proofing, and corridor noise can be a major problem. When i awoke after my first night in this hotel, i was surprised to find the remnants of the previous guest's coffee still in the coffee maker. Rather more repulsive was finding short, curly hairs still in the shower. I am not sure if this is intentional or further imperfection, but the hot water is very far from hot---even after waiting for nearly 5minutes with the tap on full hot the water was at best lukewarm. This was not helped by the \"water saver\" shower head--- running around to get wet under a few, low-volume streams of lukewarm water is not a positive shower experience. For a vegetarian, this place is also far from adequate, although admittedly not much worse than other hotels. The in-room dining has a few egg dishes and grilled vegetable sandwich, but beyond that you'll be eating out or not eating. The hotel promised high-speed wireless access. In fact, it's high- speed *wired* access. This makes a difference---i didn't bring my usual, long ethernet cable since i was assuming wireless, so i ended up unplugging their cable from the phone so i could stretch it to my laptop. When i initially asked about the lack of wireless the concierge informed me of the ethernet port and claimed there was a cable in the closet---not true.

Our view was not the best since we were looking directly into office windows with people working. We asked the front desk late one night about any places still open serving pizza. They said there weren't but directed us to the room service menu. We checked it and the high prices made us decide to try looking online. While back in the lobby we asked a bellman walking by the same question and he gave us the exact same answer. It took me about two minutes to find a place that was a few blocks away that was open. This kind of upset me but maybe I can give them the benefit of the doubt. The location of the hotel is great.

It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids. Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. We stayed 3 nights at the Omni Parker House in Boston. I chose it through Trip Advisor and looking at its history on the internet, but the travel agent booked it for us. We had stayed at the Omni in Washington on a previous trip and it was excellent, and had booked for the Omni in San Francisco on this trip too. I'd also joined the Omni chain's Select Guest program (free, over the internet, on the Omni website), which I'd recommend if you're considering staying at an Omni (free juice/coffee and newspaper, room delivered every morning). Once again, we had a double room for ourslves and a triple room for our offspring. The Omni Parker House seems a lovely old historic hotel, but unfortunately it didn't do us justice at the time. It was undergoing renovations externally, so I took no photos of the outside. There was a workman's lift right outside the kids' room, which seemed to run from about 6.00am to 9.00pm (even on a Saturday night). Fortunately, the last night was a Sunday, and they didn't work then. The foyer is nice, but the rooms, though well appointed, were the smallest we stayed in all trip, and very crowded. Ours had 2 (probably queen-sized) beds, a chair, TV unit (with drawers), and a bedroom table between the 2 beds that was cluttered with everything as provided by the hotel (phone, clock, tea/coffee making & mini-bar accoutrements, magazines and the Hotel's books on Boston, ice bucket and glasses, etc). That meant that there was actually no desk or table to put anything on. If we'd been sharing a room, it would have been impossible. There was a closet with a safe and room for 1 suitcase (we, of course, had 2 - cold country touring for 4 weeks takes up luggage space). The bathroom was also small but not too bad for us two. Internet access was free (for Omni Select Guests), but it was via ethernet connected to the telephone. This proved problematic - the phone was on the cluttered bedside table and there were no spare powerpoints. We actually had to get an extension cord from housekeeping, pull out the bedside table (which had the minibar fridge built into it), and virtually recable the phone so that it would reach to where the laptop had to be to get power. Then we wrote emails with the laptop on our knees or on the bed. The room really needed to be a single room, with one less bed and a desk and chair. The rooms that we had at the Omni Parker House were much smaller than in the Omni in San Francisco, and tiny compared to the rooms at the Omni in Washington. Valet parking was the only option unless you knew where the parking garages were, but the service was quick, though hampered by the construction work outside. The staff were friendly, but weren't as accommodating as at the Omni in San Francisco (who let the kids get juices under the Select Guest program - not in Boston as they weren't members themselves; a pot of \"hot\" chocolate as an apology for late delivery, but it was almost cold when it arrived). The location, however, is very good. Close to the 2 main historic walking trails, various shops (including the ubiquitous Macey's), buses, a collection point for the various \"Beantown Trolley Tours\", the Boston Common (including a popular ice-skating rink), and restaurants. We found a great place for cheap breakfasts ($3.00 for bacon, eggs and pancakes) just around the corner and a fabulous and reasonably priced restaurant called Fajitas & 'Ritas (guess what's on the menu), again around the corner. There were also some fine Irish pubs in the vicinity. The historic walks are easy to navigate, and the trail is marked on the sidewalk. We drove from New York in about 5 hours. Boston city (and it's parkways) was not the easiest place to navigate by road, but we downloaded excellent directions from Manhattan to get to the hotel from Google in advance, and these were accurate and worked well. We went up to Salem too (say, an hour's drive), which was a quaint little place, despite it's black history.

We also ate in the Parker Bar, The Last Hurrah, and the restaurant for lunch and can recommend them all. The hotel does need some renovation but I liked the character of the hotel and for once you didn't feel like you were staying somewhere that could have been in any city in the world. The beds were so comfortable it was difficult to get out of them in the mornings! But we did and walked the whole city - being on the Freedom Trail we of course did the tourist thing but we also walked to TD Banknorth Gardens, up to Copley Place and Newbury Street, with the posh shops, and Downtown Crossing was just round the corner where Macy's is located. There's also a cinema just down the road which was very helpful on Thanksgiving Day when everything else was closed. It sounds from the manager's comments that internal renovations are going to be made and then I think this really will be one of the very best hotels in the city.

There were 3 of us two adults and 10 year old daughter. This is a very old hotel with lots of history. This is just what we wanted. If you want modern and cold this hotel is not for you. It is perfectly located right on the Freedom Trail and central to everything. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I was a little apprehensive having read previous reviews concerning the construction work and the small rooms. Our room was on 14th floor and I can honestly say that the construction work did not bother us at all. In fact, my husband found it very interesting watching the progress of the work from time to time. I really enjoyed the beautiful view of the Boston skyline at one point I could see as far as the river. Yes the work started early in the morning but who goes to Boston to stay in bed! Our room had 2 double beds and plenty of room for all 3 of us. It was a warm and cosy room and spotlessly clean. The complimentary (select guest) coffee and hot chocolate for my daughter left at the door each morning with a complimentary newspaper was a lovely touch. Our room was cleaned each day and towels, soaps etc were all replaced. We had breakfast (buffet $18 and $10 for child) each morning in the beautiful dining room. This was very good value especially when you convert to Euros. The staff were very helpful and welcoming even calling my daughter by her first name after first meeting. This was a wonderful way to start each day! We did not have dinner in the Hotel as there were so many places in Boston we wanted to try. I did see the Menu and it looked good! We had lunch in the Last Hurrah before we left for the Airport . My daughter had a lovely caesar Salad and I had the famous \"chowda\" which was to die for! Again the staff here were very effecient and very welcoming. I was a little concerned that this hotel might be a little dull for our daughter but this was not the case even though she seemed to be the only child around for the first couple of days.

Here is the good: 1) Centrally loacted to everything within walking distance (Freedom Trail, etc). This hotel is the heart of the city. Unless you are going somewhere really outside of the city, you will not need a taxi. Gotta love a hotel with a good location! 2) Friendly service everywhere. Fast check-ins, fast valet, great conceriege, great servers, etc. 3) The inside is historically beautiful. Very pretty old, dark wood. Charming. But old. Yes...old. Did i mention old? 4) The Parker Bar, restaurant and Last Hoorah bar (all located in the hotel) are great and upscale. This is an unscale hotel. No teenagers or little kids. We saw two weddings in the hotel. This is a good wedding location. JFK proposed to Jackie O in this hotel. That says alot about the charm huh? 5) Housecleaning service is outstanding. Best i have seen in a long time and i travel ALOT. 6) Room service was outstanding (fast, good, reasonable). 7) Good gym in the hotel and a Starbucks. Yes, in the hotel. 8) Bed is comfortable. Not the best that i have seen, but not the worst. I slept fine. No complaints. 9) Lots of nice extras, like good shampoo, lotion, starch, etc. These are replinshed each day by housekeeping. Here is the bad. 1) This is the oldest working hotel in the U.S. That means a few things. The rooms are smaller than hotels that we are used to. The t.v. is a tiny little t.v., not the huge ones that we are used to in modern hotels. 2) The bathroom is very tiny and my husband and i could not be in there at the same time (i weigh 100 pounds and 5'2). This would not be a problem if there was a cheap mirror somewhere in the room, but there was not. I wish the Omni Parker would spring for a cheap full length mirror that could be in the closet or somewhere!! It was very hard getting ready each day and not looking in a mirror. Omni- buy a plastic full length mirror. Us ladies need to look at our outfits before we go out! 3) The rooms do not have safes. We like to have safes. 4) You are in the heart of a big city. This hotel is noisy. You hear cars, people, whistles, etc 24 hours per day. If you want peace and quiet, this is NOT the hotel for you. 5) I thought the towels were a bit rough and could be nicer for this expensive of a hotel. 6) Within 1 hour of arrival, our main light bulb burnt out. No problem. We called down to the front to get someone to fix it. 2 days later, no one has come. My husband changed the bulb himself with one in the bathroom. 7) Again, this is an old hotel. Small bathtub that you cant use. And so tingy that you would not anyways. 8) Hard (even) for hotel staff to get me a taxi. I waited for quite awhile for hotel staff to hail a cab. 9) This hotel is underoing remodeling on the outside only. The WHOLE hotel is enclosed in scaffolding. You cannot open your window or a construction worker will be looking at you. Literally. My husband was caught off guard naked. Yes, they work Mon-Fri from 8-5. Very noisy, my fellow trip advisor friends. Ask when the remodel is complete before booking your stay. I do not know if i would stay here again. I loved the location dearly. So close to everything. But i am getting a bit spoiled for my need to have a big room and modern amenities. I hope that helps all. This hotel is not cheap either. We paid for a room with two beds from Thu-Mon and it was roughly 380.00(or more on the weekend) per night. We stayed in room 416. Ask yourself: Location or Modern Amenities? Then you have your answer. Boston Tips: * Do not miss the North End. Get a map. Look for it. It is not to be missed. * Can be difficult to get a taxi on the weekend. Give yourself a bit of time if you need to hail one. * Bring walking shoes. This is a walking city. *Subway felt a bit unsafe. Take a taxi if you are alone. *Do not miss Salem. Worth the 30 minute drive. Wonderful town at Halloween time. Great for kids. A huge carnival. Have your kids (or yourself) dressed in Halloween attire.

There were hairs all over the bathroom and blood spatters on the shower curtain. After a long day traveling, I cleaned it up myself rather than wait for housekeeping. The bathroom constantly smelled like a sewer throughout my stay. When I asked maintenence about it, I was told it was an old hotel. On Sunday morning, housekeeping knocked on my door despite my \"privacy please sign\". When I asked them to come back later in the afternoon, the housekeeper actually rolled her eyes at me, as if this were a huge imposition. It was very hot and humid and I had my air conditioner set so the room was cool when I left. When I returned after midnight after a long day of appointments and a client event, the housekeeper not only had turned the a/c off, but had turned the heat on - it was like an oven. It took over an hour before it was cooled down enough to sleep. We had Tuesday monrning off, so I planned on sleeping in. But no, at 8am sharp workment with jackhammers sounded as though they were breaking into my room. I called the front desk to ask what was happening, and they said they were working on the brick facing outside. I was very unhappy that no one had told me about this construction work when I checked in. I spoke with the front desk supervisor, who apologized, but sounded like she could not have cared less. By this time, after so many problems, and no satisfaction at all, I called the General Manager, Dick Mason, and left a message. He called me back 4 hours later. He argued with me about whether it was jack hammers or air chisels, said they figured all the guests would be at the convention by 8am anyway, and it was the city that was doing the work, not them. He was rude and condescending, commenting that there were 6000 people in Boston for the conference and there was no way he would adjust my rate, or do anything else to make ammends for their poor housekeeping, maintences and customer service. To say I was surprised at this complete lack of hospitality by the General Manager of this caliber of hotel is an understatement.

After much research, the Omni was our top choice and we were not disappointed. We are from the easy going state of Arizona and thought this may be out of our budget and league. Considering Boston is an expensive place to visit , the hotel rates were within reason. With all the famous people that have stayed there, we assumed we may have to tolerate some sobbishness. This was not the case! Many families were staying there and the staff could not have been more professional, friendly, helpful and courteous. We had a standard room with double beds. I guess coming from a big family, the three of us did not have a problem with the size of the room nor the bathroom. The room was immaculate with a candy on our pillows and plenty of towels and toiletries. We were given a view that we got a kick out of--overlooking the corner where the first public school in the country is located and around the corner is a cemetery. Location was key to us and this was the perfect place to start our day's activities. The \"T\" was within a 5 minute walk and we were right on the Freedom Trail. No need for a rental car--the \"T\" took us everywhere we wanted to go. We even took the \"T\" to and from the airport. Our second mode of transportation was our feet! Everything is close by. We did have the opportunity to eat at the Parker Bar. Great food and reasonable prices. We also stopped in at the Last Hurrah and enjoyed munchies. I'm not much for alcoholic drinks and the staff was kind enough to go to the kitchen to fix a cup of hot cocoa for me (it was rainy that day). I regret not getting around to trying the famous Parker House Rolls. For families on a budget, the hotel is just a minute away from donut , coffee, bagel shops and good old McDonald's. Did you also know the hotel is haunted <G>? The front desk provides a \"fact\" sheet of all the ghosts that wander the property. The Omni is also one of the stops for the ghost tours that are conducted in Boston. Yes, the hotel is definitely going through renovations, but the workers do not work too early and by the time we got back each day to our room, they were gone.

My only complaint was in having only one table to put things on. After accomodating the phone, clock, snack basket, lamp and coffee tray, there was no room for maps, watches, etc. And when we received our other coffee tray in the morning, we ended up having to store things on the floor beside the tv cabinet. Other than that, we had no complaints about the rooms. My only real complaint came from the gentlemen that waited on us in the Last Hurrah. We had dinner there one night and then stopped in for Boston Creme pie one afternoon. We found the two gentlemen that waited on us to be a bit cold and unfriendly.

I am so delighted to let everyone of you know that this hotel is a great find! I would like to thank all of those who recommended it on Trip Advisor because without you, I most likely wouldn't have any idea what to expect. First of all, the front desk and valet are so nice. We had 2 junior suite rooms (3 women in each room). We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 a.m. (check-in is 3:00 p.m. if I'm not mistaken), and was able to check into one of the rooms! How nice is that? We were pleasantly surprised to find the our junior suite to be pretty large - my guess would be 550 to 600 s.f. It was very clean unlike some of the reviews. There were 2 very comfortable double beds and a sofa bed!!! Seriously, we easily could've fit more than 3 people in there, but it was nice having that large room. The hotel had a Starbuck's which is definitely a plus with our group (only 1 doesn't drink coffee). The gym looked nice although none of us ever made it in there! The only reason I am only giving the hotel a 4-star rather than 5 is that I did ask for a higher floor (although my girlfriends thought it was better to be lower during our \"intoxicated\" evenings, ha! ha!). We also had a problem with the toilet one day which of course they fixed the problem right away. There is construction going on although they gave me the 2 rooms not facing the construction and the rooms were next to each other which I thought was really nice. Next time we go back to Boston, we will definitely stay there again! The hotel has the BEST LOCATION ever! We walked all over the place - Quincy Market, Fanneil (sp?) Hall, North End, Back Bay area, etc. The T stop is also a block away if you don't want to walk. Trust me, you will be VERY pleased! Thanks to all of the wonderful employees at the Omni Parker! Boston is a great place to visit - kinda reminds me of my hometown Chicago - friendly and tons to do. A couple of restaurants I HIGHLY recommend are Taranta in the North End area and Atlantic Fish Co. in Copley Square.

It is, by comparison \"a nice older hotel\" -- certainly not fancy if you've seen any of the top-rated older properties in the major cities of the world. Yes, it's nice inside!! But, it will not take your breath away. Echoing the remarks of the previous posters, the rooms are on the small side (although I understand that there are a number of different floorplans). The first one I was in had a king size bed, a desk, small \"easy chair\" and an armoire. While it was nice to have such a big bed, the \"walkable area\" around the bed was spare to say the least.. When my friend came to see the room, I attempted to move the desk chair -- on one side of the room -- to the other side of the room where the easy chair was so that we could face one another and talk. Try as I did, I could not wrest the desk chair from its cramped space between the bed and the desk. (I could have laid it on its side, rotated it and slided it out from under the desk but we opted to take a walk to Quincy Market instead. The second room had a queen but it was a slightly smaller room so it was not much better. Both rooms had carpet that was badly stained -- as if someone had dropped a pot of spaghetti sauce on the carpeting and did their best to wipe it up. It was murky and dark -- pretty unappetizing. The great news about this hotel is the location -- 2 blocks from 2 separate subway stations (\"T\" stations, as they are known in Boston) which afforded access to three separate subway lines to whisk you throughout the city. THe Parker House is also within walking distance of Boston Common. Fanheiul Hall and a whole bunch of other sites so if walking is on your list of things to do in Boston, then the Parker House is a good choice. THe service was above average. The concierges were especially helpful in giving directions and making restaurant recommendations.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Room service was always prompt. I am always happy to stay somewhere with history or a hotel with character rather than just a chain hotel that could be in any city or any town. That said, however, the condition of the carpet in the hallway on the third floor and in our 1-bedroom suite was deplorable. The only way to describe the condition directly outside our room (306) is NASTY and in the room was not much better. It is inexcusable that the Parker House would let things get to this point. The furniture was also frayed (which I could live with) and stained and filthy (which I could not). We hated to sit on the sofa but had to sit someplace. I thought of asking to be moved but after walking the hallways on 2 other floors I decided it could not be much better in other rooms. After reading the other reviews on this site I have decided that decision was a mistake. Apparently not many others have had that problem and I'm happy for their luck. We must have been assigned the worst area of the hotel! I was in the room one day when the maid cleaned and she did an excellent job so none of my complaints are with her. When I did bring it up to the young lady at the front desk, she was very nice and told me the hotel is to be renovated soon. (When I don't know -- perhaps sometime between now and never?) At any rate she was very apologetic. Unfortunately, no apology could make up for that carpet. I have not seen anything that horrible in a hotel room in many, many years. Perhaps a token pass with a steam cleaner?? I was amused to hear the \"haunted tour\" near the hotel one night talking about the 3rd floor of the Parker House being the haunted floor.

Even after paying a $25 cancellation penalty, I still saved over $100 on the rebook.) The hotel is indeed a great location, right on the Freedom Trail between the Boston Common and Quincy Market. It's also right between two T-Stops. We had a slight hiccup on check-in: I had reserved a junior suite expecting to get two doubles and a sofa bed and turns out not all junior suites have sofa beds. We checked in to find ourselves in one of those junior suites that doesn't have a sofa bed. The hotel offered to move us to the only junior suite open with a sofa bed, but warned us that this particular room was near construction and there might be noise early in the morning. So, we decided instead to stay put and accept a complimentary rollaway, which turned out to be a hit with the teenage boys fighting over who got to sleep in it. The Omni House was a great choice. Besides being an impressive historic hotel that is very well located, it had all the conveniences we needed including a Starbucks and snacks in the gift shop downstairs, a computer room where I could check email daily, complimentary juices/beverages at our door each morning, and very comfortable beds with luxurious linens.

While my colleague had a mini bar in her room, my room was too small to even have a picture of one. This may be an isolated case, but an irritating one nonetheless. Now the stars go down to 4. My iron had burnt crust on it and thus left some on my shirt before realizing I had to clean it myself so I could use it in the here and now and not have to wait around for housekeeping to bring me another one. This should be verified BEFORE the client check is\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Breakfast was superb; every day! I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rave enough about it. The healthy choices are exquisite and I loved the small shotglass of fresh fruit smoothie at the end; nice finishing touch and caring enough of them to have your daily minimum required amount of fibre!! Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget the wait staff and hostess, all polite and efficient. The Last Hoorah bar is great. The food served is delicious and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait around for hours to be served. Parking attendants, on the other hand, will make you wait quite a bit. I checked out on the Monday morning and asked the attendant if it was busy. When he replied negatively, I asked for my car and waited at least 20 minutes. I STRONGLY suggest calling for your car 15 minutes beforehand, no less. For a whopping 38$ per night you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect service to be a little quicker. Another piece of advice, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call long distance to your loved ones, even if it is for a couple of seconds. The brutal connection fee of 14$ per call will quickly add up to a traumatizing experience. Be WARNED!! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend the place to most people but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to go about getting a better room next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m there. Sucking up is not my thing.

I was the latter. I stayed there for 5nts and thoroughly enjoyed it. First of all, it is in a terrific location. It is on School and Tremont Streets right in the heart of downtown, and it is on the Freedom Trail. Nearby are Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, which aside from their historical significance, provide a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and a comprehensive food court. It is also right between two major subway stops, Park Street and Government Center. Both stations provided access to the North Station where you can hop on a commuter train if necessary. The lobby is rather large; the staff is very personable and professional; the room was a good size (2 dbl beds/nonsmoking) and clean. The bathroom was quaint with all the comforts of home. One caution...if you are a mini bar user, check the dates on items. There were some bottles of juice that looked like they had been there for years and not replaced, and some of the items had dust on them. If you are in need of the internet, it's a good idea to bring your own laptop. We made the mistake of not bringing ours and had to pay $5.95 for only 15 minutes of use on the hotel's public computer.

He ignored me and then ran to the corner to hail a cab (I could have done that myself). Another family exited around that time and the porter wanted us to share a taxi to the airport (2 in our party and 3 in the other). Finally another taxi came and we placed our own bags in the trunk and rushed in to leave immediately since we were already 15 minutes behind schedule. The porter flagged down our taxi before we left and demanded a porter-taxi fee even though he failed to have a taxi ready for us at the time we requested. I gave him a couple of dollars as I was too tired and too rushed to argue. My wife called the hotel after we got to the airport and they said they didn't have a porter-taxi fee.

The Omni Parker House in Boston is a great hotel. I highly recommend it. The hotel is nice and is in a terrific location. It seemed like it was close to everything. It is formerly the Boston Parker House. I was quite surprised to discover the rooms are very very small--even for 2 people. We were given a room with 2 full size beds. Waaaaay too crowded. I kept bumping into things. We stayed in the room our first night. The next morning I requested a room with one queen or king bed. Luckily, one was available and so we switched rooms. Room still small but no where near as crowded. The bathrooms were small, too that had a pedastal sink, so no counter top. The bedroom has high ceilings and has the charm of an older hotel. But, that is Boston: old and charming. I do have my complaint about the room and bathroom being small but I would say overall, hotel is still an excellent place to stay. Staff was always friendly and helpful. Concierge always there to give recommendations (where to eat etc.) Also, we needed a rental car for one day (drove up to New Hampshire) and concierge made the rental car reservations for us. The car was brought to our hotel. One less thing to worry about.. Note: You do not need a car to see Boston. The best way to see Boston is by foot.

I was very excited to be staying in this historic hotel (claimed to be the oldest in the U.S.) even though I felt the nightly rate to be excessive. This is my 4th trip to Boston and it has become one of my favorite cities. The location of the Omni Parker House is outstanding, within easy walking of all the sites of central Boston and well within reach of anything else by cab. The doormen were always quick at getting us a cab and very helpful with suggestions and advice. There is so much to see and do in Boston, this convenient location made it easy to access all the fun I wanted. However, even knowing this was the nation's oldest hotel was no excuse for the poorly kept rooms, their bad smell and lousy restaurant, front desk and lobby store service. They claim there is a ghost in the hotel and I have no doubt this ghostly haunting is someone's way of getting revenge on the hotel for the same problems I encountered. The room was incredibly small, almost too small for two people. When several friends arrived to pick us up for dinner, we all could not even fit in the room at one time! Fortunately, we were rarely in our room and this saved us from feeling too ripped off. We ate breakfast in the restaurant on 2 mornings. They were only a handful of patrons in the restaurant and despite the fact that there was a breakfast buffet and at least 4 staff were visible, the service was slow and the staff surly. When they found out we wanted to order off the breakfast menu instead of having the buffet their attitude got even worse. I ordered the lox and bagels, which cost almost as much as the buffet and was very disappointed to see that my plate was put together by the waiter from the buffet spread! The other wait staff doing set up and clean up were very noisy and practically threw things from across the room! The way they handled the lovely antique sideboard was appalling. The lobby shop leaves a lot to be desired. Granted they were in the middle of adding coffee services but this was no excuse for poor service. I went into buy some Kotex for an unexpected emergency and was told I could not purchase them as the staff could not get one register to work and did not have the key to the other register and the guy who did was out for coffee! I asked to leave money over the amount of the purchase ($5.00 for a $2.99 purchase) and pick up my change later as this really was an emergency and she refused and suggested I walk several blocks to the drug store. Several times I went into the store and there was no one there at all to pay for my purchases. The front desk was very inefficient, we checked out at 5 am for a 6:30 flight and waited 40 minutes for a bell boy to get our bags. The front desk had only 2 computers working and it took almost 30 minutes to check out at the desk due to the computers not taking the information and having to be reentered repeatedly. The front desk staff were very friendly and in their defense, the hotel was extremely busy and they even said their computers were so antiquated they did not know how they got through the day sometimes. Worse yet it was the front desk staff that had to double as bell boys and get bags from the room during check out that morning. On a positive note, the bar was most excellent, just the flavor and character I have come to expect from Boston. Elegant and interesting surroundings, wonderful and personable bartenders who definitely know how to serve a real cocktail. I would not stay here again as I felt it was not a good value for the price due to lousy service and size of the room, despite its historical significance, excellent in house bar and convenient location.", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice\u201d", "Author": "TAmembers", "ReviewID": "UR5795481", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights on family tour of New England.

The location of the Omni Parker House is unmatched. You are ON the Freedom Trail, a block away from two T (subway) stations, five minutes' walk from Faneuil Hall, ten minutes' walk from the North End. With this location Omni could fake everything else, but they don't. We got helpful handling of our reservation by Skyler, a clean, quiet, comfortable room that was ready on time, attitude-free service, free orange juice in the morning, and free wired high-speed Internet service. The price made Omni Parker House a very good value indeed, while introducing us to a hotel chain which delivered a high quality stay in Boston. There is good advice in the reviews dated before this one. We took advantage of it. Let me summarize the key points I learned from other reviewers, plus some things I discovered: 1. Join the Omni Select Guest program (see the Omni website) before you do anything. It is free, almost instantaneous, has no downside, and has numerous benefits (priority in room selection when they assign rooms, that free orange juice, and more.) Use your Select Guest number every time you can. 2. Rooms vary a lot because it is a very old hotel. Phone direct at an unbusy time and seek your reservationist's advice. (When you arrive, if you don't like what you get, ask to see one or two other rooms. We didn't have to do that but another TripAdvisor reviewer did.) 3. Stay on the 8th floor or above for quiet. Even though the windows seal well, you are in the middle of the city and police and ambulance vehicles go right by with sirens on. (On the 11th floor, noise was not a problem for us.) 4. If it works for you, select a king-size bed rather than two double beds. They put the noise-making minibar between the beds in most dual-double bed room layouts. 5. Book online for the best price (we saved a little by specifying the AAA rate), but then contact the reservationist with your confirmation number and Select Guest number and add your requests. We had to have a non-smoking room because of my wife's allergies, so the reservationist added a strong note to our reservation record. We also asked for a corner room (it's larger) and a high floor. All of those requests were honored. 6. Skip their costly phone and average restaurant. Use your cell and go out for meals. (Since we took that TripAdvisor advice, I cannot say anything about the Parker House restaurant or its famous dinner rolls.) We walked and used the T to explore Boston. We found the old twisty streets confusing, especially with the Big Dig not quite done, and got lost the first night we arrived. The following days I used the map much more carefully and we got the hang of it pretty soon. For instance, the fast way to Faneuil Hall/North End is to walk toward downtown, pass the T station on your left, go through the paved area between two monolithic buildings in Government Center, and there you are across the street from it! The North End has wonderful Italian restaurants. Our favorite destination restaurants were #1 Taranta, #2 Terramia. They are both ten minutes' walk from the hotel. Excellent pizza and pasta and delicious cannoli desserts are no further away. A bagel shop and a 7-11 are one or two short blocks away; their items plus freshly made in-room coffee and the aforementioned orange juice gave us a good fast start every morning. The hotel's final convenience was the Avis rental car office that is a five-minute walk from the Parker House. We trundled our bags over there and drove away with good route advice after our car-free Boston trip segment was done.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Location, Staff\u201d", "Author": "phick", "ReviewID": "UR4253264", "Content": "This is a great place to stay.

On arrival at the Omni Parker House, we were informed that the king/2-double deluxe room we reserved was now a Queen deluxe. Despite voicing our dissatisfaction, the only response was that \"it's written in the really fine print\". Not a good start to our stay. The room itself was small but reasonable, had a nice view, and the interior was well maintained. The small bathroom was inviting considering it was the size of a closet. The TV was a bit on the small side, about 24 inches, and the one on-demand movie we ordered had some A/V problems. The vending machine on our floor was out of service and was not repaired for the duration of our three day stay. The hotel has complimentary internet service via ethernet cable in the rooms. Our cable was broken and had to be replaced - with another broken cable. After the first day, I could not get online via hotel internet despite calling the toll-free tech support.

I had previously stayed here about 5 years ago for a conference and since I had a good experience then, I decided to book the hotel again while vacationing in Boston with my parents 10/14-10/18. I know some people have complained about the size of the rooms, but both times I have stayed in the Executive Double room and was pretty pleased with the size and configuration. The room was huge - about 500-600 square feet with a sofa, coffee table, TV w/ cable in a nice armoir, 2 easy chairs, 2 double beds with that comfy triple sheeting and down comforters, a small area with workdesk, 2 closets and a decent size bathroom with tub. I had originally booked a regular double room but decided to sign up with the Omni Select Guest Program. You must do this if you plan to stay at the Omni!! I got a coupon for a room upgrade which I used this time and another coupon for 50% off a weekend stay at any Omni! However you must book through Omni and not thru Expedia, etc. Also, being a \"select guest\" they get the room ready to your specs and offer complimentary morning beverages for you and everyone staying with you, plus a small but discounted room service breakfast menu. The room was nice and quiet, although occasionally I would hear faint voices from the room beside us and out in the hall but it didn't bother us at all. We were on the 4th floor so didn't hear any noise from the street below. We had a view of a side street with some restaurant and shops and partially of a brick parking garage but that was ok. All of our interactions with staff were great. The front desk staff were especially nice and always ready to assist. My parents had accidently put their wet umbrellas in a trash can in our room and the maid threw them away thinking they were broken, however the front desk was very helpful in investigating for us and even gave us a credit on our bill for the inconvenience. We did have a light dinner in the Last Hurrah bar and the salads were huge and reasonably priced. The drinks were a little pricey but typical for a hotel. Overall, I highly recommend the Omni Parker House if you're staying in the city. It is centrally located near the T, Boston Common, the Freedom Trail and a few blocks walk to Faniuel Hall/Quincy Market. Plus, its beautifully gilded lobby and decor is very nice, and staying in such a historical place is so interesting! (JFK proposed to Jackie O here, Malcolm X and Ho Chi Minh worked here, etc).

The reception, concierge, bellhop, restaurant waiters, bar waiters - everyone was friendly and helpful, and I felt very welcome in their hotel. Phone calls down to the concierge or reception for problems or questions were answered promptly and with great courtesy. I never felt like anything I was asking for was a problem. 3. Atmosphere - I know this is silly, and entirely subjective, but I hate staying at hotels that all feel the same as every other hotel, where you could be in any other city if the curtians are drawn. No such feeling in this place. It was beautiful, had character, and I felt like I was at home the whole time, rather than a sterile box.

The first time they checked in, the accompanying PA called and addressed the concern of the hotel. And I rushed in to check their room. Instead of contacting me beforehand, they already checked in. The room was awfully small. They squeezed two double beds into the single room and there was no way that my poor folks could unfold their suitcases unless putting them on the bed. There was one chair in the room but it was in the way making anyone unable to get out of the bed from the window side. Basically the room had 2' around two double beds and one separate bathroom with rusted & outmoded features. I remind the readers that this was the deluxe room. I wend to the lobby and asked for changing the rooms but they said it was all full as it was a graduation season.

The next best location will be HARVARD SQUARE. The third location will be Kendall Sq. MIT but there are only two hotels there.

I would definately stay here again, but not with our children or I'd move to a larger room. The room was very nice albeit small. There is a tiny closet which in the hotels' defense they try to make accomodating even though its stuffed with iron/ironing board, suitcase holder, hangers, extra pillows and blankets. It does not leave a lot of room for clothing. The beds were fine with very nice bedding, lots of pillows, etc. There is a chair shoved in the corner which is not really useful since you have to climb over the bed to get to it. The TV is in a huge cabinet which again takes up tons of room. All in all they try to make the room appealing but when you walk in with 4 people and luggage it's loses it's charm. The bathroom was very clean, but again small. The one major issue is the lack of outlets in the room. Today with portable this and that you need some outlets. We had to play \"Gumby\" and plug in the charger for our cellphone. After that no where else to plug in much of anything. This was a bit frustrating. The facility itself is gorgeous and in a prime location. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Again, if and when it's just me and my husband we would definatley stay here again.

Yet, he kept retunring to the back office to speak to someone whenever I made a request. It was very odd. Lastly, Kevin the \"manager\" of front office practically evicted me from the hotel. I was quite upset about waiting two hours, having keys that did not work, being sent to a smoking room, and entered an allready occupied room. I told him I would never stay at this hotel again and felt I should not have to pay for the night. Before I knew it he had cancelled my reservation and said I would not be charged for the night and I could go elsewhere. Honestly, who has that kind of staff?

It's right on the Freedom Trail and easily in walking distance of most of the places of interest, not that Boston is spread over a large area any way. It has a grand feel to it and despite its age, it is well maintained and comfortable. I read someone complain that the lifts here were slow but we found them to be amongst the fastest anywhere - we even commented on the fact while we were there. The hotel is exceptionally friendly. Front desk, concierge, management all go out of their way to offer a friendly smile. Only exception was in Parker's Restaurant over breakfast one day - the server was well below par. Watched some guests having to go and get their own coffee refills. She was the exception though. The room we had was on the 6th floor. It had one chair and two double beds and was extremely small. No table or desk, just a large refrigerated bar between the beds as a table - but cluttered with phone, coffee maker, lamp and selction of snacks and waters for sale - so no space for your own posessions. The view out of the window was of an office block across a very narrow alley which meant the curtains needed to be kept drawn most of the time. I booked direct with the hotel and got their 'net-savvy' rate which was around $179 per night and was comparable to hotels.com et al. when I booked. I suppose discounted rates do tend to lead to being allocated the smaller rooms, but for a 3 night stay it was more than adequate.

Everything was comfortable and clean and we loved the kitchenette.

My wife and I have visited regularly now for over a decade. Thanksgiving week was our third visit this year. The rooms are spacious and quite comfortable.

The couch in the livingroom turns into sleeping accommodations for two, so the unit sleeps four. The location really can't be beat. It's easy to get to and from via I-93 (the Big Dig) and access to the \"T\" is just steps away. It's even just a couple of stops away from Logan International on the T. The Custom House is adjacent to the Fanueil Hall/Qunicy Market area and close to the Haymarket Square area (a wonderful outdoor market that's open on Fridays and Saturdays) as well as being close to the North End and its restaurants and bakeries. The views from the various rooms are exceptional as are the views from the observation deck at the top of the building. All that being said, what makes the Custom House really special is its staff. They are marvelous--always welcoming and friendly and helpful. And there are many thoughtful and compelling amenities as well--things they don't have to do, but do to make the Custom House experience special. Many hotels make USA TODAY available. The Custom House delivers it to each door. On Sundays they make the Boston Globe available (while supplies last) at the front desk. They bake cookies at the front desk late each afternoon (and they're good!). During the late fall and winter, hot cider is available in the lobby--a very nice touch. Complimentary coffee is available in the Counting Room each morning, plus there's a slate of excellent entertainers available many nights, also in the Counting Room. The concierge staff is excellent, providing the sorts of services one would expect (but all too often doesn't get), but also offering orientations to the Boston area and beyond as well as tours of the facility itself. Another example of a nice touch. Just before Thanksgiving, a truly beautiful Christmas tree was placed in the center of the round lobby.

Why? Because as a time-share owner at Custom House, I have every reason to hype the place to the sky, but I'm going to be a bit critical too. You'll see. The historic building is an outstanding spot for a hotel, and Marriott did a great job with the conversion. In particular, the lobby routunda is stunning. The location is perfect. You are 50 feet away from a T station, two stops from the airport -- and within walking distance of everything, especially now that the Big Dig is complete. Because it's a time share building with hotel accommodations being something of an afterthought, it's best described as a limited service place. There's no restaurant, room service, or business center. There's no swimming pool, This is fine by me, if for no other reason than it tends to keep families with noisy little kids out of there. Hence, the Custom House tends strongly toward an adults-only atmosphere, thank God. And you won't want to have a car; there's no parking nearby, and even approaching it in a vehicle is tough. Let your cab driver, or the T, do that work. Also, you're one block from Quiicy Market/Faneuil Hall, and a short walk to all kinds of good restaurants, so not having a restaurant on the premises isn't any kind of tragedy. I know Boston very well, having lived there for more than a decade, and really don't think there's a better location for a tourist than this one. If yiou can get an upper floor room, the views are great. Either way, you'll want to go up to the observation deck to take in the view. Wow! Now, for the downsides. If they put you on a lower floor over the weekend, you'll hear the drunken revelers at the Irish pub. Bring earplugs and patience. During the week, it won't be a problem,.The room decor is shiny on the surface, but on closer inspection the furniture is on the cheaper side. The housekeeping could be a bit better, too. Nothing's crawling, but the place is starting to show wear and tear, and could use a renovation. Your \"kitchen\" consists of a sink, a small microwave, a small fridge, and some glasses and plates. You're not going to be cooking any meals at the Custom House, trust me. But I believe all the rooms are one-bedroom suites -- it's all I've ever had there -- and they're roomy, with a sleeper sofa in the living room. All in all, it's a fine place to stay, with a wart or two if you look closely. But that's true of just about anywhere I've ever stayed, so I have no hesitation giving this place a strong rating. It's not for everyone, but if you're an adult tourist with some sophistication, a feel for the big city, and a budget to match, In think you'll like this place quite a bit.

She found this hotel when she was looking through hotel options in Boston. She had stayed in the Long Wharf previously and had initially considered booking that hotel for this trip, but decided to go with the Custom House when she stumbled upon it. The price for our one bedroom suite at the Custom House was the same as for a standard double room at the Long Wharf. We loved the room because it had a nice entryway followed by a good sized living area with sofa, armchair, side table and coffee table. Next to the living area was a small dining area with dining table for four, mini fridge, microwave, sink, and cabinets stocked with dishes, glasses, silveware, etc. Beyond that was a breezeway leading to the bathroom followed by the master bedroom with king bed, built-in closet/drawers and tv. This room was large enough for my husband and I to comfortably share with our two year old. My sister slept on the pull out couch in the living room. Valet parking was easy and the hotel is centrally (for us) located. Just steps to Faneuil Hall. A short walk to the aquarium and wharf area. Also a short walk to the T line we needed to get out to the Sam Adams brewery. Although somewhat longer, we were also easily able to walk over to the Boston Common area to visit the park/gardens. The hotel was very clean and the staff were gracious and accommodating. When we arrived and realized we had forgotten a sheet for our daughter's pack and play, the sent an children's bedding set up to our room. When our daugther decided that she no longer wished to sleep in the pack and play, they quite gladly delivered a roll away bed to our room, which fit in the master bedroom with plenty of room to spare. It was not a typical cot, but an actual matress on a platform with wheels and came to us fully made up. It was low enough to the ground that we didn't have to worry about our daughter hurting herself if she fell out during the night (which she thankfully didn't). The concierge helped us to find and book brunch on Sunday before leave. She convinced us that the brunch cruise on the Odyssey wouldn't be too stuffy for our daughter and she was right. She even made sure that they knew we were celebrating our daughter's 2nd birthday and put together a small gift back for her on our last evening, as well. The hotel does charge for their continental breakfast, but we never made us of it and simply had fruit and breakfast bars in our room. The fridge was handy for storing milk, fruit and snacks for our daughter. There is no pool, but we were so busy doing other things in Boston that we didn't really notice. Because the hotel is run as a vacation resort, they do have daily activities that you can participate in, although our daughter was too young for most of them as they were geared at 4 and up. We did enjoy the wine/cheese hour that they appear to host on Friday evenings and made good use of the dvd collection that they have an allow you to borrow for in-room use. If you're staying for more than a few days or with children, we would all definitely recommend the Custom House.

Yes...I did note the other reviews about the noise before deciding on our 10 day reservation, but decided the location was worth the possible noise-and I was right! Let me break down my review into various aspects regarding the hotel: ROOM: Our room was on the 7th floor. We had a wonderful view and I absolutely LOVED the lay out (worked perfect for a family of four). The master bedroom (wonderfully comfortable bed!) was seperated from the living area (queen pull-out sofa bed) by a small hallway with a door at each end (master bedroom/living area) and a large bathroom. It was nice having the bathroom in the middle of the rooms with doors to block off each room to decrease any noise. The living area was large enough to accommodate a rollaway bed for my teenage son, along with the sofabed for my teenage daughter. There was still room to navigate to the utility kitchen area to access the refrigerator which contained all our left-overs and snacks. The utility kitchen contained a sink, microwave, small refrigerator and all the plates/utensils you would need. The room was clean and spacious. There are two TVs (master and living area), several club chairs, and large window sills to accommodate all the papers/tickets/magazines you will acquire while on your trip! NOISE: Yes...there was noise. Like many of the other reviewers, our room faced State St. and the pubs and the shopping complex(Faneuil Hall). You could hear muffled yelling, cheering, laughing, and car noise. We were also there during the Stanley Cup playoff win and for the home-town parade...so the streets/pubs were full of party-ers. I thought the noise would bother me, so I came prepared with earplugs. I never needed them. Our days were so full each day with tons of walking and activites that come nightime (and with the time change), we were exhausted and I can say that I have never slept so good on vacation! Yes (again), there is noise...you are downtown...but if you live in ANY city or rural neighborhood..you know you hear the community around you. I would not NOT stay here because of the noise...the positives so outweigh the negatives! LOCATION: You could not ask for a better location! A subway stop (3 stops from the airport-you DO NOT need a car!) right outside the hotel, wonderful restaurants 1 block away, the North End a 5 minute walk (or less), the waterfront (walking paths, aquarium, farmer's market, wharf, food etc..) 1 block away, Boston Commons, Beacon Hill, theater district and more ALL within walking distance...not to mention the Freedom Trail is literally 2 blocks from the hotel! You cannot beat the location of this hotel. AMMENITIES: Okay..the hotel does not have a pool and that was a concern of ours when deciding to stay here, but given the fact that you have access to the Marriot Wharf's pool only a block away, we decided that the Custom House would be a better choice between the two hotels and we were not wrong. If you are deciding between the two hotels...the Custom House wins hands down! We did walk over and use the other hotels' pool (once). It's an indoor pool and kind of on the small side (the room smells heavily of chlorine) and it just wasn't appealing to my two teenage kids. On a side note, the other hotel is not as welcoming either. Anyway, back to the Custom House....the lobby is historically beautiful (a treat in and of itself), there is a wonderful observation (360 degrees) deck on the roof that provides one of the best views of the whole city, there is a small private movie theater for guests use (our kids watched Pirates and had the room all to themselves w/popcorn and all!) where they will put in any movie/dvd you want, there is also a game room/playarea for the smaller kids as well, the breakfast area is well equipped and has a good selection of continental breakfast items (the very nice Portuguese lady who was working there even boiled my kids some eggs in the microwave!), there is no room-service but we didn't miss it at all! Overall, a wonderful experience. Boston is a marvelous city and the Custom House is a great place to stay.

To address the negative comments, yes, it was loud late at night because of the bar scene. We were on the 8th floor (802) and it was loud after 12am. However, if noise is a problem, pack your earplugs. Most city hotels are noisy. The carpet in the elevator and room was due for a change, but not dirty, just worn.

Our personal bellman was Rodney, who deserves a shout out for the great service and advice he offered. Apparently not everybody gets a personalized bellman. The Quincy Market was 100 steps from the building and there is plenty there to eat a reasonable prices. Quite a few fast food type places, several sit down places and at least 2 bakeries. As long as you don't stare blankly, everybody was eager to answer questions and get you your food quickly. At the market there were several street performers who worked the crowd for tips. Including a statue who would move after tipped. I watched one from a restaurant who did not moved for over 15 minutes. I was really impressed until I remembered that my brother in law hadn't moved from the couch in 2 years.

Check-in was no problem, the clerk said she'd noticed we'd requested a high room on our reservation and so she'd \"just\" moved us from the second floor to the fifth floor (no other rooms available). We were in 505, a typical suite type room with separate king bedroom. We used the sofa bed and a rollaway for the two teens. Comfortable king bed. While it was a bit tight with the rollaway, just the option to be able to get a rollaway was great. Having the extra space for the kids with their own tv, and the refrig and microwave was great, and a real value, I think, compared to other hotels I researched.

You can bring a drink up there and pretend it's the view from your room :) Also, as it's been said, it was noticably louder outside on Fri and Sat night compared to Thurs. We'd brought a travel sound machine to drown out the noise which helped us at least in the bedroom. The room seemed clean, but I did notice my white socks were noticably dirty after only an hour or so in there during the evening. We didn't spend much time in the room, typically leaving before 10 and getting back at 3 or 4 to regroup, before going out again. That's why when housekeeping tapped on our door to clean it five minutes after we'd just gotten back late one afternoon, it was a bit annoying and required some negotiation to have time to get ready and still allow the maid in there to get the room cleaned before she went home.

First of all, it's a great location and a very beautiful hotel. You really can't beat it. It was great that no matter where we were, we could look into the skyline and say \"There's our hotel\". The architecture inside and out was amazing. I booked our room via Expedia and asked for a room on an upper floor given what I had read from others regarding the noise from the local bars. The hotel accommodated my request (thank you!) I would HIGHLY recommend you do the same. There are 2 bars that are across the street from the hotel and they can get loud. We stayed in room 2301 (highest level of rooms) and we had no issues with noise. Our room was small, but it was nice to have a bedroom for myself and my husband while the girls had the living room as their own area. The bathroom was also small, but for a few days we made due. The view from our room was amazing! There is an observation deck on the 25th floor -- very cool!!! Also, there is a game room on the 24th floor. Nice touch. We only played a few quick games of air hockey, but this was fun and not something we really expected. There is a small fridge in the room...we filled it with water which was helpful as the bottled water offered by the hotel was $5/bottle (yikes!) Also, we brought granola bars for breakfast. There is a breakfast room with free coffee/tea/hot chocolate. The food is expensive ($2 for a yogurt, $2 for a small individual serving of cereal, etc.) It's nice they have this as an option, but we only chose to go there one morning. My only complaints....the carpets in our room needed cleaning badly! Can't tell this just by looking at the carpet since it is dark blue. I know this because everyday my socks were BLACK! And this was before I left the hotel for the day. Also, one day housekeeping did not come until 4pm. By then we were back in our room to take a quick nap before dinner & the Blue Man group (which I would recommend....especially if you have kids!) Those are my only 2 complaints.

As far as things to do...if you want to do A LOT purchase the GO BOSTON card ( we purchased ours from Costco online for $139/person and it was way worth it! We did the following and all were great with the exception on one; Aquarium, Boston Duck Tours, Fenway Tour, Harbor Tour, Sam Adams Tour, 2 day double decker bus access, Museum of fine arts, Science Center (all included with the Go Boston Card) The only disappointment was the Science Center ( people were rude and I was not impressed!!!). And for the best part....The Food!! You really can't go wrong no matter where you eat but we really enjoyed Bonavitos, Legal Seafood and Chart House.

I was looking for a home away from home for my trips to Boston with the kids. We wanted to be close to the aquarium and childrens museum and this place fit the bill perfectly. The suites are all identical corner units with huge windows and tall ceilings that will give my kids the consistency to consider this their \"Boston house\" as it will always seem the same to them no matter which suite we get. This gets them excited to visit without the anxiousness of going someplace foriegn. And excited to visit is just what they were when they saw the 20th floor activity center. Essentially the 20th floor is an indoor playground complete with a tree house type jungle gym, indoor play kitchen, coloring table, basket ball hoop, bowling ally game, train set, two huge doll houses and a childrens book library. And that is just the stuff I can remember playing with myself!! They really go out of their way to make kids feel welcome and my kids definitely appreciated it which is something I found quite unique considering how upscale the surroundings and decor was. The observation deck provides the best view of Boston available and although there is no indoor pool you get full use of the Marriott Long Wharfs indoor pool and facilities just for showing your key. And with the long wharf being only two blocks away it was an easy walk for even my 20 month old son. I personally felt that the custom house building and decor were far superior to the long wharfs and quite a bit more upscale. I'd also like to note that because the custom house is a smaller facility than the long wharf, there is a lot less \"busyness\" and as a result of this I think that the staff has the opportunity to offer a better level of service. As for the Custom house staff, there isn't enough room in this review to describe how great they were. From the concierge to the chambermaids I found nothing but professionalism. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and always there when we needed them and the housekeeping people were more than happy to accomodate the extra needs of my toddlers for blankets, towels and cribs. But personally, the most important thing of all was the fact that it seemed to us that everyone at the custom house loved their job. I've never seen more genuine smiles from a hotel staff in my life. Everyone we met seemed to truly be happy to see us and made my family feel like we were part of their family; which is a remarkable thing for a place as upscale as this. The comments I've made above represent what I consider to be true value, and although I'm a firm believer in the phrase \"You get what you pay for\", in the case of the Marriott Custom House you are getting far more than what your paying for. -Tim from Nantucket.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Barthelemy", "Title": "\u201cA plus experience and location\u201d", "Author": "islandmap", "ReviewID": "UR97693529", "Content": "After researching dozens of hotel options in downtown Boston, we decided on the Custom House based on reviews on Tripadvisor.

This breakfast is more than adequate and has just about everything you could possibly want with free tea/coffee/hot chocolate. There is also a cocktail lounge open from 6pm onwards. Nearby, you have a variety of wonderful restaurants as well as Quincy Market. We walked the whole of the city and thoroughly enjoyed ourselved in Boston. Finally, you can if you have a car take a trip out to Cape Cod or Rhode Island which aren't too far away. Cape Cod is about 1hr and its best to have lunch at one of the restaurants down by the marina as they are lovely and have a view of the sea. Hope this helps, when I have loaded my photos onto the computer I will post one of the inside of the Custom House which will show the beauty of it.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC, Best week ever\u201d", "Author": "lisac52003", "ReviewID": "UR89530498", "Content": "We had an amazing week in The Custom House, the staff were so friendly , extremely helpful + courtious.

I am a Marriott owner so I cannot rank \"value\" here because I just swapped a week of my timeshare. I read the poor review of someone from southern CA like me who apparently paid a lot, and I can understand. I got here Friday and had two sleepless nights thanks to the rowdy Irish bar crowds (even sirens). So, my recommendation #1, if you are staying here Fri or Sat--BRING EARPLUGS. I am not kidding. I am on the 9th floor and I could hear all the songs they were singing, and I usually sleep like a log. Now, after these nights, last night (Sunday) it was completely quiet, I rested well, and today happened to listen in on the history of this place. Being a historical landmark, they have lots of restrictions so I can now pardon why the bathroom is not so fancy, the windows cannot be made more soundproof, etc. It's fascinating how this building could be turned into a hotel in the first place. Try to join the tour crowds and you might appreciate the hotel more--they talk about how the elevators had to be put in, you get to see the clock mechanism on 24th floor (right in the laundry room). Of course it cannot be compared to my Newport timeshare with kitchen/jacuzzi size tub/laundry in my villa/much nicer and bigger kid's club....but it's understandable. It's also right next to the subway station so you don't have to walk a lot, esp when it's cold like today. The staff can probably be friendlier, but the concierge staff have been very nice. They also try to bring entertainers and give movies in the theatre every other day. No room service--as you can imagine. No nearby grocery--but all you've got is a microwave anyways. (The convenience store across the street is a joke). If you want fresh fruits and veggies either go to Whole foods (take the subway 3 stops to Bowdoin) or if you are here Sat AM go to Haymarket, the farmer's market is unbelievably cheap--cheaper than sunny California. Boston is TINY, you can easily walk to Legal Sea Foods, Sel de la Terre, both across the street.

When we got there we weren't greeted by a bell hop but by a door with an \"push button to open\" sign. The lobby was small, no restaurant, and no bar to catch a drink and relax. There was a bar on the 2nd or 3rd floor that was small, dull and far from anything that could be considered as fun. 2) You walk into your hotel room and large, but very dated. Instead of a modern bathroom we found a bathroom that belonged in more of a 3 star corporate hotel. This is also VERY IMPORTANT, Do NOT stay on a lower floor. We were on the 4th floor and I've never had a worse night of sleep. This hotel is right across the street from one of the most popular Irish Bars in the city. This place was loud until around 3am and not with the type of crowd you'd want to hang out with. More like the kind of crowd who would barf on your shoes. To add insult to injury our air conditioner was also not working right and sounded like a truck uping up its back gate around ever 10 minutes when it turned on. 3) This hotel was over priced.

We were not disappointed - the rooms were great with an ever so comfy bed. Our daughter slept in a travel cot in our room. We had a room that looked out over 2 sides which was nice. The sitting room was very comfortable although both my wife and I banged our heads on the low hanging chandelier over the dining table.

The downsides - a) the internet in the lobby was not free; okay that is a minor gripe but b) - you are really in the thick of it and the nosie at nights coming up from the bars and streets is really quie loud. For us it was not as off-putting as noise from neighbours (of which we did not hear any) but if you are seeking peace and quiet you may not get it on a Friday and Saturday night.

We had a beautiful view of the harbor from our bedroom and a beautiful city view from the living room! The suite was tastefully decorated and the layout was great. You MUST go to the 26th floor and spend some time at the observatory! We spent quite a bit of time admiring the view and were lucky enough to watch the sunset over Boston.

I did wish that the bathroom had more counter space for toiletries. The Custom House is a Marriott Vacation Club property whereby most of the rooms are reserved for those who own property in MVC. Other rooms (leftovers?) are able to be booked as a regular hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if the Vacation Club rooms differ from the hotel rooms. There were only 5 rooms on our floor.

Right across the street from the Aquarium stop on the T (transit system). Near all the action, many restaurants and historical sights. Wonderful hotel staff. Historic building with awesome views from the observation deck floor. There is a store right across the street where you could purchase small food items, etc. Not so good news: Check in was disappointing. We had a morning flight and arrived at the hotel at 11:00 am. Understandably, our room was not available. We were asked for our cell phone # and were told that they would call us when the room was ready. Check-in is stated to be 4:00pm. Lobby was very crowded w/ guests and we had our luggage held. We returned to the hotel at 4:00 after a hot day of sightseeing and our room was still not ready. Finally at 4:45 we were given keys to our room. Apparently Fridays are a huge turnover day with Vacation Club guests. Without room keys you can not access the elevators, so until you check in you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do much at the hotel besides sit in the lobby. Also, there is no restaurant or lounge on site. There is a Vacation Club bar (The Counting Room) which is open some hours...again need the key. To be fair, the staff did apologize for the late access to our room. A small issue, but my husband likes to make coffee in the room in the morning. The packet of coffee was never replaced so on morning #2 and #3 he had to go without. NOISE! Be warned, if you are a light sleeper. Our room faced the Black Rose bar. On Friday night I could hear raucous laughter, etc. till the wee hours of the morning, but on Sat. night it was crazy. I felt as if our bed was right in the middle of every bachelorette group and frat boy partying hardy. Cars honking, motorcycles revving up, all kinds of shouting in the streets. The bars close at 2:30 am and at about 3:00 things finally quieted down. The Custom House is right on the edge of the Quincy Market bar action. When I complained a bit at the Front Desk on Sunday morning I was assured that the streets would be much quieter on Sunday night...and they were. In sum, I would recommend the Custom House for the easy location and if you desire a suite arrangement.

This time we were there for my daughter's graduation. The location is perfect for just about anything you could want to do in Boston. The hotel is located maybe 20 steps from a T station, half a block from Faneuil Hall, a block from the water and walking distance to TD northgarden. Out of all the places we have stayed this would probably be the top 1 or 2 for location. The room size is another reason to stay here. There is a separate bedroom and living room with a sofa bed- perfect for families. There is a small convenience store across the street or for more selection for a longer stay take the T to Shaws. Now for what bothered me and a reason why I wouldn't stay here again is how noisy some of the rooms are. I expressed my concerns about being on a low floor upon arrival (the hotel is located across the street from a couple bars). We were told our room on the first floor had soundproofing. It does but that doesn't help with car horns, people yelling and music from the bars. After the first (sleepless) night I asked a couple times if there were any rooms on a higher floor. We were told there was not. I asked if we could switch to the Marriott a block away and were told we couldn't. By 1 in the morning I was ready to pack up and go to another hotel. I tried once more at the front desk and miraculously a room appeared on the 9th floor- a gorgeous, quiet room. I think the hotel should offer the lower rooms at a slightly less price than the higher rooms. For some people noise isn't an issue and yet I would have gladly paid more for that quiet 9th floor room.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome place to stay in the Hub\u201d", "Author": "BostonChik85", "ReviewID": "UR62533681", "Content": "The Marriot Custom House is a wonderful place to stay.

The Blue Line is right outside the entrance. Fanueil Hall is right there. Fanueil Hall has some fun shops and restaurants. The resort is only a short walk over to the North End (Amazing Italian Food Places + Desserts). I recommend Mike's Pastry! Their Cannolis/Ricottas Cakes are delicious. As for the resort itself, the staff is also so gracious and accomodating. I requested a (cot) for my friends. They brought one up for us no problem. They usually have cookies or drinks in the lobby for when you check in. The villas are Suite Style/1 bedrooms with a Small Mini Kitchen. I recommend a higher up room because the nightlife can get pretty rowdy. There are tons of bars and restaurants within walking distance of the Resort. This Resort is more geared towards the touring the city. They do have some programs for kids but it's not the type of place to stay in for the day. If you want to use the pool, you'll have to go across the street to the \"Marriot Long Wharf\". The best rooms are the \"L Shaped Rooms\". When you come out of the elevators, they are on the last door on your left. If you can request a room before you come, I recommend that. If you have a later flight etc, you can leave your baggage with the front desk and they'll tag/lock it up for you. You can come back anytime to come grab it.

As a life-long resident of Boston who has never stayed overnight at a hotel in my own city, I decided to change that and spend a weekend downtown, treating a long-time friend who was visiting Boston. My friend used to live in the area, & has always loved the historic Custom House Tower, so staying at this Marriott seemed perfect. It was- the building is beautifully restored, the suites are spacious, and the view from our 8th floor room facing the harbor was fantastic. Also, one of the best features is the open air observation deck on the 26th floor- I remember visiting it as a teenager, and it still has the best views of the city, which was great to have only an elevator ride away. But despite all of the great things about this historic gem, frankly the most memorable part of the visit was the staff- they truly shine! Everyone was great, and you get the distinct feeling that they are a small family that all enjoy working with each other, and extend that warmth to you, welcoming you to their home if you will. And I would like to mention two staff especially- Yvon, a really helpful staff person who helped us figure out to work the DVD late one night, and whom we ended up having a nice chat with. But if there is one person who is really BORN to her job, it is Karen Connors, the Concierge when we were there. She clearly loves her job, KNOWS her job, and makes you feel like a long lost friend about 5 minutes after meeting her...... and who also has a great sense of humor..... spend some time with her and you'll see what I mean!

I had never stayed at a Marriott vacation property before, so probably some of the good features of this stay are common, but they suited us. The hotel is located in the old Customs House, which includes an impressive rotunda and tall tower. Marriott has managed to fit the rooms in around the original features, and our one bedroom \"villa\" was set around the rotunda. As a result, we had a double height (or maybe, triple!) ceiling with the bedroom set in a loft up a proper staircase. The king size bed was very comfortably, as was the queen sofa bed in the downstairs living area which my daughter slept on. The decor generally was ok - very standard and Marriott, but all decent quality. The room has a kitchenette which was nicely equipped with a microwave, toaster, coffee maker, blender, dishes and a small fridge. There is a small convenience store across the street, so we were easily able to buy milk, cereal, etc. The living area, which was a bit on the small side, had a comfortable pull out couch, an arm chair and a round dining table with four chairs. The room had a nice entry hallway and very good closet space. The bathroom was standard but large, with nice quality bath products. The towels could have been more generous, but were fine. The room was also equipped with an iron and ironing board, as well as a laundry basket. The latter came in handy, as there is a free laundry room (three each of washers and driers) in the small but nice game room at the top of the tower. In addition to the game room, the hotel has a breakfast room/bar, a small but nicely equipped gym and a small play area for young children. There are loads of activities in the hotel, including lectures, concerts and movies, and we were provided with an impressive schedule on check in. We didn't take advantage of any of these, though. The hotel is located very centrally, next to Faneuil Hall and the Aquarium, and easily walkable to other shopping and sites. It's also near a good subway line and taxis were readily available. We found the staff friendly and helpful. Guests have pool access at the Marriott Harbor across the street, but we didn't use this either. All in all, this is a fantastic place in Boston if you're not looking for 5 star luxury. It was very clean and comfortable, and is an ideal hotel either for families travelling on holiday or for business travelers with a longer stay. I tend to be a Four Seasons type of traveller, but for this holiday, the extra room and facilities really made this a better choice, and I would stay here again without hesitation.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Superior, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Disneyland9timer", "ReviewID": "UR60637872", "Content": "It couldn't have been any better.

We do know Marriott Vacation Club International because we are members, although we had never traded our weeks with one in Boston before. We stayed only one night, before travelling to Cape Cod. We knew that the one in Boston had only one-bedroom suite (other MVCI resorts feature usually 2 bedrooms). We were given room n. 0206 on the second floor. The room was on two different level: on the upper floor there was the king size bed (really comfortable), and on the first floor there was the kitchen and the living room.

We did have the microwave oven, dishes and glasses but not the hotplates! I was upset since we were travelling with our 16-month son and I had to cook the dinner for him. Fortunately, due to jet lag, he was very sleepy so I solved the problem with a bottle of milk and he fell asleep. The following day we left the hotel.

The only issue with the hotel, as many others have mentioned, is the noise from the bar across the street during weekends and also the noice from the cars, ambulances, etc... The first night we were at the 2nd floor and could not sleep at all. Then we moved to the 15th floor and it was a toatally different experience. Complimentary internet and you can also use the swimming pool at another Marriott that is very close.

Regretfully, I forgot his name, but he was wonderful! We were told that we were upgraded to one of the four (4) \"Presidential\" suites way up top. I was pleasantly surprised. We did valet park for $38/night and never moved the car. We went to the elevator, and had to step out at the 19th floor, and get on another elevator going to the 24th floor. We walked into our suite, and holy cow! There are just no words that can describe it. When we walked out onto one of two patios, we realized that our room was located right below the clock that is at the top of the tower. As we entered, there were doors that opened to a large deck in front of us, a closet to the left, and stairs to the right that went up to the kitchen/living area. Everything you need is there. Microwave, refrigerator, coffee pot, utensils, plates, etc... Also had a small table where one could eat if they so chose to. There were another set of steps down to the bedroom and bathroom, and another much smaller deck that you could step out on and see the water. All the furnishings were very nice, the room was very clean and comfortable. There was a very small safe in the bedroom closet, which was quite handy to lock up some small items. We did not have any noise problems, or any other problems for that matter. We stayed for two nights, but I wish it would have been a week. This was a very comfortable place to stay. We almost ran into a problem, that was quickly taken care of at check out, and the staff could not apologize enough. We were double charged each night for the valet parking. It was quickly taken off our bill, with a smile. I would not hesistate to recommend a stay at the Custom House, and do plan to return in the future. It is close to the North End and Fenuil Hall. We even walked all the way back from Fenway Park, as it was only about 2 miles. Great stay, great staff...I just can't say enough good about this place! It was the best birthday ever for me!

It is so convenient to everything and located near all the great attractions. The hotel is a beautiful historic building. If you happen to be staying there on a Monday, the concierge Karen gives a wonderful tour that lasts about 90 minutes. It starts at 10am. She is very enthusiastic and passionate about Boston and the Custom House. The rooms are larger than most hotel rooms and have a living room, kitchenette, bedroom, bathroom, and area to sit and eat. Each room has a different layout. There are only 5 rooms per floor. The best part about this place is the observation deck on the 26th floor. You can see the entire city and get the best views. It is not open to the public. The \"T\" station (subway) is located directly outside the hotel. We parked the car (38 bucks a day) and never used the car again. The subways and trolleys are fairly clean and very safe. Boston has become one of my favorite cities. There is so much history and beauty here. I was very impressed with how friendly and helpful the locals were to tourists. There are employees at the T stations who can help you purchase your tickets in the machines. If you are staying for any length of time and plan on using the subway, get the 7 day pass. It is only 15 dollars and is a great deal. It gives you unlimited access to the subway, buses, and one ferry from the wharf to The Charlestown Navy Yard. I would recommend doing the ferry ride because it is nice to see the Boston skyline from the boat. Boston is also \"the most walkable city\". Since they have finished the Big Dig, this statement is so true. I would recommend walking the freedom trail which has many pubs, and historic places on it. The North End is a 10 minute walk from Custom House. Just use caution when crossing the streets. Some people do not always give pedestrians the right of way. The hotel is also steps away from Quincy Marketplace or Faneuil Hall. This can be good and bad. The good is that you are right in the middle of the action. The bad is that from Thursday-Saturday they have live bands and the noise can be heard in your hotel room from 10-1. We were staying on the 10th floor and our room wasn't even facing the marketplace. It sounded like the band was in our room. The marketplace is loaded with shopping and places to eat and drink. The food court has lobster rolls that are pretty good and reasonably priced. Boston Chowda has great soups and good lobster rolls. Go to Cheers just to drink at the bar. The food is not good. Houston's has a steakhouse here and the food rocks! If you want other restaurant info you can ask the concierge. We also ate at the cheesecake factory near the Prudential Center. The calamari was great. Another tip is not to eat at Legal Seafood. Everyone raves about the food here. We tried it one night and it was nothing special. If you like Italian Pastry then go to Mike's on Hanover Street. The pastry is out of this world. Great Cappuccino too. Giacomo's is a favorite restaurant there but the lines form early as they open at 5pm. They do not take credit cards. Most of the restaurants and places in the North End only take cash so be ready. You will have a great time in Boston and at Custom House. It is a city with a quaint feel. We kept running into the same people throughout the city in different places. Our only bad experience was Fenway Park. Check out my review of Fenway. Take the tour and skip the game if you have to see the ballpark. A local had a good tip on Fenway. Get standing room only tickets. When you read my review, you will understand why. So go check out Boston, you will love it. I can't wait to go back. Another note is that this hotel does not have a pool so if you are traveling with children this could be an issue. You are allowed to use the Marriott Long Wharf pool but you have to walk across the street for that. This was another thing I liked about the hotel. There weren't any screaming kids while we were there. I guess they chose to stay elsewhere. There also isn't a spa or a place to buy groceries on the property. There is a small game room and laundry facility on the 24th floor and a nice gym on the 25th. The Counting Room on the 2nd floor serves a continental breakfast in the morning for a fee and the bar also opens up at 5pm.

We were on the 19th floor, you could hear street noise (this is a very old building) but it was no worse than staying downtown in any major city. The view was AMAZING and you have access to the clock tower until about 11pm for an outside viewing of Boston that shouldn't be missed. Laundry facilities were available (washers/dryers for about 75 cents), game room for kids included video games and a pool table, staff was VERY helpful and polite. The location was near many many restaraunts and walking distance to convience stores for anything you forgot. Bed was comfortable and there was a TV in the bedroom and the living room. Decoration was gorgeous and the main room contained a sofa and a small table for eating. Also had a full set up of dishes, small refrigerator, coffee maker, a sink, and cabinets in the kitchenette. Make sure to see the history of the building and get the schedule of events from the front desk - every day the hotel hosts some sort of event from historic talks to tours of the building (which used to serve as the counting house for the US). We took the train everywhere or walked and never ran out of great things to do. Highly recommend that you get a Go Boston card, great deals for a cheap price if you have the time to do a few attractions a day.

We are 2 adults and 2 children. I asked for a high floor and we got it - right under the clock face. While the windows were small compared to the lower floors- there were only 2 suites on our floor as the floor plate is smaller at this level. The views stretched from a partial harbour view, North End/Charlestown, Cambridge, partial dowtown, government centre-so the views were good. Overall the suite was small in size (but this is dictated by the floor plate and has to be expected given that this is a clock tower). When the sofa bed was pulled out there was little room to move about, mainly due to too many occasional tables in the living/dining/kitchen area. I had originally requested a rollaway bed (since the girls don't like sharing) but once I saw the size of the room I had to cancel it - it just wouldn't have fitted in. Our room had a king size bed - which left little room for anything else, as this room was small as well. I am generally very fussy about matresses and I can say this one was fine - very firm. The bathroom was off a lobby between both rooms. With four people travelling there was no space for all our bathroom stuff. A shelf over the wash basin would have been good for all that stuff. The extract did not work in the bathroom so one got a foggy mirror. We are very concious about the background noise of air conditioning at night. It was quite noisy and kept switching on/off throughout the night. Another issue was the supply grilles were directly over the sofa bed - so one daughter was cold and we had to request extra blankets for the sofa bed. The observation deck was very interesting as it is external and runs around all sides of the building. Also interesting was the rotunda lobby (with domed ceiling) and upper level (which was part of the original Custom House). The lower floors were all part of the original Custom House and the tower section was an addition about a century ago. There is a laundry in part of the games room which would be very useful for those staying for a longer period or those travelling with small kids. The kitchen was stocked with washing liquid, laundry powder and coffee. There was no stove - just a microwave and a undercounter fridge. As others have mentioned the location is very handy for transportation (three lines are close by), food and shopping. We stayed over a weekend so many of the breakfast places were closed since they mainly serve the downtown office community. However there is a Starbucks just up the street on State. The staff were very helpful and friendly, expecially the guys who take care of valet/bags/doors.

The room was huge - about 650 sq feet - which I understand all the rooms are large. The main area had a queen sleeper, a dining table for 4, a counter area with mini fridg, coffee maker sink etc. Dishware in the cupboards for 4. The bedroom had a king bed with lush duvet and 14 (we counted!) pillows! small safe in closet, ample drawer areas and laundry basket. Bathroom was large in size but only a single sink and tub/shower area. This room would have comfortable held a family of four looking to stay in the downtown area and not have to book two rooms. The hotels location was the main reason for booking - as previously reported it is right across the street from the Fanueil Hall/Quincy market area (convenient for food and if shopping - not having to lug packages around all day). Also a 10-20 minute walk from most of the common historic sites (freedom trail sites, Italian area, etc.) Aquarium, splash fountains and so forth. I traveled alone with my daughter and was a little concerned about the number of bars and pubs nearby - but it was really no big deal at all - and we were there during the 4th of July celebration which included several members on shore leave from the Navy and the Marines celebrating at the pubs but it wasn't an issue for us at all. We were on the 19th floor facing the pubs - and the only real noise that bothered me was several fire trucks at a nearby apartment building - but that can't be helped - its city life. My daughter liked the chocolate chip cookies at the reception desk when we checked in and thought it was cool to have the game room - even though several things were out of order. We also spent time on the observation deck looking at the city view and for the falcons that nest on the building. Parking was expensive here ($38 a night) but I parked and didn't move the car during our stay as the Aquarium T stop was right out the front door of the hotel.

I might have moved along a little more but I didn't want to discourage her from soaking it all up. We liked the foot tour but our very knowledgeable guide the best. (Boston by Foot) Most mornings were a quick pastry and coffee at the nearby Au Bon Pain. We had an ok dinner at Joes recommended by hotel staff - I wouldn't go again but it wasn't horrible. We enjoyed dinner one evening at cafe Florentine in the North End followed by a stop at Mikes Pastry shop for Gelato for daughter and an espresso and Canoli for me. Most of our other meals were eaten in the Quincy Market which had some very good places and some places that were like eating at the food court in the local mall.

Local males are just as offensive in appearance. The rooms at the Customs House are large but with typically cheap Marriott furnishings and amenities. For example, there are no glasses in the bathroom and the shampoo/soap are decidedly downscale. Gym on 25th floor is adequate and that term just about describes the entire experience. Activities at the property are typically outsourced and do not expect to get anything useful without paying for it, e.g., no free Internet access, overpriced continental breakfast offerings, exorbitant valet parking charges, only McPaper for morning reading, and limited housekeeping service. You can, however, watch old movies and free TV in a 'special' lounge. Staff very helpful and amiable overall. Were I not able to trade for this space I would never pay what room costs at retail, upwards of 400.00 per night.

I had visited the Custom House many decades ago as this is where various Federal offices were. I was more than surprised to hear that it had been turned into a vacation property and hotel rooms. You couldn't have a better tourist address in Boston: right outside your door are the historic Faneuil Hall and markets and within a short walk plenty of restaurants, bars, etc. Even better now that the interstate highway is underground here. The Custom House offers valet parking - but I believe your car is then taken over to the Marriott on the wharf. I'm not sure what the current price for parking is but I would expect that you could buy a good meal for whatever it costs. That was about the only downside to staying there.

The separate master bedroom was lovely and the bed was comfortable, decked out with nice quality sheets and duvet. There was a microwave, mini-frig and small sink in the dining/living area and also a few dishes. The table and 4 chairs were nice, as we were so close to Quincy market that we could walk back to the hotel room in less time than it took to find a table for our family (the market was very crowded) to eat our lunch. Although the furnishings were a bit on the \"fancy\" side, they were not in brand new condition, which actually made us feel more comfortable. It's well worth a trip up to the 24th-26th floors to check out the excercise room, the game/laundry floor and the 26th floor which features information about the history of the building and an observation deck.

The only hitch with our stay was that we were originally booked into a room on the first floor. It was really beautiful, with tall, tall ceilings, marble walls and architectural features from the original building. There were only 2 rooms on the floor as there was a large open rotunda down to the lobby, sales offices for the time-share feature and the club room. The windows in our room had extra insulation to keep street noise to a minimum (we heard none while we were in the room) but unfortunately, an event had been booked for the \"public areas\" of the floor, including the club room for the evening. It was supposed to be over by 9pm, which was still a little disruptive to us (we were jet-lagged, having flown from the West Coast the night before), but by 10 pm, it was still so loud that we could not hear our rented movie without turning the sound up full blast. We had called the desk twice to inquire about the noise, but finally went down and requested a room on a higher floor. The desk clerk immediately and apologetically found us another room on the 7th floor and sent up someone to move our bags and a new rollaway. She also gave us an appropriate monetary credit for our inconvenience, without my requesting it. I was very impressed by this handling of the issue, though felt they should never have assigned us the 1st room since they had an event scheduled for the evening in areas adjacent to the room. This was apparently a disconnect between guest services and the events group which should be addressed. The room on the 7th floor was much the same as the one on the 1st floor, without the super high ceilings and marble walls. The view was better but without the insulation in the windows, it was very noisy as the bars/clubs let out between 1:30-2:30 a.m. on Saturday night/Sunday morning. The following night was very quiet. . At least 3 people working at the desk apologized to us for the inconvenience, at different times. This was much appreciated by my family and went a long way to correcting the issue and made them seem like a very professional operation. The concierge was also very helpful and sent us to a great, family friendly reasonably priced little Italian restaurant (\"Rabia's) that we would not have known about without her suggestion.

Staff unobtrusvie but room always well cleaned. Lounge on frist floor served buffet breakfast in morning but with Quincy market just across road there is no need to eat in hotel. Downside is that the Black Rose pub across the road can get quite noisy at night and it is about a 10 to 15 minutes walk to Newbury street or the italian quarter.

Offers great value in a great location, right next door to Quincy Market. Stayed here in Dec 06. Paid the standard 225$ and as we were travelling from Ireland this translated to about 32% less due the the currency at the time, so we thought it was good value. We had a loft style room on the second floor. We loved it. Pop down to Quincy for some smashing food within ten secs of the front door of the hotel. THe T is also right outside the hotel door across the street, which is a great bonus for getting around town. The free internet access was great too. We didnt use the bar or dining room in the hotel as we ate out mostly, so I cant comment on that personally, but did hear others praising it.

We booked two nights at the Customs House. Was only disappointed in the fact that the room was not as great as it could have been. Upon booking directly with the hotel, I requested a high floor, harbor view as it was my family's first trip to Boston. Called again before departure to make this request, but sadly was given a mediocre room and the only harbor view was a tiny port-hole of a window from the master bedroom. Overall, the room was not bad. There was a decent-sized bathroom between the master bedroom and sitting room (with sofa pull-out). There was a small kitchenette area and a small round dining table. The traditional decor was sort of blah. However, the location was the best. We had a rental car as we were looking at colleges. It was easy to drive in and out with good valet service. The hotel, being a landmark, was easy to find when driving in the city. Also, it was easy to get onto the freeway from the hotel. For walking around the city, the hotel was perfect. It was in a safe, upscale area of downtown near many of the major sights. I felt safe walking with my family at night for dining. I felt safe walking in the afternoon with my daughter shopping. I was pleased and would stay here again based on the wonderful location, and ease of getting to different areas in the city and out of the city.

The room: When I called I had requested a room as high up as possible, we ended up on the 6th floor. Not a big deal, but dissapointing just the same. When we first walked in, we were happy about the size of the living room area, there was a table with four chairs, a little kitchen area with a sink and lots of cabinets, dishes, coffee pot, and microwave and refridgerator. The bedroom was tiny, barely enough room to get around the bed which we thought was hard and not very comfortable. The pull out couch was awful, our two kids slept on it, but the mattress was bent and dipped down in the center. The bathroom was okay, nice size, but could use some updating, The whole room needed to be repainted as the paint was just chipped off in a lot of areas throughout, the worst part of the room was the filthy carpets, they either need to be steam cleaned or totally replaced. After walking around in our room in clean white socks (one person had grey socks on) we noticed that the bottom of our socks were black. It was pretty disgusting. For $385 a night and $365 (AAA discount) a night, we would expect a cleaner room and a better maintained room.

What no one has mentioned is the birds! After a week in Maine we needed just one night for a family of four. When I asked the Marriott Waterfront if there was an alternative to renting two seperate rooms at their hotel for my wife, me and two college aged daughters, they recommended the suites in the Custom House, 650 sq. ft. of room. And the price was right, only $315.00 a night. We could not possibly have imagined how delightful the stay would be. We occupied one of only two rooms on the 21st floor, each a suite occupying half the footprint of the building. I believe our floor was the only one that had private balconies. Not one but two overlooking Boston. But back to the birds, posted on the door of each balacony was a warning that the building was the site of a peregrine falcon nest and sure enough, we shared the 21st floor with these beautiful birds. While one daughter read on a ledge 21 floors above the bustling town, the other daughter was busily photographing the falcons in their comings and goings. At one point the obviously unfazed falcons were seen working over a crab they had caught in the harbor, all of about 30 feet away.

Boston harbour about 5 mins walk from hotel. Make sure you go to the top of the tower and see the 360 degree viewing platform - fantastic views of Boston and surrounding area. Restoration of Custom House has been carried out very well - keeping many of the original features including Counting Room and original internal dome. Make sure you ask for a higher floor room though - the hotel area is surrounded by several bars which can be noisy at closing time - and preferably a view towards Boston harbour - you can see the planes taking off and landing in the distance from Logan airport plus the boats coming in and out of the harbour.

For this reason we cancelled our stay. Having booked with the Hilton we were not told about the change, they also could not find our booking when I rang to cancel. Eventually we were told our booking had \"slipped between the Hilton and LVH booking systems.\" Under the conditions of our booking we were supposed to lose our deposit, the hotel however were good enough to refund our deposit as we had booked with the Hilton and now it was no longer a Hilton. End of story? Not quite. Having lost our original booking, they somehow duplicated the booking a month before our trip and charged my credit card a second time. They also refunded this money but they insisted I had made a second booking. I most definately did not, why would I when I had booked elsewhere? So I cannot review the hotel having not stayed there but having had the experience I did, I would never book this hotel. Also having been to Las Vegas this last week and seen the location of the hotel, it is too far off the strip and to use the monorail every day is expensive.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "MV MN", "Title": "\u201cWorst stay ever\u201d", "Author": "mgavett", "ReviewID": "UR127011369", "Content": "We stayed at the property a month before and staff was friendly and things were open and things were good. This time we stayed the room was upgraded to a suite which was smaller than we booked and was in disrepair so we opted to go back to our booked room. We found things closed all week long when the signage said open daily 7am-11pm never opened the entire 3 days we were there. The monorail closed early at 12am instead of 2am (this was not presented until you had paid for the tickets and entered to monorail) the entire week we stayed, this made us return to the room 2 hours earlier than planned every night. The staff was over heard just begging to get a different job to get out of this hotel. One hostess was even trying to land a job with a local patron right there on the spot while she was working. The bars had drink offers but were never open to honor them. The offers we did use had failed to mention they were for cheap beer or rail drinks only, so the offers were horrible. The entire stay was miserable and service was aweful. Even the gaming staff was looking like they didn't want to be there. Never once got a free cocktail while playing an hour of roulette and slots never paid out at all. This was the worst stay ever. Not to mention it looked like a ghost town. Our upgraded room, when we had trouble the clerk stated they didn't have anything else they were all booked 'NOT TRUE' the hotel was at a minimum all week and the number of people walking around showed this to be true. The only friendly help was the bellman who hailed the cab as we left the property. Think twice before staying here again. The only saving grace was the package price was pretty good and the buffet was tasty and dinner included beer & wine for $19.99. Never did see any of the other restaraunts open but we did see people in the cafe but it to was closed. No lounge acts or music and shows were high school quality. Definately not worth the price of admission. When we checked out we mentioned the issues to the desk cleark and they could care less never once asked to elaborate or if there was anything they could do to make the stay memorable just here's your receipt, thank you, goodbye. Even the gaming offer didn't work right and took a long time to get the $10 credit applied which was lost in 2 pulls of the slot machine, was definately not worth the effort or time waiting for them to figure out their own system and offer. The going green credit was nice but we were told we would get the credit each night and it never showed up after the first night. A really nice earth friendly concept but a failed execussion, oh well we did get one credit but not the other, they even argued with my wife which is never called for. The only pleasurable part of the stay was the spa/fitness & pool area, nice and relaxing, this is what you would have expected the entire stay.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cSame old, Same old\u201d", "Author": "kidsareallgrown", "ReviewID": "UR126964261", "Content": "I have stayed here almost a dozen times over the last 15 years.

We found dirty socks under the bed when we checked in, but all in all the room was clean. The mattress, sheets and towels are not the quality of what you would expect in a 3 or 4 star hotel.

We have frequented this hotel in the past when it was a Hilton Property. In fact when making reservations for this trip in late 2011 the hotel was still owned by Hilton. Sadly, as of January 2012, the property had been sold (I was told to an Atlantic City investment company.) Although a few Hilton branded items remain in inventory (laundry bags, pens, etc.) Hilton standards are long gone. We stayed here for a five day convention in mid March 2012. Several problems were encountered and reported, none of which were corrected or even addressed. We paid the \"conference rate\" which was about twice the rack rate or \"special\" rate available at the time (but included a few conference registration items.) Value was probably about half of what we paid. The first indication that there was trouble ahead was that there was absolutely no one in line at the check in desk. The experience was pretty much on a straight downward trajectory after that. Compared to the well kept properties just a few blocks away on the strip, this hotel is definitely third tier and fading fast. I expect it will be razed and replaced within a few years. The trip was salvaged from \"one star\" status only by the extremely helpful front desk agent encountered on the last day of the stay. She was very apologetic and courteous, gave us a modest food credit, and sent a bottle of $9 champagne to the room for our inconvenience. However, in a prophectic quote she said \"...some of us think we would be better off if this place just imploded.\" My sentiments exactly. For the cost, almost any place on the strip will be a better value for your money. I can't recommend this hotel any longer. And now for the specifics: Pros: 1) Due to declining attendance, the casinos and public spaces are less crowded. Subsequently, there is less smoke choking the public areas. Parking garage was also quite uncrowded. 2) The rooms are adequately sized and clean, if not well maintained. Definitely better than some of the sleazy hotels just off the strip. 3) Some decent eating establishments inside the hotel. The TJ Steakhouse was very good and the prices while high were not exorbitant. Food quality was very good and service was excellent. 4) Staff is friendly. 5) A nice \"green\" program whereby you receive a $10 food credit for each day you keep your linenes and decline to have your room cleaned. (Not offered on day of arrival or departure.) Cons: 1) Room air conditioning didn't work (I understand this was the case with most of the rooms in the central tower.) I reported this twice by telephone to maintenance and four times in person at the front desk. It was never fixed. In fact, on the last day I was told that there was no recpord of the problem ever having been reported. We were offered to upgrade to a room in another tower with working air conditioning at a cost of $20 ($40 if wqe wanted the \"resort\" upgrade.) When I protested that upgrading to a room with working air conditioning at no cost was not an unreasonable request, I received an ambivalent response of \"sorry\". 2) No hot water one night. None. Not even lukewarm. 3) Shabby maintenance throughout. Elevator call buttons missing, worn and dirty carpeting (I counted 14 pieces of dirty, flattened chewing gum on the carpet just between our room and the ice maker), rusted metal on the tub, leaking faucets in the lavatory and tub, dirty windows. 4) Very noisy elevators. For some inexplicable reason, we could hear every up and down trip of the elevators even though our room was located about six rooms away. I pity the poor occupants who were closer to them. 5) Location - many visitors will not like the location which is a couple of blocks off the strip (and they are long blocks.) 6) Security was not very good. We were panhandled in the elevator immediately upon arrival by a very shady looking character who was just hanging around the elevator lobby.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smithfield, Utah", "Title": "\u201cConference experience\u201d", "Author": "Brian S", "ReviewID": "UR126459959", "Content": "Stayed several times at the Hilton and now the LVH.

Was fortunate enough to book a room at TheLVH (formerly the Las Vegas Hilton). EVERYTHING was fantastic from check in to check out. The front desk service was cheerful and efficient, the restaurants provided a wide range of options at great prices and EXCELLENT taste (I personally enjoyed Casa Nicola's Picatta Di Vitello and the Tiramisu). Rooms were spacious, well appointed and very clean. The pillowtop mattresses provide for a very comfortable night's sleep. Large windows afforded a wonderful view of the Strip, especially at night with the glow of lights. The gaming area was large, well laid out and the staff was courteous and helpful. The table minimums were best in town, yet there were pleanty of options for playing higher stakes if so desired. The Sportsbook Room was a dream come true for true sports fanatics, especially with March Madness games. The multiude of horse and harness races from across the country on VERY large screens was 1st rate. The Sportsbook's comfortable and plentiful leather chairs, friendly wait staff made this area a big hit and I made frequent visits. Shows at The LVH were enjoyable, with spacious seating and reasonable ticket prices. The Rat Pack show certainly was entertaining and harkened back to the early days of Vegas. What also made the LVH a good and affordable location was the Monorail Station right at the hotel. This was a wonderful way to get to and from The Strip within a few minutes and a few dollars. Saving the best for last is the level of customer service. I did not feel as if I was lost in the shuffle, but was genuinely treated very personably by everyone at the hotel, from the coffee barista at the Fortuna Coffee and Wine Experience to the dealers, Pit Bosses (Monty was a great guy) and front door staff.

The room we stayed in was very modern and large with an impressive marble bathroom and a view of the strip. Exactly what we wanted out of our Vegas accommodation! This hotel is off strip but well connected via the monorail and has a lot of free parking. We never used the monorail as I thought it was expensive for what it was - if you have the use of a car during your Vegas stay and don't drink, my advise would be to just use the free 'self park' parking that all the big hotels have. We didn't eat at the hotel as there are too many other choices in Vegas, but I understand their Japanese Teppanaki place- Benihana- is pretty good ( especially with a 20-30% discount that you can get from one of the discount voucher places near Fashion Show Mall).

I know you aren't in Vegas to go on the internet but for the occasionally convenience, like booking your onward travel, 1hr or so of free internet for guests would be ideal. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, for the right price, but wouldn't pay over about 60 bucks a night whilst it is in its transition period but it definitely is a cut above the likes of Circus Circus and other budget hotels on the Strip.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrington, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRun down convention hotel\u201d", "Author": "Yellotail", "ReviewID": "UR125961913", "Content": "We just got home from 5 days at the LVH, Now.....just simply the Las Vegas Hotel, rather than the Hilton.

I'd never been to Las Vegas, so I was pretty impressed by the long driveway, the glitzy chandeliers and the expansive lobby floor. The staff was polite, which helped make up for my long, long hike to the outer reaches of the north tower to get to my room. At least there were shops to peek at along the way. The room was fairly high end, which justified the price, and I had a good view of some of the nearby casino/hotel signs. (It's off the strip, next to the convention center.) The problem was this: A few things were off with the room. Some PR material had been knocked onto the floor and not picked up; there was an empty grocery bag left behind in a bathroom drawer and there was a USED washcloth drying on the shower rod. Yuck. What else had the maids not cleaned that I wouldn't know about? That said, there was a variety of stores, bars, restaurants and gambling options in the hotel. Since it's not on the strip, you can't walk around much. You could, theoretically, strap on sneakers and cut across the Riviera property to get to the strip. But you probably picked LVH to be by the convention center. You'll walk about 3/4 of a mile to get to the furthest conventions (and it's not a scenic walk). But you won't have to cab it. I like conservation as much as the next guy, but it seemed strange that the hotel is using all of the old Hilton materials. The Hilton H was still on the hotel, and virtually everything in the rooms -- from the keys to the menus -- still said Hilton. I guess it's good to not throw those things away, but I did wonder about other ways they were cutting corners to save money. Because I like conservation, I opt to skip maid service when I can. I don't mind not having new towels or a freshly made bed each night since it saves water. It also saves the hotel money, and LVH will reward you with a $10 coupon for any \"food or beverage outlet\" in the hotel when you \"go green\" this way.

Another reason is that you don't have to go through the casino to get to your room like many other hotels. This is especially nice if you have kids. Check in was easy and fast. The room is your standard hotel size - if you stayed in premium room they have the new pillow top bed that is very comfortable. And the bathroom is a little nicer. As like many Vegas hotel, their rooms are in different stage of 'renovation'. We've stayed at standard room and it's also fine.

When we arrived I was sort of let down. Showing up in a limo and no one to help us with our bag's no biggie, must of been a really busy Tuesday night around 9:30. When we arrived we checked in. My room was supposed to be 600 square feet and non smoking. When I got to my room it was only around 400 square feet ( i'm an engineer I measured) there were also 2 ashtrays and my room reeked of smoking....Obviously a non smoking room. Complained and they told my boss they would bring the new room key to his suite as we went out to eat. When we came back I got my new room and it was 100x better (non smoking and about 600 square feet). A bump to floor 26 from floor 4. Gross alert but I have to say this as this may turn some people off to the hotel. That made me happy but when we were in the elevator going down to the lobby a middle aged obvious lady of the night was getting dressed (next to the elevator) and she spit bodily fluid (obviously from a man) into the black sand ash tray near the elevator door then proceeded to spill her money all over the place.....made the elevator ride very awkward....but the place is vegas....just would be nice to keep some of the riff raff out. So now I have the fun stuff out of the way heres the pro's and con's. Pro's Most bartenders make killer drinks, though some had no knowledge of simple drinks. How ever I thought that if you were gambling drinks were free, some drink girls would charge x amount for a drink some would not. Not sure what that is all about. I slept well every night. The room service made the room very well. Good Staff Good dry cleaning prices Monorail Station Good distance to Convention Center. Very professional and cool dealers. Actually taught me how to better my odds at roulette! Thanks to them I left vegas with more money than I Flew in with!!!! Who ever reads this give Tommy the Doorman a raise or bonus! he is the man and suggest several great local eateries to me! I left somewhat satisfied. Con's Lots and lots and lots of little kids running around the property ( I remember being a teen in Vegas and If I walked in the Casino Security would ask me where my parents were and what not.....not this place though I did not see any kids gambling) Seems a little bit dated on the inside. Breakfast buffet was miserable and over priced. Restaurants had weird hours. They were never opened when we were around. They would always say....go to the pizza hut. I can get pizza hut anyplace I don't want to eat that crap. My boss's suite had lots of mold in both of his bathrooms. My boss's hotel floor reeked of Vomit and Jack Daniels for 3 days. Very Uncomfortable toliet paper. Actually went out and bought my own it was that bad. I am 5 foot 11 and the shower head in my room came up to my chest. I have a really bad back and it pained me to bend over in the shower to wash from chest up......I'm not a dwarf LVH...... Pool closed way to early. I understand about an early swim if your there for pleasure but I was there to work.....coming back from the show nightly to see that the pool was closed was depressing. The thing that got me was they kept telling everyone its not the Hilton anymore ( I understand that) but everything still says Hilton. In the rooms the poker chips ect ect. Room service, some of the food items were insanely over priced ( Ritz Carlton would be comparative) but then again some things were very cheap, regardless everything I ate was tasty. Finally the huge sign out front. Does not light up any more :( I remember being a kid and seeing it light up and I would of loved to have seen it do that again. Not sure if its down for good, none of the staff I asked could answer that for me. All this being said with some work and money this place could be as good as a on strip hotel. Though it is a bit dated on the inside it is still not a terrible place. Next time I do a show I might even consider staying at this hotel again since it is just that close to the convention center and regardless of it's off strip location being able to take the monorail down town is easy, though the monorail 3 day pass's and taxi fare get expensive. Also I am not going to lie. When you go to the Wynn, Bellagio, Palazzo, MGM, ect ect for dinner and what not and you go back to the LVH its almost a sense of depression that you get. Especially when some nicer rooms in other hotels on the strip could be had for cheaper.

The suite was designed so that you could lock out the bedroom from the entertainment area, and had two separate doors to each part of the suite. The door connecting the entertainment area to the bedroom could be locked closed or it could be opened. This could be ideal for business travelers, particularly women, who want to keep entertainment guests from getting an idea that the bedroom is nearby and available. The setup also works for spouses who are here to play or rest while the other works in the entertaining area or families who want to sleep separately from their children (who are sleeping on rollaway bed in the living room). The suite was very spacious, approximately 800 square feet. The huge entertainment area was divided into a living room and a dining room. The lighting was recessed and bright with two additional standing lamps. The celings had crown moldings and a marble finish floor that gave the entire room an elegant and high end feel. The entertainment area was configured around both a large cocktail table and an armoire with a large flat screen tv. Great for watching sports events with colleagues. There was a central seating area for entertaining up to 8 guests and a cocktail table and plush cushioned chairs. The floor was marble. There was an elegant wood dining room table with seating for eight in the dining area of the suite. The drapes were floor to ceiling and controlled by four automatic buttons which worked perfectly. There was a bathroom with a shower in the entertaining area. You could not ask for more in a business entertainment space. On the other side of the entertainment space by a separate entrance (although connectable with the opening of two doors) is the bedroom space. There was a desk with ethernet modem, a huge, plush king bed with high thread count linens. The bed was terrific, and it made sleeping a pleasure. The mattress was plush but supportive. The bedcovers were of a high end luxury quality. There was a tv in a wall unit and a large bathroom, with marble heart shaped Roman bathtub with jacuzzi jets that would be great for a couples bath. Room service was prompt and professional, and when we had a problem with the handle to the Roman tub coming off, engineering was prompt, professional, courteous and fixed the problem. We were entitled to VIP checkin at the lounge, and there was no waiting because of that. The other services of the lounge were not impressive. There was morning coffee and cookies, but only prepackaged creamers, not milk. There were mixed nuts from a bowl and not much else. As a VIP lounge, it was pathetic. There were small bottles of bottled water in the refrigerator. We still had our expensive morning lattes from Fortuna's which serves Starbucks coffees in the lobby near the elevator. The monorail to the strip is clean and convenient, but at $5.00 each way per person, you are better off if you are more that two taking a taxi which are available all over Las Vegas in front of hotels. There is a green rebate if you forgo housekeeping, but that made no sense economically if you are in a large suite (for the environment is another matter). We ate our meals on the strip in the Mesa Grill (excellent at Caesar's) and the Carnegie deli at the Mirage (I recommend the corned beef and pastrami combo named after Woody Allen--avoid the turkey which was dry and unexceptional) The gym and spa had a number of ellipticals and treadmills as well as some weight machines and a bench with dumbbells. There were also a steam room and sauna, clean locker room with showers and spa services. There were oranges, apples, bananas, coffee, tea water and plenty of clean fresh high quality towels available. The spa would have been great except for the $20 per person charge per day! Until the end of April, they are waiving the gym fee for Hilton honors members. I don't know about after that. That struck me as a high usage fee. Lastly, for families with children, or people who are disgusted by the being offered cards with photos of nude young women available for flesh services, the LVH casino, being away from the strip is a bit of a refuge from all that, and other than the casino, a quiet space. In summary, the LVH is not the glitter and party atmosphere of the hotels on the strip, but for the customer who is more in Las Vegas for business or has a family in tow, with the room upgrade, LVH can be a great fit.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cOff the Strip = Peace and Quiet When You Want It\u201d", "Author": "PFD-Canada", "ReviewID": "UR124613653", "Content": "We have stayed here every time we go to Vegas on our own.

My view was of the nearby Las Vegas Country Club golf course. I'm guessing I would not have liked the regular room, and further guessing that the negative TripAdvisor reviews and some pictures are of the regular rooms. The hotel has gone green, and they offer you a $10 resort voucher every night you decline housekeeping service. All you have to do is press the green button on the room phone before 1A, and they'll leave the voucher under your door the next day. Since I traveled alone this trip, I had plenty of towels to use for my 4 nights, and I only messed up one bed. So I was willing to get $10 a night (not valid your first or last day) to take 3 minutes to make my own bed and straighten my room each morning before I went out for the day. They actually left me more towels one morning anyway. Not sure if this was a mistake or if you can \"go Green\" and still order more towels.

Another couple we were with also stayed in the hotel. Upon check-in the front desk staff was very nice and very helpful. I have to say, based on the old look, feel and smell of the property and casino, I was pleasantly surprised by our room. We did have an option to pay an additional $12 for a room upgrade, which we did - to a Grand room in the North Tower. We were on the 7th floor and had a view of a small pond behind the property. The room was very well kept and newly renovated. It smelled clean, the water pressure was great and it had everything you needed - hair dryer, soap, shampoo, plenty of towels etc. The casino however was very very smokey and smelled old, but it's an older casino, so what do you expect? It is a bit of a walk to the center strip, but if the weather is nice then it is a nice walk. It is one of the stops on the monorail line so you can always catch that if you don't want to walk. If I was coming to Vegas for the first time, or even for a return trip, I most likely wouldn't stay here. It is pretty far from all the action and it is an older property with not too much entertainment... but for someone staying for a convention or meeting, it is perfect. It's quiet and out of the way, it has plenty of places to eat (Bennihana is my favorite!!) and the rooms were decent. However, our friends paid for a \"strip view\" room and said that they really got a monorail view room... so they confirmed that it was not worth it. I guess if their room was on a higher floor it would have been better - so if you do book a strip view room... make sure you are on one of the top floors. They also said our room was much bigger than theirs and a lot nicer... so if you don't care too much about the view (though, ours wasn't bad at all) then stick with a grand room.

A roll-in shower was requested and when we arrived at the room discovered that the bathroom had a tub.....back to the desk to inform them and get reassigned. New room had the right kind of shower but the shower curtain was 8 inches too long and would get trapped in the wheels of the scooter. Cell phone photo and back to the desk to advise of this new hazard, along with education for the staff on how this would be a liability.......maintenance arrived minutes later to trim the curtain to floor length. First shower.....in their wisdom, they have installed a curved rod over a straight line shower. With a poor floor design and drain, water was all over the bathroom in no time. Informed staff, and the lady on the desk never lifter her eyes from the keyboard in front of her but was able to say \"we are sorry to hear that\" in her most insincere and uncaring voice. Room number 2, was about 100degrees F when we entered with the temp control not functioning. Phoned desk - said they would send someone from maintenance up. Waited at least 30 minutes (remember, hotel is pretty much empty) and called again. Was told that the issue had been added to the list for maintenance and I asked what they would do in the meantime. Finally had to go again to the desk and demand to be moved to a different room. This room, still near my friend's room was fine, until the suite at the end of the hall decided to have a Latin music festival starting at 3 a.m. My young daughter woke me up (I wear ear plugs!) and I couldn't believe the noise. Had to phone hotel security and they did respond in good time to remedy the situation. Day two, the key stopped working on Room 2 when we returned at 11:00 p.m. I phoned the desk from the hotel phone located in the hall of our floor. When I explained the situation, the guy said that our key to room 166X did not work because there was no one staying in that room. They had not bothered to update our room situation. They said they would send someone up so we could move back to our original room....what a bunch of clowns. I said \"I am not moving! We need to get into the room. The guy said to come down to the desk (we are on the 16th floor, East Tower, about a mile away from the desk). I then said, \"that will not be happening - this is your mistake - you need to send someone up with the keys\". I would not stay here again.

So we decided to drop-off the luggage at their baggage hold room and look for a sit-down restaurant here at the Hilton for a meal. We were disappointed to find all of the Hilton's main restaurants are open only for dinner and their \"coffee-shop\" style restaurant was closed from 3:00 to 5:00 pm. The buffet was too much for us to eat, so we had to settle for one of their fast-food restaurants. We picked-up our room keys at 4:30 pm and went to that room only to find litter (paper) scattered about the floor and food items on the table, and the bed linen disturbed - it appeared that someone came in the room after it was cleaned. So we went back to the check-in counter to tell them about this problem and we received keys to another room. No apology was given by the clerk at the front desk - only appeared suprised about the situation. When we went to the second room and opened the door, we found several pieces of luggage and shoes on the floor for another group, but luckily no one was in at that time. So we went back to the front desk again to tell them about this problem - again no apologies was given. On the third try, however, we did get a good clean room. So front-desk service at the Hilton Las Vegas does not rate very high for this situation. We did find the hotel room clean and fresh, nicely appointed, comfortable bed and clean bathroom.

I got one internet access free and the VIP Lounge access (after I asked) and free breakfast for two even though we had a child with us. We had to pay at the buffet for the child. Now comes the bad stuff.....in the room next to us they started playing rap music in the afternoon so loud it shook the room, the bass sound was so loud. Then they started smoking and we had a connecting room so it came under the door. even though I have no-smoking room on my profile it was ignored. I called Security and they came up and asked them to turn the music off. About 6 hours later at 10:30 PM they turned the music on again. My husband called Security and they came up and told them to turn it off. No more music after that. The tub was hard to turn the water on, from then on out the tub leaked and was noisy. When I checked out they asked how I enjoyed my stay. I told them about the problems and they said that's too bad!. I loved this hotel back in April, 2011 when I visited due to the perks but I don't know if I would stay here again, especially since it won't be a Hilton,", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201ca little off the strip but its perfect!!\u201d", "Author": "may0529", "ReviewID": "UR122006137", "Content": "I love staying here when I want Vegas but without the craziness of the strip.

Comparing this stay to my last stay, I can honestly say that these hotel rooms are a bit run down. As soon as I took my first steps into the room, I stepped on a loose tile and it \"popped\" up, causing me to stumble. The shower dripped, and required herculean strength to turn the handle to stop the dripping. The cold water faucet handle was also extremely stiff. The motorized window shades have been removed, not all the bulbs were working, and the radio/clock was broken. Of all this, the only thing that was truly serious was the loose tile. Actually, there were loose tiles all over the entry and into the bathroom. However, the one at the entrance actually \"pops up\" when you step on the corner of the tile. I informed the day manager of these issue and she said that they will be resolved before I get back after tonight's show (10pm). I returned to my room at 1am. When I walked in, that tile \"popped up\" again and I almost fell on my face. It caused a scratch on one of my leather dress shoe. The next day (checkout) I spoke with another manager, and they were very apologetic. I would never ask for compensation. I leave it to the business to determine if they feel that it may be appropriate to compensate me for my loss, my ruined stay, or anything. I feel that it is a testament to their willingness to show true Customer Service. However, after all that I've been through, they never offered to reduce or refund any portion of my room cost (which was $300), replace my shoes ($200), or even offer me a complementary meal.

Ate in the hotel about 50% of the time at either at the buffet or Paradise Cafe. Food was fine in the Paradise Cafe and staff were very good BUT over a few nights I noticed some people waited more time than they should have to receive their orders. One night a party of 6 left before ordering they got fedup waiting. Buffet still had plenty of selection BUT at least 1 night the hot food was not hot, only luke warm. It was better the next night. And now onto the public areas . Clean BUT glasses left outside rooms for 2 days, Glass with spilt drink left in the lift for 12 hours , it was eventually moved. Stairs not cleaned for 2 or 3 days If the rate was cheap enough we might stay there again but only for 2 or 3 days. It has lost the 'crisp' quality it once had.

My room has always been clean, updated, with a comfortable bed and pretty decent bath. I'm sure there are rooms that will give you the view of the strip from right off one block, here on government business I get the non-strip view; and that's okay. The back view is a view of the beautiful French (aka Sunrise) mountain. It was here at the Hilton I discovered how beautiful the view of the mountains are around this town. When I have to stay here, I beg for a mountain view and I keep the drapes open so I can get a view of the cloud, smog, sunlight, around the mountain from sunset to sunrise each day. Back to the Hilton, again the rooms are nice, not huge but they've definitely done them over. I've used the spa services at the Hilton and I have to say the staff of masseuses are very skilled; I'm sorry to find out that Luther retired but the other staff do a great job. The whirlpool area is basic; nothing fancy like the Mandalay or other hotels I've stayed at, but the tubs function like they are supposed to. The spa staff are always nice and pleasant, the gym is small but functional. I've also used their salon services, the esthetician on staff did a great job in taking care of my needs when I needed. I've eaten at the restaurants there, the Hilton does a good job of making sure there are good places to dine, no complaints. Also when I was there for vacation, they offered me a club access package for @ $40 a day. I took advantage of it, with small variety of breakfast food, but most important a selection of beer, wine (including a sparking wine) in the early evening, I figured I'd spend that and more each day especially with the cost of booze. I learned about this from the front desk staff who checked me in; I appreciate that they are pleasant and tell you about offers the hotel has during your stay.

It was her and my first time to Vegas and we were all on a budget. Although we knew the Hilton wasn't going to be like the hotels on the strip, we weren't too bothered b/c we knew we wouldn't be in the room or even at the hotel much. We actually picked it b/c the monorail to the strip has a stop there. The room was average. Clean for the most part. No fridge, no microwave, none of that, even though it purports to be for business travelers. The casino and bars were also average. Again, we were on a budget and so weren't expecting it to be a VIP type getaway. But here is my problem with the Hilton- you pay $15 for wifi A DAY and $20 A DAY to use the fitness center. Why are they still charging for wifi? I can go to the La Quinta here in Little Rock and get free wifi at a room rate of $50 a night. So I expect it for free from any hotel in a place like Vegas. You can't tell me the hotel isn't making enough money to cover this. I'm also a huge workout junkie and find it necessary after indulging in places like Vegas to get at least one good sweat in. The rate to use the fitness center (and I use that term loosely) was $20 a day. You could get a \"deal\" on two days for $36. I decided one workout would be acceptable for the 3 day trip, paid my $20 and entered a room that was literally no larger than the room my friends and I were staying in. It was packed full of average equipment so there was barely room to move around. Add to it the 12 people that were in there already and you have a hot, cramped space where no one is having a good workout. WTF Hilton? I have to call BS on your fee and your description of this room as a \"fitness center\". So, if you want a workout and are a guest at the Hilton, I say skip the hotel, take a run outside or find a local gym that you can use for the day at a similar or cheaper rate. Like one poster has stated, know what to expect when you go there and you probably won't be disappointed. It is a good rate for the room and access to the monorail, but that is about it.

After a long 5 hour drive I arrived to find out that my \"requested\" 2 double bed non smoking was no longer available. After correcting my reservation it was quickly found out that they no longer had any non-smoking rooms, because they had over booked the weekend. I was offered an \"upgraded\" smoking room. I inquired if the upgrade was complimentary, and was told no they couldn't do that.It was then vaguely explained that due to the weekend there would be a hold on the charges on my boyfriends card. Had no idea what they meant, but said ok. We arrived in the new room that smelled like an ashtray with two small double beds. My boyfriend is 6'6, and a little double doesn't really work. Called the front desk that found us a queen smoking room in just a few seconds. Room still smelled bad, but we were ready to start the weekend. My BF checked his bank account, and found he was charged double the amount for the night of the room. Confused we inquired at the front desk. Turns out if you use a debit/credit they hit your card with a $50 a night charge for any misc. room charges, but will reverse those charges once you check out. The explanation \"Yeah it's stupid, but the hotel doesn't want to get ripped off\". As people traveling with a moderate budget this caused us a lot of stress. Housekeeping NEVER cleaned our room. On check out we were informed we had a balance. Obviously confused I asked for an explanation, and was met with a very curt response. I wrote them a letter of complaint with no response as of yet. They really need to learn how to communicate to the clients. I suppose the weird explanation that the charges would be held for the weekend was their way of telling us about the $50 hold, but that wasn't good enough. I picked them due to what seemed like reasonable rates, but now realize they have hidden fees. I left feeling stressed out, uncomfortable, and smelled like I smoked 20 packs of cigarettes. Next time I will spend the extra money at another hotel to have a higher level of customer service. I feel like they took advantage of a stressful situation.

Both times, we had nice rooms that were clean, had good bathrooms, very comfortable bed, and good amenities. Is it the fanciest hotel i've ever stayed in? No. But i must disagree with other reviewers who didn't like it. (I am also a Hilton HHonors member and have stayed in Hiltons of all types on my travels.) The hotel is also running a promo that if you stay Thurs-Sat, you get Sun night free. I thought that was a pretty good deal. Check-in was fast and courteous. The breakfast buffet had a very good selection of typical breakfast foods like pancakes & french toast, as well as different kinds of sausage (regular & turkey), corned beef hash, requisite bacon, etc. It also had lots of fresh fruit, a complete salad bar, and many hot items. You could definitely have brunch with the variety. On weekends, brunch includes mimosas. We love the fact that the hotel is NOT on the strip; the metro (monorail) stops at the hotel, so you can get to the strip within five minutes but you don't have to deal with the partiers when you're ready to relax (this was definitely a bonus on NYE, but helped even on a non-holiday weekend). The monorail is in need of reupholstering, but it's a fast, good public transit for a reasonable price (get a two- or three-day pass if you stay at the Hilton). We did not eat at any of the fancy restaurants; just at the buffet and the sports/booking area sub shoppe. And had cookies from the coffee shop in the lobby - those are yummy.

Room: The rooms are decent, with good beds, but are certainly not as good as the newer hotels in LV. New flatscreen tv, nice work area. The bathroom was cramped, certainly would not want to try and share. The prices used to be almost $200 night for the rooms but last couple years have been under $100 which is an ok value. Facilitates: Like many hotels in LV you pay extra for just about everything from wifi access to exercise room access. I just don't use most as on a tight budget for travel. Food: There are a good selection of restaurants, but half the time i eat outside of the hotel being Vegas or I will grab a quick snack. The snack/coffee bar near the front desk is decent, but often a lineup and not a lot of seats. Location: The location is off the strip and a long way (by walking) from the main strip. However it is next door to the main convention centre so if you are attending a convention there it's convenient. Also the monorail is at the hotel, which does make getting to the strip somewhat easier. Like everything in LV, expect to do a lot of walking though!

I'll think twice next year. The main reason I choose this hotel was because of how close it was to the convention center and the mono rail was right outside the door. These were the two BEST features of this hotel. The check in was ok, be prepared to wait in a LONG line. I just couldn't understand why they have such a long font desk area and only 2 or 3 people working the desk at any one time. I had booked a King room and was told that they had no king rooms so they bumped me up to a Jr. Suite type of room. Same thing happened last year, so I was ok with, that is until I got to the room. After a LONG trek through the hotel I finally got to my room. It was at the end of the hall and it looked like it was designed to be part of a Double room set up, the other half of the room was across the hallway and there were a set of double door that could be closed to block it off from everyone else. The bed was a Murphy bed. Not bad, but not very comfortable. The room had a nice bar area and a pretty comfortable couch (more comfortable then the bed). The TV didn't work. Took three trips by maintenance to get it working. Even then, the remote didn't work the TV unless you were right in front of it. The shower leaked so bad that the carpet got soaked, I mean there was standing water on the carpet. The food was not that good. The buffet by the booking area was horrible. I've had better at Golden Corral. One afternoon, I wanted to take lunch up to my room without ordering room service. That was not a possibility. The food was WAY too expensive. So was the WiFi. $9.95 a day?? I had to have it for my work, so I forked it over. In a hotel like this, it should be free. Most other hotels of a lower class have free WiFi. Don't think about using the business center to print out anything, $2 per page for a black and white copy of my boarding pass. Print it out at the airport and save your self some money. Get to the airport early when you leave, the security lines are AWFUL!!!!! I don't know why they are so bad in Vegas, Atlanta is a much bigger airport and the security lines move twice as fast. The Casio area was old and out dated. I think it is the smallest of the major hotels in Vegas. The area where the Star Trek Experience used to be is still there and still decorated with a space theme. It's been gone for 3+ years, don't you think they would do something with the area, it looks like no one cares any more. That is the whole feel of the hotel, no one cares anymore and I think I know why. Found out that Hilton has sold the property to another company and the Hilton name will stay until the end of the year. Don't know much about the new owners but I hope they put some love and attention to the place. It has a great location in relation to the strip that you can walk there if you want, but far enough away where you don't get the noise and light. I know the economy is bad there, but there needs to be some work done to the area around the Hilton, just a bunch of empty parking lots. Pay a bit more and stay on the strip, better hotels, better food and better staff. At least they get the new owners in place and they make some changes. BIG TIP: If you take a taxi from the airport, tell the driver to take Paradise. It will save you some serious money.

Before I begin, the hotel looked a bit run down but we only stepped inside the lobby, casino & lifts so I can't comment on the hotel room etc, only the chapel. We went to see the chapel after seeing the lovely gazebo pictures online, what got me was that you were given the cd of all the pictures taken, copyright released, which most places charge for. The girl was friendly & explained everything and it wasn't really expensive. Although you have to get married at night because behind the gazebo there is a wire fence and tatty looking scaffolding up! The girl told us the limo would pick us up out front at 6:30 & the wedding would be at 7. It was a good job there was just the two of us and our little girl because the limo driver didn't turn up and eventually found him at the wrong entrance at 7! I was stressed out of my mind, hot and flustered after running back and forth through the hotel looking for him!! We arrived late but everyone was really nice, the minister was exceptional! He really made it special. The photographer was helpful and we were in and out in 15 mins, which was nice as we didn't have any family or friends but we felt a bit rushed. We told the girl when booking that we were going back home 4 days after the ceremony so she said she would try and sort out that we had our pics to take home. We rang on Monday and we were rudely told that we didn't get any pictures with our package! This infuriated us as we knew we did, so we spent the next few hours waiting in the hotel room for a call back, which never came until a few hours later! Turns out we do get pictures but the email which contains the link to the pictures where we can choose didn't come through, we picked the cd up on tuesday and were told the link had been sent, although I knew we were being lied to and of course the email was still not there! The 'helpful' lady who booked it for us didn't say a word to us when we picked the cd up or even made eye contact with us, which was rude and awkward! Considering it is supposed to be the most important day of our lives it was ruined by the chasing and disagreements over the pictures and basic aftercare through customer service! The reason we chose to get married in Vegas is so it was easy and straight forward, although at the la bella chapel at the Hilton it certainly was not!", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lomita, California", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad stay at the Hilton\u201d", "Author": "BMRosenberger", "ReviewID": "UR119664333", "Content": "Stayed here again for the Indy car championship race Oct 2011, because of the players card offer that the hotel was having. Keith checked us in, and he was the best! Got us a nice room as requested, all with a smile and a helpful attitude! He really made the stay complete. In fact every employee we interacted at the hotel was friendly and professional. My only complaint was that the wine bar was (again) not functioning properly. We like to have a nice glass of wine, while watching the crowd go by, but just like last time the machine was not working. A small issue, didn't mar the trip like the events at the racetrack did, but it was disappointing. We pointed it out to the woman behind the counter who said it was our card, but when we pointed out that it worked on the white wine machine - she said she would get someone to look at it. It never got fixed, so we were stuck drinking just white wine. Oh, that and my players card did not work in the machines - I gambled a bit and I was too lazy to go get another card, so shame on me, but it was annoying that I have to get a new card every time I stay at their hotel. Once again, we went to the buffet as we got two free with the room deal, and were satisfied with the food. Not the greatest ever, but decent enough. They need to work on the deserts though - they look wonderful but I thought they were fairly tasteless. The bread pudding was pretty decent though! They are also still offering a $10 voucher for skipping room service - got another buffet out of the deal which really was nice. My recommendation, don't go in expecting too much and you will be pleasantly surprised! It is an older hotel, so if you want newer, hip style hotels stay at city center.

Others do this as well. I do not recommend this hotel. Front desk \"manager\" known as \"Junior\" is the most unprofessional, rude and ignorant person Ive had to deal with personally or professionally. I was actually stunned by his ignorant attitude. Some employess are true gems, others the bottom of the barrel. Junior Salvator is an example of the latter and im sure has cost this place dearly. I have had friends and groups in town and have sent them elsewhere due to this ...person Granted its a faded glory BUT that solely due to Colony capitol the owners who had a unique licensing agreement with Hilton, which finally, they lost effective Jan 3 2012. Colony walked away from Resorts in Atlantic City and The AC Hilton, now the ACH, lost its franchise immediately and according to teh AC press hasnt paid taxes since 2009. This seems to be the way this company operates: Buy a property run it to the ground until teh bank takes over and declare bankruptcy. The rooms are old. Even the fantasy suites on the 29th floor feature ( drum roll) A VCR!! I miss the 80's but REALLY?? Rugs look like they just removed the police tape from the crime scene, dirty musty and old. bathrooms are surprisingly clean however. The halls are long , floors uneven and dark. SIGNAGE IS HORRIBLE you will never find you way without a guide. Spa is OLD SCHOOL which, if you like that, youll enjoy the experience. Gym is in the spa. There are separate male and femalespa areas. Great attendants and the manager \"Carol\" is a gem. Food: its bad but at least its expensive....... LVH is NOT a food destination. benihana is the best outlet but even that is very uneven. check in is amazingly slow- so slow its almost like a seinfeld skit, typing for minutes and minutes etc. Other properties are so fast. Bedding and towels are old. very old and surely the cheapest they could rent. Amenities are hilton standard however that will change in 2012. beds are cheap. Few furnishings in the room TV: Tired old box tvs and some rooms have plasmas BUT only a handful of channels and no HD which most properties have. Complains and problems fall on deaf ears. Its the only Hilton affiliated property that does not respond to emails when all you are trying to do is resolve an issue, which then in itself becomes and issue. Vip lounge has its gems... This access is given to Diamond members instead of the lounge floor upgrade or access as required under Hilton Hhonors program ( they have the resorts club level-named to avoid policy compliance, not worth the price) Parking is easy. Fast to get from car to room usually. Avoid sportsbook parking on sunday of course Sportsbook is giant and loud. Table games frequently have high minimums. Slots run from 1980 models to newer games. Players Card program went from bad to worse. Low payback and comp especially since the other properties have upgraded their programs. Many people have the same complaints over a long period which clearly shows the lack of ACTION from the property. Ive seen the innocous responses to some complaints posted here, but that \"lip service\" to alieviate the effect of the honest reviews.

But there is only average and very good to choose from. It's above average, but probably not quite \"very good\". My husband and I stayed at Hilton twice over the last few years. The first time we stayed there because there was a conference at the Riviera that my husband was attending and the Hilton is close by. We got a great deal on an airline/hotel package. I believe it was under 600 dollars for both of us with airfare and a room for three nights. The second time we stayed for free. We got player cards and gambled a fair amount in their casino. We get offers all the time from them in the mail. We got another offer for 4 free nights, free show tickets and some free dining and we are going back next month. I guess to be fair, it's easier to give it a better review when we didn't spend anything on the room and got other free perks. Again, you do have to get a players card and gamble. We have stayed at many other casinos/hotels in Vegas ranging from Golden Nugget, Caesars, Terribles and the Palazzo. We do have a pretty good point of reference. Location: It is off the strip, but it is on the monorail. It's great because you walk right out of the casino and onto the monorail. Very convenient. I agree with some other reviews that it's easy access at Hilton, but getting to your next destination - the monorail station isn't always that close. Getting off at MGM Grand is kind of a hassle because MGM is huge and you have to walk through that place quite a ways to get out and over to NYNY or wherever you were wanting to go from that stop. Rooms: Rooms are good. They are huge and clean and just fine in my opinion. No - there is not a coffee maker. Why does everyone keep complaining about this? I haven't stayed at a place yet where they have those in the roooms. Hello - they want you to go to the casino floor level people! Maid servie seemed fine and I don't remember anything wrong with the room. Is it as fancy as a remodeled room at Caesars or a suite at the Palazzo? No, but there's nothing wrong with the rooms. Not the newest - but not anything to complain about. Dining: There are a ton of places to eat at here, which is good since it is kind of off by itself. We ate at Benihana, the Italian Restaturant and the buffett. Buffett - pretty standard. Benihana was good and the Italian place was fine. Even without a deal, I believe they always give you coupons at checkin for discounts off their restaturants. No - they don't have the celebrity chef restaturants there, but they also don't charge their prices either. I LOVE Delmonica - but I don't always feel like spending $200 dollars a night on food. Bars: We usually take advantage of the free drinks while we gamble, but we did go in Tres Rios - Vince Neil's bar. Margaritas were good and it had a fun atmosphere. I do remember the waitstaff being adequate, but acting a bit bored... BUT, we had fairly quick service. Pool: I really liked the pool. It was clean, big and not overcrowed. Enough said. Checkin: I think we've had a line both times we checked in, but it moved fairly fast. The desk clerk was always nice and polite. Casino: The casino seemed pretty big. Not as big as the huge hotels on the strip, but bigger than a downtown casino. It also is in the middle as far as slots. Again more selection than the smaller casinos - but it won't have every new machine like the newer, larger casinos will have. It will have a nice selection of old and new machines. Wait service is pretty good. We have found some \"dead spots\" on the floor before, but once you get a waitress and tip her well, she'll keep coming back. Sometimes we've even had them come back with more drinks without asking. Can't beat that! (yes I realize they are wanting you to sit and gamble longer, but we didn't mind) I guess we never stayed at Hilton during it's \"prime years\" when it was shiny and new, but we probably wouldn't pay the prices for a shiny new hotel to stay off the strip either. It's going to feel a bit older, not as much flash as some others, but it's solidly in the upper middle class of hotels in Vegas.

He also stated that our reserved room type (king bed, non-smoking, golf course view) would be available after 3pm following day.

I then asked for some kind of comp given the fact that the hotel didn't honor our reservation the first night. He then provided two complimentary buffet meal tickets.

This definitely was NOT the case. I was traveling with my husband and another couple. The Hilton is on the older side; it's showing it's age, mostly in the signage in the front of the hotel. The signs for the parking can be very confusing. However, everything else, for the most part, was fine. Check in was smooth; we were traveling with another, and the check in staff tried to accommodate our rooms on the same floor-there was no king available for them, so they opted for a different floor; however I appreciate the time they took to try and help us. The room was very nice!! We had a premier room, with a king bed on a non-smoking floor. Very clean and very spacious. No COFFEE IN ROOM. That's a disappoint for everyone who wants coffee in your room. No free Wifi either..anywhere in the hotel as far as I could tell. It's $13.99 a day. NO thanks. There is a starbucks and a mcdonalds down the road if you need free wifi. The Iron in our room was in a sad state; I probably could have asked for a replacement, but for 2 days, it served it's purpose. The breakfast buffet was fine. I had my coffee at the Fortuna coffee and wine place in the lobby. Pricey but my friends had their coffee from the pizza hut/Seattle's coffee which was much cheaper, and close to the parking garage exit. The Star Trek area is super dated..I was almost embarrassed for the decor. It just sticks out like a sore thumb and is just, WEIRD. The casino was very quiet and though I had no luck I enjoyed that they had a non smoking section. The monorail is right at the hotel..which is a nice option- a cab ride to the strip, near the Venetian (we went to catch a show) ran us about $11. Not bad. All in all, if I had to stay off the Strip, this is an ok option. Quiet and suited my needs and was budget friendly. I don't know what the pool area is like, since we went on a rather chilly weekend and didn't even bother to look at the facilities.

This trip was for my wife's birthday. There was a group that my wife likes playing at Harrah's, but with the a huge concert in town they, and all the other strip hotels, raised their prices for the weekend. The Hilton's prices were very reasonable and we had the convenience of the LV Monorail. We checked in and were upgraded to a suite (reservation was made for a regular room with the option of an upgrade if available) on the 24th floor. It was not one of their \"SUPER\" suites but it was nice having the extra room. So it was a room with a connecting lounge. We decided to take advantage of it and ordered room service. The food arrived quickly and was very good. After we ate we took the monorail over to Harrah's and walked from there over to the Venetian to see the Phantom (Fantastic!!!). I was concerned about the walking distance because of my wife in her heels. It wasn't too bad. It took us less than an hour from our to the will call at Phantom. I thought that was pretty good considering the walk across the Hilton, Harrahs, and the Venetian. After Phantom we walked back over to Toby Keith's at Harrahs for Marshal Reign and stayed until after 1 AM. We hopped back on the Monorail and safely arrived back at the Hilton. The next morning we had breakfast, at our usual, the cafe. We always have a very good breakfast here and after a late night it is nice that they bring a caraf of coffee to your table.

They have a Pizza Hut Express, which is pretty good, but one day they had some conference there and the line was like a 30 minute wait....

Billed as the world's largest Hilton, it is a massive hotel. It is also an old hotel, very old by Vegas standards. As a Hilton Diamond member, I booked a king bed deluxe room with a strip view. On check-in, the clerk told me I had been \"upgraded\". Upon reaching my room, it was a king bed on a non-smoking floor as requested, but the hallway smelled of smoke and there were ashtrays next to the elevators. Also, my \"upgrade\" was apparently from the strip view I wanted and paid for to a mountain view of the smog which always hangs over this city. Hallways were nasty with carpeting I'd be afraid to touch with anything but my shoes. My room was hardly better with furnishings I doubt Salvation Army would accept. The ac barely worked and had to be left on full the entire stay. The bed was crushed on one side and linens old and cheap. Towels were threadbare and scratchy.

When we got to the room again, the decor was old and out of date. After I had a shower, the water kept running, and no matter how hard you turned the handle, the water would not stop.

Three night stay in a North Tower Superior King Room overlooking the strip on the 12th floor Vegas is one of those places you need to visit at least once in your lifetime, and my first visit certainly did not disappoint thanks to the LV Hilton. My travel agent originally had recommended me the Luxor or Stratosphere, however I was not too keen on staying on the strip because of the noise nor did I want to stay that far out of the action - as a HHonors member, I asked about the LV Hilton and got a good rate here so I booked it up. The entrance hall is grand, and check-in was a breeze - I arrived at about 2.15pm, did the \"$20 front desk tip\" (which worked like a charm, originally I had booked a Standard Central Tower room, very glad I got upgraded as the North Tower rooms are renovated and lovely compared to Central Tower) and went to my room straight away. Room very well proportioned, coming from the UK where space really is a premium - the bed was HUGE and very comfortable, TV again absolutely huge (although the controls did take a while to get used to) and air conditioning worked wonders - so much so that I had to turn it off for periods of the day in order not to freeze! Housekeeping did an excellent job of keeping the room clean. Overlooking the humungous Hilton sign and the strip in the distance was brilliant at night, definitely recommend specifically asking for one of these rooms. The Buffet at the LV Hilton was good, although not spectacular - some of the food was not warm enough, but the range served was more than adequate - champagne in the morning and complimentary wine and beers in the evenings was a good addition (where else but Vegas could you drink three glasses of champagne before 8am?!) I spent two afternoons at the pool during their 2for1 Happy Hours (4pm until 7pm) and thoroughly enjoyed the time spent there - drinks service attentive with the DJ playing a good amount of commercial dance music. I only would have wished the pool was busier though, as it did not have the \"party\" atmosphere one would expect when going to a \"pool party\". Casino well ventilated, as a smoker I do not have problems with people smoking but the air always smelt fresh. During the day, the drinks service at tables and slots was not as attentive as it could be, but the evenings made up for this. Table dealers are nothing to look at, but I did not mind as I was there to play the game and not oggle at some scantily-clad supermodel dealers. Very large variety of on site shopping, the Pizza Hut onsite was quick and cheap, and the food quality was good. I did not try Benihana's and now regret not doing so! Location wise - I felt safe in the area, and it is well served by buses and the Monorail - easy to get to the strip and back in no time at all, and no need to use a taxi! Overall, a brilliant first visit to Vegas - sad to hear as of January the LV Hilton will no longer be part of the Hilton Worldwide brand, so I will not be able to collect HHonors points for stays - this does not mean I would not consider booking here again. 100% Recommended.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOverall Fantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JoC92", "ReviewID": "UR118313366", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton for 2 nights whilst in Vegas before going to the Luxor.

It was certainly adequate for what I needed. I was able to take the Monorail to where I needed to go and the Monorail is conveniently located at one end of the Casino. I have been to Vegas before and stayed at the 4-Seasons, Venetian and the Bellagio. This hotel does not compare but neither do the prices. I think I got a very good deal for the money, but the hotel is off the strip, out of the way, Casino and pool need upgrades etc. But what do you expect for the price. If price is of concern, then consider this hotel. But if you are going for the first time or want something more luxurious, there are many other hotels on the strip.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marietta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and Comfortable!\u201d", "Author": "Time2CheckIn", "ReviewID": "UR117969132", "Content": "This was the first time I've been to Las Vegas and not stayed in a hotel on the Strip.

It\u2019s an older hotel that shows its age in some respects while the rooms have been nicely updated. The rates are much less than a higher-end locale like the Encore, Venetian, or Bellagio while still offering nice accommodations. An Elvis statue greets you upon arrival; the front desk staff was courteous and fairly speedy upon our arrival. (Elvis performed here for several years in the early 1970's). Our room was a standard king and had the traditional appointments: a mini-fridge, nice-sized HD TV, safe, ironing board with iron, and a hair dryer in the bathroom. The 18th floor view was fabulous, overlooking downtown on the left with the rugged Nevada mountains on the right. The room was clean and the bed/pillows were VERY comfortable. You can indulge in pay entertainment via a wireless keyboard control interfaced to the TV, or by the traditional remote. The safe cost $3 a day and the bottled water in the room was $4. I found this annoying but it's SOP in Vegas (and most hotels) these days. Service was speedy: our room only had two pillows, so we called for a couple more and they arrived within five minutes. However, there should have been two extra in the closet so shame-shame on that point. The casino is less raucous than some of the newer spots such as the Wynn which we also visited on this trip. The Elvis feel wind throughout through the period appointments used. The gaming staff was friendly and the table limits were about $5 less for blackjack or craps compared to newer strip locales. Overall it was a pleasant if not overly thrilling gambling experience. The average patron is in their 40s, with younger players a minority but still significant portion of the casino crowd. One disappointment: The Las Vegas Hilton does not have a poker room, so card players need to seek satisfaction elsewhere. There's a pastry bistro on the ground floor with very friendly staff and pretty good coffee, croissants, cake and such if you have a sweet tooth or just a hankering. You'll find the customary gift shop and of course room service is available as well. We did not partake of the available buffet. The facility shows age in the casino appointments. The chandeliers and ceiling d\u00e9cor need a serious cleaning as they are yellow with nicotine and dust. The carpets could use a good cleaning as well, but the place was not dirty per se, and I didn\u2019t see any trash about. The wait staff was quick to pick up used drinks and offer you fresh ones even on the quarter slots. The hallways from the reception area to the elevators are also quite dated; in all the LV Hilton is a hodge-podge of various d\u00e9cor styles with a classy old Vegas feel when you walk in and a \u201cplease remodel me\u201d suggestion on the way to your room. The location of the LV Hilton is a bit inconvenient. You will need a taxi to visit downtown or other places on the strip like the Mirage, Bellagio or Venetian. The Las Vegas monorail stops at the LV Hilton so this helps reduce the inconvenience, although the monorail is not cheap. A 3-day pass costs about thirty bucks a piece.

We had rooms at a different hotel and it was crappy so we booked here instead thinking it'd be decent it's a Hilton they've been in the business for awhile. We checked in a little late around 9 pm or so, so check in went smooth the staff was friendly the place smelled beautiful they had fresh night blooming jasmine in beautiful vases at the counter. That was the best part of the whole experience. We went upstairs to our room and walked in I'm sure the couple making love were much more horrified then we were, we at least had our clothes on. Seems they forgot to note the room was taken. Should have remembered why we stopped booking rooms through Hilton This happened to us before on a trip to San Francisco where we walked into a room occupied by two dogs that were none to friendly. So we go downstairs and were apologized to, given an upgrade and sent on our way to yet another occupied room people clothes were strewn about and towels luckily it looked like they were out for the evening so this time at least no yelling. We were given free buffets and an upgrade to a lanai suite and another apology. We were informed we couldn't talk to the hotel manager because he was in a meeting but they'd be sure to let him know about it. So this room was unoccupied and would be pretty if not for the stain on the carpet and the cigarette burn next to the bed. The bed was big and comfy the view of the golf course was lovely though they neglected to clean the ash tray on the patio. The bathroom was spacious but unfortunately there was rotting wood on the walls near the bottom though that is do to I'm sure to the large walk in showers with rain style overhead shower heads real nice place to shower I admit. The countertop in the bathroom was water streaked and dusty but my husband cleaned it with water because by this time we were fed up. The beautiful plasma TV in the parlor was broken so we were only able to use the standard one in the bedroom for us not a big deal but for someone who has booked and paid the asking price for this room yeah it's going to be a problem and if you're only staying a few days be warned it takes at least two to get someone to look at the TV according to the gentleman who came to see if he could help us out. Housekeeping will open the door without knocking here just to let you know even if you leave a do not disturb sign on the door so with all the miscommunication about rooms which by the way according to the front desk is housekeeping's fault I suggest you double bolt I got to see how the couple we walked in out felt the next morning do to this fun quirk. I think Hilton might want to invest in getting housekeeping proper training. After being walked in on, my husband was not in the best of moods so this time he wanted to speak to the manager. Kevin O Brian was the gentleman he spoke to and I have to say though none of last nights problems had been mentioned to him he was very apologetic seemed sincerely to be embarrassed about the situation comped our internet I do feel he was sincere but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I have no real intention of staying on any Hilton property which is a shame I love Vegas and tend to only gamble at the hotel I book my room in and do most of my shopping on property as these getaways are my me time. I didn't gamble or leave the room much at all! What if the person they gave key's to my room wasn't as honest as we were I bring my laptop and jewelry with me as many people do plus I was going to a wedding in Arkansas after this particular get away so I had a lot of valuables on me at the time. I almost didn't go to the show I'd purchased tickets for but Mr O Brian put a not e in the computer that no one was to touch the room unless me or my husband personally invited them in.

We booked the Grand rooms (as like in San Francisco, we got a good deal on the rate here too so we upgraded ourselves from the money we saved to these Grand rooms). We arrived at approx 11 am and we wanted to leave our luggage (as we did not expect the rooms to be ready yet). The luggage desk told us we needed to check in first due to security. We queued up and when we got to the front of the queue they told me I had to go to the VIP lounge (still unsure if this was because I booked the grand rooms or what but they definitely did not do me a favour!), where we were met by 3 incredibly unapproachable ladies. The first thing one said after we said we wanted to check in was that check in was not until 3 pm. When we explained that we only needed to check in to ensure we could leave our luggage there was simply a silence for like 10 / 15 seconds before one of them went: Oh well, come here then! After all was arranged and we left our luggage we went to explore the hotel's pool area and casino. At approx 1 pm I decided to go and check if the rooms were ready and to my surprise 1 of the rooms was. We got the keys and were told we were in the North Tower. All the way at the end of the corridor, on the right. (approx 5 / 10 minute walk from reception) We got to the room and the key card didn't work so we had to go all the way back down again. With 2 new cards made I ventured back up again and while I am standing in front of the room the doors of the Scenic elevator opened and a lady with EXACTLY the same room number had a working key while we again did NOT! Naturally I was not happy and the lady in the VIP desk just laughed at me which really got me wound up! I asked her if I could go back to being a normal customer and use the normal front desk as those people there seemed a lot more capable then the VIP specialists! She just laughed nervously and found me another room which when we got there was not cleaned! So I went back and demanded to speak to the manager who I was told was not available. I demanded a solution and for someone from the VIP desk to come to the new room(s) with me which again was refused due to staffing issues. We finally had 1 room (JUHUU) but how disappointing. Yes the room was big but it was just so empty, it had a strong smell of smoke in it even though it was a non-smoking room. at 4 pm I went downstairs to pick up the keys for the second room and was told that I had to wait another hour as housekeeping went for lunch (AT 4 PM!!!!) I demanded a room and then was offered a standard room instead. I accepted and told them there and then that I would be checking out the next day (out of a 5 night stay), as I simply had had enough of the whole situation!!! Back in the room, someone was knocking the door so we opened it and to our surprise another couple was given OUR room and problem was that they insisted we'd leave... In the end I had to push the guy out of my room and shut the door is his face! But this really simply should not be happening! Then the safety deposit box... EXACTLY the same safe as they have in San Francisco so I knew how to operate it. However the only difference was you had to call a number to activate it. At NO POINT did it mention I was to be charged USD 3.00 per day! Honestly shocking, FOR A SAFE??? Boarding pass printing, USD 1.50 per sheet! This hotel is just a joke and take you for all they possibly can. There is no excuse about them not having resort fees! Again, San Francisco had exactly the same facilities as the Las Vegas property so I could call San Francisco a resort as well, and they don't charge extra for basic services! Overall, avoid this hotel by all cost! My travel agent got me an amazing deal for the remaining nights at the Venetian, on the condition I was to not ask for a refund for my unused nights at the Hilton, as they said that hotel was a pain to deal with and it would take weeks before anyone from the hotel would have written back.

I call the LV hilton two days (08/03) following, inquiring as to when my deposit would be returned and was informed it can take from 10 days - 2 weeks. Again, understandable. I wait 16 days from my cancellation date and still my deposit hasn't been returned. Slightly irritated. I call again to inquire as to when I should expect my refund. As a side note, the card I originally booked the hotel with was lost and was cancelled the weekend I was supposed to stay at the LV hilton. I explain to the woman on the phone that the card was lost, but that my reservation had been cancelled prior to that. Afterward the call goes similar, but not verbatim, to this : Woman: I can't look up your reservation without the card used on the account. Me: That card has been cancelled and is no longer in my possesion Woman: Well as I said, I can't look up the reservation or cancellation without that card number. Me : I have my confirmation for both the reservation and cancellation, can you look it up with that? Woman: No, as I already told you, I need the card number. (To myself : what the hell is the purpose of a confirmation number then?!) Me : Alright, so I'm going to lose my deposit? Woman: No, that's not what I said at all, what I'm saying is, why don't you try and call your bank and ask for the card number, and then I'll be able to help you. Me: Awesome, thank you! In all honesty this employee's tone of voice was extremely rude through the entire conversation. My apologies for not knowing I could get ahold of the deactivated card number. After calling my financial institution and jumping through fiery hoops, I obtain the card number, smooth sailing right? Wrong. I call the LV Hilton back and speak to another individual (who might I add was extremely helpful and personable) by the name of Sheryl. I tell her the situation, she looks up my reservation, then tells me that my reservation was never cancelled. I tell her that I have a confirmation email stating that it was, and she then asks me to forward that email to her address. Ok, not a problem. After all of this runaround I'm told that my refund for my deposit will start to be processed, but may take 2 weeks to be returned. Again, more waiting. I completely empathize with clerical and accounting errors, but with the rude customer service as a cherry on top...I won't consider booking with this hotel ever again! Word to the wise, it'll have been over a month before my deposit for that weekend is returned to me.

We booked two rooms - which were upgraded upon arrival to a larger suite with sunken living area. The hotel is at the north end of the strip (behind the old Sahara Hotel). The rooms were clean and the service was top notch. If you have a car then this is the best hotel to stay at. Its only 5-10 minute drive to the center of the strip (Bellagio). If you don't have a car you can always hop on the monorail (in front of the hotel). As someone who has been to many 4 and 5 star hotels worldwide, I enjoyed my stay at the LV Hilton. It's not as glitsy and luxurious as Bellagio and Venetian. But then again are you going to Vegas to sit in your hotel room? This hotel is still far better than MGM Grand, Flamingo, Mirage, Treasure Island, Luxor, and many others on the strip. We got a great price with buffet breakfast and many other freebies. The buffets (both breakfast and lunch) were excellent. While the hotel is not as new as some of the hotels on the strip, it has history. Elvis used to live at this hotel back in the 1960s and 70s while in Vegas. The pool area was decent - wish it was a bit larger. The casino did not smell like smoke when we were there. Some of the reviews on this page arenot accurate and aim to discredit the hotel. The hotel is great for people with families who do not want drunk people roaming the hotel. The security at the hotel was tight. I hope that Hilton does not end their contract with this property as it has lots of potential.

If you are a HHonors member and book via another site other than Hilton, you will not get points from Hilton but will be able to use your HHonors number to use the gym/spa. If you are Gold member and above, your breakfast buffet is comped. Other than that, unless you are a Platinum HHonors guest, you won't receive anything else for your loyalty to Hilton. NOTE - reception did not tell us about the breakfast comp, male representative who checked us in was not exactly rude but definitely needs a course in providing great customer service. (The older hotels little off the main strip need to do that part of a guest's stay better than any other hotel if they want to keep guests coming back in spite of the little inconvenience of not being main-strip located. This guy failed.) We stopped at the HHonors portion of the front desk later next day to find out we could use the spa and get our breakfast comp'd since we are Gold members. Would have been nicer if the first representative when we checked in had been that helpful. While this Hilton is near the strip, VERY close to the convention center, very close to the golf course, and close to the Stratosphere, it's still about a 15-20 min walk to the Fashion Mall near TI. The casino is not crowded, there is no poker room (big drawback these days), and the restaurants/buffet are not crowded. Our room was ok, especially for the price booked via Vegas.com, it was really nothing special. Not sure when the renovation took place but the feel of the hotel is dated. Interior rooms/hallways may have been renovated but the exterior is very 70-80'ish. I will say one great thing about our room was the fantastic bedding. Seriously, I haven't slept that well in a long time, not even at home. Very few cable TV choices. Buffet decor is really tired and seems to have no discernible theme/color scheme. It's a mis-mash of furniture, wall decorations and colors. We didn't eat there other than breakfast and it was pretty good. There are many offerings, the fruit was really good. Stay away from the biscuits, hard, tasteless and definitely not made in the kitchen there. Maybe they are ok if you cover them in gravy? Otherwise, it's a typical Las Vegas breakfast buffet. There is a business center and you are charged by the MINUTE if you don't buy a day pass. It's open 24 hours a day, staffed during normal business hours and you can get mail, send mail, etc when it's staffed. Hotel advertises wireless but it's something like $19 a day - SERIOUSLY - why would anyone pay that when you can go down the street to the Starbucks, taking your money elsewhere for coffee and getting free WIFI. Again, if we hadn't booked via Vegas.com, as Gold members we would have had free internet.

Our room was large and offered plenty of seating and room! The carpets were dirty. My son instantly found beads on the floor from a previous guest and no not hidden in a corner behind the bed but right when we walked on the carpet. The tile was so dirty I took a cloth to it to clean it so we didn't slip (possible sunscreen, I honestly don't know what it was) but the white towel was black after I cleaned the floor. The sheets had stains and a pillow also had stains on one of the beds. The shower and bathroom smelled of mold or something and the walls looked like their was something growing on them near the floor. The same was found in another bathroom as well on a different floor by people we met at the pool. The pool area was beautiful with plenty of chairs and even shade areas. The pool itself however was FILTHY! Giant hair balls floating around, various other things floating in it, and they allow their guests to smoke in the pool so there are ashes in the pool as well. Very disappointing. Yes it was crowded but we have never had giant hair balls attaching themselves to us as we swam in other crowded pools. These were clearly things that had been growing in the pool for quite some time. Also watch your money with the gals that come around offering you drinks. They don't bring change! This happened twice!! Save your tip money and walk to the bar. No one should have to pay $5 for an iced-tea. This was simply not a hotel that lives up to the Hilton standard. We are not the type of people to complain but we wanted to hopefully save some people their money. There are other Hiltons in the area and maybe they are awesome. This one does offer the monorail system on site which was fantastic but not worth all the other nasty things. Save your money and stay on the strip at that Hilton or somewhere else.

We've actually stayed here for the 4th of July for the past 4 years. The hotel I read was losing it's Hilton status as of January 2012, so I thought I would out a review in before it changes. The rooms have been remodeled and are very nice--the beds are quite comfortable with higher end mattresses. This visit we stayed in their 'strip view' room, which is an upgraded room. The strip is about 1 mile from the hotel, so you can see the other hotels far away. With the upgraded room there's a refridgerator and upgraded bath ammenities. We were going to stay in the Resort level rooms, but that doesn't include free Wi-Fi anymore, which caused us to change our room. Wi-Fi is $15/day. Location--it's not really on the strip, but the monorail station is right off of the front entrance so you can get to the strip easily. Be prepare to walk when you get to the other casinos if you're travelling on the monorail--all the stations are at the back of the resorts. Sometimes it's about a block or more to get to the front. Casino--some of the slots machines have changed and there seems to be less machines than before. Probably due to the economy. With the closing of the Star Trek experience, that part of the casino has changed into a lounge with multiple couches and chairs. There's a stage area of entertainment on the weekends Buffet--it was truly a disappointment. Luckily, it was free--I would have been very mad if I had to pay $19 for such poor quality. We've eaten here many times before and it was never this bad. This was suppose to be their special 4th of July menu. The prime rib was not 'prime'--it was so tough. I also got the spare ribs--way over cooked, some parts were even burnt. All the grilled meats were overcooked--the lamb chops were tougher than pork chops. No cooked vegetables other than the peppers that were grilled and a medley of carrots, broccoli, cauliflower that appeared to be from a frozen bag. No containers for cocktail sauce, so you were stuck putting it on your plate--which is not the best thing to do when eating oysters. The crab legs were salty and of poor quality. There were small mozzarella balls in a bowl by themselves with olive oil and balsamic vinegar--was that suppose to be a capresse salad? If it was, someone forgot to tell the staff to put tomatoes and basil in it. The free wine--the red selection was a burgundy!! Who drinks burgundy anymore?? Wasn't that from the 70's?? It would've been acceptable if it was good, but then again it came from the tap and tasted like it came from a cheap box.

The casino is small in comparison to other mega resort casinos in Las Vegas. The room I stayed in was good sized and had been recently remodeled and was a non smoking room. The room was far from perfect. It had a big burn hole in the center of the carpet,looks like someone dropped there crack pipe. The room itself smelled funky,like the hotel was trying to cover up the smoke smell. The caulking around the tub was completely cracking and the shower was odd shaped for putting the soap/shampoo in. I ate at the Paradise Cafe and got a good waiter the first time and a waitress with a big chip on her shoulder the second time. When playing in the casino,the dealers were also a hit or miss. Some were outright rude,one actually asked me to hurry it up because it was just after midnight and he couldn't shut down his table until I quit playing. All in all,it's not up to par with anything on the strip and probably not as good as the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street.

Checking in on a Friday afternoon during the summer is a challenge and the line was excruciatingly long but once I made it to the front desk, check in was a breeze. The staff is very warm, welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. If you need to know something about Vegas, just ask. They are going to help you out! After check in, I went straight to the counter to ask about shows & restaurants. Once again, I wasn't disappointed. We were able to get tickets to the 2 shows we wanted to see and were given directions as to when & where we needed to be to pick these tickets up. Our room was on the 21st floor and was very nice! Our view was overlooking the city and at night, it was so pretty. Ate dinner @ Casa Nicola and were pleasantly surprised at the stellar service. No waiting for the table (we didn't make reservations) and were served our drinks and our dinner with very little wait time. Good food and great portions... couldn't eat it all! I've had better Italian food, but this was very good. The line for the coffee shop the next morning was long but moved quickly and we were able to sit and enjoy a quick breakfast before we started our day. We managed to hit the pool one afternoon and were pleased with it, also. Pretty crowded and lots of kids but the pool is clean and cool and staffed with lifeguards to keep an eye on things. The monorail being right outside the hotel was the main reason I chose this hotel. Didn't want to be driving around Vegas if we didn't have to and in the heat, we didn't want to walk too far. I must say, we met the nicest people in Vegas who seemed to make it their job to see we had a good time. I had read all the articles about being careful, etc. and did notice the folks standing around handing out brochures for the adult entertainment. All you have to do is smile and refuse and they will leave you alone. On our last night in Vegas, we needed to grab a quick bite and get to our last show so we chose to eat @ Tres Rios Cantina - good food and a very good margarita! All in all, our room was nice & clean, our bed was perfect, the food was very good but the people who operate this hotel make this a place we fully intend to visit again!!!

I stayed in the Hilton back in 2009 and remember a smell of mold when I went to my hotel room. I wasn't expecting much this time around, and was very surprised at the North Tower room that I was in. I had a strip view, the room was very clean, there was no odor. The room had a giant bathtub, larger than normal bottles of shampoo, massaging soap (very unique), the bed was very comfortable. The A/C unit had the room chilly, although the unit was old and didn't have a temperature gauge, so I had no clue what I was setting the room to. There was a 37 inch flat screen TV, lots of pillows, and no real issues with the room. I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for a Vegas Vacation, the food is pricey compared to other 3-4 star hotels, you are off the strip, the pool is tiny (yet deep - unique in Vegas), the casino is dark and lacking in weekday action, like everywhere else you're paying for EVERYTHING (water bottles, wifi, etc.) but there is no resort fee. I would however recommend the hotel to someone who is going to the Convention Center, as you have a short monorail ride (or walk) to the place.

There is a large granite work desk area running the length of the window overlooking the pool below and the mountains beyond. That made for a nice diversion while working on the laptop. However, the work chair was of poor quality and needs upgrading. There is also a basic chair and ottoman for reading. The King size bed was comfortable with two adjoining end tables. There was a 32 inch flat screen on top of a very nicely sized chest of drawers. The bathroom was clean but also very dated. There were 12 inch tiles on the floor with decorative tiles lining the entire run of the walls, floor to ceiling. There was a combination bathtub and shower unit that was absolutely nothing special. There were a few tiles in need of some chalking. There was a good sized closet with plenty of hangers for clothes, something of a rarity these days. I have never understood why hotels never have enough hangers for their guests. One thing that is goofy is there are no ice machines in the Central Tower. There are ice machines at the ends of every floor in the East and North Towers, not that it does any good if you\u2019re staying in the Central Tower. Be prepared for a hike when you want ice. Something else that was goofy there were signs on the main level that said guests were not allowed to bring in any alcohol from outside of the hotel. Yeah, right Hilton. That one is going to fly. Especially when your \u201cclientele\u201d are rolling their coolers stuffed full of Coronas right down the hallways past your rent a cop security. The nightly rate was $125.00 at the convention rate which is acceptable for the room and facilities at the Las Vegas Hilton. After all, this is Las Vegas where all rooms seem ridiculously priced. However, I would say $125.00 a night is pushing it for the facilities and amenities offered. You can tack onto that wireless Internet for $13.99 per day; complimentary for Hilton Honors Diamond & Gold members. Personally I find that rate to be extortionary, especially considering there are zero free hot spots in any of the common areas. Las Vegas Hilton: Pass. Seriously, Pass.

I went back to room 109 and called front desk asking where our key was.

They said they would immediately send someone up to let us in room 101. We waited another 20 minutes and I finally went down to the front desk. There was a long line of people waiting to check in. I went to the front of the line and asked for a key to our room and explained what had happened. There was no apology given nor did he seem concerned. I asked to speak to a manager and I was asked to step to the side while they went in the backroom to get a manager. I waited 12 minutes and no one showed up to speak with me. I was very disgusted and left the desk and went back upstairs to our room. I really wanted to just LEAVE this hotel and checkout and find someplace else to stay. I contacted a friend at MGM who said she would help us out. Over all we were at the hotel for over an hour and a half prior to getting into our room. I have not stayed at this location before and will NOT be staying here again. I am thoroughly disgusted with Hilton\u2019s lack of apology and lack of concern for their guests. The last day we were there, we did not receive maid service for whatever reason. We received it both days prior. They never changed the sheets the entire time we were there either.

A simple sandwhich was around $20 and chicken wings were around the same price for 6! We ate at the buffet at 10 am and it was good. Everything seemed to be fresh. We also ate at the caf\u00e9 restaurant in the hotel. This was mediocre at best. Overpriced and the food was only ok, nothing special. Pool was small and overcrowded.

Also 100% privacy. (2) Liked the easy access to the Monorail but think more than 2-3 ticket booths for tickets would be necessary when large groups who speak no English, and there with kids take too long to get their tickets. I missed two Monorails while 8 people were joined by 20 more from their party who got in front of me. This occured at the second machine I moved to also but here only 9 cut in front of me and each one did their own ticket.. Very frustrating when trying to make a show at Harrahs. (3) Think that the offerings in their Resorts lounge could use some variety. Every day, the same sliced gorgeous fruit, cheese cubes and crackers, pretzels, carrots and celery stix, coffee machine with choices or cold drinks in their cooler and red and white wine afternoons. Always the same 3 kinds of cookies, and never one hot thing. . Not sure if it was worth the extra money. Should offer trays to help carry a cup of coffee to ones room along with a plate of snacks if traveling alone since you cannot open their door or press the elevator buttons or slide your card in your door slot without spilling it all (or bending down to put down what is being carried and then bending down again to pick it all up!) (4) BE AWARE that if you use the boarding pass machines at the end of the long counter of \"front desk\" that the privacy statement says you agree that they can give out your information to 3rd parties INCLUDING \"Adult services and sites\". You cannot avoid this since if you say no - no boarding pass. Even if you choose to hand put your credit card number in rather than swipe it, it will provide you with your pass along with likely porn sites coming to your email address they insist on. Hilton should be sure that company is switched since in the business office you can also get your boarding pass from a different company that does not make you sign that you agree to their privacy policy but who knows if they have the same rules but just don't show it. Always be careful especially if you have children under 21 at home since being exposed to sexual adult sites opens them up to unwanted solicitations. (5)Lastly, their facebook site tells of the Hilton being sold and wonder what will happen to all the deals they offer on points earned on the Players cards. My experience with a Hilton in Philly airport was horrible but since it was just \"using the name\" but was franchised, they refused to offer anything except one free night if I flew there again (for $960.00 within 11 months.

There were two primary areas contributing to this opinion. First, the front desk staff was consistently rude and uninformed about the hotel's own processes. This attitude was consistent throughout the stay. More concerning was the fact that many areas of the hotel were dirty. The hallways never appeared to be vacuumed, the ashtrays by the elevators overflowed with cigarette butts at all times of the day and night, dirty dishes sat outside of rooms for hours at a time, the windows in the \"scenic\" elevator were streaked with dirt, the handsets in the room looked untouchable, several of the hallways smelled of mold-and that just to names a few of the cleanliness issues. To be fair, there were three bright spots. First, the beds (at least in the upgraded rooms) were very comfortable. The second is the complimentary lounge for the upgraded rooms was quite nice. Also, the lounge was the only place that seemed to be clean with friendly staff. Throughout the day snacks and drinks were plentiful and readily available. Access to the lounge was only available if one chose to upgrade the cost of the room, but it actually did make the stay considerably better. The third and most significant benefit tot his hotel is the fact it is connected to the Convention center--it helps a lot when it's 106 outside to be able to walk through the hotel instead. That is really it's saving grace, because otherwise it is substandard on so many levels. So, if you have to have close access to the convention center and thus have to stay at this hotel, I would recommend you upgrade your room so that you have access to the lounge. Otherwise, it would just be too miserable.

I was somewhat dubious after reading several of the reviews posted here but had no choice in where to stay. Check in experience was OK but only because I am a HHonors member & was able to use that line. The rest of the folks (and there were over 600 checking in for this meeting) had a VERY long line for check in. I was originally booked in a standard room but on the advice of a friend upgraded to a deluxe room. The room appeared to have been recently renovated & was comfortably furnished. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was almost identical to the bathroom in a Hampton Inn I stayed in a few weeks earlier - adequate. I had no noise issues but my room (in the North tower) did not overlook the pool. The AC is very old fashioned & does not allow for individualized temperature control; either you run it continually & keep the room cold or turn it off until the room gets warm. Otherwise the room was comfortable. The restaurants are very pricey with food that is OK. Even the \"fine dining\" restaurants had food that was OK but not to the quality one would expect for the price being paid ($40 one night for a small appetizer, small salad, & diet soda). No wonder I saw so many guests checking in Friday afternoon dragging coolers in with them. The hotel does have that neat deal of providing a $10 voucher for food & drinks for each day you chose not ot have the maid service your room. You just need to call the \"green\" number each day, and the voucher is slid under your door during the night. Not being a gambler, I cannot really comment about the casino. It did seem rather small with few patrons when compared to others I have seen on the Strip. My biggest problem with this hotel is how they nickel & dime you for everything - reminded me of the airlines. The 2 bottles of water in your room? $4 each if you open them. Internet access is a ridiculous $14/day. I was even charged $3 to use the computer kiosk in the main lobby to check in for my flight & print my boarding pass. There is a daily fee to use a safety deposit box (no safes in the rooms). There is also a $10/day fee to use the business center. There is also a daily fee to use the fitness center unless you are a high level HHonors member. At least the parking is free (so far). The pool is also free (towels are provided) but is awfully small for a hotel of this size (over 2000 rooms). This hotel makes a big deal out of advertising \"we don't charge resort fees!\" but they more than make up for it with this fee for everything approach. The hotel is off the Strip but has a Monorail station in it; the Monorail has several stops on the Strip & runs every 6 minutes. If you use it, buy a multi-day pass; otherwise it costs $5 for each one way trip. Overall, the hotel was OK for my purpose (business conference in the hotel). All of the staff I encountered were all very friendly & helpful during my stay. However, if I were to come to Vegas for a vacation, I would not stay here.

Even though it was only 12PM, I was able to check into a room immediately. The front desk staff was very courteous and the check-in line moved quickly despite being very long.

It was a bit confusing to find my room but maybe I am directionally challenged. The room itself was rather nice. I had a double bed room with plenty of space. There was a view of a golf course that was pretty good. I liked the built in desk thing next to the window. The bathroom is separated toilet/shower and a sink and vanity with plenty of lighting. There are no resort fees here but gym usage and internet usage come with additional fees. I saw there was a pool but I did not participate. Unlike the previous hotel I'd stayed in, Hilton did not have thin walls. I did not hear everything going on in the hallway.

One night had a personal pizza and large drink at Pizza Hut. This cost me nothing. The pool was large and clean all around. It is easy to get to the monorail station. Much easier then at the other hotels. Had a room across from the elevator. Could hear it but it never woke me up. Used the computer for my airline boarding pass. Only cost $3, good deal.

It is clean and has all the basics you need, but it's a long way from the rest of the Strip and the rooms have seen better days. If you're not there for a convention, give it a miss. I was there for four days and had a room in the central tower overlooking the pool. The pool area looked nice from my window although I didn't have time to go down there. Loud music from the pool in the afternoon, but it didn't keep going into the night and I had no problems with noise at this hotel. There are much more popular pools at other casinos so if you want a pool for swimming/playing and not partying, this will suit you. My room looked like it might have been super fabulous and upscale a long, long, LONG time ago. It was enormous and I think it was one of the room styles that is used for meetings/conventions as well as for a bedroom. There was a large living/dining area and a small bar area, and the bed was a Murphy bed that could obviously fold up into the wall to turn the room into a meeting room. Adequate bed, not uncomfortable considering it was a glorified foldaway, and the pillows were great. The other furniture in the room looked like it came from a garage sale at $2 for the lot. I wish I'd taken a picture of the coffee table - chipped, scarred and unbelievably cheap and crappy. I've stayed at Motel 6s with better quality furniture. Like the bedroom area, the bathroom was huge but very low-quality and gave the impression of being a cheap remodel of a previously high-end suite. One of the sink taps had the top broken off, and on my second night the other one fell off too. Only one of the two large lights at the sink worked. The sink itself was slow draining and would fill completely whenever I used it. The shower was fine, no problems there. Despite the shoddy quality, everything was clean and the housekeeping service did a good job every day. I was impressed that after the first day, some lovely housemaid noticed all the empty packets of allergy medication and used Kleenex in my trash, and left me two large boxes of Kleenex to replace the little one that was in the bathroom. Great service, and I hope that person was still on duty to find the large tip I left for them the next morning. Amenities in the bathroom: shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, tissues. Low-quality cheap hotel towels, but lots of them. I thought there wasn't a hairdryer, but found it on top of a shelf in the closet the next day. There was a small safe in the room, and a fridge under the bar (along with a couple of pieces of dirty plywood that appeared to be shoved in there to cover up some holes and damage around the pipes). The hotel's buffet was okay and not overpriced for what you get. Buy some bottled water elsewhere before you arrive; there are two small bottles of water in your room which will cost you $4 each if you drink them, and similar sized bottles sell for around $3 in the hotel shops. I would stay here again if I was attending another Convention Center event, but not for a pleasure trip.

So its a great VALUE, especially if you just stay at the hotel and then go to the strip. Another positive is that they have the Monorail that goes from the Hilton to some of the strip hotels. Monorail was quiet and clean and on time every 5 minutes. Also, we saw Trent Carlini, the Elvis impersonator at the Hilton Shimmer Cabaret theater. He was really good. Also, if you like Sports betting they have the largest Sports book in Vegas and it indeed is a nice place to watch sports. Ate at Hilton buffett and its average for what you would find in Vegas. Not a great selection of food but if all you want are the basics....meat, potatoes and desert it will do fine. The bed was very comfortable and the pool was quite large. Now the negative: it is an old hotel built in the 1960's. Our room was near the elevators which we thought was good at first, but at night you could hear the RUMBLING of the elevator....ALL NIGHT. The next morning we requested a different room away from the elevator and were promptly accommodated. Do NOT stay in a room near the elevator, unless you are deep sleeper. Also, our bathtub faucet was leaking even though we turned it all the way off. Also, they DON\"T have a food court. They have a small Pizza Hut nook which closes at 11pm....11pm? C'mon!! So, anyway, I ordered room service at 11:15pm and order did not come until 12:45am...YIKES! Also, room walls are thin as I could hear the people in the room next to us talking. In addition, I'm not a snob or anything but the crowd that comes out at night to the Hilton is certainly not the same crowd you would see at the Ventian. Just something to keep in mind.

I have stayed at this hotel several times over the last five years. My review will be mostly about this stay, but it is fair to say that I have witnessed an enormous improvement in the quality of the service and amenities offered by this excellent property. I cannot give them a \"perfect\" score because they still have the old box TVs in the rooms. Granted, the suites have the more modern flat screens with great picture quality. If you are into the groove of booming music ask to be put in a room on the poolside of the building. If you are not into the loud noise of the festivities of the weekend pool party and happy hour, then you need to ask to be put in a room more quiet to suit your taste :-). I personally loved being in a lanai suite on the 3rd floor. It is close enough to the spa, gym, pool cafe, and pool bar for those who rather do the beach shorts and flip-flops. If you are into the more casual dressing and casino atomosphere, go for it baby! The room service is okay, I rather go to the buffet or one of the many top quality eateries within the property. If you like to drink, I suggest picking up some spirits from the local grocery store, Walgreens, or CVS (yes they sell alcohol at the drug store - imagine that :-). As far as Hilton Honors goes, take advantage of the VIP check-in lounge. You will NOT see it advertised anywhere, but just as you enter the building from the front, it is on the left side right before the front desk. They serve everything (well champagne after 11AM) beer, water, juice, soda...and the cookies are delicious! You will find the staff at this property (mostly) EXCELLENT. There are a few who make you feel like you are interrupting their day, but hopefully they will be gone by the time you book and stay at this property. The management (throughout) is absolutely guest friendly and will go out of their way to make it right - simply call and speak with one of them and you'll be pleasantly surprised. They really make your stay great. So, don't waste time arguing with an associate. Save the stress and just kindly ask to speak to a manager and you will be handled with kitten gloves. The quality of the housekeeping is simply stellar. These ladies are like stealth boomers. The come and clean your room so quickly and professionally, it leaves you wondering if they are watching you leave just so they can get into the room. By the way, the Las Vegas Hilton gives $10 (FREE) daily if you call housekeeping and tell them you do not want or need service. You have to do it before 1AM and it's not valid on check-in or check-out day. A few words about security. My advice is do not \"screw\" with them or you'll be out in a flash. If you come to gamble or eat or enjoy the fun, you are cool, but if you even smell of mischief,,,let's just say be on your best behavior. I hope this review helps.

We went down to the desk to inquire and were told that we would need to pay an additional $10.00 per night for an upgrade. Not seeing a choice at that point, we agreed to the upgrade and did indeed get a nicer room (at first glance). It was indeed a remodeled room, but the marble tiles in the entryway to the room were missing grout and moved when we walked on them. There was an automatic control for the window treatments that apparently wasn't connected because nothing happened when we hit the switch. I understand the water saving feature on the shower heads, but this one was more like a pressurized spray that felt like needles on the skin. Staff were generally not helpful. When questioned as to why we weren't offered the upgrade option at the time of reservation, we were told that we would have to talk to a supervisor. Interestingly enough, the gentleman at the front desk was wearing a name tag that below his name read \"supervisor.\" The attention to detail throughout the hotel was sorely lacking as was security. Whenever we have stayed at a hotel on the Strip, there has always been a security person checking for a room key prior to getting in the elevator. We saw no security personnel and were never asked if we indeed were staying at the hotel prior to getting on the elevator.

My close friend and I were staying in Vegas overnight for a Kylie Minogue concert and luxe shopping. I booked a Resorts Club Room (do it!) which was an excellent decision. The valet was prompt, despite my busy arrival time of 2pm. Walking into the lobby, I could tell they weren't lying about the recent renovations. Nice marble floors, updated signage, etc. There was a separate check-in line for HHonors, VIP, and Resorts Club Room guests, which made me happy from the moment I stepped in. I waited about 10 minutes before being greeted by a smiling agent who simply collected a photo ID and confirmation number and promptly gave me my arrival packet. Knowing of the renovations, I inquired if my room was one of the newly upgraded ones, and I was assured it was. Proceeding to my room, the elevator was a tad dated, but it was speedy so no complaints there. After getting into the room, I was VERY happy! Two complimentary bottles of water were provided because it was a Resorts Club room. Robes in the closet was a very nice touch. The room itself was very contemporary and up-to-date, from the furniture, to the bathroom fixtures (and upgraded toiletry amenities). Never have I had bell staff retrieve my luggage as quickly as at The Las Vegas Hilton. No more than 10 minutes passed between my call and the arrival of my luggage. GREAT bell service! After the luggage came, we checked out the Resorts Club Lounge. I've frequented Ritz Carlton properties that have a Club Lounge, so I had a vague expectation. At 2pm there was a plentiful stock of cookies, cheese and crackers, fruits and vegetables, soda, and a large cappuccino machine. At a later return (about 6:30 pm), there was a Wine reception which was very nice to enjoy the view with. There were also restrooms, 32inch HD TVs, complimentary newspaper, and internet access in the Resorts Club Room. Very pleasant for a Hilton property. The BED was amazing! One of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. It rivaled the Westin Heavenly Bed (only the pillows here were better!) Fabulous down comforter, sheets, etc. The next morning we did the breakfast buffet, which was not only very good, but well-priced at about $15 per person. (French toast and smoked salmon a la carte would've been upwards of $20 anywhere). The french toast was the most authentic I've ever had at a breakfast buffet (better than at ARIA, MGM and Mandalay even). Check-out was effortless, at 9:30 AM, they didn't even need a signature (I did traditional check-out because I wanted to ensure the Breakfast Buffet and movie charge posted correctly).

I was informed that the hotel was over-booked and the room I requested was not available. They tried to give me a standard room with double beds with a \"bonus\" that I could move to the room I requested the next day. By now I had been at registration for 1 hour and was not happy. The clerk gave me several reasons why my room was not available, the people before us didn't check out, they gave my room away to another couple, the hotel was over-booked and then that there was a room available but it was dirty and she had no idea when it would be cleaned. At this point I asked for the manager. The manager had zero problem solving skills but did eventually decide that she could get the dirty room cleaned in about an hours time frame and she would give us a $50 credit to go eat dinner in one of their restraunts. An hour later after eating dinner we returned to the desk stood in line again and was told the maid had been cleaning the room for a while so she should be nearly done and we could head up to the room. We arrived at the room which was still dirty, the maids cart was in the hallway but she was no maid in sight. The maid showed up and said she was just told to the clean the room and it would 20 or so minutes. We sat in the hallway and waited. Once we got into the room we turned on the air conditioner and had the pleasure of listening to a really loud squeal it was putting out. Additionally, this room was next to the elevator so it sounded like a freight train running through the room everytime the elevators moved. It was 1 am so we decided to go to sleep and deal with it the next day. The next morning I called and was told my room would be ready at 3 pm and it was. We moved and had no more room issues or any other issues the rest of the stay. We did zip check-out which avoids lines with them emailing you a copy of your bill. I have opened that bill and have found that they did not credit the $50 as promised on that 1st night. So tomorrow I will have to call and fight with them about it. A couple other things that I thought was strange was they charged a $10 \"handling fee\" to have a package shipped to the hotel and they charged $1 a minute to use the internet.

We were told that it was a request only, not a reservation.

If you want to be at the convention center, or at a location with easy access to the central strip by car or monorail than this is a great option. The Las Vegas Hilton is an older hotel with a casino but is well maintained. We were in town for four nights staying three of them at the Hilton Grand Vacations at the Flamingo. (Excellent Property by the way....see my review of that location) Friday night prices on the strip were crazy, and we had wanted to ride the rides at the Stratosphere arrival night and do the Neon Boneyard tour the next day, so this was a great fit for an inexpensive overnight. Glad we did, this is a nice hotel and it fit the bill for the night. Upon arrival it is a bit hectic and confusing to find where to check in if you don't want to use valet parking but we found a 15 minute zone spot and finished our check in. There was a long line for check in but as a Diamond HHonors client we went to the the VIP line...so our check in took about 5 minutes. Though we had a confirmed King Non Smoking they tried to put us in a room with two double beds...unacceptable and I had to get a bit pushy but they finally put us in a room on their \"resort\" floor....though they did not give us access to the lounge...cheesy to do that, given Diamonds are supposed to get lounge access, but we checked in late so would not have gotten much benefit from the lounge. Our key worked to get into the lounge but the lady at the desk would not admit us without additional documentation from the hotel. The lobby is large and welcoming with a casino, multiple dining options, etc. The room and bathrooms are nicely appointed and are roomy enough. Room decoration is warm. The room had plenty of desk space. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel had plenty of TV Channels and flat screen TV's. Climate control is acceptable and you can leave the blower motor on for white noise while still using the climate control. Absolutely no noise from the nearby boulevard. They did have a couple of bottles of water in our room. (no charge) This was only because we were on the resort floor. Oddly enough there was not a clock in the room and we had to call down to ask for one. The bathroom was properly appointed....small but acceptable. There was no charge for in room internet access as a HHonors diamond member for 1 computer...the second (or first for non HHonors members) is $13.95. The one connection per room....also kind of cheesy in the world of multiple laptop using spouses. One Diamond amenity that was provided was full breakfast in their buffet, which was a nice step up....given only continental is required. This was the best HHonors buffet I have had in the US. (Not as good as Europe locations, but by far the best in the US) Full breakfast, chmpaign , mimosas, (on the weekend) full omelet station, lots of food choices, great option...excellent buffet. Good Service. Awesome! Honestly, even if we had to pay for this buffet it would have been a good deal. Another amenity that they provided that was excellent is that they did not blink at offering us 4pm checkout. Self parking is free, Valet is $10, unless you are a HHonors elite, then it is free. The hotel had an outdoor pool and hot tub area that was rather nice. They also had an excellent health club / gym / spa. Access to the health club / gym / spa was complimentary as HHonors Diamond members. (I am unsure how much it cost for non elite guests) We would stay here again in a heartbeat if we did not need to be right on the strip. Other than a few minor hiccups with check in and clock, the hotel was perfect....though they did not give us lounge access the other perks more than made up for it.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAging Property, Mediocre Casino, Good Steakhouse\u201d", "Author": "mjm19", "ReviewID": "UR105804548", "Content": "I came into town for an overnight stay to attend a convention.

Other hotels may advertise rates as low as $25 to $35 per nite but most of them will add a resort fee of $5-12 per nite that doesn't usually provide spa or fitness ctr access or even free wifi. As a Hilton Gold member I was cheerfully upgraded when I arrived after 10pm on a Mon by Jeanelle to a \"premium\" (ie, renovated with frig in North Tower) room that was spacious and tastefully decorated, with premium bedding, lge flat screen plasma TV, and even a very comfy oval tub with excellent water pressure and good drainage.

By the time I figured all this out it was too late to take advantage of it but will do so next time. There will definitely BE a next time as the buffet b'fast was amazing in both quantity and quality (tho service could be a bit slow esp the later you went) and I LOVED relaxing in the almost deserted spa jacuzzis, steam rm and sauna, (complete with robe, slippers, cold water and chilled washcloths!). It wasn't as posh as Qua at Ceasars or the Canyon Ranch at the Venetian but it also didn't cost $40-45 AND I didn't have to lve the hotel. Also enjoyed the pool outside the spa/fitness ctr on the 3rd floor (neither the Venetian or Qua includes swimming pool access with their day spa entrance fees). Both the pool and spa staff were very friendly and helpful. I also happily took advantage of their unique $10 per nite restaurant cert for passing on daily maid service. My only negatives woulld be the small size of the bathrm--really HATE having to close the door to be able to access the toilet or showe/tub!--and the limited TV channels plus the slow valet parking service (tho having a rm in the N Tower was VERY convenient to self-parking). The only restaurant I tried was Benihana and it was decidedly mediocre and overpriced--even with the $20 I saved by not having my rm cleaned! Wanted to see the Elvis Impersonator but he was booked Tues nite and I had other plans for Wed. BTW, I ALWAYS rent a car in Vegas as traffic really isn't bad during the week and parking is either free or cheap (few $ for valet).

I know that sounds like a backhanded kind of compliment, but that is how I feel about the place. If you want grandeur, go elsewhere. If you want pretention, stay away. If you want a full-time rush 24/7, forget it. If you want experienced competence at affordable rates, then the Hilton is for you. My wife had to go to a social work conference there, while I hung and explored on my own. I spent part of the time in our ample and spacious room doing work on my computer and part of the time on foot or monorail exploring the strip. The monorail stops at the Hilton, making it very accessible to other venues. I had breakfast twice in the Paradise Cafe, used the coffee kiosk by the registration desk often, and meandered into the casino at random moments when I felt like some slot machine action. The hotel felt like a proper home base: easy to negotiate, friendly, compact in the amenities end of things. And the Paradise Cafe, for casual low-cost breakfasts, is your home town cafe: heavy on waffles, bacon, and granola, light on caviar and oysters. Fine with me. Do I have any complaints? This is minor and aesthetic only. I'm not crazy about being treated as a demographic. This is done by the incessant piping of \"music of your life\" retro rock into every public space 24/7. I know that it is another \"this is your hometown\" device, but I resent the demographic targeting. I actually burst out laughing when the Rivingtons blasted me with \"Bird is the Word\" in the men's room or when Dylan broke out into \"Like a Rolling Stone\" while I was having a cup of tea. It was ok: I've heard worse, and Big Joe Turner's \"Chicken and the Chicken Hawk\" went well with my morning waffle one morning. Still, a little less demographic targeting goes a long way with me. But I liked the Hilton. When I wanted my grandeur fix I got on the monorail and went elsewhere, and got out when I'd felt the telltales signs of sublimity overload. (One giant statue looks like all the others.) The LV Hilton knows what it is, and plays its role with easy confidence. It doesn't pretend to be pyramid, a movie set, a French Rue de la Desert, etc. I liked the arrangement of the public spaces, with easy access from cafe to casino to room elevators. I found the staff friendly and efficient. And when I came back from another hotel by taxi, the doorman said to me \"Welcome home.\" I kid you not. Would I go back? Sure. I'm a fussy guy and I found nothing to be dismayed about.

What a fantastic guy and a great intro to staying at the Hilton (we've partied and played there but never stayed before).

I stayed for 5 nights so got a pretty good look at it. The room showed signs of neglect: the carpet was well worn with some stains, there was caulking coming out just a bit around the tub, the toilet ran all of the time (which I was able to easily fix myself with a quick adjustment to the flapper chain) and the whole hotel away from the main floor just seemed a bit drab especially for glitzy Las Vegas. These things do not bother me but the traveler who is expecting everything to be perfect may see it differently. Housekeeping was good, the room furnishings were good, especially the bed. The room was quiet and the temperature control was good. In spite of some of the horror stories in other reviews about the staff, I found them universally very friendly and courteous. No complaints at all in that regard. A few complaints, however: The room internet quality was good but $14 a day is a ripoff. I stay in hotels at half the price where it is free. I had to pay $3.00 in order to log onto the hotel computer that allowed me to print off a boarding pass. Because I got caught there during a major weather disruption to air service throughout the nation, I ended up having to do this several times. Not a big cost consideration in the whole scheme of things but it gave the impression that they were not going to miss any opportunity to stick it to their guests. The hotel does not provide an airport shuttle which is okay, but the Concierge, while friendly, was surprisingly ignorant of the schedules and pickup procedures for the commercial shuttles that provide transportation to the airport. I guess they figure that if you could afford the hotel, you could afford a taxi. Of course the hotel is designed so that you have to walk through or by the casino every time you go somewhere and get to enjoy the second had cigarette smoke. However, the smoke control is good and I did not notice cigarette smoke elsewhere in the hotel. I spent a sum total of 0 cents on gambling during my 5-day stay so clearly I am no expert on the matter. However, it was my observation that the Hilton casino was dull and boring. There was no excitement like I saw in some other casinos that I walked through. The people who were there were just somberly going about the business of loosing their money. There are some real food bargains some places on the Strip but I didn't find any at the Hilton. However, the Paradise Cafe on the main floor was reasonable. It is just plain food but it ranged from decent to really good. I probably ate at leas a half-dozen meals there including breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. At peak times there was sometimes a bit of a line but I never had to wait to get a seat at the counter which is where I ate most of my meals. All in all, I would not see any reason to avoid this hotel. However, if you are headed to Las Vegas for fun and excitement, I would look elsewhere. Also, there are a ton of hotels in Vegas. I am sure there are some much better buys that are more convenient to the strip if you do a bit of looking around. If you are at a meeting in the Las Vegas Convention Center, it is worth considering this hotel for convenience. However, there are a couple other hotels that are conveniently located adjacent to the convention center as well including a Clarion right across the street from it. It would be worth checking out the alternatives.

However, it had been quite some since our last stay. Although we still like the property and its location our overall experience this time was not what we expected. We chose the Hilton \"Resorts Package\"-a nice perk overall-it includes morning continental-style breakfast, and in the evening refreshments and appetizers-cheese, fruit & vegetables, chips & dip, champagne, wine, beer and an assortment of juices and soft drinks. It also includes some room perks, bottled water, robes and slippers, a 37\" flat screen TV. On our arrival we noticed only one robe in our closet, not a big deal but just the same we called the desk and were told that usually only one robe is provided. After explaining there were two of us staying in the room they agreed to send up another robe and did. Not a good start. It only went downhill from there. The hotel has a program allowing guests to opt-out of receiving daily housekeeping service, for doing so the guest receives daily a $10 coupon to be used in one of the property's restaurants. Since we enjoy having fresh linens and our bed made by while we're vacationing we chose not to participate in the program. After our second full day, and upon returning to our room late into the evening, housekeeping had opted-out for us. Upon calling the front desk to let them know our room had not been cleaned we were abruptly told we needed to call housekeeping ourselves. So we did only to be told that they thought we chose the no service program, and if we wanted to have our room made up that evening it would be at least a 45 minute wait before staff could get to it. So we went one day and night without housekeeping service but never received any compensation whatsoever. On our fifth evening we arrived at our room after an all day excursion only to find that our key cards would not open our door lock. Having remembered the Front Desk's \"not our job\" credo we decided to call Security. A security person-who was very professional and helpful-immediately came to our room with a pass key, and after checking our ID, which we appreciated, attempted to open our lock with his pass key but was unsuccessful. He then asked me to attempt to open the Resorts Room lock-located just down the hall- with my key. Upon being able to do that he determined our lock was malfunctioning and called the hotel's locksmith. At that point he explained that he was required to go on break and another security person would be there to stay with us until the locksmith arrived. That exchange took place but before the locksmith arrived the second security person needed to leave because of an emergency alarm call. Finally, the locksmith arrived and took the lock apart and determined its batteries were dead. Thirty minutes had elasped and we were not in our room yet. Since there was no security person present the locksmith was reluctant to let us into the room. We understood his dilemma and suggested he call Security, which he did. He received clearance to let us in but we still couldn't go in because he had to remove the framing in front of the bolt lock, stretch the door frame with a jack, and then, use a slip jack on the bolt to open the door. Another twenty minutes and we were finally in the room. Not done yet, he still had to replace the batteries in the lock. All in all over an hour after we had tried to open our door. We luckily had no pressing reservations for the night, and again, no apology from Management. On our sixth night we were abruptly awakened at 4am by an alarm that announced on the room's overhead speakers an emergency alarm had been triggered. The anouncement said this several times before finally announcing the emergency had been cleared and no other action was necessary. Again, and by now, expected, no further explanation or apology was given by Management. On our final morning we needed to check out early due to our flight and upon check out-which the guest is told can be done three easy ways-we chose to check out via TV screen only to find out that we could not receive a final total printout because it was too early in the day-5am. We were able to have the final emailed to us.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, California", "Title": "\u201cPoor service competes with outdated rooms\u201d", "Author": "Trav-a-lot-from-Cali", "ReviewID": "UR96670053", "Content": "Our visit to this property provides just one more experience demonstrating that the Hilton brand seems to be going from bad to worse. We came to Las Vegas for the Valentine's Day weekend to get away from everyday problems. I reserved the Valentine's Day package that promised us a bottle of champaign and chocolate dipped strawberries plus $100 in coupons. Upon arrival the check-in lady gave us the wrong set of coupons and informed us, incorrectly, that the room service folks will bring the champaign and strawberries to our room. After waiting for a while I called up the room service and got transferred to five different people and had to explain the same question to all of them. Finally, I was told that I have to go back to the check-in to get the coupon for the free champaign and strawberries to pick these up myself in a bar. There goes an hour of my time. We tried to use one dining coupon in a hotel restaurant but were told that this restaurant decided to shut early (at 8pm) on Valentine's Day weekend. After looking at the other hotel restaurants we decided that, even with coupons, we can get better experience for the same price elsewhere in LV so we ended up not using any of the coupons. The room was OK but the bathrooms are outdated and nowhere near the quality of what one gets in this price range at other LV hotels. Even though we were not directly near the elevator shafts (probably some 30 yards away), we could hear loud noises from elevators moving up and down all night. The HVAC fan was very loud, the kind of noise one would expect in a rural cheap motel, not LV Hilton. To top things up, during check-out I was double-charged for Internet. To their credit, they took the 2nd charge off as soon as I pointed it out. Finally, on the way to our car we found out that the elevators in the parking structure were not operating. The doors to one of them were wide open and the floor was splattered with blood. This place needs considerable investment, new management, and better trained employees.

First let me say that we love Las Vegas and spend from seven to ten days there 3 or 4 times each year. We like to stay at a different hotel each time, so I am familiar with the service (and respect) that other hotels still provide their customers. For seven days, we parked on the first floor of the hotel's garage. On Friday night, we were flagged down by a surly security guard and not permitted to park there. The reason was there was a concert held that night at the LV Hilton and we were forced to park on the roof. We were very lucky that the crowd was happy and respectful to us senior, but it could as easily not have worked out that well. We were given two rooms when we checked in and neither had any heat. Since they promised to fix the heat the next day, we decided to stay in the room. I had already unpacked and I wanted a shower. If we had stayed in the room the full seven days, the bathtub would never have drained. What a mess. Against my better judgment, I packed again and moved to another room. We were escorted by housekeeping, not a bellman, so we had not choice but to repack. The room we ended up with was used as a hospitality room, so the bed was a Murphy bed, smaller than a queen. The frame stuck out 2\" all around and we kept running into it all week, but I didn't have to pack again. Oh, by the way, no heat in this room either. We were told by the manager that this room was an upgrade and he could not understand why the heat didn't work. Upgrade usually doesn't mean half the size, but at the LV Hilton it does. They fixed the heat and we stayed the 7 days. Never again. All the stores along the side entrance are empty -the pizza/yogurt/sandwich shop that has been there for years is only open on weekends. The whole place looks like a bizarre haunted house. Nasty. By the way, the housekeeping staff on the 26th floor was great - at least they are committed to customer service.

With its long history, I expected much more from this hotel. The Las Vegas Hilton needs serious updating and customer service is lacking. The hotel looks like it's straight out of the 80's. For the amount of money this hotel touts it recently spent on renovating, I have not seen the output. This hotel does not value its top-tier HHonors members. At check in, I received a generic letter welcoming me to the property and outlining the HHonors benefits I would be receiving. My VIP on-site benefits are set to a room upgrade and breakfast. The room upgrade was to a \"renovated room\". This \"renovated room\" had not been renovated in years. At some point, there must be a statute of limitations on how long you can call it \"renovated\". I would hate to see what the non-renovated rooms looked like. The letter also outlined that Gold and Diamond members would receive ONE free internet connection per day and each additional connection would be charged at the regular price of $13.99 per day. I do not believe this is what Hilton had in mind when they granted free internet as a published benefit to all members. HHonors members have computers, iPads, and cell phones that they would like to connect to the internet. On a positive note, the internet was reliable and fast. In addition, Gold & Diamond members get free access to the fitness center; I do not believe it's worth it for non HHonors Gold & Diamond members to pay for the use of this center. The buffet breakfast was pretty good. The weekend version was even better. HHonors Gold & Diamond members should bring their membership card with them in order to receive the breakfast. The front desk staff seemed bothered when I did not have my card and they had to issue breakfast certificates. This property has an on-site monorail station that connects with the other stops along the strip. The monorail is $5 per ride, $12 for unlimited rides for 24 hours, or $28 for unlimited for 72 hours of unlimited rides. The monorail was a nice benefit since the hotel is not on the strip. However, the monorail does not operate 24 hours a day, has few stops, and you must take a long walk through the casino of the hotel it stops at to reach the strip. As with all hotels in Las Vegas, smoking is allowed in the casino. However, the smoke at this property filtrates into other areas such as restaurants and the front desk area.

We were attending a convention at the Sands Expo center, and got a great deal on the Hilton through their players club that we couldn't pass up. We used the monorail to get to the sands, and it was a bit of a hike to get to the expo center from the monorail but we liked the exercise (much less on day 4 than on day 1 though!) The hotel itself is older, but still decently maintained so it does look a bit dated, but not super run down. The rooms have been renovated, and while not as plush or luxurious as say the Wynn or the Venetian, definitely better than a motel 6. The beds were better than expected, again not Wynn level, but I didn't have a sore back or neck after 4 nights and I usually do when sleeping in hotel beds. We upgraded to a superior room in the North Tower and it was very convenient to the monorail and lobby. We ate the buffet 3 out of 4 nights, because it was right there and the price was good for what you get. It isn't overly huge or anything, but the food is decent and you get all the bud light you can drink with it. They also have complimentary wine, but being a wine snob I just couldn't bring myself to drink it. The Hilton also offers you a $10 voucher if you opt to not have the maid clean your room each day, so we got a free buffet out of the deal by not having her clean every day. I like that, thank you Hilton! We would definitely stay there again if we got a great deal, but if we can stay on the strip next time we will. It is off the strip a little ways even with the monorail it is not easy to get to the other side of the strip to see the new hotels and shopping areas.

There was a pretty good selection. Casino - The casino looks like it hasn't been redone in decades, so we stuck to the Strip for our gambling, which we'd planned on doing anyway.

I have stayed here 4 separate times in the calendar year 2010. I have even visited the casino and continued to give this hotel my business even on a one day trip to Las Vegas where I did not stay overnight. My wife and I have enjoyed our visits. Unfortunately, on the latest (currently still at the hotel) trip here - December 17 to December 19, I have been extremely disappointed. Upgrade problem: I flew in from the east coast on Friday evening - December 17. I was greeted warmly at the front desk, and was recognized as a Diamond member. Additionally I was told I had been upgraded for being a Diamond VIP. I highly doubt this was the case. In fact, on previous visits as a Gold VIP, I was actually upgraded to better rooms. I was even specific at the front desk to which time of room I wanted - and I wasn't asking for a suite. I simply wanted the updated bathrooms (and referenced the room I stayed in before earlier in the year). Instead, I received an ordinary 'Classic Room' without an updated bathroom. This was the least of my concern, as room cleanliness was even worse. See below. Room cleanliness: I am surprised that the Hilton thought this room was ready for check-in. The toilet wasn't 100% clean, my sheets had several stains on them along with several holes. I found hairs in the sink and inside the sheets of the bed. The shower curtain liner was extremely old and emitted a disgusting musty odor. So, even though I was tired, I actually packed up my belongings and returned to the front desk. Room Swap: The front desk listened to my concerns and did give me a new room - a resort room. The front desk had to point out the fact that since I didn't pay for a resort room, that the bottled water and safe were not free. I had thought all along I was allowed bottled water by being Gold VIP or higher? In fact, each time this year I had bottled water free of charge. As far as the room goes, even though it's called a 'Resort Room', it's no better than a regular 'Classic Room'. It's the same thing with the exception of having extra amenities included in the price - water, etc. I spoke with Van, a front desk supervisor on Saturday, December 18. He listened to my concerns but didn't do much more. He offered another room swap, but considering I was only in town for one additional evening, what did that actually accomplish? My expectations fell far short on this particular trip. While I was not treated rudely, I also felt that there was no sincerity in my discussions with the front desk. Also, I would have thought by returning to this hotel multiple times in one calendar year would actually mean something. Apparently both my wife and I were wrong about that. In summary, I will speak to the front desk when I check out today about my experience. I also plan on calling the hotel to speak to the highest possible manager I can reach. They should know about my experience and why a loyal Hilton member (both to the entire chain of hotels and to this particular hotel) will highly consider staying in a different hotel. There are plenty of options in Las Vegas. And one more thing: Apparently the hotel was having power issues. Some of the elevators were not in use because of this. Lines were growing really long to use them, and they are slow in the first place. I had to walk down the stairs to check out because I didn't have time to wait around. I was on the 25th floor.

I would go back again and look forward to doing so. The rooms: The hotel is enormous (not uncommon for Vegas) and so it was a a good walk from the room to the Casino but this was good for us because we would leave most of our money and credit cards in the safe in the room and only take what we planned on losing. The bed/bathroom/sofa/view was all spectacular. We got an upgrade at check-in. I just asked for one and they gave it to us! The room service was phenomenal. I have never stayed somewhere that room service was not only affordable but priced similar to the hotel restaurants. They do not add gratuity to the bill which I was surprised by--but I added the normal 20%. I think they should make this more well known because I suspect a lot of people assume it is added. The Hotel: The hotel is beautiful. It is not on the strip and is not like the fancier hotels like the Venetian or New York, New York but all of the appointments are spectacular. They really do the details well. There are several dining options, ranging from a japaneese steak house to a hot dog stand and everything in between. The breakfast buffet was immense. The Casino: If you like to sports gamble, this is the place to go. I only wish they had more non-smoking sections available in the sports book. The ventilation is not very good and it did become bothersome after a while. However, on Sundays during NFL season, they open the theatre and broadcast all games in a smoke free enviornment with cheap drinks, food and lots of free stuff. The slots and tables were adequate. I found the blackjack dealers to be a bit aggressive and for a first time table gambler, that was intimidating. Cons: Its Vegas and so be prepared to pay for EVERYTHING. The internet access was $20 per day per laptop. I found that to be excessive. They offer kiosks in the lobby to print out boarding passes for your flight home but they charge $3 a pass. Given that there are about 50 kiosks at the airport, don't bother. I did not find that the concerige was very helpful and we had better luck with just figuring stuff out on our own. Outside the hotel: If you get tired of gambling, go to Red Rocks in the Mojave Desert. It is only about 20 minutes away and it is truly breath-taking.

As a Diamond member I was due a complimentary upgrade to a Grand Room. However for an extra $40 per night I chose a resort club extra large room. I went up to that room, checked out the resort club lounge and went straight back to reception. Neither was worth the upgrade. The Club lounge is very small, has a very small selection of food and gets very busy. I use Executive lounges all the time in Hiltons. This is not worth it. The \"upgraded more spacious resort club room\" was not worth the $40 a night price tag. As it turned out, it was not much bigger than my Grand room, though it did have nicer Acca Kappa toiletries and bath robe/slippers etc. In fairness to the excellent front office staff, they had absolutely no issue with my change of mind and gave me a very comfortable Grand room on the 6th floor. In my opinion, a better room. The hotel itself is massive. It's a logistical miracle that the place is able to run but boy do they have the hotel running well. Staff are all excellent, in EVERY area I came across them. It's great idea to get a no quibble $10 voucher for not having housekeeping if you choose not to.

The pool, fitness facilities and the spa are adequate, but hardly opulent. That these are free for an Hilton elite is really an important benefit, however. Dinner in the buffett is worth little more than the $20 fee. Breakfast, on the other hand, provided a wide array of food and an excellent choice of fruit and melons.

At other times, the line was quite long) we found out we could upgrade to a premium room for only $20 extra per night. This included a fridge and newer room facilities, so we did. It was worth it.

Shower/bathroom was good, and there was plenty of room for our luggage. I should mention that the bed was incredibly comfortable, and my wife and I both slept extremely well thanks to this and the blackout curtains, which kept the room dark and quiet.

It is at least a quarter mile and no buses run to the Hilton. True, the Hilton is connected to the downtown by way of the monorail but it stops running at midnight.

Unfortunately, while the East Coast was battling storms our flights were delayed and we arrived to an empty airport; the ride to the hotel was very short on a beautiful cool night, or was it morning? Thankfully our room was very comfortable, the bathroom was large without the sink because that was right outside, that's a plus when you have family to share the bathroom with. Hungry at 3:30 a.m. we called for room service, but we couldn\u2019t order because when the checked-in we were asked if we would charge anything to the room and not thinking clearly we said no, so we had to be in person at the front desk to authorize charges. We then found out that internet had to be paid there too, an additional charge not included in the room charge, that\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it? Movies too, which we knew wouldn\u2019t even have time to watch. So, back to the room and within half hour we had a huge breakfast, expensive, but it was complete with whipped cream for our chocolate, syrup for our pancakes, all in real dinnerware, and covered to keep it warm. By the time we finished our meal we didn't want to go to sleep, but for a few hours we relaxed in tranquility. The hotel also has a security check at 3:00 a.m. so we had to endure a security guard opening our door, which really was no inconvenience, actually I thought that was very thoughtful. Moving on, the buffet and restaurants in the hotel were near the casino area, which was always crowded, all day and a lot of people smoking, this affected my daughter and myself, we came back with sinus problems. I loved the exclusive stores and convenience store, along with specialty coffee and wine shops, all inside the hotel. Everything was a short distance away by taxi or monorail, right there. Taxi is preferable for several people traveling, it\u2019s cheaper, even the person outside the hotel designated to call the taxis recommends that. S/he will also get you a taxi that accepts credit cards if you tell them. I really loved the hotel, but it would be better if they figure a good smoke extractor system or something to clean the air a little! The pool was large enough, and yet cozy, they had tons of lounge chairs to sun bathe and they provide you with a towel when you enter the pool area. They also have a small store for swimming necessities, and a bar to order your favorite drink by the pool, I can\u2019t elaborate because I didn\u2019t order anything.

However, after giving the girl checking us in a decent stare down she \"found\" us a king room on a non-smoking floor. What luck, huh? Our room was decent. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds that I've slept in in a very long time. We had a decent view from the 22nd floor, however, the gigantic Hilton sign shone right into our window at night- but the room had decent black-out curtains. The hotel overall was decent- at least for us. There were a few things that could use some attention, though- the hallways need to be cleaned BADLY. There are balls of dirt and lint along the baseboards and in the corners near the doors to rooms, elevators, etc.; glasses used in hotel rooms should be REPLACED after every guest checks out- not just wiped out with a dust rag and placed back on the counter for the next guest to use.. i know this was the case because of the fuzz in the bottom of all of our glasses- as well as random body hairs stuck to the inside of glasses.

WRONG!!! I was extremely disappointed. First, we reserved a non-smoking room when we made our reservations online. When we got checked in, our room reeked of cigarette smoke. I called the front desk and they could only move us to another room on the same floor, which is supposedly a non-smoking floor (although I had one employee tell me that it was NOT a non-smoking floor). So we moved next door to another room, which was better but still had a hint of cigarrette smoke. I called the front desk again, and they told me all the non-smoking rooms were occupied and they couldn't move us. We decided to stay. The room was not clean -- not terribly dirty either, but not clean. There was a stain on the bed spread, there was a 1/4\" thick layer of dust covering the air intake filter as if it hadn't been changed in a year, there was a layer of dusk on the night stand, there were cup rings on the table. It was just not what I would expect from a Hilton. Furthermore, the room was not a \"Superior room\" which we paid extra for. What kind of \"Breathtaking views of the Las Vegas strip\" can you get from the 4th floor? Plus we were supposed to have a refridgerator in our room & didn't. They did bring one to our room when I called and asked about it. There was a safe in the room as described in the room description, but you had to pay extra for it. And speaking of paying extra, how about the $4 waters & $13.99/day internet access charges. I mean, maybe this is standard for Vegas, but who charges for internet use these days. Most Hampton Inn's that I stay at offer free WiFi. Going back to the 4th floor being a non-smoking floor... there were no signs anywhere on the floor indicating non-smoking. Not on each room number sign or when you get off the elevator. And speaking of which, there was an ash tray as soon as you got off the elevator. So yeah, it was a smoking floor & the front desk just straight up LIED to me. Speaking of service, the cleaning people were nice enough, but the people downstairs were slack. On our flight out to Vegas, one of our bags got lost. We were told by the front desk that when our bag arrives they would call our room so that we could come & pick it up. They didn't. On the way out, we swung by just to check, and there it was. There were 2 girls sitting behind the desk with no customers to be helped. Why didn't they call us & let us know it was in? Thanks for nothing! I know for a fact that I will not go back to this hotel, nor will I recommend it to anyone. The location to the heart of the Vegas strip was not great, but the monorail stops at the Hilton. So that made it okay.

My advice pls spend extra on a hotel on the strip and stay away from this dinosaur ..if you still go ahead , then let me add that the food and service at its coffee shop ( paradise cafe) may well spell gastroenteritis !", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCheck-in lines are long and seem to only...\u201d", "Author": "Xytoneboy", "ReviewID": "UR82523301", "Content": "Check-in lines are long and seem to only have two staff checking people in during my trip.

What I thought was extremely unprofessional was that one of the pool staff was going around telling other guests that he thought the past lady was on drugs...gossiping about someone when they are being carried away on a stretcher?!

It's not bad for the price, and since we got player's cards we usually get good deals like we did for our most recent trip at $35 a night (regular price is usually about $60-$100/night). The location is off the strip, so plan to drive or take the monorail if you want to head down to the strip (it has a monorail station connected to the hotel). It's nice to avoid all the weekend traffic on the strip, but requires some planning if you want to go down where all the action is. My three biggest problems with the hotel are: (1) the last three times we have stayed there when we check in to our room it has clearly not been vacuumed. We always have to call and complain about that because the floors can be pretty gross; (2) the shower heads are terrible, they feel like sandblasters; and (3) there are not a lot of casual dining options, and the one place they do have that is decent food (the Sportsbook Deli) has really weird hours so it's hard to find a time when it's open. The pool area is okay, but it's definitely not the \"happening\" pool scene that you can find at places like MGM Grand, The Palms, or Hard Rock Hotel. It's more a place you would go to relax for a while than to be seen. My husband loves the sports book, it is apparently the biggest in Vegas, so he likes to go and watch games down there. The casino is good, and you can usually find cheap gambling tables (we play blackjack) earlier in the day and on weeknights. On the negative side, they advertise on their website that they have \"no resort fees\" (which are apparently a mandatory fee between $5-$15 a night), but when you click on the list of hotels that do have resort fees, you notice that the resort fee includes things like free wireless internet, access to the fitness center, etc. At the LV Hilton you have to pay for all of these things, so if you're interested in using the fitness center ($20 a day) or you want wireless internet ($14 a day), you will end up paying a lot more for it than you would at a place that charges a $10/night fee and those things are included.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "albuquerque", "Title": "\u201cdecent stay\u201d", "Author": "princess_on_the_road", "ReviewID": "UR79521512", "Content": "What can I say - it's Las Vegas, tabaco smoke everywhere (barely noticable in the room too) the good: price (not too bad comparing other ones on the strip), location (has the rail station right at front of the hotel - goes to the strip main attractions).

The service was willing enough but not sophisticated - think upscale Olive Garden or Red Robin while the food was very expensive and the steak in particular was no better than adequate.

If this was the upgraded room I'd hate to see the regular room. To add salt to the wounds, there was no soap, the curtain switch didn't work, and the shower leaked. Also, our upgraded room was near the elevator and we were blessed with the elevators humming up and down all night long. They should ask people if they prefer to be near the elevators or not.

The bathroom was big enough and had a fantastic shower with great water pressure. Yes the tiles were pink as some other reviews have said, but they were pale pink, not the barbie pink I was almost expecting, and hardly enough to put you off staying there, it's only the bthroom. The hotel is a little away from all the action of the strip and we found this to our liking. We caught the monorail back and forth to the various hotel and came back to swim and relax. The monorail is reliable, runs frequently and best of all is airconditioned. We ate at the hotel buffet once for breakfast and once for dinner. The food was lovely and there was a good variety for both meals. We also ate in the \"paradise cafe\" one night. The service was a little slower, but the staff here are also somewhat older, but still very friendly. The food was fantastic. The meals were huge, and very cheap. We also used the coffee shop in the foyer to get our morning/evening coffee and tea. The staff there were friendly too. I can highly reccomend the hot sandwiches from here. They were fantastic. We loved the scheme they have rewarding you with a $10 voucher to use in any food and beverage outlet at the hotel if you declined to have your room cleaned.

(Only 1 issue was a little dirty grout in the corner, I'm not picky and this didnt bother me). My first night I had a subpar room but I checked in late and the Star Trek convention was in town.

Breakfast buffet had nice selection and very good omelettes. The hotel really shines however in the staff, especially security guard Wayne. He made our stay terrific. Saw us playing the .25 cent Elvis machines and continued to take us on a behind the scenes tour of where Elvis played and told us some great stories. Wayne is an asset to the Las Vegas Hilton and really gave the hotel a personal touch. Thanks again Wayne we'll see you next time when we visit Vegas.

Firstly the check-in line was long (even when we went past after midnight people would often be lined up for up to 10 minutes) and watching the staff interact with other customers was terrible - there was eye rolling, plenty of huffing and puffing, repeating things like you would to a child, etc. SO RUDE! Service over the phone was just as bad if not worse. No one went out of their way to be helpful, and if you asked for help or reported a problem they were very dismissive. After recounting our stories to other people at the convention they all had similar stories and many had long ago refused to stay at the Las Vegas Hilton again (the convention has actually been moved away from the Hilton next year to everyones relief). Also be careful with rates as I was charged $75 more than originally quoted and this had already been taken off my credit card before I had even arrived! Plus you get NOTHING included in your room rate and everything is extra (even the safe!!!) - no free breakfast or internet here - despite the high room rate. We upgraded to a \"Superior room with Strip view\" and were pleased with the room itself, although if it was \"Superior\" then I dread to think how basic their normal rooms are (this is one of the most expensive hotels I have ever stayed in and I was disapointed to find it was more basic than the mid-priced motels I stay at here in NZ!!!). The beds were incredibly comfortable though and the room was quiet which allowed us to get a good nights sleep which I guess was the main thing. Also the curtains blocked out 100% of the sunlight which is a must when living the nocturnal Vegas lifestyle! There were maintenance issues though with the toilet (although this was fixed quickly) and the TV internet system did not work and this was not rectified despite frequest requests (oh well we saved ourselves the ridiculous $14 a day fee). The view was very pretty but you couldn't see anything of the main features of the strip. This was my first time in Vegas so it was worth the extra money but next time the view won't factor in to my choice of hotel. We ate quite a bit at the hotel and really really enjoyed both the buffet and the Benihana restaurant. There were also small cafes and a Pizza Hut which were handy for food on the run. Overall I thought there was a good selection of restaurants and shops. And when you ran out of things to do there the monorail was very handy for getting to the strip hotels.

I stay here once a year for a conference, and the service was bad enough that I may stay elsewhere next year. The check-in line took nearly an hour, and once I did check in there was some pressure to upgrade my room. I was adamant and said no, I just need a nice quite room, I'll not be spending much time in it. The room they assigned to me was 1900. Beware if your room ends in 00! 1900 was adjacent to the elevators! It was so loud in the room that I called to ask for a room switch and I could hardly hear the clerk on the phone over the mechanical elevator noise. The clerk told me they didn't have a single room in my price category except a handicapped room. Fine. Anything is better than the elevator room. The kicker is that I had to schlep all of my stuff back down to the lobby and wait in another line for 25 minutes just to get the new key! (This time I got to wait in the VIP line, which was slightly shorter, but far too long considering the aggravation I had been through.) I've been in a similar situation at a couple of other hotels that were running short on certain rooms types and both other times I was upgraded to a slightly better room for the inconvenience I had been put through. At LV Hilton, no upgrade, no apology, just another line. The real kicker was that I had an hour off from my conference that I was using to check in, and I ended up being late and missing an important session. I explained that I was in a hurry to the clerk on the phone and asked if I could switch rooms later, but I was told, no, I couldn't leave my bag in the room and switch later. Suffice it to say, I did not feel values. I felt like one of a heard of cattle being chuffed in-and-out to keep hotel volume up. The Hilton staff gives lip-service to the hospitality ideal, but they fall short of it when you actually need them to help. I expressed my disappointment to two desk clerks and both spoke calmly but had a look in their eyes that said \"what the heck do you want me to do about it can you see that this place is an overbooked zoo?\" I honestly felt a little sorry for them. Most hotels go out of their way to make you happy because each individual guest matters. At LV Hilton is seems like more of a numbers game, and then can afford to treat some customers poorly. It could have been my timing, but there were also some really obnoxious intoxicated guests in the elevators. A few girls were antagonizing a woman who was alone in the elevator. It didn't get too bad, but I've never witnessed that at another Vegas Strip hotel and it left an impression about the changing clientele of the LV Hilton. I might also add not only must you pay for wi-fi, but the use of the in-room safe was an extra $3.50 (but nobody told me (no sign either) that until I had already used the in-room safe.) I considered fighting the charge, but it wasn't worth my time to wait in another line.

The next morning we waited in line to ask for a new room and they said we would have the same style room but it wouldn't be ready until later in the day. When we came back from shopping at 4pm we got in line again to get our keys. Another less than warm welcome from the front desk. We went up to the our new room and found that it was smaller, the mirror in the bath was hanging off the wall and the ceiling vent was dirty and falling down. I called downstairs to explain the issue and I was told that they didn't have the larger room available and they would send up new keys for the room we would move to. We moved into our 3rd room and it was fine. However the next day the toilet backed up and it took them over 2 hours to respond to our call. It was the maid service that finally was able to get someone up to fix it. HOWEVER-- In fairness we had two other families traveling with us and neither of them had any problems with their rooms. The floor above ours was being renovated. I was advised they do not guarantee satisfaction. That is only available from the Hampton Inn. I guess we just had some bad luck. Otherwise the casino was nice, the rest of the hotel appeared clean, the publice restrooms were spotless and the buffet breakfast was really good. The line for the buffet was at times very long, but if you are an Honors member you get a shorter line. Food was good, hot, with plenty of variety. We had coupons so it was free. We picked this Hilton property because of the fact that it has the monorail stopping at the hotel. Be prepared to walk far everytime you use the monorail. It is always in the back of the hotels at each stop and you have to walk through mazes to find the entrance. If you don't want to drive or pay for cabs it is available as an alternavie and It is clean and not crowded. I was disappointed in the response to our room issues by the front desk staff. They have 3,000 rooms and they responded as if it is a normal occurance to have to move as often as we did.

Imagine walking down the hall hearing all this tramping of kids wearing the same jersey's and athletic shoes with duffel bags slung around their shoulders. It was taking place at the convention center next door. Lucky me. Had never stayed at the Hilton and the rates were good. I had visited once to see the Star Trek experience. It's mostly gone now. Quark's bar is still there. A lot of Star Trek decorations still there. The rooms were very nice, clean and large. Had a view of the Stratosphere and downtown Vegas. Didn't know what the buildings were until I saw the Plaza lit up. Only saw something dangling off the Stratosphere once. Too hot for jumping. I like the no bedspread look. The bed was comfortable. The walls were a little thin. I could hear those big kids having fun running down the hall enjoying the echos. The buffet was very crowded with families. There were no coupons for buffets. I did get in on the green choice, not to have the room made up every day gets you a $10 coupon for food anywhere on the property. I don't need the maid to make up the bed and change the towels every day. I had half-price buffets. I found the food everywhere to be very expensive. I also thought the Hilton was smaller than I thought it was. I guess I thought the convention area was part of the hotel. I have a car so driving wasn't bad if you take Paradise and other back roads to the strip. I took the monorail once, which has lower prices then a few years ago. Still not very handy as it is far from the hotels in the heat. Parking once you figure out where you are was good. The pool is very nice on the thrid floor. Went to the Friday pool party and it was gridlock to get down to the rooms. I do like to look around so I remembered another elevator the pool crowd didn't know about a few more steps down the hall. No waiting. Saw Love. It was so good. Sort of put my mind on vacation for a while down memory lane. Just two rows above the special effect. I would see that again. The Revolution bar was packed after that. It looked funny seeing people sitting in the Revolution letters like a commercial for the show. Saw Aria, very nice, and Chrystals mall. Another expensive shopping center with tourist milling around looking at it and no one in the stores or restaurants. How long will the mall attached to Casino's last. I guess I'm not a high roller.

The room itself was nice. We paid for an upgraded room and I was pleased with it. We also had a nice view from our room. The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was nice. The towels, however were not very soft and the shower head was extremely low and sprayed really hard. We were given the option of not having our sheets and towels changed for a day, and it return were given $10 to spend in the hotel. I liked the idea, so we did that. I thought they would at least come in and make the bed and clean up, they did not. We got no service at all. The $10 credit originally said it could be used in any food venue or shop, but it turned out to only be good for food and drink. We also were given a free breakfast with our reservation, but the line for the buffet at breakfast was outrageous! We skipped it on the first day because we didn't feel like waiting.

It would have been nice to be given instructions on how to redeem the free breakfast though because there was a cashier at he front charging $18.99 per person and we certainly weren't going to pay that.

We were traveling with young children, it was 100+ outside, the kids knew the hotel had a pool and were really looking forward to a swim -- but disappointment again! The pool was a 21 and over party every evening -- no kids allowed. And it closes at 8 PM (standard for hotels on the strip, I'm told -- great for getting adults into the casinos ... but for kids?) As for the cigarette smoke, our whole family was hacking by the time we left. This facility makes no effort whatsoever to separate smoking areas for the comfort of their guests. Apparently they also have no concern for the health of children. Their staff told me that their hotel was \"focusing more and more on adult guests,\" but yet they were a host hotel for several youth sporting events during our stay. Most hotels seem to care if your stay doesn't meet your expectations. This one just didn't. Their website should carry a \"NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN\" warning. Unless, of course, you prefer for your kids to swim in cigarette smoke rather than pools. I'll never stay here again. If you're traveling with a family, I recommend you stay on the outskirts of Vegas and venture onto the strip on your own terms, rather than immersing yourself in it 24/7.

I really didn't mind the location since it was on the monorail. One thing I ahte about hotel checks in for LV is typically there are long lines. If you are a diamond member of HHonors you can use the VIP lounge to check in off to the left. There was no waiting at all. You also get the breakfast buffet as your breakfast which is great and the really nice thing is you can use the VIP line so not waiting if you are a diamond. . You can also use the VIP as a diamond for the one cafe, even if you never have spent a penny gambling in the hotel. Was also nice having the two free (and very large) bottles of water. One other nice thing for HHonors members is that you can chose free internet for your my way for that hotel. I was told all diamond and golds get complimentary breakfast regardless of the my way benefit (even though I got an upgrade). I only gambled at their casino one day and the blackjack dealer did have an attitude and the casino is dated, but the ladies who do drinks were great about coming around freqnuenlty and they are generous with the alcohol.

Don't get me wrong he is still a nice guy. With the silver or above in the Hilton Hornors and enough gaming history would get you in the better room than you reserved every time.

We came home early from the Strip to put our kids to bed.

There are just a few networks, sports and news channels. I understand that they don't want you spending a lot of time in your room, but this was a disappointment for us. The complimentary self parking is far away. We had to walk to the far end of the large hotel and then even farther to get to the lot.

You could go to the Business Center and use their computers at 80 cents a minute (all plus tax), and $1 a page to print out in b/w. I just find those rates the biggest greediest rip-off ever. I have stayed at less expensive hotels and gotten wifi for free with the room. The info book in the room did not have a layout (drawing/map) of the hotel main floor.

Before we went there I was kind of worried about our decision of staying at LV Hilton after reading all the mixed reviews. Boy, we were so glad we stayed there. We had a great time and everything was just wonderful. We booked a resort club room, I'd definitely recommend to stay at their resort club rooms. We got to go to express check in line and they upgraded our room because other rooms were not ready yet. The lounge on the 24th floor had breakfast, snack and drinks, even beer and wine. Our room was the size of their Grand Room, very spacious and clean. I really need to say something about the bed in our room, it was so comfortable, amazingly comfortable. Our room was on the 26th floor of North Tower and the view was absolutely gorgeous. We could see Wynn and Encore from our room. The only thing I was not completely satisfied about is the bathroom, it was pretty small but with all the upgrades. We had plumbing issue the first night we stayed there. We called the front desk and they sent someone to fix it in 15 minutes, very satisfied about their prompt response. We stayed there for 4 days and we tried almost everything there. We went to the swimming pool, had spa and massage, got my hair done at the salon, tried four restaurants and also gambled at the casino. The swimming pool was smaller than I expected, I wished it could be bigger, especially for a such big hotel. We went to TJ's Steakhouse for dinner one night, the steak and lobster were really good, too bad we had to catch a show and couldn't stay longer to enjoy our meal. Talking about location, LV Hilton is not on the strip but Monorail stops right in front of it. It takes about 5 minutes to get to the strip. What can be more convenient than that? We were lucky to stay in North Tower, It's the closest tower to parking garage and monorail station. We loved our stay there, everything exceeded our expectation. Besides swimming pool and bathroom, I really could not think of anything to complain about. Most of our guests stayed there with us. We went to some of their rooms and here are my conclusions: LV Hilton is an old hotel and their classic rooms are not fully upgraded, one of our guests had a room with pink bathroom. Everything in that bathroom is pink, I'm not joking! It's also not worth it to book their suites if you don't plan to stay with bunch of people in the same room. One of our guests booked a East Tower suite, and it turned out it's just two rooms right next to each other, not one bedroom with a living room.

For the price? It was an amazing deal; 2 days on a holiday weekend less than $200. $194 to be exact and if you are Gold or higher HH member, you will get free breakfast (2 tickets) for their buffet. The rooms were clean and fairly big, but the beds were not queens, they were true double beds, so 2 people per bed made for not such a good night's sleep. The suitcase stand was broken! The hotel is big, huge actually, so there's a lot of walking from garage to your rooms, depending on which tower you are in. The other consideration is location. Normally we stay on the strip, but no matter how nice a hotel may be, I refused to pay over $180 in Las Vegas and that is already pushing it. The Hilton is far from the strip and you either should rent a car to get around or you can take the monorail, which is a big rip-off; $5 dollars a ride. However, it is much cheaper than a taxi. Overall, the hotel worked for our group, we were all happy and being away from the strip had its perks, it was less crowded. The casino was not too crowded either and the drinks kept coming, even if you play the nickel slots. Big plus for me, as I am not a gambler. The buffet was decent and for being free, I can't really complain. Those who stay over the weekend, should know that the HH buffet ticket includes free cheap champagne and free beer (I know!). Anyhow, good choice for us and probably a good option for families too.

Lets break it down step by step. #1, the desk staff was almost inhumane. No personality and really not very helpful about anything. Ask the same question to ten people and get ten different answers. I would like to add I'm a gold honors member and can firmly say this is the worst Hilton I have stayed in, by far. I stayed on the 8th floor of the main tower. The rooms were very out dated. Very old tub, no fridge, no coffee pot, and the internet is another story. It cost $13.99 a day to use their internet. I was there on business and I'm a professional that has to have access so internet. This is the FIRST TIME I paid for internet service PERIOD! The bed was just ok, but the worst I have had in a Hilton. Also, the location is a long long did I say long way from everything. Nothing was within walking distance except a convenient store. Your options for transportation was, have your own car, taxi, which were very expensive, bus which took forever to get places, and the monorail is $14 dollars a day and a long walk to everything. There were several little restaurants in the hotel, but many were only open at night, so it left only a couple restaurants with limited menus as choices. NO FREE MOVIE CHANNEL! Very few channels on tv almost all were news channels, if you want to watch a movie, just like internet, YOU PAY! Things were very expensive. Just think of a ridiculous price than double it, that is how much everything cost. I was going to go to Studio 54 until I found out their cover charge was$10 for women, $25 for men, and $25 for both on the weekend. Not only is that sexist that is crazy! Penny slots were 25 cents. Yeah no kidding the slot machine say 1 cent, but you have to make a 25 line bet. We call those quarter slots back in New Orleans because it cost a quarter. In the conference of some 400 people there were a lot of grumblings, many I have mentioned. My suggestion is if your planning on going to Las Vegas go to New Orleans instead. It is far cheaper, better food, more things to do and the people are much more friendly.

I booked my room 2 months in advance...then to make sure everything was going to be correct on my reservations i called 2 days before we got there and i was assured that i would have my King size room and it would be a strip view... HAAA so when i go to check in they tell me \"here is your double bed room\" I was like ehhhh no its suppose to be a king \"oh we are sorry we dont have any king rooms call back down here in the morning and we will get you switched over to your king\" Ok no problem i'll just do that. So we go up to the 27th floor open the door and.......no strip view im overlooking a golf course. So we take our bags back down to the front desk-this time im talking to a different person i tell him the whole situation about me switching rooms in the morning to my king room and i ask him can i at least get a room with a strip view??? He's tells me with a goofy grin on his his face \"sure you can but theres only one problem we're not on the strip\" YES i know this BUT your rooms say strip view rooms, so can i get one of them? \"Ohhh yea we'll switch you over\" thanks buddy let me get those keys so i can be on my way. Once we get to the room with the strip view we open the door and i feel like im staying at a Holiday Inn, not that there is anything wrong with a holiday inn but i paid for a hilton. So after a long night of drinking we get up the next morning and i call the front desk to get my king room and they tell me none are clean yet call back in a couple hours, so in a couple hours i dont call i go down there in person to get my room. I talk to the lady behind the counter and she says let me get u a supervisor...the supervisor comes out and says we are not going to have any king size rooms for you during your WEEK stay due to the volcano erupting overseas. Lol your joking right??? I mean im sure there are alot of people here from overseas but its a lil hard to believe there are no king size rooms in this whole hotel for a week. So after he pretty much just says it is what it is i dont get offered a comp of any kind, a upgrade, a nothing but a blank stare and we are sorry.

The property has evolved from a hotel to a resort and the public areas are well maintained and elegantly designed. However, there is serious room for improvement regarding service and hospitality issues. Our visit began with a very long line at check in...there is a rope line not unlike rope lines at airports....a long, sleek check in counter with 15 or 20 stations...roughly a quarter of them staffed. Consequently, long lines and many minutes waiting with luggage. On a hopeful note, when it was finally our turn, we were offered a 'free upgrade' to a bigger room. What a surprise. When we entered our room, it was obvious that the room was already occupied..lights on, fan running, used towels on the counter, bed linens rumpled. I immediately called the desk and after many minutes waiting on hold, a 'manager' came aboard and instructed us to go up to another floor, and wait for security to escort us to a different room. Apparently, the first room was indeed registered to another guest but fortunately for all of us, the registered guest was not present when we barged in...nonetheless, it was an unsettling experience. Security escorted us to another room, unlocked the door with a house key and instructed us to return to the desk for new key cards...so after dropping off our luggage, we returned to the front desk...and the rope line. Our room was a very large king...dressing room, wardrobe mirrors, sitting area, large bathroom with an oversized tub, beautiful view from the twentysomething floor looking across to the strip. On a closer look, the bathroom is aging, lots of damaged tile and missing grout around the tub, mildew odors, stained shower curtain, banged up woodwork, black lacquer vanity that's scratched and aging, black granite counter top with spotty, discolored areas from water damage...a too small leaky faucet, soggy soap and no soap dish. Lovely make up mirror is a nice touch, however very dim lighting; the entire room had very dim lights. Bottled water for sale in the room, no coffee or tea. The furniture in the room consisted of painted black wood, squared off plain and functional design...a bit scratched and unpolished, not a bit dressy. $13.95 per day for internet connection. The bed was comfy, the linens very nice. After a day of travel, and hours of Las Vegas nightlife, we settled in...listening to the constant whir of the elevators all night long, and awakened every early in the morning by housekeepers slam banging carts and doors in the hallway, and shouting at one another in a high pitched frenzy...all of which echoed and bounced through our room. We finally gave up trying to sleep, and headed downstairs to the Paradise Cafe on the main floor for breakfast. The restaurant was somewhat busy, but there were plenty of empty tables and booths...many them dirty. We were the only guests waiting to be seated, and the hostess asked us to wait a moment longer so that a table could be cleared. Obviously, they were a bit short staffed. After we were seated, the hostess informed us our server would be with us shortly. We waited, and waited, and waited....after waiting 20 minutes for someone to offer to take our order, we finally left the cafe and headed off to an off site restaurant for a bite to eat... So...our stay the Las Vegas Hilton was a series of poor service mishaps...one after another. This a busy, impersonal hotel...clearly shuffling through as many quests as possible with minimal attention to personal service. On the other hand, the main casino is spacious and pleasant...one gentleman dealer chatted with me for many minutes, sharing memories of Elvis and stories of long ago. The crystal chandeliers are very showy, the orchids in the lobby are stunning, the pool area is upscale, well designed and sunny, but...with so many other resort and hotel choices available in Las Vegas offering impeccable hospitality with attention to fine details, there is no reason for us to choose the Hilton ever again.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rolling prairie, indiana", "Title": "\u201cWish we could have stayed longer!\u201d", "Author": "amrstack", "ReviewID": "UR60865767", "Content": "We stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton for one night (flew in a day early and our other hotel was booked that night.)

The upgrade cost was like $20 a day which all four of us thought was more than reasonable for the cost (i'm pretty sure we drank more than $20 in beverages each day alone). The food at both the cafe and buffet were better than expected. The cafe might be a little pricier than back home, but certainly not out of line compared to other places in town and surprisingly good and ample portions. The dinner buffet was decent, not high-end but not low end. For less than $20 each, we found it just fine. Rather than hitting someplace on the strip or elsewhere for ribs, we did it at the buffet, definitely for less. Overall, the property is not perfect and some details are overlooked (could you maybe fix the elevator button plates in the lobby of the north tower as that is what many people's first impression is going to be?). However, nothing of significance bothered us for five days. The weather was great so the pool area was used much and was just fine. Staff was friendly, service was decent. If you want a first-class experience, LVH is probably not what you are looking for. But if you are seeking a nice property for a decent price, plenty of amenities and a bit quieter experience than the hustle and bustle of the strip yet near enough to it, we highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salinas, California", "Title": "\u201cConvenient to the stip via Monorail\u201d", "Author": "Petalpalz", "ReviewID": "UR59165440", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference in this hotel.

I loved the monorail access and bought a 3 day pass for my stay. My only problem was I didn't realize the monorail closed sometime during the wee hours and I had to walk back to the Hotel. It was scarey and dark and there were loonies everywhere on the way to the hotel. A taxi driver quoted me $20 for a 2 mile ride which I thought was ridiculous.

In fact, if there is a Champion Busboy award, that guy would win it. Still, there were a few problems with the place: 1. When I first stepped into the bathroom of the room, I found urine in the toilet. Not the worst problem in the world, and certainly one that went away with a quick flush, but still kind of gross. Makes me wonder what the staff does and doesn't do to prepare a room for new guests. 2. It took about 10 minutes for the shower to warm up, even given that it was mid-afternoon (and thus not a busy time of day) when I used it. The water got tolerably cool (as opposed to very cold) after a couple of minutes, but it was only as I was finishing that the hot water really kicked in. 3.

Sure, I'm probably in their prime demographic, but I've never had particularly good experiences there and find most everything about it annoying. BUT, I was passing through on a larger roadtrip and it just made sense to get a room for the night. I wasn't picky about where it was, but I wanted a decent neighborhood that would allow me to walk to things and I wanted a cheap room. What else is there for that in Vegas but the Strip? I was surprised to find a 3* on the Strip on Travelocity's relatively new blind booking system for $34. This turned out to be the Hilton. For a Saturday night near the Strip (or almost anywhere in Vegas), $34 is a steal, I think. Easy to find? How could you miss this hotel with its giant \"H\". That \"H\" out front sort of defines \"ginormous.\" There was only one entrance, which was nice, as the elaborate layouts of some Vegas hotels can be confusing. Self-parking was at the back and required a drive through the valet area, which I expected. You can actually access it a lot easier on the street running behind the hotel. The parking garage was, of course, all the way on the other side of the hotel complex from the front desk. Again, I expect this only because I've stayed in these hotels enough to know how they work. A long walk through the casino and shopping complex led me to a line. There was the VIP line, the Hilton Vacations line and the regular Joe/you're not paying enough to be here line. It took maybe 5 minutes to get to a desk clerk and there, my reservations was not found. I looked up the confirmation on my phone and read off the number. The clerk placed a call and I was checked in. This was Travelocity's fault, as they had, I guess, not sent the reservation. I was given the choice of room type and smoking or non-smoking. I was also offered an \"upgrade\" to a \"refurbished\" room. No thanks, I'll stick with my excessively cheap room. Room was on the 14th floor on the southwest side of the hotel. I had a view of the Sahara, Stratosphere and the start of the Strip. The room included a flat-screen TV, desk, king bed, alarm clock, and a small closet. There was wired and wireless internet available but, of course, there was an excessive fee ($13 per 24 hours). But, again, I expected this. Now, I think where this room noticeably separated itself from the \"refurbished\" rooms (although I didn't see those) was the bathroom. It had pink tiles circa early 80's. The tub and shower were obviously fairly old, with rust on the tub drain, and the other fixtures were definitely dated as well. I've seen this in other hotels but, where this one came out ahead was the fact that this horrible tile and generally array of bathroom oldness was spotlessly clean. How they kept those tiles so clean for that many years is, I'm sure, a little bit of a secret, but I'd like to know. The bed was very comfortable. Even though I wasn't by the elevators, I could constantly hear some sort of motor that sounded a lot like that of an elevator behind my bed. I don't know what it was, but it was a little bit annoying. I still slept well though. In spite of my dislike for the Strip, I did walk down there at night, mainly in search of food, which is always excessively expensive in that area. If I were female and unaccompanied, I would have been a little worried about that walk. There are few people and it isn't terribly well-lit. It's also a good ten minutes from the front doors of the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd. I made it down to about Bally's and just took the monorail back. For a public transit option, it's definitely a bit of a rip-off, but it was convenient, especially considering that the Hilton has a station right out in front of it. For what I paid, I would say \"exceptional.\" Overall though, I've seen a lot of better 3*'s out there.

After being directed to my elevators I proceed up to the 3rd floor, which is the only floor the Lanai Suite is located on. As I open my room I am pleasantly suprised, the room is big and has very high cielings, a lower level sitting area and a slider to the roof top patio and private cabana with furniture. The room does not come w/ a fridge however I called down to the front desk and they had one brought right up within 20 minutes. The bathroom was very nice nothing super special. Drawbacks to room were the 2 1/2\" gap under the door that connects the hotel room next door, after shoving a towel under it all was good. After settling in I decided to go check out the resort club on the 24th floor and see what they had to eat, after knocking on the door because front desk agent never gave me a gold key to enter, the attendant then allows me to enter only to then call down to front desk to figure out if I was allowed to be in there or not, well after almost 5 minutes she gets it figured out and I am allowed to eat the free fruit and cookies they have out, along with free beer and wine, no mixed drinks or hot snacks like the Hyatt Regency Clubs do, which really disapointed me since that was the level I expected from Hilton. After leaving the Resort Club room I went down to front desk to get proper gold color key card so as not to indure the embarassment I went through earlier trying to access the Resort Club room, I get the key and all is good no lines only took about 5 minutes for her to verify on the computer, quite a little bit to long if you ask me but who knows. Next day I go to resort club food is the same cookies and fruit no hot apps. at all nothing fancy just a bunch of cookies come on, grab a couple of free cokes and go back to room. Hotel will give a free $5 food voucher if you dont want them to clean your room each day, its there way of being green they say, so I recieved 3 $5 vouchers for declining housekeeping and was able to goto the buffet for free basically, this was a great program and hope more hotels will offer it. All in all I really enjoyed my stay here, the resort club food was what it was and who cares cause it was part of the package but if they try to sell it to you at the desk as an upgrade dont go for it, its not worth it.

I picked this hotel because we'd been on the Strip for the \"real\" 4 nights of our getaway and they'd taken enough of our money, and because I've got Gold status with Hilton and trying to maintain it into next year. The lobby is spotless, very busy and full of people and a little confusing but once you've gotten your bearings, it's actually quite easy to navigate, even on the gaming floor, which is uncommon in many resorts and hotels out here. We had an early check-in and were given an option of waiting for a room, a ready room that didn't have our bed preference, or one with the bed preference that was ready but near an elevator. We took the near-the-elevator room and probably will not do that again. The elevator runs constantly and unlike other hotels where you might hear a ding now and then or people talking, you actually hear the whirring of the elevator up and down the elevator shaft. We did not complain about it because we agreed to this room, we're tired, and we can live with it but if we'd stayed another night, we would have to be moved. It is quite noisy and it's constant. If you are given a room near an elevator, think twice before accepting it. The room itself is very comfortable with nice decor, deep reds and golds, and we had a phenomenal view over the mountains. Lovely at sunrise. The room is spacious and very clean. Bed is comfortable but bedding is strange; seems like there are too many flat sheets on here, and they wrinkle easily. So while the bed is comfortable, the bedding makes it a little uncomfortable. Having a small fridge in the room is a nice touch. The bathtub is more round than a normal bathtub so one person can have a nice soak; the bathmat gives a dated, faded appearance and should be replaced or left out entirely. Hallway noise travels very easily to your room so our Superbowl night was interesting to say the least. But any Vegas hotel is going to have hallway noise and in all honesty this bed is far more comfortable than the one at Monte Carlo. Service in the casino was better than at the strip hotels; lots of cocktail waitresses and they actually wait on you, instead of having social hour with eachother like the ladies at the Mirage. There are plenty of table games and the sports book is massive but the slots are a litle dated, like they get the second pick after MGM has taken all the new and flashy ones. The restaurants--- we enjoyed the steakhouse (the creamed spinach is amazing) but were very disappointed that about half of the restaurants were closed on Sundays and Mondays--- the only nights we were here--- so plan accordingly. The buffet has fewer choices than some of the strip hotels but does all of those items very well so I like it better than others; who really cares if there's chinese food and pizza for breakfast if the pancakes are cold and rubbery? The food on their breakfast buffet at the Hilton is fresh and well-stocked, also seems to be cooked in smaller batches so it's always fresh. Nice pancakes :) Overall, we'd probably stay here again; it's not a bad hotel and definitely a great price plus we won a fair amount in the keno bar.

Since this older property Hilton is away from much of the action, we bought a 3-day monorail pass and headed to the strip numerous times. It is very convenient, fast and safe. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants this time because there are so many other options at other hotels. Our only complaint is that the casino is very smoky and not as trendy as some of the other hotels...but we are not gamblers and we only walked through the casino on our way to the conference center. We were contiually impressed by the the responsiveness and friendliness of the hotel staff. Checkout was fast and efficient at the end of our 4-day stay. We paid a conference rate of $89. a night for the room and felt it was a good value for an outstanding room and service.

This hotel should not have the Hilton name on it at all; it does not even come close to the standard you expect from that chain. The whole hotel is heavily worn and dirty, and next to even the downtown properties, looks like it has seen far better days. Non-smoking rooms are a joke, thanks to the highly interconnected ventilation system. Hot water is a sometimes treat, luke warm is about the most you can count on. The bed is uncomfortably soft, and the pillows all need to be replaced. When we asked for four firmer / non-feather pillows, we got one foam pillow about an inch thick and another sad bag of feathers. Housekeeping is very inconsistent, every day we've been missing lotion or wash cloths or something. No coffee / tea in the rooms, no mini-bar, and no premium TV channels (though that's probably common in Vegas) on the 42\" TV. As for the rest of the property, the casinos are mostly empty all the time, which is not a good thing in Vegas. The front desk is ALWAYS (like at 12:30 a.m. last night) about 30 people deep; they just don't staff for good service. For some reason, we've also seen dozens of couples / families sitting in the lobby with all their luggage and bags for hours. No idea what this is about, but between them, the stroller traffic and the little kids playing tag, this feels a lot more like Disney than it should. Lastly, there's the location. Yes, it's on the monorail, but that is a) expensive and b) only stops in 7 places. If you want to go anywhere except the actual hotels on the stops, you are walking. A lot. This is also a good half mile away from the Deuce, which moves at a snails pace down the strip, runs far less often than advertised, and is often too full to board. If you have 3 or more in your party, stick with taxis, the price will be comparable and your feet will thank you. Next time, we'll look at staying at some of the Downtown properties.

The casino in the hotel is quite small compared with others and we did find that it was not very loose with the winnings, having better luck in The Mirage and others on the strip. All in all after reading some of the reviews we were quite happy with our stay, but would prefer to stay on the strip as it is more convenient to get around at night.

The amentias in the room were very modern, nice new desk, chairs and dresser which held the large flat screen TV. The bathroom, while clean, has this salmon colored tile on the walls and floors and there was some rust on the tub/shower. The only way to keep the shower from dripping constantly was to put a lot of pressure on the single knob that controlled the water flow. The carpet was atrocious with an orange colored stain in the middle that was so large that I went down to the front desk to let them know it wasn't me. The front desk offered to move us to another room, but it was not that big of a deal. The king bed had plenty of pillows and was comfy. When I finally did decide to get to bed I quickly learned that the water pipes from the other rooms around ours were loud and squeaked harsh tones when someone flushed the toilet or took a shower. In the morning I had the opportunity to use the spa/workout facilities. The workout room had 5 treadmills 2 elliptical and 4 bikes. However 3 of these machines were out of order. There was also a set of weightlifting machines and dumbbells to use. Fresh fruit was available for guests of the Spa for no charge. Food/coffee is expensive on property. My wife paid $6USD for a large coffee in the morning. I opted to walk across the street to the AM/PM mini market for my soda fix. Checkout left a lot to be desired - the front desk person I dealt with was downright rude. While this hotel is not on the strip it\u2019s not a big deal for me.

If you are twenty-something, you may find the nightlife better at Planet Hollywood or MGM as these properties tend to have a younger crowd. The music is not blaring loud in the casino, which is a plus to me. As a slot player, the comps here (4 nights comped rooms including weekends) for moderate play are the best on the Strip. The slots are a bit looser too. Perhaps I am not as picky as others, but I have never had a bad stay here. Last time I checked-in my room was not ready & I had to wait an hour at 10pm, but they were apologetic & gave me 2 free buffets (even though my room was comped). I think I only came across one rude employee over the last 10 years. The Paradise Cafe is basic affordable food available 24 hrs which is nice option. The buffet is just average, but fine (Bellagio is my favorite). I thought the room service was good, though not exceptional. I never use hotel pools, so I can't comment.

The cafe is good, it has a place for coffee, a couple of casual places to eat an an essentials shop that keeps late hours which is a good thing. It doesn't really have any major attractions, and isn't going to keep you busy and walking around looking at shops like many of the hotels on the strip, but it's a good place to stay if you'd rather spend your money on gambling than you would a room on the strip. The casino is significantly improved compared to what it was back in 2005. It's larger, has more table games and more slots to play than it did. In 2005, they were remodeling when I was there, and it was nice to see they did a good job. Service-wise, everyone I encountered was courteous and friendly, and that is a welcomed change in light of the bad experiences with customer service I've encountered at Atlantic City lately. The only potential down side I can see was the parking situation. The parking lot and garage is quite a hike from the hotel rooms, so if you rent a car be prepared to do some extra walking in addition to the walking you'll do around other places. Overall I'd say that if you're looking for a reasonably priced, decent hotel to rest your head in between seeing all the sites and places Vegas and the vacinity has to offer, then Las Vegas Hilton is a bargain and well worth the stay. If you're looking for one place in Vegas to stay, play and spend all your time in, then it's not the place for you as you'd be better off at a place on the strip such as MGM Grand or Mirage, where you can do all your gambling shopping and dining in one place.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bracknell", "Title": "\u201cGOOD LOCATION.....\u201d", "Author": "sherbertal", "ReviewID": "UR48488347", "Content": "Our rooms were not well cleaned during our stay.

We got a conference rate of $69 a night for one of the \"renovated\" rooms, which was a good value.

The front desk person was friendly and efficient. I have no complaints about our room. It was clean and updated as promised. Large flat screen TV, marble accented bathroom and comfortable beds. I had read ahead of time that there was no in-room coffee maker (pretty common at large Vegas properties), so I brought my own. We had a view of the golf course. For the rate we paid, I wasn't expecting a strip view. No major noise issues. For people looking for a hotel in the \"middle of the action\", this is probably not the place for you. But if you're looking for a quieter off-strip location with easy access to the strip (via the monorail) the Hilton is a good bet. Some people say the casino was \"boring\", but I actually enjoyed the fact that it was not overly crowded and you could usually play whatever you wanted to play. We did pretty well on the Star Trek machines (so well that they actually broke down on us, twice!) but the slot tech working that night was very friendly and patient. If you want to go downtown from the Hilton, I recommend taking a cab. Getting there wasn't too bad...we walked down to the Sahara bus stop and took the city bus to Freemont street without many issues. Be warned that the Deuce (double decker bus that runs between the strip and downtown) does NOT go by the Hilton. To catch \"our\" bus back, we found out we had to walk to the downtown bus terminal, which at 1:00 in the morning was quite scary for two females! Lunch choices were limited as we didn't have enough time to leave the Hilton during the conference. There's an \"express\" pizza hut, a deli near the pool and the sandwich shop by sports book (actually pretty good and reasonably priced.) We avoided the paradise cafe due to other reviews. We had the buffet one evening (so-so) but were usually out and about at dinnertime. Didn't do any of the \"high end\" on site dinner restaurants, so can't comment. The pool deck was nice, plenty of places to lounge. They have a half priced happy hour which we took advantage of once. The pool itself was a little smaller than it looked in the pictures, but still a nice place to relax. So why only the 3 star rating? Costumer service issue #1: 5:00 in the morning on our first night our phone rings. Neither of us answered it thinking it must have been a wrong number (anyone who wanted to reach us would have called our cell phones). But the light is blinking and there's a message from security. Apparently the previous occupant had left his cell phone charger in our room. REALLY??? You're going to call me at 5:00 in the morning because someone ELSE forgot their stuff in my room? This is MY problem now? Don't get me wrong, I am not opposed to helping someone else out, but I'm pretty sure the charger would have still been there a few hours later at a decent time of day! We couldn't even find it at first (wasted about 10 minutes of OUR time looking for it), but finally did. Called back and told them we would leave it out with a note on it as we had to get going. Came back to the room and it was still there. Another day goes by and it's still there. Finally my co-worker brings it down to the front desk (she is a better person than I am). I let them know I was not happy about being woken up at 5:00 in the morning over a lost cell phone charger. She said \"well, the customer really needed itl.\" Apparently that's why it was left in our room for 2 more days? She was nice enough, but we really weren't offered an apology or \"freebies\" for our inconveneience.

Little did we know that it was a fight weekend and hotels on the strip were ridiculously expensive(especially in this economy). Although I was hesitant about staying off the strip, with a AAA discount we would be getting the room for $65/night and it seemed like a deal we did not want to pass up. Since we were going with another couple we booked two of the \"updated rooms\" for Friday and Saturday (and stayed at Treasure Island on Thursday). I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the rooms. Because so many reviews on here were bad I was not expecting much. The rooms were clean, with new furnishings and they looked modern. So yea, the bathtub was chipped, whats the big deal?! I dont understand why people complain so much on these reviews; people really just need to relax. I felt that for $65, it would really have to be pretty terrible for me to complain. I have stayed at plenty of \"higher class\" hotels on the strip including Mirage, THEhotel and the Venetian. I think that when you book a room at the Hilton you have to keep in mind that you are not going to get the luxury of those types of hotels; nonetheless we were all satisfied with our stay. Yes, we did have a couple problems checking in (wrong beds, then rooms in two diff. floors) and it seems they overcharged the credit card, but despite those minor fixable errors I cant really complain. Most of the staff was very kind, except for the staff at the Paradise Cafe who tried to ignore us so they wouldnt have to take our to-go order (it was 20 mins before closing of the restaurant). When we called to inform management of the problem, they apologized and gave us credit to eat at another 24hr spot in the restaurant.. Although I do find it more convenient to stay on the strip since we do enjoy taking advantage of some of the nightlife, the benefit of staying at the Hilton is that you can avoid the Las Vegas Blvd. congestion by taking the back road the hotel is on. We found this to be very convenient, and having driven to las vegas, did not mind the small amount of extra driving we did. If you are on a budget (like we were this time around) or if you simply dont think its worth it to pay the extra money for bigger hotels on the strip then I would really recommend the Hilton.

Check in lines were very long and over an hour wait. Bellman service was poor and unorganized. The food at Paradise Cafe should be avoided. I ordered a taco salad with shredded beef and when it arrived the beef was undercooked. I sent it back and asked for a meatless salad. The waitress was indifferent about it, and actually tried to convince me that the chef said that what I was looking at was a tomato. I mean really! At breakfast another time, we waited nearly 30 minutes for our order to be taken when there were less than 20 people in the place. I had to get up from my seat to go find someone. In another instance, a manager chided an employee within earshot of us. Very unprofessional. The Mexican restaurant has been closed permanently but it doesn't tell you that anywhere. The information books inside the hotel have not been updated since they closed the Star Trek attraction, and Quark's Bar is still listed as an eatery. The ladies in the sundry shop were really friendly to us as we were in there nearly every day to buy something. Internet service is $15 a day for each computer. A real ripoff. But the kicker for me was when we left the Hilton to go to another hotel, I realized I had left my cell phone charger in the room. I called. Got the runaround from security and housekeeping. But no offer to take my number and call me should they find it. So somebody there has gotten a new cell phone charger out of the deal. I will never stay at this hotel again.

Im not sure if it was just the Classic Rooms they offer that were junk but I took pictures and videos of my time at the Classic Room Level. When I arrived at Check in once again I spoke to a front desk manager and she told me that she had no complaints today about any of the rooms and for me to check it out. We went to our room and the curtains were not connected above and the windows on the outside were extremely dirty. I walk in the bathroom and the vanity light was out and only one light was working, and the bathtub was running a stream of consitent water and wouldnt shut off completely. I used my finger to check the cleasiness of the Tub and it was very white chalky on my finger and rough substance. It look like chalk of somesort, The towels were way below Hilton Standard they are old and very rough not even your oldest towels at home are this bad!! You have a flat screen TV in your room and that was very grainy not just a little bit but more so than a regular TV set from before these were invented or used with an Antenna. I reported my findings and the front desk lady diddnt seem happy that I was complaining but from a frequent Hilton Guest this is the worst Hilton I have ever stayed ever! The stay felt like I was in a room in the motel 6 with new tile and oh I forgot the bed and let me tell you this was the worst it had like a sand grain and only 2 small pillows. The bed in this room in the Central Tower room 2248 was so hard they put on a cotton bedding under the sheet but it felt as though I was on just the boxspring not even a mattress. I complained again to another front desk manager about all my findings and showed them the video on my phone and photos and I was given a free buffett for 2 in their restaurant what a compensation. Well after awhile I went downstairs again to complain and spoke to a manager named David and he offered a room change but not until the following day. When I went downstairs again the next morning for the room change the front desk clerk said to me she was going to upgrade me at no charge because she diddnt want me to complain again and keep switiching rooms and she had an attitude about it. The room I was switched to was on the North Tower room 23108 this room was what I am used to from the hilton the bed was a comfortable and thick mattress without the boxspring feel to it. In the upgraded room the TV still had poor quality for a flat screen LG Television but there was a water crack in the top of the celing. So If I was you choose another hotel for this one was the pitts unless your going to pay for upgraded rooms at a much higher price when you can get another hotel for the less price and better quality. I did stay at the Motel 6 once in Vegas over by the MGM and let me tell you it was better than this Hilton since this lacked the Hilton Quality Towels, Bed, TVs and Guest Services. I can guarantee you that I will never ever, ever reccomend this hotel to anyone but stay at your own risk, I could of and or should of stayed at the Embassy Suites for $99 a night with free cooked to order breakfast and a living room and seperate bedroom and been much happier so please trust me that this hotel is no where near 4 star level or what you would come to expect from the Hilton Name.

It was advertised as a 4-star hotel just off the strip. Since we had a car, location wasn't a huge worry so we figured the big-name Hilton would be a good place to stay. We paid $50, which was actually quite good given the short notice and supposed 4-star rating. Our check-in was actually quite good, given the reviews on here. The front desk was friendly, courteous, and quickly got us into our room. The hotel casino had a futuristic design, mimicking something like a space ship.

I can't stand hotels that charge for such a basic feature. Even though I was on vacation, I needed to do some work and keep in touch with my office. The bathroom is ridiculously small and relatively outdated. The sink is outside of the bathroom. There was no free coffee maker (of course, they do have a coffee shop downstairs that charges $5+ for a specialty coffee, conveniently).

The hotel itself is in a horrible location. Too far from anything (other than the seedy areas right off the strip) and the self-parking lot is a LONG way from the hotel. We were lugging our bags a long way to get to and from the vehicle. The hotel lacked any attractions that other hotels have. There were very few things to do or see, other than the Barry Manilow concert (which we did not see). The casino was a good size and the dealers were friendly.

I've had better experiences at lower-end hotels. One place that I particularly liked was \"The Orleans\" hotel, which was far cheaper and a better overall experience...That should give you an idea of what I can find reasonable.

The hotel itself is getting older and it shows in places. Yes, it appears that they are trying to keep their costs down as some of the hallways could have been cleaner as well as the windows which need to be cleaned. Service was fine and the staff friendly. Contrary to some of the previous reviews I did not see room service trays sitting in the hall for longer that a couple of hours. We really enjoyed the pool area. The pool could be larger but the surrounding area is very large with good service there too. We did not eat at this hotel much though I highly recommend the deli in the sports book. Good food at very reasonable prices. The location was excellent for us as we had a pool tournament to attend at the Riviera which was an easy walk. If you are looking at being on the strip this is not the place for you. Probably the big question is whether or not this hotel lives up to Hilton standards.

The other thing is the location. The actual walk to the strip is not far at all, it's nothing over with in under 10 minutes but to get to where the action is it's quite a hike. Too far to walk. Tips to get over that, don't bother with the deuce in the evenings, it took FOREVER to get anywhere. Go the monorail the whole time and jsut walk the rest of the distance. The only other thing I would say about the las vegas hilton is to take out a hilton honours membership.

I have stayed in the Hilton group of hotels all over the world and this hote lis second to none... for its Lack of cleanliness and quality!!! As a Hilton Honours Member I got free room upgrades... God only knows what the standard room would have been like!!! We had 4 rooms, 2 with King Beds and 2 with Dbl Queen Beds. All the rooms were not what any normal person would class as clean. The first thing to point out is that there was one central set of lifts, which cover all floors in the section of hotel we were in. Getting was enough of a challenge as the doors close as soon as they open... thats after a lift has even arrived!!! Once we were on our floor we were greated with a corridor full of dirty crockery on trays, plates of half eaten food lying around and general dust and dirt along the corridor. When we got in the room it was as if the maid had never been introduced to a Vaccuum cleaner as there was dirt and food crumbs all over the room. Dont get me wrong, the room is large enough and the beds are comfortable... its the thought that you are being eaten alive by mites, lice and anything else that was alive in the carpet, furniture and bed. Needless to say we checked out the very next morning after complaining and went to the MGM grand... that was our next mistake! Would I recommend this hotel? Overall NO. It is a LONG way off the strip and the Monorail is expensive ($5 per person per trip, although you can get a 3 day pass or something I think) and once off the monorail you have to trek through whatever hotel it is you get off the monorail station at because the monorail runs along the back of the hotels on the strip.

And if it weren't directly connected to the convention center, I'm certain it would have been imploded (or sold and renamed some third rate dump casino). While walking in, the bellhop didn't even attempt to greet or otherwise assist with baggage. Upon check-in, you're given the choice to upgrade to a \"renovated\" room for $20. So right away, they're taking away from your experience by saying \"well, if you're not going to spend more money, you're getting a less than stellar room\" ... Gold/diamond level members get the renovated room. They didn't have a single bed, and the staff was unwilling to offer us a nicer room to get the room we had booked. Staff was lacking in general, I think they know they're working for a dump and hear it all day long. After examining our first room, we found it to be pretty dirty. I wouldn't have wanted to walk barefoot in that room. Outside of the 1982 pink Formica tile in the bathroom, there was a stash of pubic hair on the floor. A carpeted bath mat (gross). The lamp shade was ripped in half. Everything about the place felt like a low grade motel. After finding the pubic hair, we called at 4am to complain and the next day we got upgraded to a renovated room in the East tower (2575). It was nicer, but still far below any other modern hotel's quality in Las Vegas. The tub leaked so there was a stream of water across the floor all day, every day. (Extremely wasteful--I've read other reviews complaining their tub leaked too). The place smelled strongly like sewer gas every time we entered the room. The buffet is DISGUSTING. And for $18 for brunch, not worth it. Actually, if it were $8 I probably wouldn't go back. Most disgusting, low grade food you've ever seen. Everything is cooked to a shrivel and sits out. Eggs Benedict were inedible. Super low quality everything. Patrons that aren't smart enough to not leave the tongs sitting on the food (gross). The only redeeming thing were the crab legs (snow crab though, not king). But really, how many of those can one eat before you feel sick? Only fake HFCS iced tea. They have no club, so gold/diamond members get the buffet for free in the morning. I felt so dirty just sitting there eating the food. They have those alcoholic hand sanitizers on the way out--they really need them on the way IN. I'd classify the buffet quality to be on the level of Old Country Buffet, at best. The casino is so-so, maybe on par with other 'dive' casinos. It's smokier than just about any dive casino I went to. There's not enough of a border between the hotel and casino; the second you set foot in the hotel door you're encased in a stench that you won't not smell until you leave the premises. If you're staying there for a convention and not to gamble, this is probably annoying. The crowd in general is older on average, nobody young purposely goes here. The only time we spent gambling there, the power went out for a brief second and the slots rebooted mid-play. The Riviera is the closest casino/hotel to the Hilton (10 minute walk), it's just as old but smelled 100 times better and was a much younger crowd. The sports book room is pretty nice--it's huge with projection TV's (though it needs an HD update). Still a fine place to bet on some horses while getting free drinks. The Wynn/Encore are probably a 15-20 minute walk, and since you'll be looking for excuses to escape, probably a walk you'll do several times. What's sad for the Hilton is their food pricing is about the same as Encore/Wynn's, yet anyone who has been to Wynn/Encore knows everything about those two places STOMPS the Hilton. Hilton actually had the nerve to have a page of appetizers on their room service menu where everything was $21-29 for a quantity of 6. 6 jalapeno poppers for ~$25. 6 chicken wings for $20+. etc etc. Are they insane? They nickel and dime you to death, more than just about any other hotel chain is doing right now. $14 Internet. No free water. No free \"if you forgot\" toiletries. No free business center. I believe the indoor fitness center was not free. They even charge $5-10 to accept a FedEx package for you, that's just insane. There's no reason in the world to stay here, unless forced to because of a convention where employers require it. Still though, there's a newish Renaissance on the opposite end of the Convention Center if you're needing to be close to the convention center. Outside of that, there are much nicer hotels with much cheaper rates (i.e., MGM). They're promoting that the building is 40 years old with posters and free T-shirts..

There was plenty of room for the roll away bed / cot and we overlooked the Hilton Vacation Club's parking lot (where I was parked). The pool leaves something to be desired. It sits on top of the 3rd floor semi roof, right in front of the large painting of Barry Manilow. It was 112f (44 c) when we were there and we walked up to the pool. The pool was nice and warm, but it was so hot up on the roof we didn't swim. Pool hours are only 8a-8p, which is inconvenient, as I prefer to swim in the evening. They still haven't found something to replace the Star Trek Experience, so there's a big advertisement in the hole where the door to the Experience was. The casino is just as stingy as the last time I was there, I didn't win anything. Hardly any cocktail waitresses came by on the floor. The Paradise Cafe in the East tower is not the place for late night dining. We had to wait ten minutes to be seated, there was no queue - just no staff.

Lot's of people in line for check-in but not at the dedicated Hilton Honors members line. Walk right up to the \"Honors\" check-in counter. Checked in in less than 5 minutes with an upgrade at no charge from a very pleasant check-in agent. For the record, we have been Hilton Honors members for exactly one day. We walked into our room exactly 35 minutes after getting off of the plane. Our upgraded room is a \"Premium Room\" on the 26th floor of the North Tower, with a very nice strip view and \"Resorts Club\" access. The room itself is smaller but nicely appointed, with some newer features including a flatscreen and nicer linens. The basic bathroom is also on the smaller side, but very functional. We never heard the neighbors but we definitely saw and heard some rowdy partiers as we walked down the halls. We paid an extra $20 per night for the \"Resort Club\" benefits. Great breakfast with free coffee and juices in the morning. Free bottles of water are available all day and in the evening there are free soft drinks, beer and wine, along with snacks. Also free access to the gym/spa facilities. The buffet is a good value with a large selection. It's not fancy but it doesn't advertise itself as being fancy. Others on this site have complained about the inconvenient location of the Hilton to all of the action on the strip. I can only relate our experience and let others decide. We went to the strip one morning for brunch at the Bellagio. We left the room at 9am and caught the monorail(which runs every 7 minutes) 5 minutes later. In 10 minutes we got off of the monorail at the Bally's stop. We walked through Bally's, over Las Vegas Blvd and into the Bellagio at 9:35. We spent the early afternoon walking through the Bellagio(thumbs up on the brunch and the chocolate fountain), Bills, Paris and Planet Hollywood. Another quick walk back through Bally's and we were on the monorail and back to the Hilton in a jiffy. VERY convenient! A one day pass on the monorail costs $10.

They gave me an offer for $115 for 3 nights ( any nights of the month in July and August). I called them up and booked for the hot 4th of July weekend. Amazingly they did not give me hard time, and let me have it for the special price. So just by the fact that I got such a steal, I was going to be very reasonable for the things the Hilton lacks. Which is not much! We checked in at 8pm on a Thursday night. Definitely in a time crunch if we had to get to Tryst by 10pm. I unpacked all of my shirts to find some wrinkles in them. So I thought I would bust out the iron. It just so happens that I had one that did not work. I called front desk, and it took a good 30 minutes before the maid brought another iron up. They even went out of their way and tested the iron to make sure it works. How nice of them! I ironed my clothes and was on my way out and made my deadline. Having stayed at the Hilton before, we knew exactly what the setup was. So getting ready and getting in and out of the hotel was a breeze. I m not going to review the room so much this time around, but give a little insiders point of view. Our last room did not have a flat screen, and this one did. So I highly suggest asking for one of the renovated rooms. It seems like the furniture in the room was newer as well. Overall size and lay out of the room is in the same. Our room was located on the 22nd floor of the central tower. Rooms in the quite east tower are $15 more a night. Another thing people don't know about is the parking. Don't park in the designated lot for guests! You will be walking a mile to your room. I always park in the \"Sports Book\" parking lot on the east wing of the hotel. Make sure you don't park in the sports book VIP spot or you will get a ticket. From here it is about a 10 minute walk, instead of a 20 minute walk to your room in the East or Central towers. The service all around the hotel was very. We didn't spend too much time in the room to really notice. They were gracious enough to offer us coupons for the weekend. It included coupons for drinks at the hotel, and dining/ room service etc etc. We didn't spend any of them because it was just a little too pricey even with the coupons. With our room we got a great view of the fireworks over by the Palazzo (center strip). This was an added bonus. There were one minor annoyance with our bath tub. The drainage definitely needed some work done because the bath tub water came up all the way to our ankles whenever we took a shower. It was kind of like a bath/shower all at once. Another problem was catching an elevator. It seemed like the elevator system was not smart enough to detect that it is a full load and would stop at every floor when going down. It took anywhere from 5-10 minutes to catch one single ride. Other then that, I would love to stay at the Hilton again. I don't expect steals like this, but as long as I get a reasonable price, I will be back to use the place as a mattress and a cooler bucket for my bottles again.

Partly because I'm Hilton HHonors member and partly because its caters to the middle roller. The hotel itself recently went through an extensive facelift about two years ago. Their rooms now have flat screen screen TV's and new bedding. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The air conditioning works very well for a 40 year old hotel. Dining options are decent and pretty standard for a Vegas Hotel/Casion of this size. The Buffet is good but not outstanding. The one thing we did notice is that it appears that the Hilton has shut down their Mexican Restaurant and the Teru Sushi Bar in their Benihana Village. My wife and I were looking for the these restaurants on Friday night during the 4th of July Holiday and they were closed. Very dissapointing. So for late night casual dining your only options are the coffee shop and Pizza Hut outlet. There is a new lounge called Tempo and is pretty nice. It's has free live music/DJ's that has been missing from this place for a while. When it comes to shows, the entertainment options are among the best in Vegas for the variety of acts that perform here. This is one area that the Hilton has invested heavily in. For resort ammenties, the Hilton has a large pool area on its third level and several tennis courts. The pool area could use more shade for those very hot summer days. The spa facility is very nice but the gym is too small for my taste. Standard free weights, machines and treadmills are the norm here. The casino itself is not that large compared to others on the strip. But the sports book is huge and a great place to catch a game provided you get there early to grab seat. The Eigth Pole Bar in the sports book area is in dire need of a make over due to the smell coming from the drainage pipes behind the bar. Stick with the Tempo Lounge or Spacequest casino for your drinking pleasure. All in all, the Las Vegas Hilton is a good value for the mid roller. Its not dumpy like the Riviera Hotel or super upsacle like most of the strip resorts. You could alway take the Monorail to the strip. NOTE to Hilton HHonors members: This hotel is not owned by Hilton but by Resorts International. You do get some perks as a Gold or Diamond member (Free breakfast buffet, free spa access, free bottles of water) but do not expect a room upgrade.

Since that was the location for the event and others were staying there, we did too. I stayed in a 3 room suite that essentially was 3 separate rooms with connecting doors. Although certainly not a bad place, I would not stay there again for the reasons below. The not OK: 1. Check in was bad. We waited 45 minutes in line for one of 2 people servicing check-ins. Others waited until past 5 pm to get into a room. 2. The \"heated pool\" was ice cold and , as one expects in Vegas, there was very little shade unlesss you had a cabana. I don't know how they keep the pool so cold given the temperature and it was not jus tthe difference between the two, it was very cold. 3. It is not a destination within Vegas. In other words, nobody is going to go to the Hilton if they are at another hotel. The result can be very few people in the casino and a palpable lack of energy. 4. Petty charges. These include $3 per day for use of the room safe, $14 per day for internet and a $3 charge for printing a boarding pass at the front desk. The showers all have the aerators but in this hotel, taking a shower was a bit of a struggle given the water spray, or lack of it. I think they would have charged for tap water if they could. 5. Prices throughout were high ($3 for a bottle of coke at the sundry shop) and what you would expect from a top end resort hotel on the strip. The problem is that this was not one of those and is off the strip. Breakfast for 4 at the coffee shop can easily top $50 for bacon and eggs. 5. We asked for a strip view and a higher floor. We got the 6th floor and no strip view (I am not really sure there really is one from this property). We also were jacked around making reservations with no 2 people ever giviong us the same rates for the same room. 6. The casino is relatively small and during the week, isrelatively empty. By the end of the day, the sports book is a mess (as opposed to other places that constantly clean their's up). There is no poker room for those who play. 7. Going anywhere else is expensive. A cab ride to the strip , for instance, is a minimum $10-15. 8. There are much better values on the strip with some top end hotels currently quoting rock bottom rates for rooms. The OK: 1. The rooms are nicely appointed and the beds were comfortable. You do not have to go through the casino to get to the elevators. 2. The staff (other than the front desk) and casino employees were very pleasant. 3. The food at the restaurants was overall as good as the competition although expensive. They try hard to provide alternatives for dining probably to deter you from leaving the property. So there are options for mexiccan, italian, chinese, japanese, a deli, coffe shop, buffet, ice cream place, a steak house, a coffee place and an ice cream shop. 4. There is never a wait at the cab line. I guess that cuts both ways. 5. It is a little closer to the airport. The bottom line: this was not a bad place.

Cooked perfectly and tasted Delicious! Staff was friendly and very attentive to my needs! Thanks Marie and Pricien! Pool - Clean, Not Huge, but acceptable for amount of people there. I would have liked for there to be additional wait staff at the Pool, one girl for the whole pool. Spa - Clean. Nice Set up. Jacuzzi and Wet and Dry Saunas in Men and Womens Lockers. Friendly Staff. Valet - Quick and Efficient. Room - Definately ask for Updated Room, but they were very nice and clean.

There is a monorail station in the hotel, and the city bus stops right in front of the hotel (if you're going to/from the airport, use this option. It costs $1.75, no transfers needed!!). However, I always felt distant from the strip life because it is so far away. Even the strip hotel bus doesn't stop there, which is a minus. Expect to wait a few minutes for the elevators. There are 6 for every 15 floors or so and it always seemed to take a long time, even though nobody was ever in the elevators when I got on. The restaurants in the hotel were good.

We got a fabulous rate: $45 with senior and AAA discounts, and really didn't expect much. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised. I got an accessible room because I use a scooter to get around, and it was lovely. Great bed, large room, even had an empty frig. Everyone was super nice and accomodating about the scooter. Since we're Hilton Honors members, we were given free buffet breakfasts which were perfect: bagels and lox, omelets, fruit-all very fresh. We'd heard that the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood had been voted #1. If so, the voters had never had a good buffet. It was awful except for the Middle Eastern section and the desserts. So we went to the Hilton Buffet the next night and it was really good and much less expensive. It wasn't Paris or Bellagio, but the service was excellent (terrible at Spice Market) and the food was very good and totally fresh. The Casino was nice and not too smoky-I even offered a young guy $1 to move to the other end of a craps table while smoking (he wasn't playing)- and he graciously moved and they actually had penny slots which were just fun to play-and got us free drinks even before we moved on to more serious play. The pool was nice, uncrowded, and they have a really good happy hour from 4-8. My only complaint was the housekeeping wasn't quite up to par (although the room was basically clean, just not vacuumed) and when I mentioned it while checking out, they gave me an upgrade for my next visit. For the record the Peppermill Lounge Bar is a must try. It's like old Vegas, lots of neon, waitresses in ball gowns who sit down with you, dark corners with couches, fireplace fountains, and great old time drinks. Open 24 hours and lots of fun. The restaurant attached to it is OK if you need a late night breakfast or burger. All in all, everything went totally right on this trip.

We had planned on returning late next week for a few days after a trip to LA but we have cancelled our reservation and will stay elsewhere. None of the staff is accountable here, which has made our stay a real bummer. Its just been one thing after another. Here are just a few: I booked with Melissa in casino marketing who sent me email confirmations. When I checked in, the front desk told me my \"package\" did not include certain features that I was expecting. I finally fished out the email confirmation two days later and when I brought it to Michael's (in marketing) attention they said I had to understand it was a mistake and that I shouldn't just expect those features on a package where I got a 4th night free instead of a 3 night stay with the features. Again, I'm still staring at my email confirmation that lists a 4 night stay with all the features. Hmm?? The rooms was not being cleaned. I'm still staring at the same sunflower seeds, plastic from clothing tags and dust on the carpet and bathroom counter that have been here since Sunday, 4 nights now. Speaking with the front desk got me, \"there are no other rooms available in your package rate\" Having been a loyal customer who has paid 2 times the current room rate on several occasions in the past, I asked the front desk if a $149 per night room was cleaner. I got no answer, the front desk attendant just continued to smile. Upon check -in the front desk did not take an imprint of my credit card so I couldn't charge anything or activate the in-room safe without having to go down again which I did when I went to inform them about the state of the room. This room is looking a little warn down and the bathtub is horrendous, mold around the caulking and chip enamel, I'll post pictures when I get home. I definately didn't see anything like this last year. Yes, there is a better deal to be had with better customer service around the strip. Don't stay here. They just don't care anymore.

Reasons being, despite reading mixed reviews, the website pictures of the updated strip view rooms looked reassuring ( yeah, I know, I fell for that old trick ! ), the monorail would make it easy to get around, and the room rate was reduced from $299 to $169. So we gave it a try. We had driven from San Francisco and didn't arrive at the Las Vegas Hilton until around 9pm. On arrival, the self-park garage was easy to find, and we rolled our wheelie suitcases into the lobby a few minutes after parking. We requested a high-floor room hoping for a good strip view, so was disappointed to hear the clerk say, \" we are all out of strip view rooms, your room overlooks the golf course...\". On being presented with my printed out reservation he apologised and said whatever it says on the website, rooms are not allocated until arrival. There was nothing he could do as the hotel was sold out for the evening. When we opened the door to our EAST wing 15th floor room we were dismayed. Firstly, the room smelled badly of smoke, the furnishings, carpets and television were worn out, and there was a dangerous broken tile outside the bathroom. The windows were very dirty, looking as though not cleaned for months. However, the room itself was perfectly clean, so we decided to go back to the lobby to request a move to the room type that we had booked for tomorrow. The gentleman we first dealt with on arrival, had left, instead we dealt with Francisco, he was most apologetic and very helpful, he reserved a high floor, non-smoking, king superior strip view room for the next night. Thank you, Francisco. Next morning we went back to the lobby and explained the situation, on complaining, we were advised to see the concierge desk, they could not do anything about the first night room rate as it was pre-paid, but they reduced the room rate to $99 for the second night. We were happy with this. The room we moved to in the NORTH wing on the 26th floor, was completely what we hoped for. It was obviously updated, had brand new carpets, furniture, television, and bedding. The windows were spotlessly clean, and through them was a superb view of the strip. Fantastic. So to sum up, the staff we dealt with resolving our problem were really good, particularly, Francisco, and the lady in concierge ( sorry, name forgotten ). The monorail, the self-park garage, and if you manage it, a renovated room, were all very satisfactory. However, we were very disappointed that the Las Vegas Hilton does not reserve a room as booked through the Hilton website. This is very misleading, and in truth, we will not stay there again, because of this.

However, when they say \u201cstrip view\u201d they really mean that if you press your head to the window looking all the way to the right you can see the rear of some of the strip hotels in the far distance. Not a big deal though. I just wouldn\u2019t pay extra for it in the future. The room was one of the nicest I\u2019ve stayed in at a Hilton property. Comfy bed, plasma tv, new furnisher, and even an empty fridge! Be warned, however, the in-room safe will cost you $3 a night. They had a table tent explaining this though it was pushed all the way back so it was practically unseeable unless you were looking for it. The front desk was kind enough to adjust this charge off at the end of the stay though. We LOVED the monorail. It was fast, convenient, clean, safe, and kind of fun. It sure beet some of the sleazy cab drivers we got that kept on trying to promote strip clubs and wanted to charge us $20 to go to the Las Vegas strip. The casino itself is not as glitzy as some of the ones on the strip. Nonetheless, it was kind to me in that I came out about $20+ (I am a small gambler so this is great for me!). This is compared to the Ballagio in which it took whatever money I put in the machine. The pool scene was not bad. Drinks were reasonably priced during happy hour and they even had a free raffle at 7pm with small prizes like show tickets and free drinks. The spa and workout room (which is free for elite status guests) was exceptional. It had separate male/female dry sauna, wet sauna, steam room, and Jacuzzis. As a gold member I was also entitled to a free buffet breakfast that was served until 10am. Unfortunately, for a group in their 20\u2019s this was way too early and we never made it. So, in all, I must say that when I saw some of those properties on the strip like the Venetian I kind of wished we would have stayed there. They were absolutely beautiful.

I certainly wouldn't have thought that a Hilton property could be so lackluster and have such poor service. I was in one of the more upscale \"Resorts Club\" room that had been renovated with a plusher look than their standard rooms. The room was nice, although the bathtub didn't drain well and I showered in 4\" of standing water each day (despite telling them each day that the water was backing up). The overall feel of the hotel's main level and casino is dated and dingy - especially over on the side where the casino is a Star Trek theme (the Star Trek Experience is permanently closed, which was no big deal to me). Here are some specific issues I had with my Hilton LV experience: 1) The two bartenders I used were both rather unapproachable, never smiled, and acted as if I was taking time out of their precious day to serve me a drink. In both cases, they only had two other customers at the counter. Can't say they were overwhelmed at the time. I would expect at least a smile and thank you for a bland bloody mary with double-shot vodka that cost me a whopping $20.50! 2) They tout their upgraded concierge service, but found them rather unapproachable as well, didn't smile, and acted as if I was asking quite a lot of them to guide me to the nearest drugstore (such as CVS or Walgreen's). I asked if there was one near the monorail line. Her answer was (in a staunch pained response) \"well, the monorail won't drop you off at their front door\" - to which I replied that I was aware of that. She said there was a CVS next door to the Wynn. I took a taxi, was dropped off at the Wynn only to be told there was no CVS or any other drugstore nearby. I then walked to the south end of the strip to find the CVS across from the Monte Carlo area. She was blocks, and blocks wrong on the location. 3) I found all of their restaurants (which weren't all that impressive to begin with) to be understaffed and provided very poor and slow service. At Hacienda Margarita, I waited for over 20 minutes in the bar to be served. I gave up and got a table in the dining room. It wasn't overly busy, but it took over 15 minutes just to be greeted at my table to place my drink order. It then took no less than 30 minutes to get my drink. My dinner selection took just as long. Drink and dinner took 2 hours for a simple mexican style dinner and one margarita. I have stayed at many, many properties in Las Vegas - both upscale hotels in the heart of the strip and fun, kitschy ones on Freemont. Never have I been given such consistently poor and rude service as I did at the Hilton. I can only assume that the Hilton can get away with such lacking service since they are guaranteed patronage from those in town for events at the convention center.

Considering that the cheapest place on the strip (3+ star) was coming in at over $300 for that weekend, we decided to go with LV Hilton. We were given the option of a murphy bed which we declined and then were routed to 2 other rooms. Checked for bed bugs, none found. We did notice problems with their sink...leaks in the pipes and bad job sealing the corners of the granite top sink so water would leak to the ground.

The hotel staff assured us that it was an \"isolated incident\" and that their rooms would have been cleaned of any infestation if that were the case.

That's when we usually find ourselves at the Hilton. This weekend, we'll stay there for the fourth time (we nabbed a great rate for it was a perfect little weekend getaway).

You can jump on the tram for easy access to the Strip, but I find the tram to be a little overpriced -- rivaling the price of a cab. (We usually have our car, so we don't take the tram much.)

The Monorail stops right at the hotel and is convenient. But at $5 for a one-ride ticket, it's only cheaper than a cab for groups of 1-2 people.

I called a different pizza place and the manager said they get in trouble if they try to deliver to the hilton). -Spa is $20/person/day unless you are silver level in hilton's rewards program! -The gym is part of the spa, so no gym unless you buy into the spa. -High-speed internet is $14.00 per day! -It is a LONG walk to the strip - only one block, but the biggest, ugliest block you've ever walked.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat location; mediocre hotel\u201d", "Author": "e0steven", "ReviewID": "UR27460560", "Content": "This hotel has great access to the LV Convention center, which is one of it's best features and is also one of it's greatest downfalls.

The rooms are some what clean, the non-smoking room wreaked of smoke (as does the entire hotel) but it's Vegas, so no biggie there, kind of expected that you're going to have the 2nd hand issues. The shower lever \"fell\" all the way over to scorching instead of holding itself in place, so applying soap was a comedy of errors like something out of a Pink Panther episode as you hold the handle over warm, quickly apply soap as the water goes to nuclear hot instantly, and then your rush to put the handle back to warm. It was the funnier part of our stay there. This is just an old, out dated hotel that is probably ready for demolition if they had half a brain and decided to start competing with the rest of the Vegas hotels. Goddy, brass everywhere and just felt like an old casino for older people. Now, onto the staff. I learned later on that the waitresses are union members and from the looks of them, they are the \"original teamsters\" from the 40's. Just NASTY! Old, saggy, decrepid, angry women that really had no business serving the public. Complete lack of courtesy & slower than they were old. Just terrible. I realize again that this is Vegas, but come on. Waiting an hour for a waitress at a table is a little much. I shutter to think of what would happened had I been at a slot or video poker machine. On one occassion we actually asked the pit boss four times to send the waitress over, he also couldn't have cared less if we wanted anything. He should have, all 6 guys dropped 1k at the casino that night, you would think they would notice this. The buffett wasn't all that, I even got mine free with my Diamond membership, which of course they don't tell you at check in, you're supposed to just know these things. Even being free the 2nd day, it was barely worth the money if that tells you anything. I will say that the Porters were hands down some of the best in Vegas and they had everything wired.

The management and customer service response (or lack there of) really surprised me. We were given a letter when we checked in saying we could contact management if we needed anything. Of course, when we called the number we just got the front desk and were put on hold. After doing this twice and spending more than 10 minutes on hold we gave up calling. I also sent an e-mail and called the hotel customer service department after leaving and it was clear nobody cared.

It was at the very end of one wing, directly under the Barry Manilow poster; perhaps you can try asking for one of those rooms. I'm sure I wasn't charged extra for it. The furnishings, service, and cleanliness were in line with what I would grade a 3 1/2 star hotel. Because of the great value and the direct stop on the monorail line (convenient and inexpensive if you get a 3-day rate), I'm overall giving the hotel a \"5\" rating. The carpet did have a mild, ground-in stain on it. I had meals in the buffet restaurant and the deli-style restaurant next to the sports book. Both were okay (nothing special, not bad either).

Suffice it to say that the rude registration employee ruined the stay from the get go. First of all, I had my reservation in writing several months out. The hotel did not even try to honor that reservation. The employee at the front desk tried to trick me into taking a downgraded room, without even explaining why. As a Diamond member I am supposed to get complimentary upgrades, if available, not downgrades just because the hotel staff feels like it. Nobody should be treated that way, even if they only travel once a decade. I don't expect an upgrade, but I do expect the room and rate that I have reserved and I do expect a hotel employee to give me at least as much respect as I show to him or her. In the end, the snarky employee almost gleefully told me that the hotel was at 100% capacity (that was a lie- I confirmed with Hilton online after getting to my room), and that guests seeing the popular performer in town for the weekend took precedence and that my disappointment was \"just too bad because that's just how it was\". I had reserved (and paid for) a king room with a view. I ended up with a double bed room with no view- and they didn't even have the decency to lower the rate to that associated with the room type. The real kicker really was the horrible attitude of that registration staff member. What a way to start a weekend away. Now there was some good- there room was updated, the monorail station was convenient, and the food we had there was fine. There were also more negatives- the temperature control did not work and the room was warm and stuffy the whole time, the water did not drain properly out of the shower (took about a 1/2 hour after a shower), and the dealers in the casino were rather unfriendly. I still cannot believe that Hilton employs a staff member who so clearly cares nothing for guest satisfaction and who obviously took pleasure in lying to a repeat guest of Hilton. He did lie- about the room type (view) and about the hotel being completely full. Completely unsatisfactory. I will not be back.

Got to the counter and rep asked if we wanted to upgrade for $10.00. $10.00 sure rep printed the contract and behold the price was now $95.00, $34 dollars more!!!!! (See A TREND YET!!!) I told him he was out of his mind and that I hadn\u2019t had this type of BS from a car rental company in some time. He then re-did the paperwork and this time tried to charge me road side assistance for $3.00 a day!!!! If Payless isn\u2019t going to come fix their cars if they breakdown they are [-] nuts!!! He then finally re-did paperwork and I finally completed the transaction. I\u2019ve rented from several car companies recently and haven\u2019t got the run around like this in awhile.

Once we arrived at our room on the 17th floor we found it to look exactly like the pictures from the internet for a standard room. So much for the upgrade. After several minutes we found the room to be dirty. There were used towels and a used bar of soap on the sink. We then returned to the front desk to request another room. We were given a room on the 20th floor this time, almost directly above the original room. This room was clean and where we stayed for both nights of this trip. Although the room was very close to the elevators, it was quiet and we did not hear a thing from any other guest. I would have like to have seen a free wi-fi connection. With the direction the internet is going these days, I think charging $14.95 per day was a little much. We did the check-out option via the television. It was quick and painless. Several hours after checking out my daughter realized that she had left her favorite pillow on the chair in the room. It was a feather pillow and had a light pink 1000 thread count pillow case on it. I called the property only to be told that I would have to call back several hours later in order to check with security. When I did call them back, they said that the cleaning staff had not turned the pillow in. I was told that I could call back the following day to see again if somebody turned it in. I was again told no... but if somebody had turned it in that I would probably not want it back since they would charge me over $30 to have it shipped. I then informed them that I would be in Las Vegas in 3 weeks and could stop by and pick it up. I was then told that it would be tossed out before then.

After reading alot of bad and average reviews on here, I get the impression people expect this Hilton to be something it's not. This hotel caters alot business travelers, and therefore does not provide the typical \"vegas\" experience that many people look for. So if you stay here, dont expect that. Its an older, quiter hotel. But to me basically every aspect of it was accpetable. The rooms are what I would consider to be a standard Hilton room. There is no theme...but they are a decent size, clean ( at least mine was), and come with the basic amenities most travelers would want or need. One complaint I would have of the rooms is that the walls are very thin. I could hear talking and other things quite clearly in the next to me. Other then that, the room was fine. The casino was never crowded, which to me is a good thing. Blackjack had some very low limit tables, and it was never hard to find a seat. The sportsbook is great here. Its large and has comfortable seats with greats views of the TVs. The dining chocies are a tad limited here, and the buffet was closed while I was here. But as a business traveler ,and by myself, this was never really an issue. I also enjoyed the spa and fitness area alot. I never got to use the pool because it was December, but it seemed to be on par with many other major hotels in Vegas. As far as serivce, I found the staff to be very polite. Some other hotels on the strip that I have been to seem to provide somewhat snobby service, but staff here is very proffesional and polite. Overall its defintly not my favorite Vegas hotel, but seems alot better then many of the posts on here would indicate. For the price I paid I would defintley return. But I warn of one thing, that if you come here you have to expect a more basic hotel. Its not a loud and themed hotel like many on the strip.

Flights for two from Colorado Springs, 5 nights at the Hilton (with an upgrade on the room), plus a rental car (Avis) for $1058. Not bad at all, I thought. And, in retrospect, it wasn't all that bad, but it was, indeed, \"cheap.\" The fact that I am a HHonors member (Silver status) meant that I didn't have to get in the long check-in line. I was whisked away to the VIP lounge... that was a nice start. When we got to the room, I immediately thought that I got the standard room and that supposed \"upgrade\" was bogus. Not a bad room, though. The bed and sheets were incredibly comfortable, the place was generally clean, and TV worked fine. On the other hand, the A/C was loud, there was no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign anywhere, and windows were pretty mucky outside. Other disadvantages for me: the Hilton has no poker room, the casino's ventilation system could use an upgrade (cigarette smoke smell all over), and the off-the-strip location. The SPA, too, was ok but--as you'd expect--not anywhere near the quality other hotels can and do offer. To boot, the massage therapist (!!) said the guy's side was dirty and added, \"I wish I could take you to the women's side.\" At checkout, the receptionist was short--almost rude--when I asked her for a receipt: \"You're gonna have to get it from US Air.\" Sheesh.

First of all we only went to Las Vegas to see Barry Manilow and built up our holiday around this. We thought staying at the Hilton where he was appearing would make things easier. We were greatly disappointed as Manilow cancelled all his shows while we were there. We were given various reasons as to why, different versions of illnesses, but the last one was that he had Bronchitis. Can't moan if the chap was ill , not his fault we went especially to see him, but to cap things we had booked the Donny and Marie show, we had booked the meet and greet after the show and paid extra for it and guess what Donny did not show due to Bronchitis. We did see The Phantom show at the Venetian -- not to be missed fully recommend it. Luckily the Hilton was better than the reviews we had read before going. The room was great , clean and we had requested a room near to an elevator( it was very quiet) and with a golf course view ( we did not want to see the strip every waking moment this being our 4th trip).The service at reception was very good and housekeeping exceptional.The hotel seems to be mainly for adults as there was a distinct lack of children but although being smaller than strip hotels it deserves its 4 star rating and the casino was as good as any although smaller . The valet service was good and the longest row of taxis avaialble 24 hours a day. We booked our hire car at the hotel and got a great deal.

There were many details not right, such as burned out lamps, grout that needed rework/stain removal, old linens (there was even a tear in one of my sheets!), etc. The common areas were equally shabby. The conference room bathrooms were reached up stairs that were carpeted with the oldest, dirtiest, most stained carpet I've ever seen in a hotel! The restrooms themselves were clean, but very dated. All restaurants/walk-up food locations were overwhelmed with busines and therefore incapable of providing timely service. This was especially apparent in the Sports Book restaurant where many of my fellow conventioners found a slightly less expensive breakfast. The one person working at the counter each day was inundated and totally incapable of keeping up!

And that's assuming you don't get burned big at the gaming tables. Ok on to the Hilton. I've stayed at Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, and Treasure Island in Vegas. This Hilton property shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as these. The Hilton location is only for those going next door to the Convention Center. Other than that it's a world away from the Strip. And let me tell you, if you don't golf there's little to do away from the Strip in Vegas. Although the hotel is on the Monorail line, it's just not that convenient. The Monorail will drop you on the Strip but then you're usually looking at a 15-20 minute walk to get to your final destination. Fun, huh, in 100 degree plus summer heat! The rooms at the Hilton are not particularly large or comfortable. The food is exceedingly poor. In terms of service, well, let me be blunt - Vegas ain't about service unless you're a serious high roller. Constantly lining up at the hotel to get a cab (because they aren't allowed to pick you up on the street - what a scam!) and then tipping a doorman who did nothing a few dollars isn't service in my book. There's no freebies, no comfortable little extras. Just constant digging in to your pockets until the money runs out. For people who do want to do the Vegas thing, it's about the Strip. Otherwise why bother? This Hilton is for business travellers who have very low expectations indeed!", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIt was great at first\u201d", "Author": "nef1231", "ReviewID": "UR19315750", "Content": "We arrived at the Hilton at midnight, after a long day of flights, and we were tired and cranky.

Our second morning at the hotel, we were walking to the buffet when I fell on the stairs and broke my foot. That was the beginning of the end for me. The hotel treated me like it was my fault, were very defensive, and were totally consumed with covering their rears. They did help get me into a cab (why did I have to pay for a cab????) and I went to the hospital. You would think someone would have been concerned about me, but not at all. We came back and they made us put 100 dollar deposit on a wheelchair, and ignored me the rest of our stay. I am very upset about the way I was treated. They did everything they could to let me know it was my fault I fell and were more concerned about their own liability than my comfort.

Upon arriving in our assigned room we found that we mainly had a superior view of the Airport with a small portion of the strip visible from the corner of the window.

So, don't waste the extra money on a strip view, its not worth the extra $30 per night. Other than that the view, the room was fine. Very comfortable beds/pillows, decent sized bathroom, every thing was clean and well kept. The only thing missing was an in room coffee machine. The hotel itself was was pretty large with several restaurants to chose from. The only one we tried was the mexican restaurant which was decent, but nothing special. Pretty much a standard Hilton hotel with gambling. I do want to commend the staff for being very helpful when we needed assistance. Due to an injury I needed a wheelchair for my wife.

It had potential to be a connecting room and the room was a bit of an L shape (possibly because we were near an Emergency Exit). The beds were so comfortable that I didn't want to get up in the morning. The TVs were nice and despite complaints from others in these reviews, I enjoyed the channel choices - we had decent reception on NBC for the Olympics and the Discovery Channel. Although dated, the bathroom had a large step-in garden-size tub. Standard Hilton toiletries. INTERNET: Internet was about $13/day. HALLWAY: There were complaints in other reviews that the hallways weren't vacuumed, but I saw our hallways being cleaned while we were there. SPA / FITNESS: Our Silver Hilton Honors status gave us free access to the spa and fitness center which otherwise costs $20/day. Other than that, no addl fees w/ fitness center, but spa services cost extra. POOL / HOT TUB: The pool area was nice. It was laid back w/ various types of people and not the \"meat market\" you find at other hotels. There were various ages and types of people at the pool. I particularly enjoyed the hot tub areas. It was like 3 large hot tubs connected into 1, surrounded by a gazebo-type structure w/ sun screens which blocked very direct rays but still allowed you to get a tan. Surrounding the gazebo were cool misters sprays and contemporary music was playing. The cabanas weren't busy, so I could watch TV in one of the nearby vacant cabanas from my cushy lounger next to the hot tub while catching some sun. Compared to other places, I was told by others that the cabanas were reasonably priced and available at 4-hr or 8-hr increments. DINING: Tried breakfast at the 24-hr Paradise Cafe. It was comfortable, and the food was good and reasonably priced. However, other than this, the sandwich/coffee shop, and the food court choices, most of the decent food choices in the hotel, like the very nice Benihana Village, did not open until 5:30pm. What a bummer! We wanted to have a late lunch at Benihana or the attached Noodles place but never could. Finally, on the day we left, we went to Quark's near the Star Trek area for lunch and had the cheeseburger. It was terrible. Probably the only draw to this place - I'm guessing - is the $20-25 2-or-more-person drinks like the Warp Core Breach drink. If the other food was like my burger, I wouldn't hope for much....you could see it was definitely some pre-formed frozen patty, tasted like those burgers you find in a convenience store. There was hardly any cheese on the sandwich despite the fact that after the $9.99 price for the burger, you pay $2.99 additional for up to 3 toppings, incl. cheese, lettuce, etc. So for $13+, I had a 99c Kwik-E-Mart burger. And the booth they put us in was so uncomfortable, I was sore when we left. CONVENIENCE: It was nice that this location is a Monorail stop. The monorail is $5/trip, so if you plan on a round-trip, you might as well pay $12 for the 24-hr pass. These prices were obtained buying the tickets from the Concierge. I was told by someone that buying the tickets elsewhere would have made it more expensive, but I'm not sure if that's true.

Staying at the hotel of the conference is always a great bonus since there is no commute time to worry about to get there on time. The Hitlon is huge, while we had our conference, there were at least three other conferences going on and was very busy in the hallways and in the direction of the convention center. The elevators were a big problem at first and there were issues with them going to the correct floor and also actually getting them to close their doors once you were in them. I fixed this problem by finding out that I could use any other bank of eleveators to get to my room I just would have a longer walk to do once on my floor. The Scenic elevator was also pretty useful when it was operational, although it goes slow as it actually stops at all the floors and does not do a major jump from 1-15 or 15-22. The pleasure part of my experience started off poor. Upon checking into our room we discovered we had a nice big room, with bar, extra seating areas, plus a dining table....but the bed was tiny and a murphy bed is not my style. After sleeping on it one night I went and complained. I was moved to another lloor but wit a big king size bed and no extras. The bathroom were all the same, tub was not jacuzzi, but wasn't a regualr small tub either, it was more oval shaped. The place was always busy and being away from the stip is not conventent. There is a convenience store across the street and if you don't mind walking a few blocks you can be at the Riviera and Circus Circus hotels within 10 minutes if you walk, but be careful with the construction going on and some homeless people asking for handouts. The monorail is conventient but not cheap. An all day (24-hour) pass was $9 during my stay and even though it took you all the way down to the MGM, you still had major walking to do from any of the hotels it stopped at to get to the strip.

I was just there for a week and the property is in very good condition, especially all of the public areas. I do know they are in the process of renovating some rooms, so it would be wise to request a room that has already been updated. The updated rooms are nice, and include a flat-screen TV and nice decorations. That said, this is not an ultra-luxe property on the strip. It's a fine, clean, comfortable hotel with some imperfections (bathrooms could be bigger, they charge for internet, the safe is small, etc.). The dining here is pretty good. And if you're into Sports, the Sports Book is the best I've seen in town. Personally, I prefer being away from the insanity of the Strip, which is why I chose this hotel.

Next day when I picked up the car, there were about four other people waiting for their cars in front of me\u2026 it took over 15 minutes to get my car.

The Hilton was a very nice and from what we saw, a well kept property. We walked to Circus Circus, Slots of Fun & Riviera from the Hilton with no problems. My DW and I stayed in Room 2409 in the Central Tower overlooking the pool, convention center & strip. We had adjoining rooms with my sis-in-law & bf. but for some reason, our room was bigger and included a vanity area with stool and a larger seating area for the same price. The room contained a large flat screen TV, a small safe (not large enough for a laptop), ironing board & iron & there was no fridge. The bathroom contained Soap, face wash, shampoo, (no conditioner), lotion & a shower cap, hairdryer with extra TP & tissues in the closet & on the shelf above the toilet. The bathroom was clean & large enough although the shower head was low. The water in the room was $4 a bottle so be aware. The vending machines down the hall consisted of soda & snacks which operated with coins, bills or debit/credit cards. There is a 24 hour gift shop/snack store in the hotel on the first floor just past the Star Trek casino area which sold souvenirs, sodas/ water/beer/liquor, assorted food items & cigarettes. There is also a ice cream/breakfast/lunch/pizza hut called Perk Place further along past the wedding chapel that sold awesome croissants for $6.95 plus tax which included juice or coffee. Made when you order it and very tasty. Just past this was an exit & to the right was a \"scenic\" elevator (a glass elevator that affords you a view of the outside but it has no observation area just a regular elevator that people ride up & down on) do not bother, go to the Stratosphere for a view. There was also a video arcade down this hall but we never saw it in operation (in the morning when we were around there that is, don't know about during the day). There was also a Barry Manilow shop that I happily by-passed (could care less about him, sorry). Our favorite place in the hotel was Quarks bar & restaurant while drinking a Warp Core Breach (WCB). This was the best drink we had in Vegas hands down & the most fun drinking it as well. The Full size WCB in a giant fish bowl glass & metal frame ($30) contains 10 shots of liquor & other ingredients & the Mini WCB ($15) in a large fish bowl glass contains only 5 but they bubble & smoke from the dry ice in them & look cool & taste even better. We had pizza for lunch there $15 but it was great although a little small for 2 people if you are really hungry. We encountered a Borg during the time we waited to get our room, his name is #3 & he was the best character we saw on the trip. All of the characters would talk to you (in their own way) and pose for pictures with no problem. I am not a trekkie but we had a blast talking with them. There was also a Klingon, and 3 other characters that I can't remember the names for. This is a must do if you stay here (& even if you don't). The entrance to the Mono/Rail is through the Star Trek area & was $9 per person for a 24 hour pass & worth every cent. There was entertainment at night but we only saw a small part of it as we were busy trying to see all of Vegas in a few days. Check-in was easy (no line at all)& our room was ready around 2pm, so if you get there early as we did (11:30am), use the bag check service desk to the right of the front desk & this was very convenient & worked well. We picked up our bags & went to the rooms after a short time spent wandering around the hotel, casino & Quarks Bar for lunch. This may seem a long time to wait but it went by so fast as there was so much to see plus lunch to eat & a WCB to drink. Check-out was easy & fast. We printed boarding passes at a computer provided for this near baggage check for $3 to save time at the airport. The taxi ride from the airport was $28.40 & took about 20+ minutes but we found out on the return trip with an honest cabbie that the ride takes half that time & therefore half the fare. If you get in a Ford Explorer cab with a toothless driver, get out & wait for another one, he is crooked. Paradise Road goes straight to the airport by the way but we didn't realize it on the trip in. The only draw-back we encountered was my sister-in-law bought a sandwich from the 24 hour shop & neglected to check the expiration date & paid the price that night around 4am. Needless to say they were mad at the hotel for this (I don't agree, you have to check the date on stuff like that, or not buy it at all in my opinion).

I have to say the reviews I read prior to checking in had me worried. After staying there for a week I can say it wasn't that bad a hotel. Make sure of two things to make your experience more positive, reserve an upgraded room AND sign up in the Hilton Honors program. There was a special line for Honors members for check-in that took no time at all. The \"regular\" line wasn't bad when I arrived, but throughout my stay there were times when it was rather lengthy. When I made my reservation I had reserved a Superior Strip View room for the first 3 nights ($159/nt) and downgraded to a standard room ($139/nt) for the remainder of my stay. The woman who checked me in told me I could stay in the Superior room for the length of my stay so that I wouldn't have to change rooms. I also was given my original booked price. The Superior room was nicely furnished and appeared to be recently renovated. The bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping staff was great. The only shortcomings were the poor reception on the TV and the tub would not drain. We called the front desk and the drain was fixed quickly, but the TV never seemed to clear up. This room was worth the extra $ and I would suggest the North tower strip view to anyone. Co-workers joined me on the 27th and they had reserved standard rooms. Upon inspection they were more on the level of a Motel 6 than any other Hilton I have stayed in before. Despite having non-smoking rooms they smelled like a casino and the furnishings were well below par. I would not have stayed in one of these rooms for $139/nt. After complaining to the front desk, they were offered remodeled rooms for the same price which they gladly accepted. The casino is average at best, not really a place you would want to spend much time. The pool was OK, the \"Cool By the Pool\" 2 for 1 drink special helped, but the scene was rather poor. We ate at many of the restaurants and had no real complaints. The buffet wasn't worth the $17.99, so I would suggest passing on it. The Paradise Cafe is good for breakfast. As far as location is concerned, the Hilton is definitely off the beaten path as far as the strip is concerned. However, the monorail is extremely convenient and can get you up and down the strip rather quickly. A 3-day unlimited pass was $40 and well worth it. It was easy to go where we wanted to without having to pay for a cab and sit in traffic. Overall I would say as long as you upgrade your room you should be OK.

The positives: * The conference facilities and food were very nice (and so was the conference). * The Hilton hotel staff were very nice. I wanted some foam pillows and they were promptly delivered. And, I needed an extension cord to plug in some medical equipment I must use, and that was also provided very promptly. * It's a typical casino - you have to walk past slot machines or some other gambling \"opportunity\" to get almost anywhere. And, smoking is allowed in all the casinos, so walking through the casinos was not fun for a non-smoker. The rest of the place smelled somewhat smoky, but not nearly as bad as I expected. * My room was 638, a non-smoking room, basic, but clean, comfortable, and nicely laid out. It had a big bed (lots of pillows, thick comforter, a little firmer than I like but OK), desk with desk lamp (with electric outlet) and desk chair, and 2 upholstered chairs with a table between them There was a lamp behind the table but it was unplugged and the cord was not long enough to reach the outlet. Not sure why it was there because it was unusable. * My room had a small refrigerator, but my colleague's room did not. Mine was $15 more a night. I'm not sure if that's why, though. The disappointments: * You had to pay $3 by credit card in the lobby to print your airline boarding pass! AMAZING! And, the paper wasn't loaded correctly so it jammed on us. Just what you need when you're in a hurry to make a flight. But, I was stunned that they would charge for that. I've traveled pretty extensively this last year, including an earlier trip to Vegas, and this is the first time I've ever been charged to print a boarding pass. * There was NO coffee maker in the room, which surprised me. You could go downstairs to a very nice deluxe-Starbucks type place (which was not Starbucks). Pricy but nice enough. * The A/C had 2 speeds - \"on\" and \"off\" - and 2 temperatures - \"too cool\" and \"too warm.\" Lots of heat penetrated from outside when I left the curtains open just a smidge one day, so I didn't do that again. I hate the heat, but I managed to be comfortable keeping the fan on, the A/C set on \"cold,\" sleeping under just the sheet with the comforter thrown back. * There was a charge to use the Internet ($12.95/day), and both wireless and ethernet cable was available. Keep your firewall on, though. Somone was always trying to break in. * There was a charge to exercise in the \"spa\" but no charge to walk around outside (nice grounds around the casino). * Not an over-abundance of electric outlets considering most business travelers have computer and cell phone batteries to recharge. * If you're into the Vegas Strip, it's not very convenient although there is a monorail stop at the hotel that gets you to the strip quickly enough. The puzzles: * As soon as I made the reservation, I began receiving hundreds of spam messages every day, all of them about gambling - online gambling, slots, poker, roulette, etc. Since I'm a non-gambler, I have no idea why I would be receiving it, and I suspect the hotel sold my e-mail address (but I really don't know for sure). Watch your e-mail after you register and see what happens. * I chose \"express checkout\" to avoid the long checkout lines in the morning. Using your hotel folio (that you receive your key cards in), you write your room number and fax number in specific spaces, put your room key cards in it, and drop it in a box in the lobby. I checked out a week ago, and I still have not received that fax. I'm calling them tomorrow. * There was a safe in the room, but you had to call in to the desk to register that you were using it, so I suspect there was a charge for using it. But, I didn't use it, so I don't know for sure. * You could not control the volume of the water in the shower, another \"on\" or \"off\" kind of situation. Vegas is in the desert, but you couldn't tell. The water pressure in the shower was strong enough to peel paint off a wall, and it was not adjustable. On the bright side, there was obviously plenty of hot water. If you're in town to attend a conference at the mamouth Las Vegas Conference Center (one of 3 I saw, including the LV Hilton), it's probably the closest to the Conference Center, although there is a Marriott Courtyard across the street from the Conference Center, and a very nice Marriott Suites less than 2 blocks away.

The desk clerk then asked if we had our card! I reminded her that she just saw it and she was apologetic. She then gave us a letter which outlined the Gold and Diamond perks: free weekday newspaper, 2 bottles of water, free access to fitness center, free daily breakfast buffet for you and a guest (within certain hours), free in-room safe and upgrade to newly renovated room. We had rooms in the North Tower, 6th floor. Our rooms were about 3 doors away from each other which was great. The hallways and rooms were completely redone including the bathroom. The bathroom had an oversize oval tub. The bed linens and pillows were great. My dad didn't like the soft mattress, but I did. We had a flat screen tv, large desk (with an outlet in the desk lamp), refrigerator and safe in the chest under the tv. Our room was clean with fresh towels. Toiletries are adequate but nothing special (just some generic Hilton brand). We had a view of the golf course and mountains. We heard no noise from the outside or neighboring rooms. The main complaint was the elevator on Sunday. It took a long time to get a down elevator. Several elevators stopped but were completely full. My father, who is in the elevator business, said this reflected poor programming of the elevators. We finally had to get on an up elevator in order to make it to the lobby. Sunday brunch was good, not great. (Unfortunately our free buffet was only good through 10am and we slept in. ) I have had better brunches in Reno where I live. The casino floor was nice and I did pretty well in the slots.

We wanted to be by a certain group of people and had called ahead of time to request a room by them since we booked after they had. When we got there the lady said no such request had been made. We told her the group we wanted to stay by and she pretended she could not find them in the system. This woman was very rude. I think it was because we turned down the $75 per night upgrade. She put us on the 7th floor. When we got there we found 1 king bed when we had requested 2 beds. I called down to the front desk (which was an ordeal by itself to get to) and said we wanted a room with 2 beds. They sent the bellman up with new keys to a room a few doors down, which took double the time she said it would. In that room I called our group and they told us they were on the 20th floor. I then called the front desk to request a room there. The gal said that was fine and it would be $50 a night for the upgrade! We debated but decided to go with it to be by our group. The room was nice. The bed linens were the best. Our fridge did not work and they had stuck another one on the floor at the end of the bed. We reported 3 times that our fridge did not work and were told someone would take care of it and noone did in 6 days! The sink in this room was in the bathroom which is not good if you are not alone. They bathroom is very small. The tv is nice and we got lots of channels and good reception in this room. We did not use room service. We ate at the Paradise once. It was ok. We ate at the Buffet once on the weekend for almost $20 a person, which was not too bad of a price considering there was prime rib (very good), ham, crab legs, champagne, and tons of other things. We looked at the menus in the other restaurants and we are just not used to paying $30 and more for 1 meal. We did take a cab ($8 one way) to the grocery store and bought buns, ham and cheese, water, etc. I highly recommend doing this if you are not wealthy and plan on staying more than a couple days. The casino to us was nice. We are not big gamblers but we did do the penny machines quite a bit and got free drinks there. The waitresses seemed very nice. One morning we got coffee with Baileys and it was more like Baileys with coffee! Very good but I would prefer a little more coffee in mine! We are coffee drinkers and the rooms do not have coffee makers in them. We think we figured out why. At the coffee shop downstairs it was over $8 for 2 large coffees! Next year we will be packing our little 4 cup coffee maker! The pool area was very nice we thought. It reminded us of the resort pool areas in Mexico except the drinks were not free!! All the chairs had pads on them and there were alot of them. On Saturday though they were all taken! We were surprised. We waited around and did find a couple. We did not order from the bar. We brought a couple beers from our room. When we were checking out we got some good news/bad news. I gave them my Hilton Gold Card to make sure I was getting my points. The guy said that with the Gold card the almost $300 upgrade charge would be free (Good News) and that the whole time we were there we could have been eating free at the buffet, using the exercise room, drinking the $4 water in the room, and a few other things! So if you have a Gold Card show them when you get there! (Bad News) As far as the strip, it is not that far. We walked to it a couple different days and it was not that bad of a walk, Wear comfortable shoes though! If you are not in that great of shape maybe it is too much. We are in ok shape and it was fine. They have the tee shirts 4 for $10 just like Mexico! that was nice to see. There is a mall right on the strip that has a huge food court. that was nice too. We took the bus to Fremont Street. That is worth the trip. Lots of music, people, casinos,etc. We had the steak and lobster for $11.99 at Tony Romos. We got there at 9 pm when the special started and we were already #55! The lobster, potato, and veggies were excellant. The steak left alot to be desired. But what do you expect for twelve bucks! Lobster back at the Hilton was $60 at one of the restaurants! We took a cab back to the hotel from there because we were tired and the sun was starting to get to us from that afternoon. I think it was $12 and worth every penny! We are going back for the next 3 years and plan on staying at the Hilton.

There was no line and I was quickly checked in. We were booked in a standard room as part of a package. I asked for an upgrade as a Hilton Honors guest and was told no; that my level was not high enough to rate an upgrade. It was volunteered that the manager had given them directions that only Diamond level guests would be upgraded. Without a word from me, she stated rather flippantly, that you got what you paid for. Great start! I then asked to be put into a refurbished room and was curtly told that they were all updated. As many of the previous guests have stated, this is an older property and could use some modernization. I have stayed at this property years ago and little has changed. Before I carried my bags in I went up to check the room. My room was on the 21st floor of the central tower. It offered a view of the Hilton Sign and the Strip. The room itself was decent in size. The cleaning left something to be desired as there were items on the floor in several locations that should have been vacuumed up. The air conditioning was sputtering. So, we went back to the front desk and asked them to have these items addressed and to leave 2 blankets in the room. We went to self-park as the valet was backed up and cruised the casino briefly before we headed back up to the room. There were two blankets in the room, but the housekeeping/maintenance items were not addressed. As it was now close to 2am we decided to call it a night. The carpet in this room was very worn, but not scary dirty. The room had a desk and chair, a dresser with a flat screen 37 inch tv (with poor reception). The beds were adequate but nothing special. The linens were fine. The bed had a comforter and several decorative pillows. This was a basic room. The bathroom was small but the sink was outside (which was nice). The showerhead was so low that I had to duck to get water on my head (or face for that matter). Anyone over 5 feet 3 would have to do the same. The bath linens were fine and relatively soft. As others have noted previously, the loud noises carry a lot here. If someone entered or left a room nearby, it was exceptionally loud. In fact if it was next door or directly across the hall, it was jarring. There were comments about items being left in the hallways for long periods of time (room service trays or glasses, etc) and I saw the same thing. Many of the entryways needed to be vacuumed but were not during my short stay. The next day (Monday) we stopped by the check-in desk after noon to share our concerns and to see about getting an upgrade if possible. We were helped by a man named Jason who quickly apologized and upgraded us to a room on the 27th floor in the north tower. This was a 180 from our previous experience. This was an upgrade. The room gave us a similar view but with a few niceties. The room seemed a little smaller, but there was a nicer bed, nicer linens and more decorative pillows, a compact refrigerator, a large soaking tub, automatic (sheer) curtain opener, and nice carpeting. The lighting was better and so was the clock radio. This room also had better insulation. The slamming doors were more muffled. The air-conditioning also worked well. This room was also a little cleaner than our previous room. On Tuesday, after a very late night, we awoke to no water! I had read about this occurring in March! We used our bottled water to wash our faces and brush our teeth. We went to the front desk and I explained the problem and was told that I could be moved to another room because there was no water problem. I asked what good that would do if there was a problem with water in the new room. The lady helping us went in the back and came back and stated that the water was off on all floors above the 22nd floor. It would be off for a few hours. I asked if they would allow me entrance to the Resorts Club Room for our inconvenience. She said no, but I asked her to check this with a manager. We were granted access for the remainder of the day. After another late night on the town, we returned to our room about 2:30 am and were relieved that we had water. Unfortunately, we had no hot water. I called the front desk and was forwarded to Terri in housekeeping. I was told to run the water for 20-30 minutes. I stated that I hated to waste water, but I was told that if I could reach maintenance that this is what they would tell me. Also, Terri said that I would be lucky if maintenance responded within a few hours. We ran the water for 25 minutes in the sink and shower. The water was tepid at best in the sink, but colder in the shower. I am allergic to smoke, so not showering was not an option. I took a cool shower. It was not much better when my wife showered. The next morning, we still had no hot water. Wednesday morning on our way out, I happened to see several people in halls taking pictures. The gentleman had a nametag that said he was a manger of building maintenance. I told him about the water issues and he suggested that I should inform the desk at check out. I said that I was leaving that it should be fixed so that the next guests did not have the same issue. He again asked me to report it. I did so and was told that they were sorry, but since our stay was part of a package that they could not make any adjustments. I said that I did not want anything. We were then offered two free buffets. We declined. All in all problems (challenges) aside the stay was not bad at all. If we were put in the second room initially and if we did not have the water issues, we would have been very satisfied.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buttonwillow, California", "Title": "\u201cgreat location and value\u201d", "Author": "travellingcowboy", "ReviewID": "UR15288348", "Content": "Stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton during the National Finals Rodeo.

The front desk said that there was no record of this but that they could accommodate. I arrived for my late check-in and was told that there were no more rooms of my preference but that I could change rooms the next day, fine. The room was dated, the bathroom was covered in mold (all of the tile grout was pink with mold), and the showerhead was terrible and low.

I called at 1:00 and they just said, \"Come down to the desk and we will give you a new room.\" Now, maybe this is common, but in a \"4 star\" hotel, I would expect them to just send up a bellman with a luggage cart and our new keys. Instead, I had to wait in the check-in line for 30 minutes to get to the desk and request the new room, then move all of my luggage myself- no offer for a bellman. We got our new room and it was surprisingly much more updated, but the bathroom was just as moldy and the shower was awful because I couldn't get the shower to work strictly as a shower- the bath spout was also gushing water and the tub filled up to my ankles very quickly as the drain was slow. Speaking of the bathroom, the toilet ran continuously. One of my biggest complaints is that both of these rooms have beautiful new flat-panel TVs, but the TV service is ANTENNA! There are very basic channels and the picture is awful- it almost looks worse on the high-quality TV. The food at the Hilton is extremely expensive and not very good. I ordered a frozen margarita at the pool and I don't think there was ANY alcohol in it- and considering it was $10 (with tip), I was very disappointed and didn't even finish it.

The pool staff walked around the trash and never bothered to pick it up.

I am a very well travelled, VERY picky person and very hard to please and I find nothing wrong with this hotel at all.

I have not long returned from another stay there and cannot fault anything. The rooms are lovely and comfortable, the staff are always friendly, the food is good and personally I think the casino is perfect. I think the real reason people have complained on the whole is that it's not directly on the Strip itself. Do not be put off by this, this is not an issue. The hotel is connected to the strip by the monorail which stops at the hotel, and if you wanted to you could walk to the strip which is only 1 block away. I speak from experience here, I've walked it and I don't tend to like walking long distances. Please bear in mind that the staff at the hotel are humans too. If you treat them with the same respect with which you would like to be treated, you will be treated the same in return. I always bear this in mind and am polite to these people. As a result I have had excellent service here every time. All in all, I think this hotel is perfect.

Not what I expected. Maybe the word \u2018Hilton\u2019 in the name threw me, but I thought this was no better (or worse) then any of the other hotels I have stayed at over the years (Imperial, Orleans, Gold Coast, Circus, Sahara, Rio and even the 4 Queens!) Here is my honest review: Noise -Stayed on the 26 floor at the end of a hallway far from elevators, yet we could still hear the elevators along with everything else that was going on in the hallways and the rooms next door, I mean word for word conversations, every toilet flush and every \u2018other\u2019 thing as well. Was this place built with no sound proofing at all between rooms?? Cleanliness - The casino floor was well kept but hotel hallways were not. There were always little bits of something that needed to be cleaned that even more the 24 hrs later were still there. One example was a drinking glass lying on its side in front of the room across the hall from mine that sat there for a day and a half before it was removed, during which time the maid had been in and out of the room. Not only was this trashy looking but dangerous as well. I started to pick it up myself but wanted to see how long it took the housekeeping staff to get to it. Well over 24hrs! Housekeeping \u2013 Asked for no housekeeping services (only there 4 nights), but called and requested extra pillows, one set extra towels and told them the end table lamp didn\u2019t work and that we tried changing the bulb but it still didn\u2019t work. Was told no problem everything would be taken care of. They also sounded thrilled that our room didn\u2019t have to be attended to for the 4 days. Well we received the pillows but no towels and they never came about the lamp. Staff \u2013 Most staff were very pleasant and helpful with a couple exceptions. When checking in I asked if there was any chance for an upgrade, which for some reason made the woman\u2019s demeanor towards us change, let\u2019s just say, we didn\u2019t get an upgrade! Also the woman at the box office was not helpful at all re: tickets for the Game show Spectacular, got the feeling we were \u2018bothering\u2019 her. Pool area \u2013 Don\u2019t let the website fool you. There is nothing great about this area either. Good sized oddly shaped pool but nothing fancy, small hot tub for such a large hotel. And the \u2018roof top\u2019 area, it\u2019s on the THIRD floor! Rooms \u2013 Most uncomfortable beds ever!!! 2 things in the tub area falling apart that simply needed gluing, very little counter space, hairdryer had been ripped off wall and the sound of the toilet flushing made you jump ten feet in the air. Also itched from the moment I got into the room till I got home. I don\u2019t know if it was the washing detergent or the fact they were ripping out and replacing carpets on my floor, but had one hell of a rash. A few other small issues but overall not anything really wrong with the place, just not great, not what we expected. We wanted clean, comfortable and quiet, that\u2019s not too much to ask for, but not what we received either. Would I stay again or recommend??

This was a non-smoking floor and that was nice! The linens never smelled of smoke either! The hotel is about 2 blocks from Las Vegas Strip on the North End (Would be a decent walk to any attractions but it has a Monorail Station connected which would ease someone getting to strip attractions, although I did not try this...check for coupons for all-day passes for about $8) This was my 2nd trip to Las Vegas. I was there with others and planned to see attractions and bet a little. I'm 28, wife is 26. Travelled with 10 y/o girl belonging to friends we went with. FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The entrance is GRAND! The check-in area, casino floor, and resturants were all updated, clean, and getting around was fairly easy (I only got lost 1 time looking for the ICE machine on my floor). ROOM: Upon entry into my room the first thing I do in any room after setting down the bags is turn on the TV. The room had a nice flatscreen TV. The remote did not seem to work, so I found a lady cleaning down the hall and she replaced my remote. I still had trouble getting the TV to turn on and finally found out that each time I turned the power on, I needed to push \"power\" again to get it programed to work for that TV (no instructions and a pain to do each time). I counted only 20 channels that were in English and not hotel or Vegas channels. Good enough I suppose for a few days. Next I opened the large window coverings and had a nice view of the Stratosphere Tower, Las Vegas Country Club, and mountains far off. Nice window view for the $ and the windows themselves were very large (floor to ceilling, wall to wall)! BEDS: The beds were very comfortable and soft (I prefer a soft bed and pillows) I slept well every night! The furnishings were very nicely updated and clean. Hilton particpates in \"Conserve to Preserve\" program which basically means if you don't need/want your bedding washed and changed each day, you would put a note (provided) on the pillows. If the note is not placed on the pillow, then your bedding will just be made. I liked this feature (and opted to just have the beds made). BATHROOM: Next I went into the bathroom. The first thing I noticed was a marble tile on the side of the tub was completely off and exposing some plaster and plumbing. The tile was leaning up against the wall behind the toilet. This was a joking point with the others in my party. The tub was very large and the sink was nice. The marble floor and tub was nice! SHOWER: When I took a shower, the shower head was a water-saver model and felt \"airy\" and not very soothing due to the pressure. It felt like I was in a car wash. I'm only 5'8\" and I had to bend backwards to get water on top of my head. I felt sorry for a taller visitors. The tub ceiling felt too low even for me. The water temp fluctuated a bit but nothing too noticable. Overall the bathroom was probably a 2 out of 5 for me. I then looked for a coffee maker and never found one. The bottled water available was $4--so I brought in my own. The refrigerator hidden under the TV was nice. The programmable safe was nice, but I did not use this. The furnishings were all very nice and updated. OTHER THINGS: Each time I left the hotel out the east tower doors, I was walking through someone smoking and sometimes it was a hotel employee (get a smoking area for them please). One time I walked out to find an elderly lady had fallen and needed assistance to get up fully. I helped her up and she thanked me (as an employee looked on and did not offer any assistance--probably to busy to stop taking drags on their cig). ALSO---several times the elevator on the East Tower would stop at the 11th floor for no reason at all......spooky! GAMBLING: The Superbook staff was moderately helpful and friendly to a novice like myself. They weren't as helpful or as friendly as other betting facilities I have been to, but they weren't rude. My wife and I played some video slots and walked away winners (nothing big to brag about, but we had a lot of fun). The only gripe about the casino floor was the lack of servers. It took me walking around looking for someone to come take our orders. The one server I did find told me that she only worked a certain area and not where we were. That's fine but she could have offered to get someone to help us out. They seemed understaffed for a Friday Night! Once the lady did come she was friendly and quick in getting our orders to us. However, I am usually checked on for a drink a lot more often at other casinos. I played some video-assisted Roulette and that was fun because it goes a lot faster than regular play with chips. HOTEL RESTURANT: Paradise Cafe- The only 1 I ate at. We were quickly seated for breakfest. After a few minutes we started to hear the sound of a grinding or cut off wheel behind the scenes where they were doing some sort of construction. This was highly annoying and distracting so we moved to a different part of the resturant. The staff was very nice and the food was very good for the price. I just hope their construction ends quickly or they work at a different time of the day--not the busiest. ATTRACTIONS I VISITED: Peppermill resturant (on the strip)--GREAT ATMOSPHERE and GREAT FOOD (huge servings for $-average meal about $15) Madame Tussauds Wax Museum- Worth the $25 (SEE PICS) Freemont Street- Neat, nice place to spend a few hours-free (SEE PICS) Red Rock Canyon- Beautiful 10 mile drive into a canyon with awsome views. Nice to get out of the car and hike down into. $5 car load price. Lied Discover Children's Museum- Located in Downtown at LV Library, $8/adult, neat for kids and parents, lots of hands-on science exhibits, friendly staff. Just beware of homeless folks that linger outside, if you ignore them, they ignore you. Las Vegas Zoo- in downtown area, had fun getting into Goat pin and feeding them....lots of cool birds, monkies, gator, emu's, a couple of tigers, etc. Beware of the pigeons and chickens that follow vistors around---kinda funny! It's what you would expect to see and experience for $7/adult....but it's NON-Profit, so that's good. (SEE PICS) Stratosphere Tower- GO AT NIGHT! Worth the $10 trip to get up. Rides at the top cost extra $10 and unless you have the NO FEAR GENE don't bother.....I am pretty fearless but those looked even too much for me! Observation Deck outside is cool and at about 1,200 feet! (SEE PICS) RIO Mardi Gras Show- Very Fun....goes around the ceiling of the Casino every hour I think, lasts about 15min. Dancers throw beads (no need to show anything)....Stand along the 2nd level to get best show and most beads! (SEE PICS) Star Trek Museum/Rides at Hilton- I'm not a Treky but it was cool. The normal admission is $42/adult (but we found $10 coupons) This was still too much for my tastes but the 10y/o loved it (again). The rides were ok...nothing to be too thrilled about. The staff in costumes stayed in character well and were friendly. OTHER RESTURANTS: Rio Buffett- Pricey but worth it! Lots of choices. Look for coupons in hotels for a free steak (but our steaks weren't that great). Stratosphere Buffett- Better priced than Rio and pretty good food. Fri and Sat nights have better seafood selections (crab legs). OVERALL HOTEL EXPERIENCE: PROS: Clean, Priced Appropriately, Updated Furnishings, Comfortable Beds, Access to Monorail, easy parking, Nice Casino, Environmentally Friendly, good resturants, Non-Smoking Floors. CONS: Bathroom shower head, broken tile, Smoking staff outside doors, lack of servers on casino floor, Elevator on East Tower mystriously stops on 11th Floor, No coffee-maker, weird TV remote. (We didn't try out the pool, spa, or fitness center, so no opinion) I WOULD RECOMMEND AND STAY HERE AGAIN, despite the few problems. It's VEGAS....and it's been fun!

This hotel is just off the strip. We rented a car in order to visit friends in the outlying areas. However, if you plan to stay on \"the strip\" the hotel's close proximity to the monorail renders a car superfluous. We requested a room with a king bed. When we checked in we were advised that there were none available. We offered to wait until departing guest had checked out. However, we were informed that even the rooms that were checking out had been accounted for. Okay, so we were assigned a room with 2 queen beds in the newly renovated section. The room was lovely. The bed was comfortable. The housekeeping was another matter. On our second night we returned late in the evening to discover that the bed in which we had slept had not been made. A call to housekeeping resulted in a visit from a housekeeper who knocked on our door and handed us 2 pillow cases. After informing us that she had neither been assigned to \"dress\" the pillows nor make up the bed we had to wait for yet, another housekeeper to come and make up the bed. A half filled glass of water remained on the dresser for the duration of our stay. We accumulated a few hundred dollars in credits at a NJ casino that could only be redeemed at one of their affiliated casinos in another state. This was one of the main reasons for choosing to stay at this property. At the time of booking I was assured that the credits could be used for \"any of the hotel charges\". I confirmed this at check in. However, after eating lunch at \"Quarks\" we were advised that it is the ONLY restaurant in the Hilton at which these \"Destination Dollars\" could not be honored. The hotel buffet was passable, but not notable. We were unable to use the \"print your airline boarding pass\" because, both of the designated computers were out of order. When I reported this outage, I receieved NO help nor offer to help. I did however, receive an astonished \"It's not working? Try the other one.\" This was followed by a hasty retreat, (lest I ask for assistance). Overall, we found the hotel service to be inconsistent. When we checked out, the reservationist was perplexed as to why our credits could not be applied to the Quarks bill, which we had charged to our room. After confirming that Destination Dollars could not be used to satisfy the Quarks bill, she returned and said that \"I wish they would tell us these things.\" Yes,------ indeed.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cOK, not luxurious\u201d", "Author": "Lee4Vaca", "ReviewID": "UR13217896", "Content": "Family of 4 stayed at LVH for two nights MLK weekend. The hotel makes an imposing first impression as you first approach. Several blocks from the Strip, the Hilton is much taller than anything nearby, so it looks very striking. Perhaps that first impression is problematic as it sets an expectation of high-class accommodation that the relatively modest interior cannot live up to. Not that there\u2019s anything unattractive or overworn about the inside: everything is clean and Vegas-sparkly. But when a building is literally a white tower that seems a match for anything on the Las Vegas skyline, it\u2019s a little disappointing when you get inside and realize you\u2019re not in the Bellagio, the Wynn, or even Treasure Island. You\u2019re in a Hilton that, minus the gaming and Barry Manilow, would be very much at home in any large city. Check-in was efficient and pleasant. The furnishings in our double-double were more upscale than you usually see at this price ($140). We were pleasantly surprised to find a refrigerator in the room. There was sufficient space for the four of us; indeed I had chosen the LVH over comparably priced accommodations on the Strip because of the greater square footage. The presence of the monorail mitigates the Hilton\u2019s distance from the Strip. The monorail is easy, with frequent trains, and the $9 all-day ticket pays is a bargain. Though we were not interested in swimming, with temperatures in the 40s, I\u2019ll mention that LVH\u2019s pool was being renovated and guests were invited to use the pool at the neighboring Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare. We ate one late dinner and one breakfast in the coffee shop, essentially a Denny\u2019s in ambience and quality. Because my mother-in-law scored us two free passes to the Hilton\u2019s buffet from her gamblers\u2019 club, we had a brunch there. It was the most unimpressive buffet I\u2019ve seen in Vegas. Nothing was bad, but the selection was tiny and there was nothing unusual on the menu. Here\u2019s the one big downer we experienced: poor service from maintenance. Showering the first morning, we found that the tub drained very slowly, so I called and asked for our drain to be snaked. When we returned to our room mid-afternoon, we found that the service had not been performed. I called again. Returning after 10:00 pm, we found that they had again failed to take care of the problem. On my third call, I sensed that the operator was blowing me off, so I pressed her for an estimated time of service (\u201cWe want to go to sleep\u201d I said). That whine brought the desired result. A maintenance man came within 15 minutes, quickly took care of the problem, then called a housekeeper to clean up after him. She arrived and finished the job very quickly. When I checked out via the TV, I saw the bill I had expected. But two weeks later, no charge from the Hilton has appeared on my credit card and there\u2019s no e-folio for the stay in my Hilton Honors account. I wonder if they comp\u2019ed me because of the service problem... All in all, I would recommend the LVH for its value.

We arrived about 3pm and were checked in immediately by very polite and efficient staff. We had booked a superior king room with strip view (although the mountain view was easily as acceptable). The room was large and equipped with a flat screen TV. The bathroom was plenty big enough with all the normal niceties. Shame about no coffee machine, but I understand that's normal for Vegas hotels apparently. There was a very good 24 hours coffee bar just off the lobby so we didn't suffer from thirst! We had dinner in Quarks Bar which really is a \"must see\". Excellent choice and value for money. And the cocktails were definitely moorish. Being off the strip it was much quieter than the other casinos, but again, we didn't have a problem with that since we aren't really gamblers (I thought we'd done well when we won $10 on the one arm bandits!). The monorail couldn't have been more convenient, and was easy, clean and safe to travel on. All in all we were more than satisfied with this hotel.

I booked there because I was attending an industry conference at the attached convention center and thought it would not be too bad. I was disappointed over and over again during my stay. I booked a KING BED SUPERIOR ROOM STRIPVIEW on the hotel website- the most expensive rate available and as a Hilton Platinum Member was excepting something decent but... First, check-in (7pm) Pb 1: No special line for Hilton Platinum Members, only one for VIPs which was not manned by anyone. Fine, I lined up with everyone else for the 2 receptionist on duty. 15 mins wait Pb 2: Showed my credit card and was asked to sign my name on the electronic screen. My rate and length of my stay were never confirmed. I was just given keys by the harried attendant who pointed out which elevator bank I should take ( a 5 mns walk) Pb 3: She gave me the wrong directions! After going up and finding it was the wrong tower, I came back down and went to the correct tower. Another 5 mns walk! Pb 4: Entering my room, I noted that a) it was not a king, b) it was not \"strip\" view. I called the front desk to change rooms and was asked to come back to the lobby since there was no one who could quicly come up to me with keys to a new room Pb 5: back down at the front desk, I was now suspicious and caught the receptionist trying to give me a room near the elevators even though my Hilton profile specifically indicate that this was not my preference Pb 6 finally entering the correct room -it is now past 8pm, more than one hour after I lined up to check in. The room was just ordinary, standard hotel furniture, a rather used look but no obvious hygiene problem. Strip view? Yeah, far far away you can glimpse the Winn hotel on the left and the Stratosphere on the right Stay: The whole hotel looks old and tired. Game area was sad with mostly an over 60s crowd playing the penny machines. Pool was closed for renovation, only option was to schelp over to the Hilton Grand Vacation on the strip (a 1/2h walk or take a cab) and show your card if you want to use the pool. I wonder if anyone ever did that? Since it was late that first day, I decided to have dinner in the Hotel Steakhouse (TJ's) with a colleague. Big mistake. Restaurant decor was abysmal, prices were expensive and service was very poor. The only reedeming thing was a pretty decent steak but I think it is hard to mess up a 22oz filet mignon. At $80 per person including a glass of wine, it was definitely not worth it. Other nights, I went on the strip but this hotel is so far from everything, there is NOTHING within 20 mns walk. Use the taxis if you can afford it or the monorail if you can't. I still remember the days when the monorail was free! Not anymore my friends. Room: Inconsistent evening turn-overs. One day it was done, another it was not. Don't care too much either way but if you do or don't do something be consistent! Usual dime and nickel in the room, $3 water bottles with Hilton Brand name so you can't drink it and replace it by a cheaper one from a supermarket. High speed internet at $12.99. Thank god for my laptop air card. Local phone calls at $1. Thank god for my cell. Fax number: not written on the room phone! Why? They don't want folks to receive faxes free! They want you to use the business center fax number where you will pay dearly! Still faxed myself my return flight boarding pass but had to pick it up downstairs and bluntly refuse to pay the $1 they wanted for the privilege. How cheap! ATM: don't withdraw cash there!!!! Apart from the usual $3 surchage, a colleague who tried to withdraw money was given instead a print out to take to the Casino cage because the machine had ran out of cash. There, he was asked to show his card and ID which were photocopied, sign some documents, appose his fingerprint (!) and wait for 10 mns before they reluctantly gave him his measly $100!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Convention Food: catered by Hilton: abysmal. Even though the organizers had payed for a packaged breakfast for the attendees, there was insufficient items. Bagels and hot water ran out after 10mns and were never replaced. A little reception around 6pm the first day had the worst appetizers I had tasted anywhere. I could go on and on but bottom line never again! If you can afford it, pay a bit more and go elsewhere or do your research and pay less and go elsewhere.

Finding a HP deskjet printer on the desk was unexpected and if I was on business a real bonus. The room had one major problem, NOISE. Noise from the corridor and adjacent rooms was always audible and frequently woke us up. On one occasion a family checked into the adjoining room at 1:30am and promptly had a loud argument. This was soon followed by the bellstaff hammering on the door to deliver luggage, then houskeeping hammering on the door. So even the staff have no respect for guests, despite the 'do not disturb signs' on many guest rooms. A complaint to the management was listened to but basically ignored with a 'just phone security'. The other major hotel problem was access. The North Tower has 4 lifts, only ever saw 3 working and 'waiting in line' to go up was frequent. Descending was far worse with many guests waiting 15 to 20 mins. The food at Paradise Cafe was ok, service was a bit slow at times. Our party had two meals at Casa Nicola, both very good with good service.

This will be our 5th stay over the past 2 years. Overall, we've been happy with the hotel. We have relatives that we visit on a regular basis, so being off the strip a bit doesn't bother us since we have a car to use. Also, if you're there for a convention, you can't beat the location. If you're wanting to be close to the 'action' of the Strip, then it's not so convient. Yes, the monorail station is right by the front entrance but the monorail isn't running as often and the stops are usually in the back of all the properties, so you have to walk quite a ways to get to the casinos in the front. Here's a quick run down of the hotel: 1) Rooms: we've stayed in rooms at all the different towers--they're all similiar, except for the view. The view of the Strip is nice, but it's far away so it's not so spectacular. The rooms have all been remodeled--new large oval tubs and fixtures, new granite tiles, new furniture, flat screen TV's. The beds were excellent--it's the Hilton's version of Marriot's Heavenly bed. The bed linens were also upgraded with down pillows. The curtains are operated by a motor, the room we stayed in on this trip--it was broken already. Be careful about the 'complimentary' bottled water for Resort Club guests--don't use them unless you've paid or got upgraded to the 'Resort Club'--which isn't included for the standard rooms. If you're staying at the North tower, I'ld recommend walking down the hall and using the Central tower elevators since the North elevators were always full and seems smaller. 2) Restaurants: the buffet is okay. Not on the same level as the more expensive resorts (Bellagio, Paris, Wynn, etc.), but then again, you're not paying the $$$$. Often you can get some kind of comp/promotion and get it for free or 2 for 1--then it's worth it. The Asian garden (where the Asian restaurants are) is beautiful--the whole thing is indoors and is about 3 stories high and they simulate a rain fall every 10 minutes or so. You can walk in to look around or just have a drink in the bar/lounge area. We've eaten at the Chinese noodle restaurant (888 noodle house) and the food was excellent--it's an open kitchen and you can watch the chefs make your food. We've just eaten at the steak house(TJ's Steakhouse) and it's good--standard 'businessmen' steakhouse menu. Nothing trendy, but satifying(they have a 22oz. ribeyes and porterhouse steaks) There's a Pizza Hut express and a counter service take-out coffee shop at the back of the North tower--great for something quick and inexpensive. It's a ways back, but that's the entrance closest to the self-parking. 3) Service: Staff is good. Only complaint was that I couldn't reach anyone in housekeeping(kept on hold) to get extra towels one evening. 4) Casino: Good size, much bigger than Downtown casino's but not as large as the newer 'mega' resorts (Wynn, Venetian, MGM). Lots of penny slots. 5) Pool/spa: gym is on the smaller size and the pool is nice circular shape. Nothing fancy, but adequate to cool off if you're tanning by the pool. No waterfalls or slides. 6) Attractions: Star Trek--The Experience is awesome. Especially if you're a 'trekkie'! Even if you're not a big fan, the rides are fun. The Borg 3-D ride is a little scary for younger kids since you interact with 'borgs'. Quark's restaurant is fun--a little pricey, but you're paying for the 'experience' (be sure to get the flaming Ribs of Taurg and the different group drink specials). There's usually coupons for discounts to the show. The best discount that anyone can get is at the 1/2 price ticket outlets--they were selling tickets to the attraction for $21.50.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laurel, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA Very Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "Wolftrapper", "ReviewID": "UR12063085", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights at the Las Vegas Hilton during Christmas week 2007.

We were all upset since we were tired and needed rooms to sleep. To compensate for this terrible incident, she offered us complimentary meal to each of us to dine while waiting but we were not hungry, so we took the vouchers for next day instead. Lots of guests were mad. One front desk person was mad too. They exchanged words and the hotel rep slammed the telephone on the lady guest at the counter. After 1\u00bd hours of waiting, we got our 1st room. We got the 2nd 3:20 am, the 3rd 3:35 am after begging and begging the housekeeper and room maids to clean them for us. The 4th room was not ready at the time and we did not know when it would be available. We could not wait any longer so we did not check in the 4th room. We just used 3 rooms for 8 of us. It was horrible experience for all of us to be treated like this. We stayed at other hotels in Las Vegas, such as the Mirage, Bellagio, MGM, Stratrosphere, Orleans before. None of them ever treated us like this. We would like to get a refund for the 4th room that we never got. Actually, we should have got refunds for all the rooms since we paid for them in advance and could not check in to get enough sleep even with those 3 rooms we got. We requested refund from the front desk rep name Reyna, she told us to get it from Hotel.com since the payment was made thru credit card charged by the Hotel.com. Also, we were supposed to get $25 chips with each booking (4 bookings = $100) but we never got. We were too busy running up and down the hotel trying just to get rooms to sleep for 8 of us.

It's some other company that pays to use the Hilton name. I feel like I didn't get the level of service that I'm used to as a Gold Member (one small example: No HHonors check-in line). But on the flip side, they let us stay in our room until 6:00pm on Sunday because we were catching a late flight with no charge. That was very convenient and nice. The casino/lobby was pretty decent, what you'd expect for a nice Vegas Hotel. The best part was, like all Hiltons for me, the bed. It was very, very nice. Clean, comfortable, and large. The room itself was clean and well maintained.

I was a bit dubious walking down the hallways as there were room service carts left sitting about and the carpet didn't look as though it had been vacuumed in awhile. But when I opened the door to my room, my first thought was \"did Wesley upgrade me anyway?\" My room was gorgeous and did look like it had been renovated. It was decorated in kind of a \"pseudo art deco\" style in maroon, black, yellow and beige - not your typical cheesy hotel decor. The bed was big and inviting and super-comfy. The big flat screen TV was great, and I had a wonderful view to the east of the hotel. Unfortunately I couldn't capture it on film 'cause the windows hadn't been washed in awhile. It was confusing at first on how to open the drapes... turns out you push a button on the wall next to the window. Also, the light in the bathroom was weird, every time you turned it off, it made a hissing sound, not like it had a short or anything, but it still kinda freaked me out at first.

Let the rest of us sleep! I had very noisy (male) neighbors who treated me to graphic descriptions of their sexual exploits in the wee hours of the morning. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Other on-site facilities I partook of were the Fortuna Coffee & Wine bar, where I had a very tasty afternoon snack of a latte and croissant, and the Buffet inside the Sportsbook, where we enjoyed a HEAVENLY Sunday brunch (see separate review).

First, I upgraded for an additional $75. per night, and the room was lovely. It was a non smoking floor, and I did not smell any smoke. The bed was really comfortable/top notch with high quality sheets (5*s here!) and the tiled bathroom more than adequate (though not luxurious). By upgrading to this level, there was a private lounge on the 24th floor that served a light breakfast and refreshments/drinks all day + had a very helpful concierge. If you don't upgrade to the $50/$75 you may be disappointed with your 'older' room -- depending on what your expectations are. I was impressed with the seperate spa facility - borders luxury - (men's/women's had whirlppols, steam room, etc.) - and we had a nice relaxing time outside by the pool area. Depending on your room rate, there may be a charge for the spa (ie. $20/day -- well worth it - plus you'll easily loose this amount in slot play at any casino so treat yourself to the spa!) .The gym is a single room (not small though not spacious), and people got decent workouts here. THe LV Hilton is a few blocks off the strip...it is about a 20 minute walk to the Wynn Las Vegas, and close to a Walgreens ... this walk was fine for us, though not for eveyone. The monorail stops conveniently right at the hotel -- this is great esp. when you're going to the strip for the day or evening. I don't mind walking but note that when you get off at most of the 5 stops (ie. MGM or Harrahs), there is a LONG walk to the strip. There were short waits for taxis, and we were at the Bellagio or Mirage in under 20 minutes. The casino is on the small side (compared to the Wynn or Venetian), and didn't find the slots at all friendly. We ate at the buffet one day, and it was \"adequate' though nothing special -- if you're looking for a gourmet feast -- eat elsewhere. There can be a very long line checking in -- though the earlier in AM or later in the PM, there was usually only a 5 minute wait. I found the hotel staff to be very friendly.

Overall, the stay was pleasant, but folks should understand a few things about this property. This Hilton is a Resorts International property. I'm not sure why or what that means, but there do seem to be some differences from other Hiltons. We checked in Friday night and were told there were no King rooms left. We were put in the central tower in a \"normal\" room. The room was OK; however the bed was exceptionally hard and the decor was dated and drab. We changed the next day to a king room and were given the option to upgrade to a renovated room for $50/night extra. We agreed and our room in the East tower was lovely. We definitely felt it was worth $50. We had used points, so it was a free room to start with. The renovated room had a bed with a double pillowtop mattress and oversized tub. Typically, Hiltons have Crabtree & Evelyn La Source toiletries, but not at this hotel. I missed them! As Gold Hilton Honors members, we did receive free water ($4/bottle), free safe ($3/night) and free breakfast buffet ($12/person.) During our time there, we did see very long lines at both check out & check in during the weekend, so be warned. There was a very large convention there that all seemed to arrive at the same time on Monday morning. For a hotel that has many conventions, it should have been better equipped to have extra staff on hand for these busy times. The convention also affected the lines at the breakfast buffet. Note to Hilton Honors members: there is a separate line for Honors members at the buffet. Don't wait in the long line, go around to the front and you will get right in. This hotel is off the strip, but the monorail is right there. Very easy to get onto the strip. There are advantages to being on the strip and some for being off. You will have to decide which you prefer. The casino is a bit smaller than some of the other hotels, but has plenty of variety of slot machines. I found the machines to be rather tight. My husband played 3 card poker every night. The dealers were all very nice. There are plenty of waitresses around for drinks. During the week they have gambling lessons. We attended the craps lessons. It was very informative and we got coupons for $10 match play and free dice. We ate at several of the restaurants. The breakfast buffet on the weekend was very good. It was more like a brunch with breakfast food, carving station, omelet station and free mimosas. It was good food, but nothing special. We had dinner at the Hacienda Margarita. The margaritas are delicious, but the food was just average. Our favorite dinner was at Benihanas. Very neat Japanese village setting that would be fun for a drink. The dinner was fabulous. We also bought lattes from the Fortuna coffee bar every day. They were great. Each night they had wine tastings that was a nice way to try some wines before you bought a whole glass. Overall, we had a very nice stay. The hotel is not quite as nice as most of the Hilton hotels in major cities, but I suspect that is Resorts International's problem. If you upgrade to a renovated room and are OK with taking the monorail to the strip, and go with the flow, you will have a very nice stay.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "Lkytrvlr", "ReviewID": "UR10667464", "Content": "I booked this hotel as part of a casino package they were doing--great deal. $139 for three nights which included a $25 dining credit and 2 cocktails. I had never stayed there before and was really looking forward to it. I was traveling with a big group--about 20 family members, and 17 of us stayed at the Hilton. After reading some negative reviews about the rooms, my husband and I decided to upgrade our room to a renovated one, which of course, cost us about $50 extra per night. Other family members did not do this upgrade, and some said the unrenovated rooms were fine, but some did not. My sister said her room was disgusting--moldly bathroom tub and carpet. She ended up upgrading adn paying. Our upgraded room was very nice and comfortable. That was the good. We ate in the paradise cafe which was like a Denny's or IHOP, at best. Not something you'd expect from such a great hotel chain. My family ate at the buffet on a friday morning and hated it--said it was really gross and not fresh. Then, they ate there on Sunday morning and said it was much better--i guess they do a fancier thing on the weekends. Here's the worst part. 10 out of the 17 of us that stayed there got extremely ill. It started wtih my 80 year old grandmother who spent all day saturday in the ER with severe vomiting, dehydration, etc (stomach issues). We thought it was an isolated incident--she is older and can get \"bugs\" easier than the rest of us. However, starting sunday night, every one else got the same thing. We do not think it is food poisening, but it is definitely some kind of stomach virus, and we are pretty sure we got it from somewhere in the hotel. It was horrible. My sister was so sick that she called the front desk to make them aware of the situation (how nearly everyone in our large group became ill), and they pretty much told her they couldn't do anything about it.

I was hesitant due to some reviews, but I didn't want to travel to the hotel every day for exhibit hours. I had other business in town for two nights, then moved over to the Hilton for the last three. I'm so glad I did. I presented my Hilton VIP card to the desk and he told me they were full (I believe him - it was a madhouse all week) for regular renovated rooms, but he could upgrade me for $50 to a Jr suite. I took it, paying a total of $149 per night. The lobby of the hotel is nice, no line at check-in. Valet was a pain the entire time, due to only three or four valets, no matter how busy it was. There is a good self-park garage with a North Tower entrance on the north side of the hotel. North Tower elevators are small and there are only four for the entire tower. Sometimes, this was a pain, other times, no wait at all. My room was fantastic. A marble foyer, a large room with plasma TV, a chair, sofa and coffee table, two queen beds and a armoire type cabinet with a mini-fridge. Loved it. AC was great, and there was a clock radio that played your MP3 player if you had one. The beds were some of the most comfortable ever. Lots of pillows and a comfy duvet. The bathroom was small but had nice shelves and drawers to store your toiletries out of the way. My bath had a garden tub and a rainshower shower head. Towels were a bit of an upgrade from normal hotels, but not plush. The closet could have used a few more hangers, but for a three night stay, there were just enough. I was disappointed that no robe was offered with the Hilton VIP level. The Hilton itself was a bit dated. There is a coffee lounge (Fortuna) and a coffee shop, a nice gift shop and a food court all by the North Towers/Lobby. Not too many restaurant choices outside of higher end rip-off restuarants and a buffet. The sports book is one of the best in Vegas, though, and has a nice deli open late. The Hilton has a great location for conventions - and they must not have to try too hard for their players. I didn't see anyone winning, and there were open seats at all the tables, even on a Friday night. Slots seemed older than a typical hotel. There are plenty of video poker machines in the sportsbook, but very few full pay ones (typical for a larger casino). The Quark casino portion was pretty quiet and had no smoke. The entrance to the monorail is off this portion of the lobby - much closer to the hotel rooms than in other casinos. If I could book the same room, I'd stay there again, no problem.

Times change, and so has the Las Vegas Hilton... After changing ownership hands a few years ago, there's finally a good ownership group again. They've pumped all kinds of money into remodeling the rooms, upgrading the lobby and common areas and have improved the restaurants. I find myself in Vegas 4-5 times a year for business...So my review is from a business perspective. (I've done Vegas as a single guy partying with friends dozens of times, but not at the Hilton, nor do I recommend it for the 'party' group). For business, it's more than sufficient...The room is large, well lit, the bed is comfortable, and you hear NOTHING outside, contrary to some strip properties. If you're Hilton Gold and accustomed to often less-than-stellar 'free breakfasts for Gold and Diamond members', that's all out the window here. They give you their full $12.95-a-pop buffet breakfast...It's awesome. Other hotel restaurants are expensive but nice. I think Benihana is very over-rated, but love their steakhouse and their Chinese room. Their run-of-the-mill coffee shop is pretty good too. The rooms are big, well appointed, bathrooms are nice. I always get an 'upgraded room' which is VERY large, has a sofa and recliner and a 42'' plasma TV. They seem very hungry for the casino business. I'm by no means a big player, but apparently I play enough for free rooms there. Even when I go on business and only play $25-$50/hand blackjack for 2-3 hours a night, they welcome me with open arms. I called the hotel to get a casino rate (that's easy for almost any player)...After looking up my account, they told me to call a special number where I was put in touch with a casino host who said \"No way are we charging you for the room--when do you want to come in and for how many nights?\" Again, not the place for tourists...It's a chore to get to the strip or even to the next nearest casino. I'm not into Star Trek, so I can't rate how their 'Star Trek Experience' stacks up against other things to do in Vegas.

We arrived at LV Hilton around 2:30 pm and dropped of the car at the valet, the bellman took care of our bags and we went inside to the check-in desk, no lines at all. The not so friendly clerk said she only had a room with two separate beds available, we declined since it was our honeymoon we would like a room with a king bed, her reply was, we'll have one ready in 2 hours, and off we went. Got back to LV Hilton at 5 pm, back to the check in desk, no line this time neither, was given a room on the 25th floor in the North Tower, very friendly guy at the check in desk, asked if we enjoyed our stay so far in Vegas, we replied yes and explained that this was our honeymoon, he congratulated us and of we went to our room. Arrived too our room, newly renovated with a big flat screen TV, and golf course view. Called bell desk and our bags arrived about no more than 10 minutes later, I tipped the bell woman accordingly (just as I did with bellman that first took care of our bags). After about an half hour it knocked on our door, I opened and room service entered with a chilled bottle of champagne and two glasses with a note from Stephen at the front desk, whishing us a happy honeymoon, really nice touch! If you read this Stephen, thank you! We used both the pool and spa frequently, nice to workout before breakfast. With HHonors Gold status you and a guest get free access to the Spa facilities, I was handed a printout at check in explaining all my perks as HHonors Gold (incl. no charge for the in room safe). Drinks where not expansive at the pool bar, about 5$ for a draft beer, 8$ for a drink, and they make them real strong, Mrs was tipsy after just one drink at noon on time, lol. (Bartender said after handing me the drink, oops a bit strong this one, hilarious). Pool was never crowded during our 4 day stay. We had breakfast every morning at the buffet (free for HHonors Elites), can't complain, huge selection of everything, like the made to order omelettes and the fresh fruit section. Used the ACG coupon for The Buffet the first night, not bad at all, big selection, fresh and good, also free MGD/Lite and wine. We had 100$ dining credit to use during our stay, we had a table reserved at the TJ's Steakhouse, we left after 20 minutes! We got our beverages, but then nothing happened, the waiter where to busy we the other two! tables assigned to him, I was furies, we left telling him we was disappointed without making a scene, we was offered a new table and new waiter by the manager but we refused and left, instead we had a fabulous dinner at the Benihana, where we met Ms Whale and her friend that where really nice and friendly, when it was time to pay, Mrs Whale decided to use her comps to pay for half our bill! Thank you Ms Whale! Last night we had nachos at Hacienda Margarita, we manage to hit during late happy-our, half price on appetizers and Mexican beverages, huge plate of nachos, we couldn't finish half of it, good thing we shared and only 4.95$, Coronas was 2.50$, margaritas around 4.50$, I recommend a visit to the Hacienda Margarita, there nachos are awesome, we had drinks there earlier during our stay, but only ate once. Mrs also tried Teru Sushi, well ok, but nothing more. Drink service on the casino floor was frequent and quick, buying drinks at the bars was not expansive at all 5$ for a domestic beer and about 8$ for a drink, not bad at all. We had a rental car which made the location excellent, we also tried the monorail witch was great, I had expected a lot more walking at the hotel after reading reviews but I guess American definition of \"long walks\" if different to Swedish, same applies to monorail station on the strip.

We've been to Vegas many times and knew what we were getting into, location-wise at least. As far as the hotel, the overall experience was not bad, but I would never stay there again if for no other reason than their proximity to anything else. The Good: Lots of bars scattered about; you never had to walk far to find your next drink. The restaurants we ate at (Benihana's, gourmet Italian (Casa di-Something) and Hacienda Margarita) were all excellent, though our reservation for Benihana's was for 8 pm and we didn't get started until after 9:00. We had a renovated room in the North tower close to the 'scenic' glass elevator; you are far from everything on the ground floor, except for a coffee shop nobody ever uses, which enabled us to skip the long lines at the main coffee shop near the lobby. The bed was the best part of the room, it was soooo soo comfortable we just didn't want to get up! A nice plasma TV and in-room fridge both got a workout. The Bad: In Vegas, location is everything. We found ourselves at the mercy of the monorail schedule, taxis, and finally the hotel's limo service to get around. We spent a lot of time waiting around, or in transit from one place to the next. Unless you want to stay at the Hilton exclusively, or use the monorail only a couple of times, you will find this becomes a big pain in the hiney very quickly. Also on the down side was that the pool closes way too early , and one day we got kicked out at 3:00 to accommodate a private party. The casino was not all that inspiring, and I found very few of what I consider the \"fun slots.\" I never heard any bells going off or saw a single hand-pay being made. Most of the dealers were fun and friendly, but there were a couple with no sense of humor at all. The Ugly: The walls are so thin you could hear every word of conversation going on in the next room, not to mention the vacuum cleaner, heavy footsteps, laughter, knocking -- you get the drift. The ambient noise, combined with the loud rattling of the air conditioning system, robbed me of precious sleep in the little time I allowed my head to hit the pillow. We were awakened one morning by a fire alarm that nearly gave us both a heart attack. The announcement said they were going to investigate the cause and we should stay in our rooms until further notified. I guess they forgot to further notify us, because we went back to sleep and that was that. Their VIP room is not even close to it's equivalent (Chairman's Club) in Atlantic City. Call me spoiled, but I expected more than a bowl of nuts, some cookies, coffee, tea, and drinks you'd have to mix yourself from a limited selection. There was also a mini-fridge stocked with beer, water and fruit juice. All this is in a small room with about five employees who handle the VIP customers. Finally, the Hilton seems especially popular with the hookers who showed up en masse each night. These girls were obvious and and aggressive, and the fact that management allows this blatant behavior go on is disgraceful. I know it's part of the Vegas scene, but at least be a little covert about it. They were propositioning my boyfriend while I was standing right there!! Overall, a good time was had by all. Fortunately, we had enough destiny dollars to cover all expenses and ensure a good time; infractions seem so insignificant when you're not really paying for them. I was very disappointed to learn that the Star Trek Experience, Quark's Bar & Restaurant, and most of the shops are not owned by the Hilton and would not take destiny dollars. The beauty salon and spa were included, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay $65 for a pedicure under any circumstances. So the bottom line on the Las Vegas Hilton is that if the price is right and getting around is not an issue, it would suit your needs. If you are expecting five star treatment and lots of flexibiity, definitely stay more center-strip. Quickbits: We saw LOVE and it was awesome!! We had dinner at the Mirage buffet and gorged ourselves on crablegs and other good stuff. The best drinks while gambling are at Bellagio and Paris. Bikefest at the Cashman Center was more like a giant swap meet, but the downtown crowd was a lot of fun. An enormous new casino is going up next to the Wynn, and it looks really, really nice.

I must say that prior to leaving, reading the reviews made me quite weary of the LV Hilton. Check-in: Arrived at the hotel around 3 pm and there was no line at check-in. Waited in the VIP line (Hilton HHonors VIP due to American Express upgrade). I tried to get upgraded to a renovated room for free but failed. Also, although we had reserved adjoining rooms, we were told they were totally sold out of adjoining rooms not unless we wanted to pay $50 extra per night per room in the renovated tower. Two hours and a different front desk person later we were finally able to check-in into two rooms that were next to each other but not adjoined by a door in between in the Central Tower. Luckily, the second front desk person tried \"harder\" to look for these rooms and even gave us rooms with a strip view and a complimentary fridge sent up to one room. The Rooms: Both rooms reeked of smoke (said non-smoking) so we were moved a couple rooms down the hall. The new rooms would periodically smell like smoke as well (smoke traveled through vents or something). The non-renovated room was aged but adequate. The bathroom water reeked of some nasty smell and they didn't even have towel racks. The bed that I inhabited gave me bed bugs (yuck!). I even took the advice from previous reviews by putting extra sheets above the mattress. Also, the walls were very thin. Luckily, the only time I was in my room was just to shower and sleep. The Hotel/Casino: Elevators were slow-operating at times and were often overcrowded. Since we were HHonors VIP we got complimentary access to the spa and fitness facilities (sign up for Hilton AmEx). Their version of \"complimentary beverages and fruit\" consisted of bottles of water, a coffee pot, and rotten apples and oranges. Otherwise, the fitness equipment was fine. There aren't very many casual food choices, aside from the buffet (pizza hut, ice cream, and 24 hr cafe). I do give the buffet a good rating though. Although the choice weren't as extensive as other Las Vegas buffets, the quality of the food was actually really good. We used our comp buffet passes for brunch, which includes champagne and beer. Finding parking is easy but is somewhat far from all towers except the North Tower. The slots were extremely TIGHT and believe it or not I had better luck on the strip. Overall: The Las Vegas Hilton was a good deal, especially for the weekend (look on Fatwallet about Santa Anita Package). Had I paid even 20 bucks more per night I would not have stayed here. It isn't as fun not being on the strip and having to drive everywhere (we did not want to spend $9 per person per day to use the monorail which takes you to the back of the hotel and still requiring much walking).

The room was clean, the bathroom, well it also was clean, but seemed a little run-down (one of the few small issues with the hotel). Everything worked. The decor of the room had been updated. It's as if someone had spent a day at the Grand, studying what they had done, and then emulated that style for the room at the Hilton. The only issue we had was with the swimming pool. They had one, but it's just not the kind of pool one really feels one could relax in. It's located on third floor, outside, but most of the surrounding is just concrete. There's very little shade and not much in the way of greenery. They did have a smoothie/sundry shop right next to it. The pool was about average sized, not the luxurious behemoths that the MGM Grand has (I guess that's what the extra money pays for). The Las Vegas Hilton is NOT on the strip, but there's a monorail stop right next to it. By that I mean that you step outside the hotel doors, walk up the steps and hellooo monorail. It will take you to most of the interesting places on the Strip. There's also the Star Trek Experience at the Hilton. They did this pretty well--lots of old Star Trek paraphernalia on the walls by the entry ramps. The actual rides(?) are kind of fun, too.

My room was fantastic! Everything was new---carpets, tile floors in the entryway, furniture, TV (plasma), you name it. For 90 bucks a night, this was great! The Hilton has different categories of rooms, and I think their \"classic\" category are rooms that are not yet refurbished. I can't comment on those rooms since I did not see them, but my room was perfectly nice. I only have a few gripes about the room, which I will now mention: 1: The electronic curtain did not work. When I pushed the switch on the wall, I could hear the motor running to open/close the curtain, but the curtain never moved. Also, it's only the opaque (white) curtain that is electronic....the blackout curtains you still open and close by hand. 2: The plumbing for the shower needs attention. The water pressure was extremely low, and the temperature never got hotter then just barely lukewarm. 3: There was no hotel information booklet in the room, so you had to do some research to figure out what the hours were for the pool, the buffet, their locations, the channel lineup on TV, and so forth. Even though I encountered those negative issues, I still give the Hilton two thumbs up! There are many reasons for this. One of the biggest things I noticed while staying at the Hilton was that the type of people it attracts and the general \"tone\" of things is very low key and nice. I've stayed at all of the major Strip hotels, and this was completely different. Lots of families here on vacation with kids, and lots of business people as well (the Convention Center is located next door). It was also not very crowded, even though the hotel was at 100% occupancy. It was nice to not bump elbows with strangers as you try to walk through the casino or walk to a restaurant. It was a great feeling to be there compared to the young and drunk crowd on the Strip. But if you want to go to the Strip, just hop on the Monorail which stops at Hilton's front door. The cost for a 24 hour pass is only $9 (it was $15, so the cost has come down). The casino is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. But even when it's crowded, it's not \"crowded\" like it is on the Strip. I thought it was cute that the cocktail watiresses at the Hilton were all grandma types! There weren't any young babes wearing skimpy outfits here, and I thought that was great. The older women would come around and say, \"Can I get you something darling?\". And the pool area at the Hilton is great also. It's not an amusement park pool like you'll find at some of the hotels on the Strip. It's just a really nice, clean place to hang out. It's located on the 3rd floor, and there is plenty of room and lots of chairs. If you want shade, there are a few umbrellas and there are also some areas with chairs that are located underneath a mesh-screen roof. There's a cabana bar where you can get snacks and drinks, and there is live evening entertainment from 5:30PM until the pool closes at 8PM. During the day they play 80's and 90's soft rock through the speakers, and it was just a very relaxing place to hang out. The spa is located just outside the gate of the pool on the 3rd floor. You can get a massage or use their jacuzzi, steam room, or sauna. The room service at the Hilton was also excellent. It always arrived quickly, and the food was very good. I also loved the buffet! Again, it wasn't like the mega-hotels on the Strip where you wait in line for a half hour. You just walk right up to the entrance, pay your money, and go eat! The breakfast was 12 bucks, and dinner was 16 bucks. It opens at 6AM for breakfast, and remains open and changes to a lunch menu at 11AM. I highly recommend this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised with what I found here. I'm glad I finally decided to give it a shot after avoiding it for so long. Regarding the other reviews that encounter odd problems here and there and then the person says that it ruined their whole trip, well......you'll have to decide that for yourself. I travel frequently, so I know what to expect when I go somewhere. For people who do not travel frequently, they can get upset by one or two minor things and turn it into a big deal. Sort of like a bride on their wedding day thinking their life is ruined because a certain flower is wrong.

Having attended conferences and conventions in Vegas in the past, we knew that it was essential to get as close to the convention venue as possible, due to long taxi and shuttle lines. After staying at this hotel, I would prefer to walk across broken glass, swim with sharks, or wait 2 hours in a taxi/shuttle line at 6 a.m. than to stay here again. I upgraded my room to a newly renovated one and when I arrived at my door, found broken glass on the carpet at the threshold. It took 45 minutes for my luggage to arrive. Unfortunately, the broken glass was still there 2 days later. I called and reported it and finally someone cleaned it up. The elevators in the renovated section of the hotel are incredibly slow and there are not enough of them to accommodate the layout of the hotel. While there are separate towers, they are all inter-connected, so elevator traffic is not tower specific. The wait for an elevator was upwards of 25 minutes on several occassions. The third day, I discovered that I had slept in a creepy hotel bed with no sheets......just the comforter and the mattress pad. I was completely horrified. The sinks and shower constantly backed up when used. The front desk staff was completely inept. When I went down to complain to the front desk, the manager was very helpful and even offered to comp my night and all of my upgrade charges. The night before I left, I checked on the status of the credit and my total bill and was shocked to find that the Manager had not followed through. The manager that I ended up dealing with that night was catty and rude. He finally agreed to honor the other manager's commitment and even comped more than the original offer.

However, when I asked one of the workers if I was the only one staying on this floor, he replied yes. I immediately called downstairs to complain, and they changed me to another room on another floor. Ironically, I asked for, and was given an upgraded room at no charge. The new room, which they originally offered to me at $50 more, was okay. Yes, there was new furniture that looked like it was taken right from Ikea or Pottery Barn. Yes, there was a plasma TV, but there were no channels in HD, so it was basically for naught. The floors in the entry were granite, but the problem with that is that they're echoey.

The hotel bill summary showed our sushi restaurant bill at around $70.00 and some odd cents. My husband rarely keeps his receipts so we had not way to contest it, seeing it after several days had gone by and having no proof or our original bill.

Called ahead of the time to make sure the room that I was request was available. However, once I arrived, I countered several issues that I normally don't encounter at the hilton property. Mixed feeling about this hotels: PRO: 1. The mattress is VERY comfortable (We did get upgraded to Northtower room for free), typical hilton bed that you can count on. 2. 42\" Panasonic Plasma TV in the new renovated room. 3. Location can be nice if you don't like the Las Vegas Blvd Strip traffic. 4. Proximity to the LV convention center. 5. Cheap rates if you can find a deal (perhaps one of the cheapest 3.5* hotel in Vegas area). CON: 1. The hotel is VERY smokey, its bad that I was coughing all the time while I was inside the hotel. 2. Front desk staff - yes, they are quite RUDE compared to the other hotel's front desk. They tried to sell you the renovated room in the north tower for $50 and they told that not even HHonors Diamond member will receive the upgrade on promise. 3. Parking Garage is a bit of walk unless you stay in the North tower. 4. The buffet is average, don't waste ur time eating here. If you want a better buffet dining experience, try The Buffet @ Wynn or Spice Market buffet @ Planet Hollywood/Aladdin. 5. The spa is on the small scale compare to the size of the hotel, limited workout equipment. 6. It took me 3 calls to get things to deliver to my room, actually I had to go downstair to ask them personally (and the front desk was NOT happy about it). 7. The carpet is NOT vacummed!! Our room's floor got other people's leftover HAIRbrush and their luggage tag lefted on the floor, make sure to walk with a slipper in case something poke thru your feet! 8. VIP lounge is very plain, not ur typical HHonors Executive Lounge style. No complimentary waters or snacks. Difficult to upgrade at this property even with status. You'll be better off if you try the $20 trick 9. MAKE SURE TO VIEW UR HOTEL BILL BEFORE YOU CHECK OUT. PRINT UR RATE CONFIRMATION SO YOU CAN USE AS A BACKUP.

We got a good deal on both the flight and accommodation. We arrived at the hotel late-ish to a great check in, No queues! Brilliant after a long flight and we had heard the rumours about long check in lines in Vegas. We thought our room was fine for the length of our stay (6 nights). It was clean, roomy and the bed was amazingly comfortable. A few things could have been updated like the closet door was coming of it's track and. a layout of the hotel in the rooms would have been good as the hotel is huge (We kept finding new places every day). but these minor faults are not a big deal in the great scheme of things. We didn't have a strip view but had a beautiful view of the golf course and mountains behind the hotel. As some others have pointed out it's not on the strip and to some people it would be a pain but as it was our first time to Vegas we were not bothered. We just became wise to the monorail system. TIP: If you look in the free magazines and some hotel receptions you can find money off coupons for the monorail. We used the tram which runs along the strip one day but we found the journey very long and bumpy compared to the monorail. The hotel has many food and drink amenities. We took advantage of the paradise cafe for breakfast, which had plenty for any tastes or appetites. We also had a fun meal at Quark's Bar and Restaurant, it was certainly a meal to remember, and we're not even fans of star trek. The cocktails are a must. My husband and I were impressed with the overall LV Hilton experience. The staff we're friendly and the hotel had everything we needed.

I wouldn't suggest using the bus, even though its cheaper, its takes too long during the day. the monorail is the best bet.

In addition to reduced room rates, the Summer Sizzle package came with lots of add-ons. The coupons for the add-ons were not given to us at check-in and had to be requested. The package advertises $25 credit toward a spa treatment, but we were never given this item. We booked \"The Redesigned Superior Room with Stunning Strip View.\" This room, of course, cost more than the \"Classic Room\" or the \"Redesigned Premium Room.\" I actually talked with a Hilton host and was assured that I was booking a king size bed. Additionally, my husband is a Hilton diamond card member. We checked in around 10 pm Thursday evening. There were about 20 people checking in. When we went to our room, the room was lovely, but did not have a strip view -- which we had paid for. We went back to check-in and learned that all the king rooms with a view were booked. We were given a room with a strip view and told that it had two queen size beds. We were told we could switch rooms on Friday. We also were given a list of benefits the diamond card members get, including the $4 bottles of water in the room are complimentary. The room did not have two queen size beds, but two double beds. Additionally, DO NOT PAY FOR A STRIP VIEW. We were on the 19th floor, and the view is completely unremarkable. You are overlooking the Hilton sign, a congested street and the old Riviera sign. There are no strip views -- don't waste the money. The beds do not have flat sheets. Instead, you lay right under the duvet and pray that the housecleaning staff honestly changes them every single time. It's gross. Friday, we went back to get the king sized room we'd been promise. Well, we got the king size bed -- without a strip view. Golf course is beautiful, though. Had to call and demand to be reimbursed the difference in price of a premium room and a superior room with stunning strip view. The $4 water bottles ended up added on to our bill. The hosts arranged for a limo to pick us up at the airport. Honestly, this was a great relief as the limo line was more than an hour wait. The limo driver was great. The charge added onto our bill for transportation was $40 (+ we had tipped him $20). Another complaint: the shower heads must have been installed by very small plumbers. I am 5'11\" and the bottom of the showerhead is situated at about 5'8\" .. meaning, to be comfortable, you should be no more than 5'5\". Showering on my knees is not fun.

The best rates I could find originally were at the dumpy but well-located Imperial Palace, an old property with a prime Strip location. A coworker then told me about a promotion the Hilton was offering to Santa Anita Racetrack visitors--rooms for well under $100, plust breakfast buffet. We knew the Hilton wasn't on the Strip, but this was a great deal, especially for this weekend. The Hilton is an older Vegas property east of the Strip, adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center. Surely most of its business is from convention attendees. The Hilton has a Monorail stop for easy access to the Strip. Unlike most ot the Strip hotels where the monorail stops at the rear of the property, necessitating a long walk through the casinos to get to the Strip, the Hilton's station is right in front by the Star Trek casino and Experience. Look for coupons for discount monorail tickets in the many booklets found throughout Vegas, including the monorail stations themselves. Check-in was pretty quick, the line short. The check-in area is surprisingly small for such a large hotel--I can imagine there are long lines at times. We were not given our buffet vouchers at check-in, so we had to stand in line again later. The hotel is designed with 3 corridors of rooms radiating from a central core (the Central Tower), a common architechtural design also seen at Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, Mirage, Treasure Island and the original Venetian building. North and East Tower rooms were added later by extending 2 of the corridors outward--these towers have their own elevator banks but are still accessible from the Central Tower elevators also. The North Tower rooms have been renovated and cost more. We had an unrenovated \"Classic\" room in the Central Tower, and it was fine, fairly spacious. The decor was contemporary--the bed had a more modern white duvet, throw, pillow shams and neckroll pillow rather than the usual old-fashioned bedspread. The shams and neck pillow covers cannot be removed--they are covered with a cleansible vinylized fabric, but I personally would not lay on these. The carpet and chairs were a bit tired and worn. The bathroom needs more towel racks. The ceilng above the shower/tub is quite low due to AC equipment above it. The initial supply of towels and bath amenities was paltry but on subsequent days was replenished more substatially. The windows are tinted so during the day the room is a bit dark. The renovated rooms apparently have plasma TVs, but ours was not. Some features on the remote did not work--no movies or on-screen check-out. Also the TV did not swivel and channel selection was minimal. They obviously do not want you to spend much time in the room. There was no directory of hotel features or restaurants, only a room service menu. There is a charge for the in-room safe. If you have a car and want to self-park, the North Tower structure seems closer than the East Tower structure. The casino is on the small side but well equipped. The sportsbook is large. Unlike a lot of casinos that are dark and windowless and you cannot tell if it's night or day, the Hilton's casino is brightly lit with ballroom type lighting and during the day daylight from the front entrance pours well into the casino. The pool (on the casino roof) is small and simple but comtemporarily equipped with cabanas, daybeds and chaises. Tennis courts and the spa are also here. The breakfast buffet was not as lavish as others in Vegas but well done and not overcrowded during our visits. On weekends they only serve brunch starting at 8 AM, but our vouchers still were accepted. We did not try any of the other restaurants. The Hilton has several lounges, but no hot velvet rope nightclubs for Paris Hilton wannabees. Barry Manilow performs here, just as Elvis did 30 years ago. Vegas itself continues to transform and grow--there's something new each time we visit. Constant construction and deconstuction continues everywhere on the Strip. The Stardust is gone. The Aladdin is now the Planet Hollywood, and its Desert Passage Shops are now the Miracle Mile Shops. The Venetian and Wynn are adding new towers, Donald Trump's property north of the Fashion Show Mall is coming along, and the HUGE CityCenter development between Monte Carlo and the Bellagio that will include 5 seperate properties (hotels and/or residences) is well under way. CityCenter is being developed by MGM Mirage, which basically now owns the entire west side of the Strip from Mandalay Bay up to Treasure Island, except for Caesars Palace. If you must stay on the always hopping Strip, the Hilton may not be your first choice. It is worth considering, however, if you can get a good deal.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cI Love the Las Vegas Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Kishah", "ReviewID": "UR7626286", "Content": "We have just returned from a 3 day weekend at the Las Vegas Hilton. The hotel is magnificent and I think this was my best experience ever. my reservation was for two attached rooms, one king size bed and 2 double beds in a none remodeled room. However when I was checking in they told me that they don't have a king size bed available but they offered to upgrade me to 2 attached remodeled rooms in the North Tower with double beds instead for free. Immediately I said yes because I read a lot of reviews about those old rooms. Thanks Jason. The minute we walked in our rooms we started to scream; It was so lovely. they had the best mattress, a flat screen TV that was huge, a printer , a fridge and a safe ( did not use safe). The bathroom was also so nice They charged me the same price as a none remodeled room. We were 4 adults and two children. Now this hotel is just great for children. It felt family oriented and we didn't get all the strip crowd trying to see the outside show or just jumping from hotel to hotel looking around. Most of the people who came here already had a room. We had 2 for 1 buffet vouchers that helped a lot and the food was great. Thank you Linda B at the buffet. The pizza hut was fun for the kids and they have a very cheap Deli in the sports room that also made a difference. Check it out. My husband did win in the casino but I can't say much since I didn't gamble here. The pool was great so was the jacuzzi. It was not as big as other hotels but more luxurious. Our children are 7 & 9 and they enjoyed it.The drinks at the pool side are not cheap but my children enjoyed the souvenir cups with the Hilton's name on them. They took so many pictures with those cups. Now that is what I call free advertisement. Bring a small cooler with you and put your own water and drinks. I saw a lot of people do that. Order something different just for the experience. The Spa is awesome too but make sure when you book your rooms try to get free admission to the spa. It cost $20 /day, but there is always a way of getting in free. Just talk to somebody at the check-in desk. If you decide on walking the only 3 hotels that you can walk to from Las Vegas Hilton is the Riviera, Circus Circus and Stratosphere. If you don't have a car, rent one if possible or take the Monorail (gets expensive if you are a huge party, but is cheap if your alone). They also have a Trolley that picks you up from the North tower of the hotel. my children and I enjoyed it a lot. If your not in a hurry and don't want to walk in the sun during the day this is great, but it is slow because it passes at almost most of the hotels for only 2.50 a ride and 6.50 for the whole day. they also have three day passes ...... If you have children you will feel very comfortable in this hotel. Even the other two adults that were with us enjoyed it. I saw some young enough children ride the elevators on their own. This is how safe it is over here. I will only recommend this hotel if you get a good price (Friday & Saturday $76 & Sunday $60). I booked my rooms about 2 month ahead of time). I hope you injoy your trip if you decide to go to the Hilton. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in . Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is be on the strip but not bad at all if you have a car since valet is free at all the hotels you just have to give a tip if you want.

I went downstairs and had my room changed. The bell staff were going to help me move my bags, but they never showed up. After 45 minutes, I gave up on them and moved myself. It took me three trips. This Hilton charges $3 per day for the inroom safe. (The Hilton I visited in Austin last week provided one at no charge. Why are they different?) There's no in-room coffee, no minibar, no mouthwash, no soapdish and only one drinking glass. The remote doesn't fully work; I reported it 6 hours ago. Oddly, there are no sources of information in the room. No instructions on how to get on the internet (another daily charge, $12 per day, and it's not wifi). No map of the facility, no list of restaurants. I find this whole experience to be almost like they aren't expecting any guests, and are surprised when someone rings guest services with a question. (When I rang guest services for help connecting my laptop to the internet, she told me I had to do it throught my television. Eventually she provided a number for me to ring for assistance.) I'm disappointed. Barry was great, but the hotel is tired, scruffy and the service is poor.

Not only is this hotel overpriced in every category,(food, shops, etc) but being one long block off the strip doesn't help. Plus, it's the old more run down part of the strip. The addition of the monorail helps, but even that is overpriced! The problem is the convention center its connected to. The convention center has grown so much over the years and now is constantly hosting something. Because of this, the Hilton has no reason to spend money on anything but small upgrades. You see, this is THE place to stay if you are attending a convention due to the fact that it is literally connected to the convention center. Unless of course you don't care shuttling from the center to a different hotel. I personally don't like to do that.

Taxis drop right outside the lobby/check-in area. We had no wait to check in, since there were multiple attendants available. The process was quick and smooth, and our attendant was very accommodating of requests. Note: if you are paying for your room with a Visa/Debit or MC/Debit card, the hotel will place an extra hold of $50 per night on your card (in the event you wish to use room services or charge items to your room.) If you want to strictly pay for the room on your card you must specifically instruct the attendant in order to avoid the hold! LAYOUT: The hotel is easy to navigate. Room are located within 3 towers, all of which are an easy walk from the lobby and casino areas. There are 2 casinos at the Hilton: The Spacequest Casino and the Crystal Casino. The Crystal is fairly standard fare, but the Spacequest is a fun, different look, with overhead lasers, changing lighting in the floors, chromed-out detailing, and neon-chased tubes. Shops and services are all located en route to the room elevators, so overall hotel access is well-planned. Taxis are plentiful off the lobby area, but best of all, the Hilton is a monorail stop, so this hotel makes for easy access to all points of the Strip. ROOMS: We booked a king-size/non-smoking room, and were very pleased with the room appearance. It looked so much nicer in person than online!! Lots of marble and granite touches, plush bed coverlet, modern lighting, inner bathroom sink, outer vanity area sink, and a spacious tub were all positive impressions. Large windows gave a great view of the Stratosphere. We were only a few doors away from the elevators, and had no problems with noise. My only complaint was that the Serta Perfect Sleeper beds were very, very firm. My husband ended up sleeping in the (very comfortable) chair in the room, because the bed was so hard on his back. 3 pillows were provided with the bedding, and a spare was in the closet. Iron, hairdryer, luggage stands, and lockable safe were all provided. The room was thoroughly cleaned and restocked with fresh towels/shampoo/soaps every day. RESTAURANTS: There is a wide variety of food options at the Hilton - hibachi, sushi, Chinese, all-American, Mexican, or buffet. Prices varied, but were all reasonable. We enjoyed the buffet immensely - breakfast, champagne brunch, and dinners. Choice of beer and wines were included with dinner buffet, and meat-eaters, rejoice! There was no shortage of meat and seafood options at this buffet, both breakfasts and dinners alike. We enjoyed several stops at Quark's Bar for lunches, dinners, and drinks. Their food is fun to order, and is presented in a unique way. I love the atmosphere there... even if you are not a Trekkie, it's good stuff. ATTRACTIONS: The shops were somewhat of a letdown for me. Very overpriced, in my opinion, and nothing out of the ordinary. There are not a lot of shopping options at the Hilton, but I did appreciate the \"business center,\" a packaging/mail station that would make this hotel a good spot for business travelers. The Star Trek Experience would have been too costly at full-price, but at the Half Price ticket location, $20 per person was well worth it! Both the Borg Invasion and the Klingon Encounter were amazing, and I'm not even really \"into\" the whole Trek thing. I think that you would need to be die-hard Trekkie to enjoy the Trek museum and shopping options in the Spacequest area, but the 4-D rides are a great experience. Spring for it! The pool looks very nice, but we didn't use them during this visit, so I can't make any comment to that end. Casino and Sports Book aside, we didn't really sense much of a night-pulse at the Hilton. The Tempo Lounge was mellow, and there isn't a night club onsite. Hop the monorail to livelier locales, if you are seeking nighttime attractions. CHECK-OUT: Smooth sailing, once again. Our bill was accurate, and while we had no wait at all, there was also drop-box check-out available. Taxis were available right outside. It's about a $30 trip to the airport, with heavy traffic. OTHER: Overall, we had a very good experience at the Hilton! If you book on the hotel website, be sure to check back frequently for rate changes.

If however you can get a good deal at the Hilton its definitely decent although not what you're normally expect from a Hilton.

A tip I learned from first stay. DONT get a room even remotely near the elevator, the noise is horrendous.

If you book this hotel at the right times [non convention in town] the price/value is great, this trip got a group rate of 4179 per night, I tried to add on a Saturday, which would have been $450 a night [I passed] I've booked this other times for $79, watch the rates book well in advance. Initially I had a problem, the average bland room I was given, it was 60 degrees, outside it was 64, I wanted my room warmer, but the heater didnt work. After many attempts of getting it looked at by housekeeping or engineering, they finally moved me to an upgraded recently renovated room in the North tower. WOW what a difference. MUCH nice rooms and amenities. 42\" plasma screen TV, printer in room, new furniture and much nicer bedding, European style pillows and comforters. Scale in bathroom in case one monitors the results of Las Vegas buffets, just much better then their average rooms. I am told that eventually all rooms will be the new renovated style. The highlight of my stay this trip [Nov 12-17th 2006] was getting invited to a private party in the \"Elvis suite\" on the top floor.

I am glad I didn't have to pay for this hotel because it really would not have been worth it. As you may or may not know the Hilton is WAY off the strip. Luckily the monorail has a station at the hotel so you are able to get around fairly easily. One other bonus is that it is near some of the older parts of the strip so if you are into gambling there are some low table minimums. Not to mention you are closer to some of the more \"colorful\" parts of Vegas. If you are not as into color as much as I am I would suggest taking the monorail south to the flashy hotels. The hotel itself is sort of a Bally's kind of place, which means no theme and very little character of it's own. The rooms are decent, like any nice Motel 6 and the like. Somewhat rundown with little details that are starting to fail like the towel caddy in the bathroom one nut from collapse. The floors, ceiling and walls are very thin and you can hear everything, and I mean everything around you. The staff are average in their service and quality with nothing to crow about or cry about. The tables at the Hilton are usually $10 no matter what time of the day and the slots are pretty tight. The sports book is another subject all together, this place is huge. How can you not like a place with more screens than anywhere else and football beers holding 50 ounces of malted goodness. Overall it was a decent hotel.

We were worried about how our stay would be after reading some of the overly critical reviews. We are used to staying at nice hotels, and didn't want a bad one. We were very happily suprised after checking in, to see that our room was very nice, and clean, and suprised also, that it was not one of the renovated rooms. We had marble counters and shelves, and a desk under the window which stretched the entire length of the room. The windows had automatic curtains. The room was in great shape. It is off the strip a 1/2 mile or so, so it is quite a walk to go to the other hotels. We did it a couple times, but we also rented a minivan with GPS, so we used it and parked in the other hotel's garages (which all have free parking) often. It was nice to get off the strip and back to the hotel to get out of the crowd. The parking garage at the Hilton is well lit, and clean, and has security in front of it all night long. We only ate at the Hilton one time all week. I wouldn't recommend it. At least not where we ate, which was the mexican restaurant. The food was forgettable, and the margaritas, which were 11 dollars, were watered down. Best bet for food is to go to the newest hotels on the strip and find their buffets. We ate at Paris, Mandalay Bay, Aladin. All these hotels' buffets were amazing! I also heard Wynn's buffet was great too.

The spa was worth the $20 use fee in my opinion; it appeared newly remodeled, with good quality aerobic and weights machines, and three whirpools in the men's facility. The casino has all the games you could want and then some. Table limits don't push out the low roller. The sports book is huge with more big screens than I could count. The monorail is especially convenient with a stop directly at the hotel, making travel to Strip properties easier. A few minor complaints: - Room temperature is adjusted by manually turning the fan on/off and moving a slider between hot and cold. It's sensitive in switching between heating and air conditioning, and hard to get to \"just right\". A thermostat would be much better. - There is an $11.99 charge for 24 hours of internet access in the room; free would be better, but I think most LV hotels apply a similar charge. Laptop internet is via ethernet cable, no wireless available. It looked like there was free wireless access available in the coffee shop downstairs, judging by the number of patrons using laptops there, but I did not try this out. - There is a fee to use the in-room safe.

The front desk staff was very accomodating and check in was a breeze. I recommend you specifically ask for one of their 'newly renovated rooms' in the north tower. The casino was nice because it wasn't jam packed with people, even on Friday and Saturday night when all the strip casinos were stuffed with holiday travelers. There were plenty of $.05 video poker machines, and most of them paid enough to let you play for awhile on their dollar. The Paradise Cafe had good food, but was a bit overpriced. We totally enjoyed the breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets in the hotel. Reasonably priced with a pretty diverse range of choices. Their mini macadamia pies were to die for!!! :o) The rooms were pleasantly decorated and suprisingly quite. One night my husband did have to get up at 4:30am to break up the hallway party, but that was the extent of any noise or disturbance. If you are going to Vegas for a little R & R, I highly recommend spending the $150 for a private cabana in the pool area. We spent a wonderfully relaxing day with our friends playing games, watching the plasma screen TV, drinking cocktails, eating delicously fattening foods and indulging in an occaisional nap. The cabana boy (David) was very accomodating and kept us cool with the occaisional misting from his water bottle. For all of you considering staying at the Hilton, just remember, it is what you make it. If you treat the staff with respect, they in turn will treat you with respect and see to it that your needs are met.

Was a little worried after reading a lot of negative reviews, but found it was above our expectations. We checked in as Hilton Honors members, and were given a nice room in the east tower. The room had been upgraded with lots of granite in the bathroom and the window desk/shelf. No issues as previous posters had with crappy peeling wallpaper rooms. The pool area was great as it has a large pool with an even larger deck area on multi levels. You can see the pool from all points on the deck no matter how far away you chose to sit. It's important to be able to see the pool from your chaise. This meant we were able to hang out where we wanted, but did not feel crampled. There were areas with shade and misting systems, and even a dude who came by and misted you with a pocket sprayer. There was music pumped throught out the area but with small speakers everywhere, the sound was never loud or annoying, The music was a mix of everything from the 80's to todays hits. There was a 2 for 1 happy hour from 5 to 8pm. In addition there was a one man band for entertainment. Now that sounds goofy but he put on a great show. His Strat electric guitar and mike were hooked up via wireless to the PA. The rest of his band is in his laptop,which was connected to the PA as well. He strolls around the deck and sings and interacts with everyone. Drank too much bit had a great time. Lets compare that to the pool at the Alladin where we also stayed. It has two smaller pools with chaise lounge chairs around the perimiter. That's where everyone wants to hang out and its gets very crowded. The rest of the deck area is large ,unshaded, and you can't see the pool. That's why the pool deck is crowded, yet the rest of the deck goes unoccupied. It would feel like you are tanning on a chaise in the middle of a concrete parking lot, without a view of the pool. So we enjoyed the Hilton Pool which was lively and a lot of fun. The monorail is outside the doors of the Hilton. It is great to be able to use this form of transport to get to other hotels. We went to the Beach at Mandalay to catch the UB40 show. The cost is almost ten bucks return but is less than a cab. It is what it is, and can't be compared to the cost of public transport. Interestingly after dark, the monorail car interior lights are bright when loading, but dim down as soon as the mono starts moving. Thats a great feature when returning back to the Hilton late in the evening. PS Most hotels charge for high speed internet in the room. Hilton does as well, but the Fortuna cofee shop near the check in lobby has free wireless. It you sit at the high counter along the back wall. you find lots of plugs to connnect your laptop power supply as well. We ate in the Star Trek restaurant, which serves basic Applebees type of food that was OK. It was neat to have the Ferengi's and Romulans roaming around as you dine. It's the experience and decor rather than the food. Had dinner in Benihana's as well. Our chef was boring, and could have mailed in his performance.

I asked for a room in the North Tower (reading the reviews it appeared to be the one with the least complaints) but was informed that they did not have any King sized non-smoking in that tower with a strip view. I was then given a room in the East Tower. To my surpise the room was huge, I mean like 500+ sq ft. There was nothing wrong with the room, but the view was not of the southern side of the strip, but of the northern side of the strip. The room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last year or so. No strains on the carpet or chairs. The tile was a little slick when wet so watch out. The service might have been the only downfall. 1) The curbside check in for the luggage was bizzare as they indicated that I would need to pick my bags back at the lobby. Most hotels have the option to have your bags brought up to your room. Confirmed this at check in as well. When I went to get my bags the bell person asked if I wanted it delivered to my room. I was a bit confused. 2) When I checked in they person forgot to print me my $25.00 gambling voucher. This caused a minor wait as I had to get back in line to get the voucher. This took less than 5 minutes. 3) Asked for a \"Do not Distrub Sign\" for the room and an extra pillow. The person on the phone told me it would be about 30 minutes and it took about 45 minutes. This is a push as we were no longer going out for the evening. As far as location goes, the monorail runs about every 6-7 minutes and your can get an 24 hours pass for $15 each. Please be aware that the pass last for 24 hours so hold off on buying one till you have to. For the 3 days that I was there, I only had to buy one.

The sandwiches available outside the convention area were fresh and very tasty. When my disabled brother needed a break from walking back and forth from his room to the convention, a motorized scooter was available for only $30/day. It made a world of difference for him. We were able to utilize the Handicapped line at the Paradise Caf\u00e9 so wait-time was minimal. Thank you, LV Hilton. Sorry to everyone who we pre-empted. My room was large, with two beds, a gorgeous view of the Strip, nice big tub and bathroom, with lots of space for everything. Early check-in (noon) was hassle-free, thanks to the young lady (Tiffany?), who was helpful and polite. I had changed my flight arrival time, but hadn\u2019t thought to call and request early check-in. But Tiffany handled it graciously. She called the bell desk because I needed help with my bags. I waited and waited. Nobody showed up, so I had to haul them to my room myself. Nice exercise. Really. Housekeeping always did a good job tidying up daily. The AC was perfect, with the settings easily changed. Access to the Monorail was easy and much appreciated. My brother was able to take the scooter on it. We were able to dash over to the MGM Grand to catch Tom Jones Sunday night. NEEDS WORK I missed Fox News and will write Hilton requesting that they carry it. I missed having an exercise center. When I walked around the hotel one afternoon, it was way too hot so I gave up exercising while I was there. But I was on vacation, after all. The only difficulty with the staff was when I requested the check one night at dinner at the Paradise Caf\u00e9. At breakfast, it took forever to get our check, so at dinner, I decided to ask for it when the waiter brought our meal. For some odd reason, the waiter (a short, chubby fellow with \u2013thar in his name) kept forgetting to bring it. I politely asked him several times, but he kept brushing me off. It took four requests to get our check! How odd. I only gave him a 10% tip. Had he brought it in a timely manner, he would have had a 20% tip with an honorable mention here. Poor \u2013thar. Oh, yeah, having dragged myself downstairs around 4:30 am for breakfast so I could catch at early flight, nobody was around to take my order for nearly 10 minutes.

I had read many reviews on this site before booking the Hilton, and I must say that the Hilton was better than what I expected. Positive experiences with the Hilton: 1. Quick, hassle-free check-in. There was no line-up, and the process was quick and painless. Mind you, we checked in early in the morning. Technically they didn't have to give us a room until official check-in time, but they gave us one right away. 2. Our room was big and clean. I was surprised at how big our room was - lots of room for opened luggage and bags. And it was really clean - no unpleasant surprises anywhere. 3. This hotel is not as hectic as some of the others. Hotels/casinos that are more central on the strip (Casino Royale; Bellagio; Paris; Ceasars; Flamingo; MGM) are absolutely packed with pedestrian traffic, inside and outside. The Hilton Las Vegas provides relief from this environment - something we appreciated at the end of the day. 4. I think we did all right in the price department. I paid just under $80 CAN per night for two people. This came with a free $25 gaming chip, which we blew all at once on the roulette table (we should have bet on black). I find that you can get good package deals to the US at [------------]. Negative experiences with Hilton: 1. Really it comes down to one major negative experience - hotel service. And I can give two major examples: First, the lady at the designated Hilton help desk, which is in the same area as check-in, was completely useless. We asked her what was going on at the Convention Centre, which is next to the Hilton, and she had no idea. She suggested we look for ads/billboards on the street that might inform us. She made no attempt to place calls on our behalf, to use the computer in front of her, or ask a competent colleague. After that, we asked her about the Las Vegas city transit system, such as the fare system and day passes. Once again she had no idea, and suggested we find out by asking the bus driver. I think a trained monkey would have been more helpful. Secondly, the drink servers in the slot machine areas were horrible at the Hilton - particularly in the Star Trek-themed area. We could be playing the slots for an hour, and no one would stop by to take our drink order. My wife hunted them down, and found two of them socializing together by the bar. When she asked them to get us drinks, they layed on the attitude and said to wait for the designated server to come to our slot machine area. Slot machine drink service was much better at other hotels, such as the Golden Nugget, Treasure Island, and especially Paris. Once again, bring in the trained monkeys, Hilton. (Oh yeah, there was one day the maid did not replace our used towels with fresh ones, but I'm assuming that this was just an oversight. We had been tipping both the maids and the drink servers). If it weren't for these negative customer service experiences, I would have given the Hilton Las Vegas a perfect score. There are other minor negative experiences that I could mention: The pool is small and easily crowded (by kids); Barry Manilow is so expensive - over $100/person for the cheapest tickets; It's about a 15-minute walk to the strip from the hotel; the Star Trek Experience (which is in the Hilton) was quite a let-down, especially for the price - don't go unless you're a Trekker/Trekkie). I was going to order a Warp Core Breach drink at Quark's bar until I found out it was $25 US each. Other helpful tips (that don't have to do with Hilton): * The Las Vegas city bus system is deplorable. It makes the Toronto bus transit system look stellar, which is saying a lot. There were 3 separate occassions in which we were waiting for the bus for at least an hour (they're supposed to run every 30 minutes) - two times at two different outlet malls, and one time in downtown Vegas. In the latter example, we waited such a long time for a bus in downtown Vegas that we decided to walk South until it came along - well we walked all the way to the North strip and the bus never came. Also, riding the bus along the dense, congested strip will be one of the most frustrating experiences of your life - I'm pretty sure I saw 90-year-olds passing us on foot. * The good thing about the transit system is that for $5/person you get an all-day bus pass that lasts for 24 hours. But good luck finding a bus when you need one. * Shopping: Look for a store called \"Ross\" on the north part of the strip, not too far from the Riviera. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but we found great deals here on brand name clothing. I would say it was even better than the outlets. You just have to do some digging to find some good items (it's like a Winners, only much cheaper, and even less organized). Surprisingly, we even found deals at the Fashion Mall on the strip. * Never pay full price for shows. There are a few discount ticket booths along the strip, including one just south of the Riviera. We got discounted tickets to David Copperfield, Mystere, Legends, Crazy Girls, and the Star Trek Experience. The first two shows mentioned were amazing, Mystere being the best. * There are some free shows, such as the MGM lions, the (Mirage?) volcano, the Treasure Island pirate/ship battle, and Ceasar's creepy automatrons. My favourite was the Bellagio water fountains synchronized to music (I believe it occurs every 30 minutes starting at 3:00 PM). * The Shark Reef at the Mandalay is worth the trip and price. I love aquariums, so I'm a little biased. I've included an interesting picture here from the Shark Reef. If you go after 6:00 PM, you get discounted tickets. * Drinks are free at all the casinos! As long as you're gambling (even the penny slots), and as long as you're not expecting service at the Hilton, you get free alcoholic beverages. And I'm not talking about cheap beer. We got Coronas, Heiniken (spelling?), strawberry daiquiris, and Long Island iced teas. * You can freely drink alcohol on the street!", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cTrekker Heaven\u201d", "Author": "LittleRedhead", "ReviewID": "UR5487406", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton July 14th-July 17th and enjoyed our stay.

My friend and I enjoy Sci Fi so we loved Quark's Bar and the Star Trek Experience. Quark's Bar and Restaurant is moderately pricey but the portions are large and food is well prepared. Having actors walk around, dressed as Star Trek aliens who mingled with the guests at the restaurant was great. I recommended the Warp Corp Breech for those who enjoy alcoholic drinks. We did some gambling in the casino and played the slots some but that got rather boring for us after awhile and we didn't do a whole lot of that stuff.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cVery Decent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Iluvehotels", "ReviewID": "UR5471742", "Content": "Stayed at the Hilton for one night.

We stayed: Treasure Island, June 25 - 28 the Rio June 28 - July 2 the Las Vegas Hilton July 2 - 7. The Las Vegas Hilton is owned by Resorts International, a casino chain that we know from our trips to Atlantic City. It was first opened by a Hilton, and it still has preserved an old world charm. I especially liked the crystal chandeliers in the casino and the elegent hallways in the hotel. We were there for the 4th of July. Several of the other guests were badly behaved, mostly due to drunkeness. That made the experience much less fun. We witnessed a horrible verbal fight at the elevators that would have turned into a fist fight if one nasty man had not been held back by a family member. It started when another guest said to him, \"The line for the elevator is back here.\" The fat pig drunk started swearing and swinging his fists. He appeared to have several small children in tow - great parent, not. There were other incidents at the pool and at the buffet where the guests seemed very piggish. I have never seen so much food wasted as what the guests left behind at the Hilton buffet. The buffet dining area was trashed by the guests! We only ate there twice. The offerings, preparations and presentations were fine. The hotel room was very old fashion, but I do like old fashion, especially if it is clean and well preserved, which it was. The room was much smaller than what we had at TI and Rio, but we were comfortable and fine. The AC was great. We we located in the north tower, 11th floor overlooking the strip. Great view! I had never been to Las Vegas Hilton. My husband had played there previously only briefly after attending work at the convention center. We received a summer rate promotion which reeled us in. We paid and average of $50 a night, plus $3 per night for the in room safe. We did not receive food vouchers nor free play as in other casinos. Our cash back credit covered one night and several meals upon check out, but still the comps were better at the previous two stays during this trip. I loved the Space Quest Casino, especially in the evening when they showed 80's music videos. The bar at Space Quest was good, the bartender was very nice. The best for me was the proximity to the monorail. We came down our elevator, walked through the Space Quest Casino and walked directly to the monorail entrance. We purchased the 72 hour pass and spent our last 72 hours tripping down the strip. We found ourselves returning to Harrah's to eat and gamble. Their 3 million give away with daily swipes and give aways lured us away from the Hilton. The woman who checked us into the Hilton, the towel handlers at the pool, the bartender at the Space Quest and the young boy who held our bags after check out were great. All other employees were rather worthless. Especially bad were the desk employees at the Bell desk and the front desk employees on the evening of July 4th. I wish I had taken their names, I would file a formal complaint. They were unhelpful and lacked knowledge when asked questions. The front desk people gave very incorrect information about the fireworks that the Hilton displayed that evening. Also poor were the employees at the Rewards booth. We had been their several times and no one offered us information about the Thursday night \"spin the wheel\" in the Space Quest Casino. We only received entries for our last day there. We lost five days of entries because no one mentioned it. The restaurants and shops were very overpriced. Things cost much more than at the TI and the Rio, both being more upscale places than the Hilton. Once we purchased the monorail pass, we left the Hilton for all meals and purchases. Lastly, before checking out I moved the two blue bottles of water from the cabinet over the television to replace on the desk. After considering the other guests and their nasty behaviors, I examined the bottles and noticed that the caps were not attached to the bottles! I called in a maid, Regina (by now I decided I had better start recording names). I showed her the bottles and said, \"You have cleaned this room. You know that these bottles were over the television. We did not drink them.\" She responded that whoever cleaned the room after the last guests checked out must have not noticed, that normally the bottles are checked, that this has been a problem in the past, and she commented that it was good that I had checked. I only wish that I had checked when we arrived. Bottled water in the room is a stupid idea! I expect that the Hilton will send offers, because we played a fairly large amount of money. But, I would hope the other places we played at book us first. I would probably return to the Hilton, but would rather be elsewhere.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for the Price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5446917", "Content": "Just returned from the Las Vegas Hilton yesterday and found that it was above my expections.

We stayed on the 10th floor of the east wing and our room was clean and nice sized. Yes there are no coffee makers in the room b/c they want you to buy the coffee from the coffee shop in the room. I know most of your Vegas hotels don't have coffee makers in the room b/c they all have coffee shops. We also had some friends staying at Ceasars while we there and they said our room was just as nice if not nicer, they said it was definitely bigger. The only downfall is that it is off the strip (which we were aware of before booking) an monorails could add up to some money if you don't have a car. We had a rental car so it was not a problem getting to strip locations. The only downfall I found of this hotel is that if you don't gamble enough to get $10 or more in comps then you have to spend your comp money in their gift shop. I rec'd $9.52 so I had buy something from one of their shops & I had $4 in comps from sports book gambling and I had to use those comps in their sandwich shop Vegas Subs.

Our room was on 21st floor of North Tower, we had a view of the Strip, the Hilton sign and even of the pool. We did take the monorail to the Strip, very convenient however it broke down the second evening so we took a cab the next day and that was fine too.

Between the four of us, we've stayed in hotels all over the country, including Las Vegas hotels in all areas at all levels (IP, Nugget, Plaza, Monte Carlo, MGM, TI, Riviera, Harrah's . . . you get the picture). I know people who've stayed at most of the other strip resorts and I've talked with them about their experiences. I have relatives, one of whom is included in my Las Vegas Hilton annual extravaganza, who have worked in the hotel industry for years. I can tell you this . . . . The Las Vegas Hilton is, bar none, the finest Las Vegas experience going. I continue to be amazed that people fail to realize that a hotel, any hotel, when the lights go out, is this: Two double beds, a bathroom and a color television. That's it. A standard room at the swankiest hotel on the strip is no better than the base room at a Motel 6 when the lights go out, so long as these rules apply: 1. The door locks. 2. The TV works. 3. The toilet flushes. 4. The plumbing drains. 5. The water is hot. 6. The air conditioning allows you to hang meat in the room. 7. The room is relatively clean. That's it. The snobs who complain that the pillows weren't right, the air conditioner rattled a little or the safe cost $3 to hide their $2000 watch are just that, snobs, who won't be pleased if they are hung with a new rope. Hotel service employees don't make much money, and to expect them to kiss your toes because they don't make coffee and bring it to your room with a smile and the paper is quite frankly pompous and annoying. You're sleeping there. If you're spending that much time in your room, you should stay home and save money. It's a place to sleep, pee and shower. That's it. The Hilton offers all of the essentials I noted above. I've stayed on most floors, in all three towers, and at most price ranges. The staff has been accomodating to our needs, which aren't much. Our biggest fight comes when we want to stuff two rollaways into a two queen room, and we've won that argument every time, most trips only paying for one of the rollaways. In addition, the casino is large, wonderful, bright, and has $5 tables at most times. The coffee shop offers what a coffee shop should, which is two eggs over easy and a steak to a drunk guy at 2 am for about $5, less when they have the special. People who want to be served with a smile and a kiss at a Las Vegas coffee shop at 2 a.m. need to get over it. Eat and go to bed. The mexican place has good food, and the steak house is spectacular. There's a Pizza Hut Express, a foo foo coffee and bagel shop, and a mighty fine Japanes place. The sports book is by far the best in the city. The waitresses in that book are fast, they remember gamblers from year to year, and a $1 ($2 every so often) tip keeps the beer coming cold and often. When you're hungry back there, go to Vegas Subs and grab an Arthur Godfrey, or the pastrami special. If you order what's on the menu, and don't get a Reuben, but without the sauerkraut, and on a hoagie instead of rye, and with rare roast beef instead of corned beef, with mayo, instead of mustard, you'll be pleased. The monorail is RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL. I'll repeat that . . .IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL. Thirty seconds from the casino and any restaurant, a minute from the show room. Yeah, it costs $5, but better passes are available, and remember, you're planning to park your can on a slot stool and shove $50 to $100 into a machine that doesn't take you anywhere. A cab ride, with a $3.20 meter drop and 25 cents for 1/8 of a mile, will be twice that to anywhere except the Riviera, which you can walk to if you can get your rear end out of your Rascal. The pool is the best I've seen. Bar right close, great hot tub, pool deep enough to actually swim, free towels, reasonable cabanas, televisions to keep track of your football parlay cards, restroom close by, and FANTASTIC VIEW OF THE STRIP. Check in is generally smooth. I've arrived at all hours, from 7:00 a.m. to midnight, and my room has always been ready. I don't gamble enough to draw the attention of the comp guys (that's not true, actually . . .I don't draw attention to my gambling enough by shouting \"HEY, I PUT $10 IN THIS MACHINE, I NEED TICKETS TO PENN AND FREAKING TELLER AND A BUFFET PASS OVER HERE), but quite frankly I've never asked, and I don't plan to. I don't care about getting stuff I don't need or want free just because it's supposedly \"coming to me.\" I want to bet on sports and horse racing, I want to drink free (for tips) while I'm doing that, and I want to toss the dice and look at cards. When I get tired of that, I want to go to the pool and drink beer, or I want to take a nap. If I don't like where I'm presently losing my money at, I want to move on easily. The Hilton offers all of this. The Hilton is big enough to offer all the amenities one wants, and it's small enough to keep one from hyperventilating when moving from place to place. The rooms offer sleep and security. It's on the monorail, there are always cabs, and the rates are right. Stay here . . . And if you're there over Columbus Day weekend, look up the three or four drunk guys in the sports book that look like they're having a great time and say \"Hey\" Maybe we'll tell our favorite waitress to bring you a beer on her next trip through. I'm sure she will.

I grew up camping and backpacking, staying in cheap and seedy hotels, and just being excited to have a hot shower....so a stay at a hilton is luxury to me! That being said....I recently had an experience at the LV Hilton that I am never going to forget! Let me briefly set the scene....I was really excited to go to Vegas for two reasons: 1) I'd never been there and 2) I was going to Vegas to get married. I lived in Florida and my fiance is a sailor in the navy, stationed in California. So Vegas was a nice neutral place to throw two families together. My family isn't made of money, so we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel, that was comfortable, but wouldn't break the bank for anyone coming to the wedding. The Hilton had solid reviews and a good price tag. So away we went! I arrived with my family a day before my fiance got into Vegas. We checked in, I received 2 full beds instead of 2 queens, which was sort of annoying, but I'm not picky. Our main complaint at this point was that our entire wedding party (twenty people and about 12 rooms) were scattered all over the hotel. We booked a solid 2 months ahead, and called two weeks, and a week before we got there to make sure that our rooms were together. They never were...but oh well! That first night I went to bed and woke up at roughly 6 am to a sound that I can only describe as a mix between a jet engine and an earthquake. At first I thought it was the air conditioner, so I played with that, to no avail. Then I figured out it was the pipes. I went into the bathroom and played with the faucet on the bathtub until I thought I had figured out how to make it go away. It did it again at 8 am when I was in the bathtub...there I am in the tub relaxing and all of a sudden I thought a plane was about to take off in my hotel room. It stopped after about 5 minutes and a lot of jiggling with the faucet. So the next day my fiance got in, I hadn't seen him in 2 months and all I wanted to do was lay in our hotel room and spend some time together. We went to sleep at around 11 and at 2 am the plane decided to take off again in our room, it scared the bejesus out of my fiance and I proceeded to bound out of bed into the cold hotel room to play with the faucet on my bathtub. It did it again at 6 am and at this point we were just too tired and annoyed to care and just laid there for the 5 minutes until it decided to go away by itself. I had given up on the idea of sleeping well anytime in the next 3 days but my father found out about our room and got us a new one. We packed up our stuff that afternoon and headed over to our new room. We had places to go and wedding stuff to do so we just dropped our luggage off in the room and took off. We had dinner at Hard Rock that night with my family (loads of fun, they made us stand on top of chairs and blow out a candle on a sundae when they found out we were getting married, and I'll never forget my entire family doing YMCA along with the music as long as I live) and then KA (at the MGM Grand....if youve got the money...go see it!!!!!!). We got back pretty late from KA, at around 12:30 at night, and just wanted to get into our bed and sleep. We got back to the hotel and I walked straight to my luggage and my fiance went into the bathroom to pee. At that instant he yelled \"did you leave the sink running???!!!\"....\"ummmm no\" I said, and came over to see what he was talking about. The tile floor in our bathroom and leading into our bedroom was covered in water. At that moment I put two and two together. When we had first gotten into the new room I noticed what looked like silt on the inside of the sink. I thought nothing of it and just rinsed out the sink and the black silt and left. When we found the room flooded I figured it out, our sinks had backed up and overflown. So I sent him down to get us a new room and packed all out stuff back up for the second move of our 3 day trip. They wouldn't give him the keys because the room was under my name...at this piont I was getting annoyed and went back downstairs with him to get us a new room. The woman was nice, but...well...when I told her our room was flooded...she said \"do you need a new room right now??\" and I, in the most polite way I could muster, said \"let me explain, our room is flooded, as in both sinks are filled with water and our floor is covered with water...its completely unusable\". So....they upgraded us to a second floor luxury room....and by 1:30 we made it into our new room. It was impressive to say the least.....two flat screen tv's, marble sinks and tile, a walk in shower with a waterfall showerhead, down pillows and comforter, a living room area, and a king size bed. But before we got to bed, we throughly walked through and inspected the room, because my fiance and I were absolutly convinced there had to be something wrong with it. Well we didn't find anything and had an excellent nights sleep. Now you would think this would be the end of our adventure at the LV Hilton, but you would be sooooo wrong. We got up that morning, with only enough time to take a shower before we had to head off. So we decided to save time and simply take a shower together. We got in and lathered up, but we had left the sliding door to the shower/toilet room open (it was seperate from the sinks). My fiance wanted to close it so we could get some nice sauna/hot air action going on in the shower. So he popped out, half in the shower, half out, and gently pulled the lever on the sliding door to shut it. Well it shut...and when it did, 3 tiles came flying off the wall in the shower at me. I screamed and then started laughing....there's what we were looking for last night....there HAD to be something wrong with the room. He wanted to get out immediately but it was just some broken tile and we really didnt have time to deal with it, so I just pushed it into a corner with my foot. We continued our nice shower, although, we often accidently stepped on a peice of tiny broken tile I had missed. When my father checked us out he told them what had happened, with all three rooms, and they did give us 7 buffet vouchers.....but I honestly just don't think that was enough. I had to laugh though, no one else in our wedding party had quite the time that we did...there stays were all quite normal and I was happy for that. So, that being said, I'm not sure how to sum up my experience with the LV Hilton. It is a hotel that is certainly showing it's age, that is certain. Are you guaranteed an experience anywhere close to mine? No....but the thing to remember....is that it is possible....because it happened to me. Some people might think I made this up.....but I don't think I could have made this experience up if I tried!", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cJust like other Vegas rooms\u201d", "Author": "SoCalTrekker", "ReviewID": "UR5205034", "Content": "My wife and I just came back from an impromptu trip to Vegas and stayed at the LV Hilton.

Not a problem for us because we drove but the Tram station is right next to the hotel. Hilton is also close to the Stratesphere, the Sahara and the Stardust so it has somewhat of a Strip feel to it. Hotel: Exterior: Standard Vegas hotel-bright with a giant marquee. The shape of the hotel is interesting but otherwise unexciting. Self-parking is a fairly long drive from the entrance and somewhat confusing (two entrances). Also the road leading to the parking garage is rough because of the uneven stones/bricks. Interior: Star Trek Theme with Barry Manilow pictures. The self parking was quite a ways from the Check-in counter but I guess that's fair for trying to save on the valet tip. The feel was quite new and the casino was lively but not too loud. Not too much smoke. Check-in: Went well, no problems. Room: Pretty standard Vegas room. The bathroom was a little small with shower and toilet in a separate room while the sink/make-up area was part of the \"bedroom\". The furniture was a little dated but not bad.

The hotel is showing it's age. The elevators were slow and too few for that large of a hotel. (We were on the 21st floor in the North Tower.) We had a decent view towards the strip, but the daytime look isn't much to get excited about. My chief complaint is the distance to the strip. You can hop in a taxi (about $10 + tip) or onto the monorail ($5/one way-$15/all day) to get down to the strip. The monorail is a great deal, but one day we were in hurry to return to the Hilton when we stood for 30 minutes during a mechanical problem (and they didn't communicate to us when or if it would resume working) and ended up hopping a taxi anyways. Otherwise our experience with the monorail was smooth and reliable. We found the staff at the hotel to be helpful, but no one goes out of their way. We didn't require any special attention so we were not disappointed. We did not use the pool as we were there for only two days. I will say this: I'm not a trekkie and the whole Star Trek thing is not my bag. I'm also not 21 and watching young drunk adults walking around with a 1/2 yard long marguerita at all hours of the day was a bit like stumbling into spring break daytona beach.

I asked if we could have adjoining high floor rooms overlooking the strip and we were extremely pleased with the rooms we got. Yes, I've stayed in nicer hotel rooms, however the room was clean, large and had all of the facilities that you would expect from a large chain hotel (except tea/coffee/minibar, but they don't want you drinking in your rooms - they want you to spend money downstairs in the casino). We ate at the buffet twice and it was extremely good both times. We did have to queue for about 40 minutes second time round though because it was a Sunday morning and very busy. Didn't really gamble much as it's not our thing but we did try the poker at the bar where you get constant free drinks (we were actually gaining here because we were drinking more than we were gambling)!! Also tried the blackjack but didn't have any luck. All of the staff we encountered at the hotel were extremely friendly. We purchased monorail tickets to get us to the strip ($35 for a ten ride shareable pass). We had to buy two of these over the 5 day visit. We also got a few taxis at night but these were only around $10 which is nothing between four people. The fact that the hotel was off strip was quite nice because you didn't have as many people wandering round the hotel. Didn't do the Star Trek experience as we didn't have time but it did look quite good. Went to see Mystere whilst we were there at Treasure Island. Very good show but not really our cup of tea.

It was our first time in Vegas and we did not want to stay in one of those overpriced mega places. Hilton Las Vegas is still large but you do not feel lost (we looked around in the MGM Grand, Venetian, Paris, Treasure Island and you need maps to get around in them). Checkin was quick but not friendly. I have a HHonors Gold VIP card but checkin person did not seem to care. No free breakfast, upgrades or other comps. Room was good. I could not compare with other rooms but it was spacious and looked renovated. Room was located in the central tower on the 24th floor. View of Stratosphere tower and the hotel delivery entrance was ok but not great. A lot of noise came from what looked like central airconditioning (I could clearly see the big ventilators) even though we were on the 24th floor and I was wondering what this must sound like on the 5th floor. Could not find construction work but then again did not walk around on the floors. After complaining with the front desk on the second day about the Hilton HHonors extras that we did not get we were informed that the hotel did not provide room upgrades, I should get a paper delivered, should get free breakfast and free health club access. Breakfast buffet ended at 11.00. For HHonors at 10.00. I complained at 10.15 but got nothing (so missed one free breakfast for 2). No excuses made. She informed me that I should get this days paper today (special delivery) and tomorrows paper tomorrow but nothing happened. No papers delivered. Was not bothered to complain. When you are in Vegas you should party and not complain. Good things about the hotel: because we were gambling (not a lot, spend about $150), we got: - comp free buffet dinner for 2 - comp free meal in Paradise Cafe for 2 - comp drinks (probably worth over $100) this made up for the HHonors issue and unfriendlyness of the front desk staff but was not thanks to being a gold VIP. What else to say: buffet (breakfast and dinner) is good quality if you like buffets. Good choice of food and it is warm for a change. Paradise Cafe looks like it could use a 20 years update (if anyone from Hilton is reading this: it is not the eighties anymore!) both for the restaurant and the staff. Food is overpriced looking at value for money. Vegas Subs: better close this down and open a new subs place. One of the most outdated places in the entire hotel. Ordered a tuna sandwich and a bagel and only got the tuna sandwich. How difficult is it to deliver what was ordered. Staff was joking around among themselves all the time we were there (sat down for 45 minutes) and did not seem to care about customers. Regarding the Monorail: quick access (it is actually attached to the hotel) but it has got some technical issues (a number of times it was delayed and a computer voice informed us it was because of technical problems). If you expect that the Monorail will save you a lot of walking: mistake. Monorail brings you to the back of the major hotels on the Venetian site of the Strip. If you want to go to the strip itself or hotels accross the street (like Belaggio) it is still a lot of walking. Overall, the Hilton Las Vegas is outdated.

In the past, we have informed the staff of our disatisfaction with the bathrooms (ie. disconnected soap dish showing black mold behind the tiles, wet carpets, etc) and every effort has been made to fix the problem. We were even credited two nights on one occasion due to the bathroom condition. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful. One thing that could use improvement would be the customer service in the reservation process. There have been times when I have asked for my confirmation information to be faxed or emailed up to three or four times before receiving a response. I've even had a reservationist impatiently say that they'll \"send it again\" although I had not received it the first time. Each time I call, I feel like I'm in a lottery and I cross my fingers each time that I'll get one of the few reservationists who are friendly and helpful.

Four hours and two calls later, it finally arrived. We went to the only open restaurant around 4AM and were literally watched by someone who seemed to be the manager. He sat at a table a few feet away. When we ordered a bottle of wine (for three, not unreasonable), the wait staff was perplexed. They seemed only to know about individual drinks... yes, whole bottles were on the menu. The same guy who was watching us then came over and asked if we were staying in the hotel. Only then did the wine come out, in individual glasses. We had been very polite, not at all loud, and had simply asked for a bottle of wine. It's amazing we were treated this way, but I'll take it as an isolated incident. I've never been treated like this at a hotel. The rest of the stay was terrific, and room service was fast!

The room as was large, but not what I would call comfortable. No coffee maker, so I either had to order room service coffee every morning or wait until I was showered and dressed to go downstairs to get coffee. Speaking of room service, twice I called in the morning for breakfast and was told it would at least 1-1/2 hours to receive breakfast. However, coffee only did come within 20 minutes. I then called ahead the night before for breakfast to be delivered at a certain time and was often told that \"that time is full\" and that I couldn't get it until later or much earlier.

Yes, there is a good bit of renovation going on, but each time I've been back, it's been less intrusive. As the work is done in each little area, they open it back up. The elevators were throwing some fits because one bank at a time was closed while new marble floors were being installed and the work load on the remaining banks was heavy. However, you can get to any of the banks on every floor so just walk down the hall a ways to get to another set if the ones you're waiting for are slow. I think they'll be finished with the elevators very soon. Yes, in the casino there is a smoky smell, but much less than I had expected from what I'd read about casinos. I walked through another dozen casinos in LV and the Hilton's was certainly not the worst smoky smell. I ran across no other foul odors in the Hilton. I've stayed in three different rooms, one in each tower. I found the two queens room in the north tower and the king room in the east tower to be wonderful. The king room was nearly as big as my apartment. All it was missing was a kitchen and balcony. The beds have all been comfortable and clean. The king room in the center tower was not quite as good but still fine. I think maybe they just haven't renovated that tower yet. Housekeeping was very friendly. One lady went beyond the call of duty helping me find the internet connection which had, for some reason, been hidden behind the TV (probably by the previous occupant). Many of the housekeeping personnel I ran into didn't seem to speak great English; they sounded almost like eastern Europeans. Despite their poor English, they were always friendly and if they didn't understand me, they would find another employee who could speak better English to help me. Every time I stayed I asked for late checkout because my flights didn't leave until 7:30 pm and I didn't want to have to lug my bag around LV all day. One time they couldn't accomodate me because they were booked solid. The other two times, they let me keep my room until 4:30pm without additional charge which I thought was mighty generous. I wish the Internet connection was free, but considering I paid only $50/night for the rooms, I can understand why they charge. However, when people are paying $100, $200, and during CES even over $400/night, I really think it should be free. The connection worked great, too. Unfortunately, they put the connection too far from the desk so you've got to work at a little table. Also, bring a power strip because they have used all the power plugs and you've got to unplug the TV or the light if you're going to use your notebook at the table where the Internet connection is. I bought one at the Walgreens on the strip just so I could use my computer with light and TV both on. I've eaten at both the Paradise Cafe and the Buffet. I'm on a low carb diet so I really like the Buffet as it lets me pick and choose. The food was good, the price was good, the service was good. The cafe was your typical coffee shop fare, but it was fine, too. The waiter we had was a little sullen, but he warmed up to us. He seemed a little thrown when I tried to substitute something for the potato that came with the steak, but eventually he got the point that I was avoiding carbs and he came up with some veggies for me. The Hilton Theatre has lots of history but doesn't seem to have been updated (at least the part the audience sits in) in a long time. It would be nice if they'd spiff it up a bit and fix it so not everyone had to stream out of the one door when the show is over. It takes forever to get out and if you're coming back for the second show, it doesn't leave much time for bathroom breaks, etc. It's also usually too loud, so bring some earplugs just in case. The Johnny Mathis Christmas concert was just right, but Barry Manilow's shows are sometimes painfully loud, and sometimes okay. Yes, I go a lot. I did the Star Trek Experience and found it to be a waste of money, and I like Star Trek. If it had cost $10, fine. But for over $30, I expected more. Of the three stays I've made so far, check-in was trying once. The line was long and I had to go through it twice because they didn't give me the concert coupons they were supposed to. The other two times, it was a snap. I'm going back on January for two nights, in March for two nights, and in July for five.

Great deal of $51 on Sun, Dec 25th, which came with 2-1 buffett coupon and $25 off spa coupons 2. Valet parking was good. No cars waiting since we pulled in around 7:30pm. 3. Check in took longer than expected, since there was only 3 hotel agents at the registration desk. 4. I recalled reviews stating to request the North Tower. Before I could even request this, we were informed that we have the North Tower, 18th floor with a view of the Strip. Not bad for $51. Keep in mind, Hilton LV is one small street east of the Strip and more North on the Strip. 5. Construction was minimal 6. Elevators were small and old, but functional 7. Renovation was above average: glass mirrow closet doors, small powder area (cute), faux marble counter tops for the bathroom, marble table top underneath the entire length of the window, small one seat lounge chair. 8. Room didn't feel very well lit until all 4 lights were turned on. 9. Shower was dripping upon arrival. There was a pool of water collecting. Since we were only going to be staying here to just 'sleep', didn't bother changing rooms. I believe this was an isolated incident: the shower head and the tub water would both run when the water was turned on 10. The walls are thin. We could hear the kids next door and you can hear people talking out in the hallway. 12. Casino gaming area is pretty small, compared with the larger casino's on the strip. We did a few runs around the casino to make sure this was it. Yes, it was. 13. There is a monorail station, but didn't have time to utilize it. 14. Excited to use the buffett coupon: lunch was $11.99, unfortuantely, I think this was one of the worst buffett's I've had. 15. Bell desk: dropped off our luggage after doing an express check out, this didn't take long at all. Picking up our luggage took 20 minutes. No one was at the bell desk, tried to get someone's attention at the registration line but given that it was the day after Christmas around 1:30pm, the line was 20 deep. Eventually got our luggage. Overall, this hotel was just another average hotel to stay at. I honestly don't know how this hotel can be considered a 4 star, but somehow it is and maybe from other people's prospectives, it is. For me, it was average.

Being budget travelers we did our homework and found we could take a city bus (CAT, or Citizens Area Transport) from the airport to the Hilton for $1.25 each. For getting around the Strip we found the Monorail deal ($20 for 10 one-way trips) to be the most efficient option since the Hilton is a bit of a walk from most places of interest. Service was as service is. On check-in we were efficiently processed and assigned a room. Same as eight million other people arriving in Vegas that day. Same as we have always been processed in Vegas no matter what we pay. Our service at the Hilton was no more or less than at anywhere else we've stayed in Vegas. We wish it were more personal. The hotel is still being renovated. We don't know what it looked like before they started the reno, but it should look pretty nice when they're done. Very rich marble (in brown, black, and cream colors) is going into the floors - after a day of wandering we noticed the same brown, black and cream colors on the marble floors at Bellagio and Venetian and wondered how many millions Hilton is putting in to keep up with the Jones's. New lighting, columns, and paint give an elegant look to the lobby and elevators. The problem with the renovation is the noise it causes and the sometimes bawdy conversation of the construction workers. For the sake of the hotel and everyone who stays there we hope this work is completed soon. We were happy with our room on the 10th floor of the East tower. It had been renovated and was clean and stylish, with a very cool cutout in the wall by the spare sink so you could look out over downtown while shaving. The bed was comfortably firm and lighting was good all around. Noise from other rooms was not a problem. The bathroom was roomy, with a big soaking tub, but the shower was unfortunately equipped with one of those water-pik things that seem to vomit water rather than spray it - it's a gimmick that doesn't work. If only they would install a wide-brim showerhead so a person could take a civilized shower without having to wrestle with a Rube Goldberg water-flayer. And it would be cheaper. We don't know what to say about the Star Trek wing. The warp-drive column and laser blasters didn't match the brown, black and cream marble and diamond chandeliers in the rest of the lobby level. There were no aliens in the bar; and on top of that the bartender said he could not make a Mojito! It seemed like a movie set after all the actors had gone home, but they forgot to turn out the lights. Dining was Vegas standard. We ate at the buffet, which seemed to us to be better than average for the price. We could not afford to eat in the restaurants in this hotel's fine restaurant section. We were disappointed that the \"Margarita Grille\" Mexican restaurant was closed, without explanation, during our stay. On the morning of our checkout, while I was seeking coffee in the lobby at 4:30 am, I was greeted by a smartly-dressed lady of the morning - who inquired if I was alone. Notwithstanding Vegas' \"what happens here stays here\" slogan, we hope this is not a feature of hotel stays for tourists who do not ask for it.

It was what you'd expect to find at any airport hotel. Room: Cleanliness Everything appeared to be completely clean. Hotel: Amenities (Restaurant, room service, workout facilities, pool, transportation) Casino: A rather small casino by Las Vegas standards, but a nice atmosphere. The Star Trek casino adds a different twist to the rest of the rather ordinary Flamingo casino. The games are space and Star Trek themed, but the odds remain the same! The dealers and casino bartenders were all quite friendly. The sports book is one of the best around. Restaurants: The Buffet - I ate lunch at the buffet. Sometime within the last few years the buffet was moved to the sportsbook and significantly upgraded and modernized. The selection was good, though not overwhelming. Its mostly typical buffet faire, but well prepared and served fairly fresh. Margarita Grille - My dinner at Margarita grill was quite good. I expected nothing more than a glorified Taco Bell, but there were original menu offerings that made it memorable. The service was slow, but since I was having a nice dinner with friends, I didn't mind lingering over some margaritas. Paradise Cafe - the 24 hour coffee shop. Normally, these are my favorite Las Vegas restaurants. My first impression of the Paradise Cafe was that it was over-priced. The first day I arrived, I ordered chicken strips and a bowl of chicken soup. The bill was over $16.00, which seemed a bit extreme. Las Vegas is getting expensive these days, and I haven't had the opportunity to compare the prices of the Paradise Cafe to other hotels' coffee shops. The food was good, however. The chicken strips were hot, and the chicken soup had a very homemade feel to it. Vegas Subs - the deli adjacent to the sports book. The subs were quite good. They had a good selection of deli meats. The style reminds me of the older sub chains - shredded lettuce, oil and vinegar, thinly sliced red onions, tomatoes, italian meats, etc. I was pretty happy with the sandwiches, although the people behind the counter were more involved with their own conversations than serving the customers. Perk Place - Coffee bar located near the Star Trek Casino. My only beef with this place is that it got ridiculously crowded in the morning, and they did not seem to have a good system for getting people through quickly. The coffee was good, but everything was a tad bit overpriced. Hotel: Location Although the Las Vegas Hilton itself hasn't moved, the location has greatly improved with the addition of the monorail. Now that it seems to be operating regularly, its easy to access the rest of the strip. Though it may sound ridiculous to some, walking from the Las Vegas Hilton can be a welcome break from drinking, eating and gambling. I recommend walking to Paradise Rd and turning left. Then, turn right on Convention Center Dr. From there, its less than a 2/3 mile straight shot to Las Vegas Blvd. From there, you can go north or south. I've done this walk a few times, and I find it nice and relaxing. Hotel: Staff \u2013 courtesy, attitude and promptness I arrived in the afternoon on a weekday. There were a few other people in front of me in line, but I didn't wait more than 10 minutes. The front desk clerk was quite friendly. I'm a cigar smoker, and requested a smoking room, and she joked with me about not too many people requesting smoking rooms any more. She told me to call down if I had any questions about the hotel. I was really pleased with her attitude. Value: I paid a convention rate of roughly $90.00. For this rate, I was completely satisfied. It may not be the most glamorous hotel, but with the addition of the monorail, it should be considered alongside most other strip hotels, if the rate is right.

Don't pay more than $100-120 a night, or you will possibly be very unhappy. This is because of the major ongoing renovation project throughout the lobby, restaurant row and fringe casino areas. The finished areas look great, but you'll need to dodge wheelbarrows and jackhammers all times of day, with congested hallways through the construction areas. Because of the inconvenience, call the hotel directly and they may be willing to quote a good price during an off peak time of the week.

I only ate at 'The Buffet' for breakfast, everyday, for a reasonable $10.95 per day. Food was tasty, hot and moist - drinks were refilled quickly. I heavily recommend requesting a room in the North Tower where my renovated room was nicely appointed in the 3-star range (saying this is a 4 or 5 star property is a probably a stretch). The room was clean, shiny new, and very adequate for my modest needs. The cable channel selection was weak (no HBO, ESPN2, History Channel, FoxNews, HGTV, Lifetime, etc), but who watches much TV in Vegas. I hate the crummy alarm clock/radios most chains put in their rooms. Hilton could offer a daily complementary bottle of water, considering you are in the desert. Bottled water was $4(ouch), so pickup a $2 bottle from the vending machines when exiting the monorail. Coupon book presented at check-in for hotel restaurants and shops did nothing to interest me. As a single traveller, too much food needed to be purchased to realize the special deal for example. The prized asset here is the incomparable monorail access taking you to the strip. The North Tower elevators are just a couple minutes walk to the fabulous monorail that takes you to 4 or 5 stops along the strip in less than 15 minutes. You know it's a great thing because the cabbies complain about all the fares they're losing. No other property in Vegas has such a short walk based on my ventures. Go for the 3 day unlimited deal for $25 per person. Cab meters start at $3.20 now, so a round trip to MGM with tip would have to run at least $12-$15 plus traffic.

I don't know if having Silver VIP status had anything to do with it. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. It has electric drapes, and an ample supply of large towels. Housekeeping was available most of the day (i.e. you could get your towels changed twice if you really needed it). It had a nice pool, which was open even in late November. The spa and gym were beautiful, with a hot sauna, dry sauna, and a steam room, and ample exercise equipment in good working order. They even provided free bottled water (although I think there would be a charge if you weren't Silver VIP or above). I found the self-parking to be very convenient. You did NOT have to walk through the casino or through a shopping mall the size of Houston to get to your room or to the front desk. In fact, if your room was in the North tower, you could take the glass elevator (great views) and walk 90 seconds to your car. Of course, the valet parking is free, but if a convention comes out when you're ready to get your car, you'll have to wait. The Star Trek Experience is a must for any Star Trek fan, and the gift store has a lot of unique star trek items (including some actual props for sale). As a hint, though, get your tickets at Tix4Tonight for just over half price. Tix4Tonight is located in the Hawaiian shopping mall just south of the Harley Davidson Cafe (and Aladdin). The Star Trek experience is probably the most technically sophisticated and interesting ride in Las Vegas. Finally, the direct connection with the monorail is a big plus if you don't have your own car (or if you have one car, and one person needs it because the other is at a convention or meeting). Is this the most visually stunning or luxurious hotel in Las Vegas? No. However, I feel anyone but the most demanding traveler will be satisfied that this hotel is an excellent value. Although I have to add that the Golden Nugget downtown is probably the best hotel value on the planet, if you want a hotel that's convenient to the Strip or Convention Center, and can get a decent rate, you should be very happy with the Las Vegas Hilton.", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNothing special\u201d", "Author": "gggaut", "ReviewID": "UR4131925", "Content": "Spend three nights at the Las Vegas Hilton.

Arrived at 10:30 on a Fri morning and was amazed at how much construction is going on, the front desk/lobby area was in complete disarray, but the signs pointing us where to go to register were very helpful. After a 10 minute wait, I pressed a $20 bill into the front desk agents hand and got a renovated North Tower non smoking room on the 20th floor, with a strip view. The agent checked for a good 5 minutes before finding us something not in the Central or East Towers, and we appreciated that. The valet parking area is also under major construction as well, but didn`t really notice it being a problem as far as dropping off or picking up our car. Wait to pickup was never more than 5 or 10 minutes tops all weekend. Back to the room...nice to see they double sheet the bed (sheet that`s over the blanket), that`s the wifes pet peeve, and the bedspread looked brand new (of course that gets folded up and deposited in a corner for the duration of our stay). Room was very clean, and the large oval tub had good water pressure. Again, the bathroom looked and smelled very clean. We did our usual Sat. night dinner at Benihanas and it was as good and entertaining as always. Love the Hibachi special (lobster and steak) as well as the saki! Also ate at the buffet once for dinner, and it`s OK at best, we had a 2 for 1 coupon so we had to go. Actually the NY steak and sauteed mushrooms were good, as well as the the tiger prawns and linguini. The all you can drink beer/wine bar doesn`t hurt either! Never used the monorail because there were five of us, and it`s actually cheaper to get a cab than spend $3 per person each way. $12 up to the MGM, walked down the strip to TI, then it`s maybe $7 back to the Hilton. In closing, this is about our 10th stay at the LVH in the past four years and while it`s not Bellagio, it has that Vegas feel about it. Quiet and classy!, They give you some great travel packages in the mail once you sign up at the Players Club for any future visits (we paid $99 for two nights, $129 for the third on this trip), so that`s the first thing a new visitor should do when staying there.

The monorail runs behind the hotels on the strip and to get to the strip from any of the monorail staions, it involes walking through entire casinos to get to the street.

This was, however, not a very positive Hilton experience. While there was no line at check-in, the clerk took about 15 minutes to properly get us checked in. Apparently it was his first day and he moved VERY slowly. This is to be expected from a first-day employee, but perhaps he could have used a little more training BEFORE dealing with customers. I expect better service from a AAA 4-Diamond Resort (yes, that's the same prestigious rating as the beautiful Bellagio and Wynn). When we went up to our room we first noticed an unmade bed and towels on the ground. Upon further inspection, we saw luggage. It appeared that our first day employee made a boo boo, as this room was still occupied. We trekked what seemed like 1 mile back to the lobby, explained our situation, and did not even get an apology. At this point I asked if they had any upgrades/suites available. The clerk disappeared into a hidden room for a few minutes and came back with an offer of a 1 bedroom suite for an additional $125 more per night. I negotiated the rate down to $75 additional and we had a deal. Here's the fun part that they didn't explain at the front desk: the Hilton's 1 bedroom suites are literally 2 individual hotel rooms with a connecting door. Yes, I really mean 2 seperate hotel rooms with 2 seperate keys and 2 seperate doors. What an amazingly stupid design! We made another trip down to the lobby and decided to keep only 1 of our rooms and cancelled the additional charge. Now, a bit about the room: it was about 15 years overdue for a remodel, had horrible light, and the bathroom had some of the lowest ceilings I've ever experienced in a hotel (I could touch the ceiling without stretching). Our room was missing the TV remote control and the toiletries were utter junk. The A/C controls were either full cold or full hot. To make matters worse, the ice machine for our floor was not producing ice. Finally - and I'll cut this short - we checked out, started driving home, and realized that we left some hanging clothes in the room. We called the hotel and got bounced around from the Operator to the Front Desk to Housekeeping to Security. Finally security said that they had no record of any clothes being turned in and that they were probably gone for good. We hung up, called again and asked for the manager on duty. He apologized for the security staff and gave us the number for the Housekeeping manager. He said that if the housekeeping manager can't find the clothes then we will be reimbursed.

Sav Mor had a shuttle to and from the airport that was handy. As far as parking in the parking garage at the hotel, it really isn't that big of a deal. It isn't a very long walk and we thought the location of the garage was convenient. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel. They served good food for a decent price. We chose to eat at different places away from the Hilton and the strip on many occasions. If you want something romantic to do, then you must have dinner at the Top of the World Restaurant in the Stratosphere. It is pricey, but you are paying for the view and the romance of it all.

The room had a low counter that was a desk and table in-one that looked out the panoramic window. The only fault I would have with the hotel is the rather quirky check-out system they have. Most hotels have a quest operated checkout system through the TV. Not the Hilton. There they WANT you to sign a BLANK checkout form and leave it in your room and then toss the key card(s) into a box in the lobby. I didn't sign the form since I could potentially be signing for who-knows-what and since the card keys were provided by one of the vendors at the show, I kept them. Would I go back again? Yes. Would I check-out differently next time?

It was last thoroughly remodeled in about 2001, but gets very heavy usage from conventions.

The overall service is OK for a convention hotel. Many of the staff have been there for 30 years. The casino is very large and there is a gigantic off track betting facility. The buffet restaurant, steak restaurant and Italian restaurant are quite good, and there is a hokey Benihana quasi-Japanese restaurant which you can skip. The management will take every opportunity to ding you for more money. Check your reservation dates carefully...if you need to add days, the hotel will jam you with a huge increase in the rate and will show no mercy (triple your original convention rate). Check your bill carefully when checking out. The 3rd floor pool area is outstanding if you get a chance to use it, very large with shaded areas and a large shaded spa and a nice pool. The location is not very close to the Strip, and the taxi lines can be endless during a show.

They provide bars of soap, shampoo, lotion and shower caps. When I asked for a second bar of soap so that we'd have one in the shower and at the sink, we were over supplied the next day. :-) The property and the furnishings are a bit old, so they are a little more shabby than what you'd expect from a Hilton. But, from TripAdvisor I can see that the prices are not the usual Hilton prices, so I guess you get what you pay for. Everything in the Hilton is as expensive as you'd expect. But, if you go out the front entrance and down the hill, there is an AM/PM mini market across the street. I got coffee and water for the room there. The $4 bottles of water in the room have a huge tag on them explaining that they are $4, so if you assume they are complimentary, you are foolish. Coffee was a few dollars in the coffee shop in the hotel and there was a line to get it. It was worth it to me to walk a block or two for a cheaper price. The monorail is running and there is a stop at the Hilton. If you want to go downtown, you can get the CAT 108 bus out on Paradise Road. You will most certainly meet unsavory characters on the bus but the bus gets you around cheaply. The bus takes forever getting up and down the strip, so I'd use the monorail then. There's not much traffic going from the Hilton to downtown though. I liked downtown and here are a few tips. Both the Golden Nugget and Main Street Station have tasty affordable buffets. We liked Main Street Station better. Main Street Station has the 777 Brewery and Restaurant. The beer is very good and at happy hour it's only $2 for a 16 ounce glass. Definitely get a 99 cent shrimp cocktail at the Golden Gate and sit and listen to the piano music. If you are there anyway, I think it's fun to go outside for the Fremont Street experience on the hour, starting at 6pm. It's neat and it only lasts a few minutes. At the Plaza there are shows in the Comedy Zone at 2pm, 4pm, 6pm and 8pm. There are two-fer coupons in some of the mags; they are offering free tickets if you win them by spinning the free slot at the front of the hotel and it's only $8 to pay for the shows (includes a drink and a ticket to get another drink for $1) The magic show and the man of 1000 voices were both good. We're not big gamblers but we did drink free Corona's with lime at the Hilton one night while playing penny slots. I thought everyone at the hotel was pleasant and attentive.

The bad reviews here gave me pause about the Hilton. But the price was right and I was able to get a room on a weekend where everything was very very tight so I went for it. It's my first time in a gaming hotel. I've been pleasantly surprised! The staff has been very courteous - and that goes from the pit bosses right through the room service staff. I requested a room with a view and received it. I ordered room service for 8am and it was right on time... As for the widely divergent accounts of room comfort, furniture, noisy air conditioners etc...I can only say that I stayed on the 18th floor of the central tower and everything was great with one exception: when I moved the desk chair back from the desk, it broke. Housekeeping arrived with a different chair in 10 minutes explaining that some of the new furniture was clearly defective and they're replacing it. Additionally, I do really appreciate is that the whole floor is reserved for non-smokers. The $11 high speed internet connection is fast and works great. And amazingly for a large corporate enterprise, the art in the room is tolerable. I even like some of it. That's a big one for me as I'm an artist. As for the much discussed $4 bottles of water - the price is clearly marked on the bottle. It's a drag to have to walk across the steet to the AM/PM to get water at a reasonable price. Certainly the Hilton would spread a little good will by comping a bottle of water especially as the tap water is undrinkable. The rest of my stay made up for that small inconvenience.

Now never once did it occur to me that Vegas blocks are as long as football fields! I should have remembered where it was (location wise) because I went in 99, but for some odd reason I couldnt remember. Anyway, we get there and a good thing that I found out (insiders tip) is that you can check in at the airport. In baggage claim right behind carousel #1 (and thats all of the Hilton properties in Vegas. i.e. Paris, Flamingo, Las Vegas Hilton, etc). Check in was fast and they gave me a room as I requested which was to be on the highest floor possible with a view of the strip. They placed me right on floor 26. The problem I have with the hotel was that it was NOT convenient. Hell, the money that I paid on taxi's to get back and forth to places I wanted to go was the cost of another room. It cost me $14 to get to the Mandalay Bay. Now you figure I am leaving the room in the morning, sometime that afternoon I am going to want to go back and shower and change. So now I have to pay to get back, and then you want to go back on the strip at night, so you pay to get back on the strip. Doing this over the course of 4 days adds up. What really burned me up was that I found a room at the MGM Grand 2 days before I left that was $89/night, but of course I couldnt cancel without being charged a fee because I had to cancel 72 hours prior. The room was average, the buffet was nothing to shout about, and to make matters worse I lost alot of money in the casino. I swear casino's marketing strategy to give you free liquor while you gamble is a trick of the devil. I hit a STRAIGHT FLUSH playing poker (and I never played the game before in my life)...Gave back ALL of the house money, and then $300 of my own before I sobered up enough to realize I was reaching in my pocket and pulling out MY OWN CASH!!!!!

Somewhere where I dont feel trapped cause I truthfully believed I would have left the casino faster if I knew I could just walk outside and be on the strip!", "Date": "July 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cclassy,great room & food no problems\u201d", "Author": "f100zardoz", "ReviewID": "UR2298850", "Content": "We travelled to Vegas to get married by the KING and stayed in the hilton for a week.

Nice people!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2284918", "Content": "Just returned from a two night stay at the Las Vegas Hilton, July 5 - 7, 2004. Have stayed at this hotel once before several years ago and enjoyed that visit. This trip I decided that I was tired of paying high prices for bad service and filthy rooms at some of the newer, pretentious \"luxury\" hotels in Las Vegas (i.e. The Venetian). I decided to give my business back to the Las Vegas Hilton and am glad that I did. This hotel is older, yes, and not as \"wow\" as some of the new places. However, it is very comfortable, clean, and the staff at the Las Vegas Hilton are genuinely friendly and helpful. I would classify the Las Vegas Hilton as a \"Golden Oldie\". When we arrived the front desk agent was friendly and completely accomodating to our request for a high floor, king bed room. He gave us a fantastic view room on the 19th floor, facing the strip. I have paid triple the room rate for what I paid at the Hilton at other \"luxury\" hotels and have never had as nice a view as this room had. The room itself was amply sized, even with the king bed, and included an upholstered chair with ottoman, an upholstered desk chair for use at the large granite top window desk (with plenty of electical plugs located conveniently under the desk), and an entertainment armoire. All hard surfaces on the furniture and counters were covered with a black and white colored granite, which I thought was a nice touch. The large panoramic windows had an electrically controlled opening/closing system, which I got a kick out of (easily amused I guess). Bathroom was very clean, had a granite counter as well, excellent lighting, and a very large oval bathtub/shower combo. Towels were of good quality and fluffy. Nice adjustable massaging shower head with good water pressure. The tub itself looked a bit worn, but all of the tile was clean and in good shape, and I did not see mold anywhere (the Las Vegas Hilton housekeepers could teach the Venetian hotel's housekeepers how to clean a bathroom, and how to remove mold from the showers.....). There was a granite topped vanity with good lighting and small stool in the area outside the bathroom next to the closet. An iron, ironing board, two luggage racks, and extra folding chair were located in the closet. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and firm, had good linens, and down pillows. I think I had the best nights sleep ever in a hotel room both nights. No sounds detectable other than the sound masking white noise humm from the ventilation system, which in my opinion makes for a great sleeping environment. We ate dinner at the Hilton's Italian restaurant, \"Andiamo\", the first night. I experienced what I would say is one of the best dishes I've ever ate in a restaurant at \"Andiamo\" - it was called \"Fettucini Portofino\". This dish was absolutely perfect! Seafood pasta consisting of lobster meat, jumbo scallops, shrimp, and squid in a beautiful tomato/herb sauce over fettucini. If I'm in Las Vegas, no matter where I stay in the future, I will visit this restaurant for this dish alone! Fantastic! And the service was efficiently top notch, too. Highly recommend! Second night we met local friends for dinner at the Hilton's \"Steakhouse\" restaurant . We've been here before and were not disappointed this second visit. Our waitress was a complete doll (I'm terrible with names, but she has a very long name and has been there awhile - ask for the waitress with the long name and they will know who you mean!). Food was perfect and outstanding, as was service, and this is another restaurant which will get our business again. Pool area is large, and even though it was busy with a lot of children (I assume summer vacations), we had no problem locating a quiet area to relax. A full service bar is conveniently located at the pool, and there are quite a few private cabanas which looked like a nice way to spend a lazy afternoon (price was $45 for four hours rental, or $75 for full day, which I thought was reasonable). There is also a snack grill located in this area which makes it convenient to grab a hamburger or hot dog for a quick lunch without going back into the hotel. Bottom line, you get a lot of bang for your buck at the Las Vegas Hilton. We were given a coupon book at check-in and used two coupons to save a total of $20 on wine both nights in their restuarants (and the wine list is very reasonable priced), and even $4.50 on the breakfast buffet for two of us. There were quite a few other nice money saving coupons in that booklet as well. One more big plus, lots of real nickel slots (yes, I'm a big player, ha ha) which were fairly loose, and even the quarter slots gave me quite a few wins. I ended up breaking even after two heavy days and nights of gambling, so that left me in a happy mood! I noticed that they recently changed ownership (in June), so I hope that if changes are made, they are only to update areas that need a little spiffing up (like the elevator banks). My suggestions to the new owners. Staff elevator banks with Security Guards to at least check for key cards - there are no guards currently, so anyone can go up to guest room floors. Coffee makers in the room are something I always enjoy and there were none here. Eliminate the petty $3.00 per day charge to use the room safe, too. I recommend the Las Vegas Hilton to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas for business or pleasure, who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a decent hotel room, who isn't concerned with pretention and the \"status\" of the so called luxury properties (which really are not, folks, no matter how hard they pretend to be - just remember, no matter where you stay you ARE in Las Vegas, so get over it), and who enjoys good service from nice people. Looking forward to my next visit to this property! Check their website out directly for terrific rates and packages. I saw a great package for a room with two half hour spa massages included for $78 per night!

I don't know what new ownership will bring, but they're spending big bucks on expansion and updating. There were only two downsides.

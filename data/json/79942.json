All the rooms I saw were outside entry and only stairs to the second level that led to an outside corridor.

Our room was toward the back and on the second floor, so we didn't experience a lot of highway noise. The room was very clean, but could use some minor maintenance, there's some rust around the bathroom fixtures, loose doorknobs, the security latch needs replacement, etc. Overall, the room was adequate, small but certainly serviceable. The biggest complaint was that the room was cold and the heater was of little value. We had to ask for an additional blanket, which they provided. Our request to the maid for a blanket, went unheeded so we had to call down to the front desk when we returned that night. The response was \"we'll see if we have any extras.\" A maintenance person came by shortly to deliver the \"extra sheets we requested.\" He seemed surprised when I told him that we needed a blanket, not sheets. Who needs extra sheets? He finally return a few minutes later with a blanket. The on site restaurant is so-so. The food is OK, but a bit pricey for what you get but the service was very friendly and attentive. Prior to booking, we were concerned by other reviews about unfriendly service and dreadfully slow internet access. Perhaps we were lucky, or the management since responded to feedback, but the front desk staff was very courteous and friendly and the Internet access was amongst the fastest and easiest to connect to that we've had at any hotel. No complaints there at all. The biggest downsides is that the plumbing is very noisy and you can hear water running anytime a nearby room uses water. One advantage of a hotel at Hotel Circle over lodging at the more touristy areas (such as the Gaslamp District in San Diego) is that you are nearby to neighborhood stores such as a CVS pharmacy, Target, Staples along with non-tourist restaurants. This is an advantage if you need toothpaste, another pair of socks, or other incidentals since you can get it without paying the outrageous prices found in hotel gift shops/convenience stores. Also, if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat without the high price of vacation spots. This is a big advantage if you are traveling on business. It is only a few minutes drive to Old Town, the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, and other attractions. We chose this hotel because of price, and we would stay again. We use hotels for sleeping, changing, and showering. If you're looking for a place to stay where you'll be hanging out, using a gym, and a spa; this probably isn't the place for you (although the pool and jacuzzi looked inviting); but if you want a lower price place that's convenient and clean, this is a good bet.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cBest Bang for your Buck in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "BobbyCha", "ReviewID": "UR121833364", "Content": "We stayed here for a few days in November.

One of the drivers, David, was especially friendly and was very informative about the area and attractions. When we arrived I was concerned about freeway noise as the property has the freeway running on 2 sides. We stayed in building 2, and requested the 2nd floor - with the widows open you could just hear the freeway noise, but with everything closed, it was very quiet - we didn't even hear our neighbors and they had a 2 year old in the room! We had a single Queen room - the decorations were up-to-date and the room was clean and very comfortable. It was nice to have a refrigerator for drinks and leftovers, but there is no microwave to use so we were careful to keep only that which we would eat cold. The housekeeping staff was very helpful. They provided an extra blanket when requested and folded it nicely on the bed when the room was made-up each day. The hotel restaurant offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. We did not eat breakfast there as 2 blocks to the west is the \"Family Restaurant\" where the breakfast was a lot less expensive ($7.99) for a larger meal. We did eat dinner on site, however, the first night we ordered the Tri-tip meal - the meat was awful - over cooked, chewy and tough. After 1 slice we did not finish the meal and the waiter never asked why - I was reluctant to return, but my husband said we should try again - the remainder of the meals were acceptable to good in quality and quantity. A FEW IMPORTANT NOTES: The hotel places a $75.00 \"hold\" charge on your credit card when you check in for \"incidental charges\". This is refunded when you check out. I am finding this practice more common lately, especially if you book through a travel site instead of through the hotel. You will receive a 15% off lunch or dinner coupon when you check in but it can only be used 1 time - however, if you ask at the front desk prior to each meal they will provide you with another one.

I have stayed at many hotels and honestly I have never had a complaint. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Best Western Seven Seas hotel recently in San Diego, California. I had paid $100 for a night and looked at the pictures and it seemed like a nice hotel that was in a good location. We we got there were completely shocked of how dirty the room was and how unsafe we felt. The door to our room had a 1 inch gap all the way around it so we could hear everything that was going on outside (this was like a motel not a hotel, you had to access rooms from outside). The sheets on the bed were scratchy and when you walked on the floor you could feel hair on your feet. The water never heated up when I took a shower and the towels gave me a rash. BUT it gets better.... At about 2:30 am someone began banging on our hotel door and you could hear the clacking of high heels outside. Somebody was walking back and floor and knocking on everyone's door and was screaming. Keep in mind that our door had a 1 inch gap all the way around it so we could hear EVERYTHING. My boyfriend finally woke up and answered the door. When he opened the door, a hooker was standing outside saying that she had lost the key to room and didn't know which one it was. Then she asked if she could stay in our room and of course we shut and locked the door. In the morning we left as fast as we could. I would never recommend anyone staying here EVER. I am not a picky person by any means and I was disgusted out of my mind. If you want to stay in San Diego and not pay an arm and leg for a hotel just pay $20-$50 extra a night to stay at a Marriott or a Holiday Inn Express. Those hotel chains have a higher quality of everything. But please don't stay here. You will regret it!!!", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cabarete, DR", "Title": "\u201cPack your earplugs!\u201d", "Author": "LEKCabarete", "ReviewID": "UR119206046", "Content": "Well, we had perhaps the worst night in a hotel that we've had during our 1 night stay before catching our early morning flight.

We did not bother to call the front desk to report the party people, we've been the ones having fun plenty of other times, so we do understand, but it was pretty sleepless. There was only 1 bath towel. The gal at check in was really nice, she booked us a taxi after we received the bad news that the shuttle only started at 6am (the first flights out of San Diego are at 6am) Attn: Hotel Management - start your shuttle earlier! The taxi price was quoted as being the flat rate of $21, however the delightfully helpful and cheerful taxi driver told us no, it's $27. Are taxi drivers really that bad the world over?! So irritating! Many of these issues are either not the hotels fault or fixable with a pestering front desk, but who really wants to mess around with that when they are just trying to get some rest?

This hotel was a BIG disappointment. The room was adequate at best. When our door wouldn't lock when shut from the outside, the repairman was there in 15 min. or less and repaired the locking mechanism. My problem was with the so-called 'shuttle service'. When my husband called for a pick-up we were told where the van would stop and when we should be at the pick-up location. After waiting for nearly an hour and no van we took a cab back to the hotel. When we asked about the missed connection we were told we hadn't signed up for a pick-up earlier in the day and the driver had something else to do. Why weren't we told this when my husband called and asked about getting a ride? The next incident with the shuttle came while waiting at SeaWorld. We got an independent ride to SeaWorld and thought we'd get the same ride back, but changed our minds. So, we had not signed up for the return trip. My husband called and asked the receptionist if there was a van scheduled for pick-up at SeaWorld since we had not signed up earlier for a return ride to the hotel. The receptionist said that there would be a pick-up at 5:30 and we should be there at least 10 min. early (my husband called at 3 p.m.). We arrived at the pick-up spot 15 min. early and waited about 30 min. before calling the hotel and asking if we had been waiting in the wrong place. The receptionist said the van should have been there but since it wasn't she checked and found out that the driver had not left and had no plans to drive out to get us. Evidently because we had not signed up in the morning for the van, and even though the driver had nothing else to do, we were left waiting for nothing and ended up taking a cab. This was not an isolated incident. In talking to another hotel guest, when she made her motel reservation, she was promised shuttle service to a special event, but was later told the shuttle did not serve the location she needed to go. We understood that their priority is shuttling people to and from the airport, but it seems the receptionist wasn't smart enough to add our name to 'the list'. One hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing. I will definitely not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel. However, the restaurant adjacent to the hotel has good food and service that is outstanding. The big San Diego Blackout happened on our first day at this motel.

Netflix did not even remotely work, nor did google in any timely manner - my phone provided our internet, which I have to pay for separately. <> The room was absolutely tiny, it barely fit a queen sized bed and two chairs.

They knew there were two of us a week before checking in. After a trip to the pool our towels had a layer of chlorine on them, which we continued to use the next morning unfortunately as that was our only option. <> The faucets are extremely loud - we could hear every single one of our neighbors washing their hands at odd hours of the night and morning. <> As I write this review (on my phone's internet) I also hear a vacuum next door (through the door that separates our room from the next) - It is 8:20 in the morning on a Saturday.

Rooms are clean enough and have most of the necessary amenities. We didn't use pool as it was full of kids all the time and closed early (around 10pm). We used hot tub once and it was fine. What struck us most is their service. On the day of check in we tried to call front desk and ask about latest check in time. We had to call five times to reach any living person there, and even after somebody answered the phone they put me on hold for long five minutes before even asking what I needed to know. The same at the check in - agents kept puting people on hold when they didn't even seem to be busy. We couldn't get much attention from them either. On the second day we requested extra towels and never got them. We ended up asking one of the housekeepers. Overall it wasn't a bad experience, just something different. Our first two nights during the trip we stayed at the Bristol hotel in downtown and the service was excellent. We had a little bit of a shock after arriving to Best Western, but we got what we paid for!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!!!\u201d", "Author": "Hollowman7717", "ReviewID": "UR115269606", "Content": "Trust my review when I write this, we stayed at this hotel with friends and I have stayed here in the past about a year ago, well after this trip that just ended I will never go this hotel ever again, first we called them at night tell them we were going to be a little late, and they lady just kept saying \"OKAYYYY\" and didn't even ask my name, I was just being curteous and letting them know I will be late. then after we got in our room, there was no hot water to take a shower or even wash your hands, there was no trash bags, and the beds are really hard and uncomfortable, this place has really been run down, must be new Management or something, but I will never stay here again, I hope this hotel gets it's act together and improves on the service and quality of Best western I used to know.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "Treadaway", "ReviewID": "UR114739880", "Content": "No problems of any kind.

The Best Western Seven Seas stands out as a motel that gets it right -- clean, comfortable rooms; attractive grounds; friendly staff; easily accessible parking; excellent freeway access and proximity to local attractions; 24-hour hot tub. We'd stayed at the Seven Seas many, many years ago when we were in college, and we opted to stay there over Memorial Day weekend for a trip down memory lane. We were not disappointed and had a most pleasant stay! Check-in was smooth, and the front desk receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Our room, although on the small side, was well-lit and tastefully decorated. We appreciated the in-room coffee (the best I've had at a motel) and the well-stocked basket of soaps and Pantene shampoo, and the shower head was nice and high -- a plus for tall people who don't like to stoop to wet their hair. The bed was a mixed bag. The mattress was decently comfortable, but the pillows were hard and a bit too large, forcing my head to rest at a funky angle. I woke up with a sore neck after the first night; the second and third nights, I used the plush beluga whale I'd gotten at Sea World for a pillow and had better nights' sleep. The pillow was the only problem though. Everything else about the room was quite satisfactory. We also liked the 24-hour hot tub, and the grounds are beautifully landscaped with tropical plants. Even though the motel abuts two freeways, we did not hear any road noise. Generally, the motel was quiet aside from the typical people-passing-the-window sounds you expect at places like this. The Seven Seas is central to Mission Valley, Mission Bay and Sea World, Old Town, and downtown attractions. There are several restaurants within walking distance of the motel, and more restaurants are a quick car ride away in Old Town and at the Fashion Valley Mall. We enjoyed our stay at the Seven Seas and will happily stay there again in the future.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "jepoyzia", "ReviewID": "UR110758907", "Content": "This hotel is easy to find it was our first time in America and we found it straight away.

I really needn't have worried! The room was adequately sized and clean, the maids came in every day and changed the sheets and generally kept the place nice. The actual hotel had pretty gardens leading to the rooms, the pool was pleasant and had a reasonably priced bar next to it. We spent an evening in the bar and met some very friendly people who were also staying in the hotel. Every night was a fantastic night's sleep, it was quiet and the beds were impossibly comfortable! The location was also great, the bus stop for Downtown being right across the road and the Fashion Valley Transit Centre 10 minutes walk away, which was very handy for getting buses to anywhere in the city, as well as bus passes for the week. People have complained about the safety of the complex, the old fashioned rooms and the price of the cafe. I, for one, never found the hotel in any way unsafe. As two young women going to our hotel room at the very back of the property late at night, we could easily have felt that way, but it was perfectly fine. The hotel rooms were slightly outdated, but many hotel rooms are, you can't expect them to match up to the quality of places like the Manchester Grand Hyatt. It didn't bother me that the wallpaper wasn't the best and newest of styles, I was out exploring the city instead of hanging around in my room! Many people have been annoyed at the price of the cafe, but it's pretty much the same price as everywhere else in the city. The food is amazing and the portions are huge! I had a great breakfast there and it kept me sated for much of the day. We sometimes got leaflets through the door from nearby restaurants, but that's hardly a major problem. Don't be lazy - pick them up and put them in the bin! Problem sorted! All in all, it's a decently priced hotel in a good location.

The rooms to the back of the property face a hill side and that kept things quiet and also not having noisy neighbors worked in my favor for some solitude. Location- the hotel is located right along the 8 Freeway so getting on and off the freeway is very convenient. The Fashion Mall is about 2 miles away and is easily accesible via surface streets. Room- the room is basic with a full size bed. No frills. Your basic 70's furniture and art decor. I appreciated having a small fridge, hair-dryer and cofee-maker. The TV had cable but with very limited channels, the good stuff (i.e movies and recent episodes of your favorite shows) cost money. There is a computer desk in the room that served adequately for my lap top. However, I had to use the outlet behind the TV, that luckily had a 6-prong outlet to plu in my laptop and blue-tooth for the night. Service- The like to change your sheets every other day unless you specifically request that it be changed daily. They did not leave any plastic bags in the trash bins but luckily I brought some plastic grocery bags that I implemented as trash bags. The Bed- I got a full size bed that needed replacing and only 2 standard synthetic-fill pillows. Food- There is a restaurant next to the front desk that is decent. There is NO complimentary breakfast and NO complimentary afternoon snacks or drinks at this hotel. Parking- Parking is abundant but the spaces are very compact and perhaps parking away from your room might be a better idea especially if you need space to get things in and out of your car. And, also, there is no elevator to the second floor and some of the stairwells to the second-floor looked as though it was ready to collapse. So be careful.

The food in the restaurant was good, albeit expensive. The wait staff, with one exception - a warm and chaming young lady from Eastern Europe - was pedestrian. I felt very comfortable with the 5 police officers who met one day for lunch. It indicated to me that the restaurant had a good local reputation for its food. The pool area was nice and pleasant to relax at. Free internet was nice as well. Management is concerned with their image and were quick to my complaint to Best Western headquarters - see below. CON: The room was too small and very uncomfortable and every request to upgrade to a larger room was met with disdain and \"if you're not happy with the room, go somewhere else,\" or \"Don't let the door hit you in the back.\" This happened 3 days in a row. They were rude and obnoxious. On the last day I requested a late checkout and was treated, once again, very badly by the Front Desk Staff - they were extremely rude and obnoxious. One of them actually sneered at me. I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was unavailable, but I did speak to a Customer Service Clerk and she was very helpful. We were allowed a late checkout (5:45 p.m.) and were fully charged for an extra night. Oh, and I never did get to speak to the manager. When I returned home, I called Best Western and filed a complaint. To my suprise 3 hours later, I received a phone call from the manager who was too busy to talk to me that day. We had a pleasant and fruitful exchange re my experience - he apologized and we discussed the need for better training of his front desk staff. I was not offered any consideration to return and the hotel never forwarded my stay to Best Western and I never received credit for my stay in their Rewards program. I have stayed in literally hundreds of hotels (including BW) all around the country and I've never been treated so shabbily. I was positively impressed with the speed and personal response to my complaint (Kudos to Steve!), but it does not mitigate how I was treated. Hopefully the staff has been retrained and have been taught the proper treatment of guests and without those guests, they would not have jobs.I would not recommend this hotel to friends or family, because I can not be sure that they will not receive the same nasty treatment I did. Lastly, prior to San Diego, I stayed at the BW Carriage Inn in Sherman Oaks for 6 nights and the front desk staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and that our business was appreciated.

When we arrived, the front desk employees were great and were able to give us a room with two beds instead of the one with a queen bed that we had to book online. Our room in the back was very close to the freeway, so I would recommend asking for one of the rooms in the middle of the hotel. When we opened the door, our room was stuffy and smelled like stale cigarette smoke despite this being a non-smoking hotel. As a result, we kept our window open the entire time we were in the room, which made all of the outside noise worse. On our first morning, one of the other hotel visitors who was parked directly below our room decided to open all of his truck's windows and blast rap music at around 8:00 am. The next morning, we had a bunch of kids and loud parents walking past our room all morning talking at full voices despite us having our privacy sign on the door. I did wear earplugs the second night and slept much better than the first! On our second night, we were tired from a day at the zoo and decided to hit the hot tub. We had to go to the front desk to get towels and were extremely disappointed to find 5-10 kids clustered in the hot tub when we returned. After the kids left, we were even more disappointed to find that the hot tub was almost as cold as the pool. Luckily, one of the kids told us about another hot tub around the corner that was actually hot, which made up for our negative experience. Several people raved about the hotel restaurant but we couldn't bring ourselves to eat there despite it being pretty crowded. We also noticed the San Diego Police tend to frequent the joint. Despite the room being small, it was clean and well-maintained. Our only complaint was that there is only one electrical outlet in the bathroom area, so if you have the refrigerator plugged in, you have to unplug it if you want to blow dry your hair, make coffee, or use the iron. Parking is free, which is nice considering some hotels charge over $20 a day!

The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable.

We kept thinking, how are couples with two kids doing this!? There was also a serious lack of power outlets in the room. The mini fridge was not plugged in becasue where it was located there was only one outlet and the coffee pot was plugged into it. (the smallest coffee pot known to man by the way, and the in room coffee was HORRIBLE). Unfortunately, it gets worse. The room was pretty dark, there are two lamps, each one with about a 20W bulb in it and that is the main source of light in the room. The only other light is the one over the sink wich is bright enough for the bathroom, but doesnt help lighting the room. The room was also not very clean, carpets were dingy and stained, way past their lifespan. There was also a roach caught in the light above the toliet for 3 days, someone removed it i guess on the last day we were there. And another one on the bathroom floor. Sink was clogged, took water like 20 min to drain. THE GOOD The bed was comfy and the AC and shower worked great, which is again all we really cared about. The grounds were really very nice and the pool and hottub looked clean and not over-crowded, we didnt go in either. We didnt eat at the hotel resteraunt, couldnt see paying $14 for a burger with Fuddrucker's like 3 min away. Thats about it for the good. We got what we needed for the price we were willing to pay but again know what your getting before you go, AAA is pushing the limit calling this place a 2-diamond hotel. I have a feeling when the next guide comes out they will not get that same rating. The grounds are great but the rooms are in dire need of an overhaul, new carpet, more power, more light, and a deep cleaning are all needed at this location.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGood Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Dawn52", "ReviewID": "UR18082217", "Content": "I did a lot of research trying to find a place that wouldn't break the bank and was close to major attractions.

The humidity in SD made 76 degrees hot so I had the cool or fan going all the time. It didn't make any noise. They do have sliding windows. There is a coffee maker, hair dryer, and a small fridge. I like that and it came in handy. The only ice machine was behind the hotel by the laundry and vending machines. The laundry area was outside. Vending machine with soda and water by the pool also mid way between rooms. Ample parking, I do want to thank them for not charging for it like some places have done after having free parking for years. They do charge the marketing Tourist Assessment fee but every major tourist trap does. I enjoyed my stay over all and would return. Perhaps they should put no children allowed in the hot tub in Spanish in the hot tub area. I didn't notice a sign in the area just the kids.

It has a convienient location, right off the freeway on Hotel Circle, easy to get to, even with the horrid traffic. When we arrived at the room we noticed a no smoking sign, I called the front desk and was told there were no smoking rooms available even though I could see an entire building of non occupied smoking rooms just across the parking lot. I was also told that a fine of 75.00 would be imposed if we smoked in the room. A complaint call to Hotels.com resulted in a partial refund. The room itself was clean and comfortable, well laid out with ample lighting, clean bathroom and standard furniture: 2 chairs, small table, chest of drawers, a night stand or two and a bed. No complaints there, however no elevator meant having to lug our heavy suitcases up the outside stairs. The motel has a restaurant which we did not go to. It also has some nice greenery lined pathways that lead to a nice pool area with umbrella covered tables & chairs which made for a relaxing place to sit while we figured out how to use our new video camera. We signed up for the free shuttle to take us to the cruise ship terminal and the next morning the kindly driver assisted us with the luggage and off we went. After our cruise we were picked up by the motel's shuttle and we spent 2 more nights at motel before driving back home. This time they had opened the long building in the back (where the smoking rooms are) which made the stay nicer since we did not have to go outside to smoke as we did before. The second room we had was also clean and comfortable, it contained a desk and TV, one chair and table, 2 night stands and the bed. One wall was covered in mirror. There was an alcove/closet where suitcases could be stored and the bathroom was divided where the comode and tub was behind a door, separated from the sink. They had a coffee maker on the sink's counter with makings for coffee or tea, and I believe there was a tiny frige under the sink (could be wrong on that). The one thing that caused me to book the room was finding out they allow you to leave you car there during your cruise.... at no extra charge! Just leave your keys with them at the desk. We were off on the cruise for 8 nights and my car did not appear to be touched at all. All in all it was a good experience to stay at the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego, even though we were unable to smoke in the room the first night. It was a good value for the money and I would certainly recommend this motel to anyone taking a cruise out of San Diego, especially if you are driving there and need a place to park the car while on the cruise.

The lamp flickered, and I discovered that the outlet to which it was plugged did not appear to be up to code - the plug would not stay in securely. My nightmare continued when I awoke at 2 AM to an infomercial playing in the room next to me loud enough that I could hear every word. I called the hotel staff, who spent the next 30 minutes pounding on the door and repeatedly calling the room's inhabitants. The TV was finally shut off, but in a few hours I woke to not my alarm clark, but all the alarms from the rooms around me (read - THIN WALLS). In addition, my room did not meet my expectations for cleanliness, which are admittedly high. The wireless access did not work. The breakfast advertised fresh eggs, but I was most certainly served powdered, not to mention the high price and terrible service. The staff spent the afternoon sawing something in the parking lot outside my room. On subsequent nights, I returned to multiple canine unit police cars parked outside the hotel in the driving lanes, not in spaces, which can only lead me to believe they were not there to enjoy the below-grade breakfast I mentioned previously. I did NOT feel safe in this hotel, and am questioning whether I will ever stay in a Best Western ever again.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cerritos", "Title": "\u201cPlace at the bottom of your list\u201d", "Author": "photous_passing_by", "ReviewID": "UR7616384", "Content": "Nestled in the corner at the end of Hotel Circle sits a lovely landscaped large scale apartment style complex but inside it's true, the rooms are small giving you the feeling that you know you paid for more.

I had originally hoped to stay on the bay or ocean, but the astronomical prices wanted by those hotels was out of the question. The Seven Seas advertised a pretty, tropical setting which at least gave you the illusion of being at the beach. While it was nicely landscaped with palm trees it was not as nice as advertised. I usually make reservations online, however, the hotel website would only allow you to reserve rooms with 2 doubles. All the reviews stated that the rooms were small so we wanted to reserve a suite since we were traveling with 3 young children. Therefore, we had to call the propertly directly to reserve a suite. We were told that they had 1 Master Suite with a patio, and 2 JR. Suites. They said the suites were issued 1st come, 1st served so that would only guarantee that we would get some sort of suite, not the Master. Well excuse me, but if we are making advance reservations, why can't we reserve it? We asked for an AARP discount and they told us the suites were not discounted, only the regular rooms. I later tried to check our reservation on the Best Western website and couldn't find it. So I called back the hotel and they confirmed that we did have a reservation. I asked if they could mail me a written confirmation since I couldn't print one off the internet. They said NO. I was not happy, but was so thoroughly spent looking for a hotel in San Diego that I just let it go. I could not relax wondering if I was going to have a reservation when I got there or not. We decided to call a few hours before our arrival to make sure everything was OK. We asked if the Master Suite was available. We were told that we could have it. When we arrived we were told that it had been given to someone else. REAL NICE! The Jr. Suite was basically 2 adjoining rooms, so at least we had plenty of space for our family. We had 2 bathrooms and 2 large closets so we could get all of our luggage out of the way. The kids had to sleep on a Queen sleeper sofa, but they were small enough that it worked. If there are more than 2 people in your party you will have to have a suite!! At least we had 2 TV's, however, the kids weren't entertained very well as they didn't have the Cartoon channel or Disney. Most of the channels were news or in Spanish. The good thing about our suite was that it was back against the hillside and therefore quiet, no freeway noise. It was a bit of a hike to the pool or restaurant. Room service was fast and had good food. The prices were very steep! One night I ordered a $2 side salad and they brought me a massive $10 chef salad. I sent it back as I was not about to pay for it. We did not see any restaurants between the hotel and main tourist attractions so you really didn't have much choice but to eat there. You can't save money by cooking your own food because there aren't any microwaves. The maid would place our room service dishes outside the door and they would sit there for several days before being picked up. We were rather offended by the poolside cocktail party and BBQ for government employees only. If you're going to have a private party it should be held in a private location, not a public one where everyone else is staring at you and feeling left out! Another disappointment was the shuttle system. What a joke! They advertise shuttle service to major attractions. Well when you get there they give you a sheet telling you the shuttle is basically for airport passengers. They will take you to Sea World at 9:30 AM and pick you up at 4:30, hardly enough time to see everything. Then if someone needs airport service you will just have to wait. We were on an extended trip and needed to use the laundry facilities. GOOD LUCK! They had 4 sets of washers and dryers and they were ALWAYS full, no matter what time of day or night it was. The waiting area was usually full of unsavory looking people which made you feel uneasy. Every evening after sightseeing we returned to the hotel to find several police cars in front of the hotel or at the hotel next door. That made us very uncomfortable! We never did hear what the problem was. The grounds were somewhat pretty, but not near as nice as the internet photos. Overall, it was very disappointing!! It would have been much nicer if we could have had a patio to sit outside on. This was the cheapest place we could find in San Diego, but for the price we paid we could have gone to the Caribbean and had real luxury and service. Now that we have seen San Diego we can say that it is somewhere that we do not care to return to.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philly", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "MeccaN", "ReviewID": "UR5772186", "Content": "I would like to say that this hotel is a very nice place to stay---and it is especially nice if your traveling with the kids!!

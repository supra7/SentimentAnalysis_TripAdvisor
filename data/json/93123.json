{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Unhappy We planned our vacation and looked up the La Quintia in New Orleans on the Internet and thought that the Price seemed reasonable so we started off on our trip to New Orleans. After our long 15 hour drive we get to the hotel. When we get there it is in a less than to be desired area that was very unwelcoming. But we figured for the price it was a good deal when we went to the front desk to get a room for a week they then told us a whole diffrent price that was about a thirty dollar diffrence from the price told on there web page. When we confronted the desk clerk about the price diffrence all that she said was Well this is the price a night And she didn't even seem a bit concernd to work with us or help any more so we left and wen't elsewhere.", "Date": "Jul 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR584332687", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Will Visit This Hotel on Furture Visits We found the La Quinta just 15 minutes from the French Quarters and was so worth it. We got a good deal at $44.00 a night, were not bothered by the staff, and it was a quiet place even though there were kids staying there. We had a great experience, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was the La Quinta off of the Crowder exit going I-10 East.

The room was spacious and clean. The breakfast was okay - the waffles were the best feature (it was fun making them!!). There was no fruit - only dry cereal, a few small muffins, juice, instant grits/oatmeal and coffee. Fortunately, there was a Wendy's and Shoney's nearby if you wanted a real hot meal. We ourselves had no problem with our one-night stay, but a family informed us as we were getting ready to leave to catch our ship that their car was broken into - several items were stolen out of their car overnight (we brought all our stuff into the room as we saw we were in a not-so-great neighborhood). All in all, I would say we got what we paid for, as we used one of those low-price internet services to get a cheap rate. I would think that next time - especially for a longer stay, I would either stay in the LaQuinta in Slidell or stay closer to downtown New Orleans in a nicer hotel. But for one night, it worked out for us.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR322588391", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Pleasant stay Enjoyed a pleasant stay for 4 nights over new year's eve. The continental b'fast was better than i had expected - good waffles. The check-in staff was friendly and the room spacious and clean. We did have a leaky toilet bowl which despite repeated complaints never got fixed...a minor blemish in an otherwise great stay. The hotel is 15 minutes away from the french quarter and has a shoney's and wendy's close by if u'r looking for a quick bite.

We were able to check in early that was good. The rooms were clean. The rail on the second floor in front of our room was broken, we had no warning about it. Thank goodness it was broken to the inside or someone would have fallen off. Their continental breakfast leaves much to be desired. They had cold cereal and cold muffins and that was the extent of their continental breakfast that their website was so proud of. The service was good however, the neighborhood wasn't. The hotel was right behind a bar and coming back on Saturday night it took us 20 minutes to go 1 block because the police had it all blocked off trying to clear out the bar. Overall it was good, but I would not stay their again.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR709787541", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "La Quinta Inn Crowder Our stay at this hotel was horrible. The room smelled musty, the pool was tiny and the pool area was cluttered with trash. We had no towels in the room, a situation that was only remedied when I requested them for the third time in person at the front desk. There was no response to my first two phone calls to the front desk. I was given two bath towels (for my family of 5), and promised that more would be delivered as soon as they were available. I'm still waiting for the towels.

The room was large and offered a lot of amenities like a huge TV with pay per view and game stadion, coffe maker and a closet with enough coathangers. The bathroom was ok for US conditions and it was nice to have a complimentary breakfirst right at the hotel (which was good for US conditions, also).Our first impression was that the neighbourhood is not the best but after checking other places in NO it seems to be the average situation except the Garden District where you have to pay more than four times the amount for a room and parking fees up to $20 per day.Since we had a car it was a 10 min drive to French Quarter and downtown and we did not have to deal with drunken tourists in the direct vicinity of our hotel as you will have it with hotels located in the French Quarter and Downtown.The stuff in LQI was always!! frindly and helpfull (they did not have a safe available when we arrived and so they kept our passports and tickets in an envelope at the front desk during our stay). For dinner there are several Resaurant right across the street (Shohey\u9e93s, Wendy\u9e93s a chinese restaurant) but as this motel is located directly next to the Interstate you can reach every restaurant in New Orleans within 15 min - and we did not have to deal with noice from the interstate.So to make a conclusion we got more than we have paid for at the LQI crowder", "Date": "Jun 23, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR912388174", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Donald512"}, {"Content": "La Quinta Inn in Slidell is fabulous! During a recent vacation in New Orleans we looked at all the La Quinta properties in the area (we had a car so this was easily possible). The LQ Crowder is not in a pleasant neighborhood and is VERY near the noisy highway; in addition, there is too much cement/concrete --- this made the pool look very unappealing. The La Quinta Inn in Slidell, however, is terrific and we highly recommend it. The rooms (which are just fine) surround a lovely green, palm-treed courtyard which features a large pool. The lobby and breakfast area are unusually spacious, and if you want to walk to dinner, there's a Cracker Barrel nearby. The staff at the desk is remarkably friendly and helpful, and the cleaning staff remembers with unusual consistency to replace coffee, toiletries, etc. The price is very good (we got a weekly rate which was fantastic), and they have a convenient laundry room. It's only about a 30-minute drive to the French Quarter, and also just a 30-minute drive to the Gulf beaches. We are extremely pleased with our 10-day stay there, and I'm sure you would be, too!", "Date": "Apr 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR279589889", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "La Quinta Inn Crowder This hotel was just what I expected it to be.

The continental breakfast was excellent and filling. Even though it was a few miles outside the French Quarter, it took about fifthteen minutes to get there which was not a problem. For the budget minded traveler, I would definitely recommend this hotel. I had no problems with the Shoneys being across the street and other nearby restaurants and Walgreens drug store nearby.

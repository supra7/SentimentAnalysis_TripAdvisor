We called the front desk to ask that they send security to stop the noise but it continued for several hours. The next day we complained to the front desk that nothing had been done about the noise after we called. They apologized and acknowledged that many other people had also complained. Later that day the manager left us a voice mail informing us that she had given us one of the three nights free. The least expensive of the three nights was deducted instead of one of the two more expensive nights with actual noise issues. This hotel had other noise problems also.

Eventually chose this for the location so we could squeeze in a bit of Hollywood in the evenings as well. Stayed in a 1King bedroom ($109 fr BW website). Once the suitcases were on the floor, there was little space for the two of us to maneuver. Another room where four of our traveling companions slept had 2 Doubles ($119) and that was more spacious. Other reviewers said this BW was really near Hollywood Boulevard and so we took a (non-scenic) walk, a good ten minutes away and it seems longer if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tired. Manager has maps of the area that are useful and you can easily get a copy upon request. What was slightly worrying was the fact that other people on lower floors could peer into our room through the heater vents in the wall.

Firstly, the location was perfect. It is located in West Hollywood which is cleaner and quieter than Hollywood however it was only a 5min walk to get to Hollywood blvd, graumanns chinese theatre, kodak theatre, a nice outdoor shopping mall, and more shopping on the street, not to mention a view of the Hollywood sign. Sunset was only another block past Hwood blvd. One stop on the nearby metro will take you to Universal Studios and, if you're interested in renting a car for your stay, you can obtain one just down the street at the Renaissance Hotel. Oh, and this hotel offers free parking. Secondly, the staff were extremely friendly, accommodating and helpful. The rooms are secure, clean but a bit small; I wouldn't want to stay there with more than one other person or perhaps 2 very tiny people. The onsite restaurant was good and affordable. Last, but certainly not least, it was VERY affordable!

I actually booked it online through my Costco club membership travel program with their discounted rate. We stayed for Thanksgiving weekend and it was NOT as crowded as I expected. It was my husband and I with our two children ages 11 and 2. Location was perfect, close to the famous Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards...if going with a large crowd, you can easily walk to these locations from hotel, but since we had our kids, we didn't take a chance since it's not a safe area to walk at night. It's perfect location if you're going to visit Universal Studios....only 5minutes away. Hotel was nice and clean when we checked in, but the two night s after that, the cleaning staff forgot to vacuum the carpet and clean the bathroom floor. When I called the front desk the first night to ask for extra towels, it took over a 1/2 hr to bring them to us, so I didn't even want to bother calling to have them vacuum at night time. We had a mini fridge and microwave along with coffee maker, which were all nice to have since the hotel does NOT provide any complimentary breakfast. They do have a restaurant onsite, but beware....prices are very HIGH. Their parking lot is on the first floor, under the rooms and the spaces are VERY tight, so if you're driving a big SUV, you will have a hard time getting in/out of your vehicle.I will say, though, that as I checked out and complained about the floor not being cleaned during our stay, they offered me an additional discount off my total rate and it was much appreciated. This shows that they have good customer service and want my business. Overall it was nice, I would go back again since Rica was nice enough to offer me that complimentary discount for my inconvenience.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, FL", "Title": "\u201cpleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "4hersheybear", "ReviewID": "UR10022517", "Content": "After reading the reviews on this hotel, I was expecting the worst. Fortunately, this hotel wasn't bad at all. The location is excellent for walking tours of the touristy Hollywood area - only 1-1/2 blocks to the Grauman's Chinese Theater and many other major attractions We even walked in the area at night, without feeling too unsafe. Parking was FREE, a rarity in LA, although the spaces were tight. Our room seemed to be newly refurnished, with a nice, clean bathroom. It also came with a microwave and small fridge. The biggest problem was the noise - the walls are thin, and we could hear the partiers coming back in the early AM. Also the curtains didn't quite cover the bottom of the window, allowing in a sliver of light. I recommend bringing earplugs and an eye shade if you are a sensitive sleeper. This is a good starting hotel to spend a day or two in the touristy part of LA.

I recommend the hotel. It's more like a family-run business. The staff was most helpful and friendly. The 800 number isn't the best way to get personal service or even to be sure that the hotel knows what's happening. There isn't a computer print out from the hotel, but, it's one-on-one by 'phone and the staff knows what's available and how to please the customer. Everyone was very helpful, even when the lobby was full of people. The room was what I had requested: Quiet and away from the street noises and parking. It was on the third floor, in the rear of the building, overlooking the pool and jacuzzi. Tall plants and trees obscured the buildings on the other side of the property, giving a park-like atmosphere to my view. The room was clean, if dated. The place looked newly renovated, including furniture. The air conditioning worked and the bed was comfortable. The TV, refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave seemed new. The bathroom was the cleanest I've seen in some time. The shower nozzle was large and easily adjustable, compared to small hard-to-use sprays at other hotels. There is a restaurant on the property, but I wasn't impressed enough with it to try for anything other than an expensive cup of soup. The computer, on the desk in the lobby, wasn't convenient, but it was there and could be used at any time. Hollywood Boulevard and the Metro station were 2 long blocks, over construction debris, down the hill. I would not recommend the walk to Hollywood Boulevard for anyone with a physical problem. Some of the past problems may have been due to previous owners and hotel condition. Current owners appear very anxious to please and there are on-going repairs to the property. It's not 4 star, but, it's clean, safe and close to everything.

At the hotel he said that the rental varied because of the fluctating market rate on rooms in the area. I figure a $20.00 difference. So have your price quote and reservation info available.

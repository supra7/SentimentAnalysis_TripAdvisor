This review is based on our seven day stay in a two bedroom suite at their Terrace building.Our first suite on the second floor had a dead fridge and needed to be gutted and redone. Our second suite on the fourth floor wasn't much better but the fridge and A/C's worked. The flooring, carpeting, restroom, kitchenette and in-window A/C's had outlived their usable lifespans years ago. The suite was clean though.

Unfortunately, there is there isn't enough lipstick in the island to make this pig look like anything but a pig.

This review, however, is based on a stay this year!The hotel is in Honolulu proper, a few blocks from the Ala Moana Shopping Center, but is not next to Waikiki -- one reason it seldom gets mentioned. For frequent visitors who don't need the full resort experience, though, it is more than adequate. The price, at least when booked through their web site, is excellent, and parking is plentiful (there's a charge, but a lot less than most other properties).There are two separate buildings -- the tower and the terrace. The terrace is actually across the street from the tower, which is connected to the check-in desk and the restaurant. I stayed in the tower, and found my room to be more than adequately large. I was impressed that there was a sink separate from the bathroom, which also had a sink, facilitating matters for those sharing the room with others. There were also a refrigerator, a microwave oven, and a safe -- all handy to have! Incidentally, each building has its own swimming pool, so no inconvenience there.Desk staff were friendly and efficient, as was the woman tending the shopette. I can't say that I had any interaction with other hotel staff.Shopette prices, by the way, are more than reasonable, quite a difference from even the mid-range properties in the US.The restaurant is renowned for its koi pond, for good reason. The pond surrounds the entire restaurant, and there are lots of tables at the windows and on a small lanai that allow views of the fish (or you can see them from the walkways outside). Feeding is scheduled for several times daily.For the daily breakfast buffet, the food is good but not spectacular. For the price, though, I'm not complaining. Sunday brunch (served after breakfast) and nightly dinner are also buffets, but I didn't partake this time. Hint: be sure to have reservations for dinner; I didn't eat dinner there because I didn't have a reservation and didn't want to wait 2 hours!I had a couple minor quibbles with the room. First, the plumbing in the tub could have been secured a bit better. I tried to adjust the shower head, and the cap hiding the hole in the wall slid all the way down the pipe.More important -- to me, anyway -- was the inefficiency of the air conditioning in the room. I realize I'm visiting the tropics, but when A/C is provided I do like it to work. It was provided by a window-mounted unit, which had a huge gap between the unit and the wall beneath it. Fortunately, I didn't notice any critters coming in, but there was a lot of gunk in there that should have been cleaned out. Also, the unit wasn't large enough to do its job. The temperature in the room was actually quite comfortable, but I was trying to lower the humidity a bit. I ran the air conditioning on high cool, full cold temperature for 48 hours and it was finally starting to make a difference when I checked out.The only other advice I would provide is that while the hotel's address is on Rycroft Street, and the main entrance (a breezeway, not a door) is indeed there, the parking is behind the property on Kanunu Street. There is a small parking lot, while validated parking is available in the Ross Dress for Less garage across the street (levels 4 through 7 for hotel guests). Since two school buses were taking up the entire space in front of the hotel entrance, I ended up feeding a meter and walking back to the hotel because there was no advance indication of where to park.To sum up, I recommend this hotel for those who don't need a resort experience, don't need to be right on the beach, and don't need a lot of fancy amenities. If you just want to be pampered, you're better off elsewhere, but for those of us with more pedestrian tastes the Pagoda is quite suitable.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR142677999", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "FlyerDave"}, {"Content": "Acceptable Place This is the thrid time I have stayed at this property over the past few years and it is a functional place to hang your hat in Honolulu.

Location and price is their foremost concern which are the true advantages to this hotel. Location is good for those who like being conveniently located in the midst of Honolulu but without the excess press of people (and cars) that characterize Waikiki. The hotel is very near a Walmart and Ala Moana Mall and, if you didn't know, has its own well known restaurant downstairs. A decent diner is also located in the retail complex next door and a sprinkling of other restaurants abound in the area (mostly ethnic). Price is reasonable for a hotel in Honolulu. What you should keep in mind is that Hawaii's largest industry is tourism so a lot of hotels have been around for a long time. This makes the average hotel in Hawaii fairly aged, unless or despite renovations. So you're not being cheated for what you get; that's just how it is in Honolulu.I've stayed with my parents a number of times at the Pagoda. Each time, we get a moderate room in the hotel tower. Usually we get one fairly high up, because you do have some street noise (not like Waikiki but sometimes loud cars or teens, etc). Parking for the hotel tower (the one without the kitchenettes) is usually in the small restaurant/hotel parking lot below or across the street in the upper levels of the parking garage. You do pay for the parking; the front desk gives you a pass that you put on your dash. Rooms are nothing special, definitely dated but clean. We've stayed there at least 8 times over as many years and nothing we've seen has been revolting. The hotel tower usually have a small fridge, microwave, and coffee maker which is what my parents really appreciate. The pool at the hotel tower (I understand there's another one for the terrace) never seems to have a lot of people in it (usually one family at a time) but was definitely small. If you're unlucky I'd say 6 to 8 guests would stuff it to the gills. We've never had a problem with the hotel staff, but we don't usually ask for much besides a lot of extra towels, which the cleaning ladies usually give us immediately.This isn't a place to get excited about, especially if you're making a special trip to Hawaii for that much anticipated family vacation. It isn't in the bustle of excitement that makes Waikiki and isn't very near any beaches. What it is is a decent affordable hotel to rest and sleep before going back out into the tropical sunshine.", "Date": "May 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR737794775", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "rea3"}, {"Content": "Comfortable, not fancy We stayed here for 2 nights during the Pro Bowl.

The location is fine if you are willing to take The Bus to get around; it's a 5 minute walk to the nearest The Bus stop; and it's about a 30 minute walk to Waikiki Beach, slightly less to Ala Moana Beach Park. There is a parking fee if you have a car. The kitchen is great to have if you have a family and want to save some money on meals. That said, there were some problems, although they were not serious. The worst was the nightly noise level from the street outside (we stayed in the building called the Pagoda Terrace; it's possible other buildings are quieter). The A/C drowned some of the noise but not enough for restful sleep. The kitchen was minimally equipped...two pots, dishes and flatware for 4, one sharp knife, one cutting board, one small two burner stove, coffeemaker (and coffee), fridge, microwave; but plenty of small sugar ants to get into any food left on the counter. The unit was older and somewhat worn, but otherwise clean. However the front desk person was very brusque upon check in., enough that I would try to stay elsewhere next time. MAKE SURE you have the EXACT SAME credit card you used to make the reservation and first night's deposit, as they will not allow you to use a different card to pay for the rest of your visit. This policy is to prevent ID theft, but the logic escaped me as we had ample photo ID to prove who we were and the reservations were made in our names! (We wound up paying with traveller's checks and having the original deposit credited back to our card). There was a nearby WiFi network we could access but it was not the hotel's network, and it was not always on.

Conveniently located close to Waikiki (within 6 blocks), Ala Moana Shopping Center, Walmart and several local style restaurants. I like the location because its fairly centrally located, if Waikiki is not your only destinaton. Our room was in the Terrace across the street from the main lobby. The rooms were clean, but definitely shabby (cracked plaster, stained tub, chipped sink, tired/dated paint job). This place has definitely seen better days. It looks to be stuck in the late 60s/early 1970s era. The room had a coffeemaker, small refrigerator, microwave, sink and some kitchen utensils. Small bathroom and water temperature changes when someone on another floor flushes or uses the sinks. Small air conditioning unit, but it worked OK. Not great lighting, but better than some I've seen. Closet space was good and there is an in-room safe. Parking is included and there were adequate, but small spaces; additional parking is available in the Ross parking structure one block over. Maid service was inconsistent - one day our kitchen towels weren't touched and no new towels were put out; another day, everything was replenished incuding extra soaps, towels, etc. Staff were generally friendly; some of the other guests were more somber and standoff-ish.They have 2 pools, a gift shop, a beauty shop and travel/tour agency on site. The buffet restaurant across the street was nice and reasonable considering the offerings (with a Japanese/local slant). The restaurant has a massive fish pond filled with koi and nightly feedings are an event. Any phone messages to your room are taken by and then relayed to you by a live person, not a voicemail service. There was some noise from gardeners and other guests using the pool, but after 9pm it generally was quiet. Access to the terrace after hours is by keycard only.Pagoda seems to be a favorite for expatriates returning to Hawaii and low budget customers.

There are plenty of hotels in the Waikiki area more befitting this treatment. Keep in mind that you're going to pay more than $80 a night though. The Pagoda has been a 2nd home to my family and me. We've stayed in their studio and their terrace more than 3 times and we're quite satisfied. In fact, it's the only place to stay when going to Oahu and we have family up there! If you're looking for a clean place to stay for a couple of nights and a LOW COST, I'd recommend it. You get what you pay for. And who spends most of their vacation in the room any way? I like the fact that the front desk is available 24 hours, I like the fact there's a Ross's directly across the street, AND I like the fact that Likelike Drive In no more than a corner a way.", "Date": "Apr 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR393771372", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "The Crapoda I had heard that the Pagoda Hotel was a popular choice among Hawaii residents visiting Oahu. In fact, I went there a few years ago when some friends from Hilo were staying there, and the room seemed ok at the time. So we booked a studio room in the Pagoda Terrace for our weekend trip to Oahu. We could have stayed with friends for free, but I thought it would be nicer to have our own hotel room than stay on someone's hide-a-bed. Wrong. I was SO disappointed. The room they gave us was smoky-smelling, old and dingy looking, and had two twin beds, not the best arrangement for a married couple. We were able to change rooms and get a double bed, but the room was equally dingy and smoky. I would have been willing to pay for an upgrade to a nicer, non-smoking room (I think the rooms in the tower are better) but none were available. Well, at least we had a kitchenette. Except that the microwave didn't work. And the hallways and elevators were dirty, with cigarette butts on the floor and stains on the carpet. We had to pay $5 a day for a parking pass, but then when we came back that night there was NO parking available in the structure. I circled the neighborhood for 10 minutes and finally found a metered spot where I parked for the night. When I called the front desk they said I also could have parked at the restaurant, but this is information that would have benefitted me more if given at the time of check-in. All these factors let my husband to affectionately nickname the hotel, The Crapoda. I know it was a good deal, but I feel like we could have spend just a little more and stayed in a place that was actually halfway decent.", "Date": "Apr 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR726865673", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kawena71"}, {"Content": "Look out for the bugs We stayed one night at the Pagoda Hotel and the remainder of our 7 nights at the Pagoda Suites.

Having fun can sometimes be a little noisy. The Pagoda has a very good security force who are also very low key. I have always felt safe. Use common sense about your valuables.

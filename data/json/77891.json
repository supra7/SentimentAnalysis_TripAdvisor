{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not a good idea to stay here This was a trip booked through LastMinuteTravel. While the price was very reasonable, I learned you get what you paid for. It is indeed in a very unsavory part of town, and you learn quickly not to venture out after dark alone. It was located nearer to the SuperDome than to downtown, which was about a $7.00 cab ride to get to the French Quarter. When I booked the reservation, I asked for a smoking room with king bed, and got a non smoking double, which they did not want to change. When we arrived, the front desk clerk stayed on an obvious personal call, not acknowledging our presence. When I asked for the room to be changed, there was a fair amount of attitude. She did grudgingly change it to a smoking room, but stated that to upgrade to a king bed was $10 per night additional, and I would need to call the people who made my reservation. The elevator was substandard at best, and scared the bejeezus out of my boyfriend and myself for the creaking rolling and grinding sounds.The room smelled, and the covers had stains on the undersides. The bathroom tub and toilet both dripped. The heating and cooling system were substandard at best. The free breakfast was lousy old coffee, watered down juice, and silver dollar sized stale pastries. They also advertised a outdoor hot tub, though there were numerous signs we never did find it. The best part of the hotel stay was our shuttle driver, Irene, who dropped us wherever we wanted to go, and was VERY friendly. The trip itself was great, though the city is not the most fragrant. Beware the 3 for 1 drinks! Very dangerous! Also, do not be seduced by the souvenir glass offerings. Go to the visitor center first thing for discount coupons in the Louisana and New Orleans travel guides. Best advice I can give ANYONE going to New Orleans: bring Purell and toilet seat covers. Even in the best locations, the toilets are really quite gross given that New Orleans is below sea level. I am more than happy to provide other reviews of local activities, and my own top ten list of things to do while on vacation to N'Awlins. :) Aquarium of the Americas, RiverWalk, MardiGras World, Cafe du Monde, Jackson Square, Garden District, the cemetaries, Moonwalk, and I highly recommend taking a Swamp Tour. Top eats for us included Emeril's NOLA, Bubba Gump, and Margaritaville. Laissez le bon temps roullez!

Went for the Sugar Bowl and what a mess. Our rooms were dirty when we checked in....one had been thrown up in and they hadn't even cleaned it up! As if that smell wasn't enough, the Clorox smell in the bathrooms was so overpowering we couldn't let the children go in. VERY narrow halls....hardly wide enough to pull suitcases down. They said there would be a nice place to park our motorhome, and that wasn't there either. Front desk was very friendly until we wanted to check out, but we did anyway. They said restaurants were in walking distance but the area was so seedy we wouldn't have walked anywhere without a police escort! We called around and found a beautiful hotel (The Wyndham) for less money and saved our trip! Not recommended by this family AT ALL!!!!!!!", "Date": "Feb 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR567648179", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nana4ou"}, {"Content": "Loved this Hotel! i usually stay at hostels but this was a welcome treat. it had the atmosphere of a hostel. the desk agaents were so friendly and knowlegable but the price was so reasonable.being a hotel, the rooms were private (private bath etc. comfortable and clean) , but the general atmosphere was just as friendly and fun as a hostel. they have free bus to the french quarter, free breakfast, .. really, cheers to this hotel! it is traveller friendly! they even allow pets free (im so sorry i couldnt have brought my chester with me!). oh, they have a coin laundry.. a godsend for us 4 month backpackers!.for the price of hostel, you can have a private room and so much more!they even picked us up (free of charge, apparantly this a regular service) from train station!some hotels are not very friendly to foreign travellers, but this one is! the front desk agents were extremely helpfull and friendly. they were so patient and kind when we were asking information on tours and inexpensive sightseeing options. i dont think we could have enjoyed the city as much as we did if we had stayed elsewhere.even after we checked out at 12:00, our train didnt leave till 21:00. they offered to check our bags and allowed us use of the van to the city and then back.. and then they drove us to train station.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR287829640", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d77891-r3086087-Americas_Best_Value_Inn-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "77891", "Price": "$199"}}

The room we occupied on the first night was clean but very cramped.The service was excellent. The safe in our room did not work. Once reported, service arrived within minutes. The man was pleasant and the problem resolved immediately. I was able to upgrade for the 2nd night to an oceanfront room. The room, while furnished with older furniture, was clean, spacious, and had a wonderful view of the ocean (but no balcony). The continental breakfast was not the best I have ever had, but it was better than some others we experienced. My children were able to access wi-fi without any glitch. We did not spend much more than \"sleep\" and shower time in the room as we were busy with enjoying Daytona and area. We did not spend much time in the lobby either than as the route to the ocean. Parking was located next to the hotel and we always found a spot in the garage, out of the sun, but close to the entrance. This was the first time I had encountered a policy limiting towels--we had to turn in used towels to get an equal number of clean towels. My children enjoyed the pool without any complaint. Overall, while the amenities were not 5 star, they exceeded my expectations for what I could afford. All of the employees that we had contact with were friendly and helpful. The location definitely compensated for any deficiency in amenities. We stayed \"on the beach\" and not several blocks away!!! I would definitely choose a beachfront room for my stay if I ever have the opportunity to return to Daytona Beach again.

Maybe I should have known better than Daytona Beach in general... but... the professional photos are taken from creative angles and probably photoshopped a bit. It conveniently crops out the enormous new resort next door that blocks the ocean view on one side. I had a reservation for a king bed with an ocean view. I show up to a room with two double beds and a view of the parking garage - and only the parking garage. Not even city view. Parking garage view. Mind you they first told us that we couldn't even park in said garage, that we would have to park across the highway in an abandoned gas station. My girlfriend tried to protest and the lady at the desk blew her off. I had to really force the issue and got a parking pass and new room. Note that all of the photos on their website are of \"ocean front\" rooms while most of the rooms are actually \"ocean view\" on the side of the hotel. And then there's the beach itself. True, the hotel has no control over it, but the pictures of a serene beach are totally inaccurate. In real life it is packed with big wheel Jeeps parked bumper to bumper for as far as you can see. When I was there, the hotel itself was playing host to a New Jersey couple's wedding - and there was enough drama for a reality TV show. Late night yelling, vomit in the elevator, etc. Again, maybe not entirely the hotel's fault, but that's the clientele that comes here. In terms of maintenance, the furniture is all trashed. It's second-hand from a resort in Orlando. All of it is still stamped with the name of said resort. Part of the parking garage is not useable because the concrete is falling apart. It is literally propped up with 2x4s and caution tape.

The standard rooms that were available only had one king size bed per room and we had four people per room.

Room 1 was on the 3rd floor in the front of the building with no view of the water. Room 2 was on the 4th floor and if you stood at the very back edge of the window you could see the ocean only if a wave happened to roll way up on shore. Room 3 was on the 8th floor on the north side and that did have a nice view of the ocean. The bed frame on one of the beds in our room was broken. There was trash from a previous guest under the bed. On the night we checked in, Brittany, the front desk clerk was not very nice or helpful. We needed a crib and she was unable or unwilling to get one saying we would have to wait until the next day. The next morning we spoke with the manager to figure out the room mix up. He was not the friendliest person and told us we did not book a specific room only the room type. Anyway he wasn't very pleasant for being in a service industry. The \"Continental Breakfast\" is a joke. Stale pastries, fake Cheerio's, raisin bran, watered down OJ, & coffee. The prices at the restaurant are way over the top. Everyone we spoke with wondered what continent they were talking about to call it a continental breakfast. The internet service is poor to below poor. If your lucky enough to get on it boots you off and on continually. We were lucky and guessed the password because they didn't give it to us. One couple I spoke to said that Brittany was a real b**ch to them also. They were so fed up with the lack of internet service and customer service, at the front desk, they were changing hotels. The housekeeping staff was friendly. I think it's the only hotel around without any balconies. There is only one umbrella table by the pool with 4 or 5 chairs. There are a couple picnic tables, one by the pool and one on the yard. I guess it was all the things added together that would make me say I wouldn't stay there again.

Our suite included a full eat in kitchen, sitting area with seating for 7, two queen beds, two tv's, plenty of storage space and a large bathroom with dressing area and full closets. We were treated to a wall of windows overlooking the ocean from the 7th floor. Our kids loved this as they could open the windows at night and fall asleep to the sights and sounds of the ocean. The room was clean and well cared for. Beds were newer and very comfortable with plenty of pillows for each bed. The staff went above and beyond in the level of service at all areas. The free breakfast is very basic. Cold cereal, pastries, coffee, juice and milk. The hotel offers a good selection of hot breakfast items at a good value. Kids enjoyed the free DVD rentals offered. The full kitchen was great option for anyone who would like to cook and would offer a huge saving option on food cost. There are ample grocery stores nearby.

They said there was a stovetop, no stovetop just a microwave, plates, cups, sink, coffee maker, cutting board, flatware, dish soap, mini fridge, and some kitchen towels. The DVD player worked half the time. Again, you had to finesse it. The windows were dirty so it was difficult to enjoy the view while looking at dirt on the window. No balconies at all. I felt like I was in a prison, as I could not even open a window. The AC was good and cold. The bed was ok, but don't look behind it because you will see crumbs, dirt, and all sorts of things. The pillows are VERY soft so if you are used to a firm pillow then bring your own. The complimentary breakfast consisted of OJ, coffee, cereal, and doughnuts. Again, laughable. The ladies at the front desk were moody. All in all, I am grateful that I had a place to stay because the experience was awesome, but I would not subject anyone to that kind of experience with this hotel.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT PLAN A STAY WITH THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "QueenB40", "ReviewID": "UR105986256", "Content": "Not only did they misrepresent their accomodations - but upon arrival and realizing that 5 people couldn't possibly sleep in the room they had \"bait and switch\" reserved in my name - they refused to do anything at all to help my family and I.

When we arrived the desk clerk was nice. We were suppose to get an efficiency but when we got to the room, lets just say it was far from appealing.

Now, my three grandchildren have asthma.( 11,10 and 8) I figured it may be because the air hasn't been turned on for awhile and the smell would go away so we notified the desk clerk and we went to the pool It was slimey so I slipped and hurt my toe going down the stairs of the pool.Now I should of reported it but I'm not like that. If I had known what I know now I would have. The room also was far from clean. I told the children to make sure they wore their slippers because the rugs were sssssssoooooo dirty. The internet is not free. There was a charge of 5.95 and that was for internet and movies for the two nights we were there. OK no biggie .The big problem came when we left. We checked out and went to breakfast (somewhere else because the breakfast there was a joke)and I thought I left some toiletrys there so we went back within 1 1/2 hrs. We went up to the room and it had already been cleaned. The maid and head maid said they found nothing in the room. OK no big thing. I ended up finding them in another bag later on. We arrived home and the next day I checked my credit card and there was a charge of $266.25 that I could not figure out from the hotel. I called the booking agent. She called me back and said it was because of smoking in the room. OK BUT I DON'T SMOKE !!!!!! My grendchildren don't smoke either. I called the manager several times (Scott Hendricks) and when I finally got ahold of him he said he had to check with the head maid. OK. No call back so I called again several times and when I talked to him he said there was a heavy smell of smoke reported by the maid and he wasn't 100% sure but he thinks there was cigarette packs found in the garbage. Again I don't smoke !!! I explained that to Scott and he said \"This happens all the time\". I tried to explain to him that I don't smoke (again) My grandchildren don't smoke either so how could that of happened.I told Scott I returned to the hotel 11/2 hours later to see if I left some things and the room was already cleaned and NO-ONE mentioned anything like that to me. So here it is months later and I never seen my $266.25. Amagine charging that much money for nothing. So whether or not you smoke if your number is drawn for the smoking charge YOU WILL get hit with it. Unless you can go back to take them to small claims court, you will never see that money again!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Our experience there was excellent. We chose this hotel because it is on the beach and allowed guests 18+ to check in. The rates were very affordable compared to the other broken-down motels and filthy hotels in the area. The rooms are super clean. The bathrooms were immaculate. We were very surprised at how clean the bathrooms were since everything is white. All the linens and towels were clean with no signs of prior usage. All appliances and cooking utensils in the room are clean. I want to give a compliment to LORETTA from the housekeeping department for being so hospitable and friendly when we asked for towels. They do have a $25 pool towel deposit per towel when you check in. The $25 are refunded back to you when you check-out and bring the towels back. I don't suggest taking pool towels at check-in since there are plenty of towels in the room, or you could always bring you own towel. The service is great. We came across the General Manager, Scott Hendrix, a few times while we was there. He is very active at the hotel which is ALWAYS a good thing. Both, check-in and check-out, were quick and stress free. There is a DVD rental machine in the lobby were guests are allowed UNLIMITED DVD rentals complimentary of the hotel. Lobby area is very clean and quiet. Agents at the front desk are professional and friendly. Seemed a bit understaffed but they managed to take care of all guests in a timely manner. WIFI is also available in all guest rooms free of charge so that was a plus. Another great addition is the parking garage. Keeps cars safe from rain and blowing sand from the ocean. As for guest safety, all outside doors are locked after 10pm and need a room key to enter the building. The food at the tiki bar was very good and affordable. We did not have the complimentary breakfast. It is a continental breakfast offered from 7am - 1030am. Best part about the hotel is that it is right on the beach. We had an oceanfront view room and it was amazing. Pool is overlooking the beach as well. Pool is open till about midnight and it is heated. It is walking distance from the boardwalk and oceanwalk village. A few restaurants nearby and a grocery store nearby as well.

There is a dining table, couch, loveseat and chair with ottoman, along with a large desk, TV and another dresser. The furniture in this room must have been fairly new as we slept on the hideabed and found it quite comforable. Our traveling companions said that the beds in the bedroom were okay, a bit small since they were doubles and probably new mattresses are in order. But we were quite satisified with the size of the room and the cost was quite resonable even though it was bike week. Maid service was great, towels where large white a fluffy. We never did get a hot shower, but the water was warm and that was okay, since the weather was warm. We did not complain about the hot water, and probably should have, but we were having so much fun it didn't dawn on us to even complain. By the way our room had a large window and door that lead out to the pool area and a beautiful view of the ocean and beach. This room was also very quite even for bike week. Not sure what the noise would be like during the summer around the pool, since we never really saw anyone using the pool, everyone was out enjoying the rally and great weather. Even though we rented a car, we had a couple friends who rode their Harley's down. They had specific covered parking for the bikes and if we could get the car in the same lot we did that too.

My girlfriend and I are under 21 years old so it is very difficult for us to get a hotel room due to other people my age going to a nice hotel and distroying and disturbing everyone there.

The staff there was nice. We had a problem at booking where they told us we did not pay the taxes on the hotel and the we owed $200. The problem was fixed immediately. The room itself was pretty large and the bed was comfortable. The TV had full cable, not the normal 7 channels you usually get in a hotel. The free breakfast was substantial and some bit edible. The main problem in this place is housekeeping and construction. Housekeeping is REQUIRED to clean your room every day at about 8 am. Now, this is fine if you eat breakfast, but some days we wanted to sleep in. You cant just tell them to leave, you have to open the door, and sign a paper saying that you didnt want your room cleaned. We had 3 housekeepers and only one was great, with a great attitude, so SHE got a great tip at the end of the week. The hotel is remodeling the 7th floor. Gets noisy early.

Also missing from the bathroom are any \"extras\" such as a blow drier, lotions, and conditioner. (Note, you can get a blow drier from the front desk.)

Regarding the continental breakfast, it consisted of up to 4 kinds of mini donuts (powdered sugar, cinnamon, chocolate covered, plain), fresh apples, pancakes, frosted flakes, mini muffins, orange juice, and coffee. Regarding check-in/check-out, apparently you prepay your stay at the BEGINNING of the stay if you have a reservation. Another person was checking out who used a pre-pay hotel reservation (eg hotels maybe), and he was asked for an additional $3.39 which was in addition to the pre-paid amount for the in-room safe of $1.13 per night. I saw this charge on my check-out statement as well. Apparently whether you use the safe or not, this is tacked on to your stay. Regarding the \"ocean view\" room, your view can be better/worse depending on your room's location. The hotel is positioned with it's longest part running from the beach to the road.

Then starting from the road is x03, x04 and so on\u2026wrapping around the building and ending in x24 near the road again. Thus room 603 would be the farthest from the beach and would be more like \"ocean glimpse\", where room 612 would be closest to the beach, but not directly facing the beach. The pool is on the southeast corner of the building, so room 612 would have a good pool view and ocean view. The south view (rooms x03 through x12) face a hotel building currently under construction. The north view (rooms x16 through x24) face the parking lot. Only the west view (rooms x01 and x02) have no view at all of the ocean. Also, there are small clusters of smoking and non-smoking rooms as you walk around the floor. Be sure to state your preference at or before checkin. A business associate got stuck in a smoking room. In summary, I would say this hotel is best suited for the budget traveller who wants to be ON the beach and have a nice pool who's main concern is fun and frolick \u2013 perfect for the spring breaker, or a family vacation. For the business traveller, you'll probably be happier somewhere else.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4243786", "Content": "We stayed here for 1 night from 11/12 to 12/12. We had reserved the room some 3 weeks ago from their own website. They reserved the room for us without charging the credit card at that time. We had specified a few preferances at the time of booking. We checked in late-night but they still had kept our room and fulfilled all our preferences namely, higher floor, oceanfront, non-smoking, king-size bed. Front-desk staff was very friendly and everything went smooth. We booked the Oceanfront Kitchenette for $79 per night. Oh was it more than what we expected!!! The room was big with wall to wall carpet, big and cosy bed and sofa, a 4-people dining table and chairs, a nice spacious kitchen area with everything that a good kitchen has sans the food, ofcourse. The biggest surprise was a leather reclining chair with footrest, right by the floor-to-ceiling glass wall facing the ocean, needless to say I enjoyed reclining in that chair looking at the ocean. Another surprise was the cable tv, I pay $50+ every month in NYC for that same cable, it had the same lineup of channels plus a few extra ones, not the usual 10-15 channels of the other hotels, half of which are local channels, I have stayed in. The view from the room is gorgeous, unobstructed view of endless wide ocean from everywhere in the room including the bed. The included breakfast was nice too, for the first time we had pancakes in an included continental breakfast of a 3-star hotel. Pool area is good and you can just walk to the beach from the lobby. In the morning we needed to print the boarding pass for our return flight to NYC, we had a wireless laptop and they have an excellent wireless network all over in the lobby, so we quickly checked in and then asked the front-desk lady to print out our boarding passes and she happily did that and we had our boarding passes in a minute. We had some doubts because of the word \"Inn\" in the hotel name and the low star-rating and that led us to spend just 1 night here and that was our biggest regret, we wanted to spend more time here and we will on our next trip to daytona beach and nearby areas, which I must say has one of the best beach in florida, we went to Miami, Key West, Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Tampa and Daytona Beach on this trip and the beach and water at Daytone impressed us the most. Highly recommended for a family or a group of 3-4 people, room is big and spacious, parking is ample and free.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, IL", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Oceanside\u201d", "Author": "Tracytfox", "ReviewID": "UR4071744", "Content": "My Husband and I stayed at the Oceanside in October 15-20. This was the week before Biketoberfest. We had a great rate from Orbitz for about $69 the first three days. We loved the area so much we stayed for 2 more. We would have stayed longer but prices went up sky high (200+) for Biketoberfest. The first night we were in a double room, but after we asked for a King we had it the next night and for the rest of the stay. Rooms were Very spacious, and clean. Housekeeping was very nice, as was the female at the front desk. The men at the front desk were a little short and rude, but we just waited for females to ask for anything. We did not do the breakfast thing, we bought some food and kept in room, so we didn't have to be up any certain time. Pool and beach were Very clean. We've been back a week and I want to go back! I recommend Crabby Joes, ate their 3 times, Inlet Harbour Restraunt ate there 2 times, and Bubba Gumps. Don't listen to bad reviews believe me, I live by tripadvisor.

This beach front hotel was perfect! The pool and grounds was clean and maintained very well every morning, the room was comfortable and had a great view of the ocean. The upper sunning deck was flawless, perfect place to grab and book and relax. The free breakfast was a little skimpy, but had hot cakes and syrup and we didnt have to pay for toast like some of the reviews said. Housekeeping staff was always kind, front desk was a little short with us because we arrived so late after driving down from Ontario Canada. Would return again in heartbeat! However, they are building a hotel right next door which in the future could ruin the view of lower number rooms, so maybe try and request a room in the teens. Also, wouldnt hurt to bring along your own pool towels, there never seemed to be enough on the shelf. Overall, a wonderful stay and didnt want to leave.

Upon arriving at the hotel late Sunday afternoon, I was told that they did not have a double room available - only kings. Since this wouldn't work she upgraded me to the penthouse suite for the same rate I was orginally suppose to pay for a double oceanfront. Very pleased - the room was absolutely amazing. Floor to ceiling windows in a corner room, full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, large living room and bedroom. The lobby was clean but a little outdated. Elevators were a little slow. Hallway carpets could use a good cleaning. Breakfast was average at best as mentioned in previous posts. The pool and grounds were very well maintained. Every morning we would watch them clean the pool, scrub the patio and hose off the sand from area (it was extremely windy that weekend - right before Ophelia). Plenty of chairs and a great oceanfront location. The tiki bar had a good selection for lunch. Nice 2 level parking garage adjacent to the hotel. Overall, we had a great time at Oceanside Inn.

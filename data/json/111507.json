Amazing location, excellent rooms. Great food. Staff is incredible. For example, when we arrived they had shown we were arriving the NEXT week. We were staying 5 nights in a Michigan Ave Suite on the 30th floor. SOMEHOW I had put in for the wrong dates! (Traveling too much I suppose) Anyhow, without skipping a beat they had us in the correct room. Great hotel for the kids, the tent they set up in the room and the Candy Man were both big hits (ask for these). Room service was great, high quality. Our suite was HUGE. The hotel is a bit on the older side perhaps, but superbly maintained so that did not bother us a bit. We ended up seeing a bunch of NBA stars in the lobby, so my older son got a big kick out of that. Oh and it is attached to a great mall. So all in all, a bit expensive, but very much worth it.

It was a tranquil escape from the crazy throngs of people over St. Patrick's Day weekend. We had two adjoining suites with friends which was very convenient. The service was impeccable. The concierge was particularly helpful and efficient. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The restaurant had wonderful food and terrific service. The only issue with service was there was no evening turndown service which is a cardinal sin at a Four Seasons! The only weakness of the hotel was the suite itself. The huge windows brought in a great deal of light which was wonderful. It was also very well maintained and spacious. That is where the superlatives for the room end. This Four Seasons could be renamed the Four Decades. The wallpaper was from the 1960['s (at least the style) and I swear it came from my grandparent's wallpaper and paint store. The curtains were from the 1970's and had to come from my great aunt's Florida condo. The furnishings were from the 1980's and the bathroom was from the 1990's. The bathroom had a shower/tube combination with a shower curtain. (Yes, a Four Seasons bathroom had a shower curtain!) YUCK! Except for the carpet and the flat screen TV's, there was no hint of anything contemporary in the room. The Four Seasons Chicago caters to well paid businessmen and rich housewives who either don\u2019t care in the case of the former or decorate their 1980 McMansions in the same manner in the case of the latter, so most people will have no issue with the decor. The gym was very large, air conditioned and had a good deal of high quality equipment. The access to Water Tower Place was very convenient. You cannot find a better location in Chicago as it is centrally located along the Magnificent Mile. Be prepared to pay a whopping parking fee of $52/night. A garage adjacent to the hotel has parking for $28/night but it fills up quickly! We were very fortunate to snag the complimentary hotel limo to take us up to North Halsted for a show. We got a decent deal on the hotel and have no regrets. This hotel is stuffy, pretentious and dated (despite the \"refreshing\" designed by my grandmother's Bridge club), but it does have top notch service, a great location and is obviously well maintained with quality materials.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect in every way\u201d", "Author": "CDM1", "ReviewID": "UR126098995", "Content": "What a place.

We love Four Seasons properties and love staying with them and Mandarin Oriental. We didn't think we could go wrong with a stay at the RC Chicago since it is actually managed by Four Seasons. Our experience was just ok. From the minute we walked up to the lower lobby I had a feeling that things were a little different for this stay. The bellmen neither held the door nor even acknowledge the fact that we were approaching the valet entrance with two large duffel bags on our shoulder's. I had to actually say \"good morning\" to them. This is way out of character for a Four Seasons. We struggled to find the elevator to the upper lobby as no one was at the valet desk to direct us. We found the upper lobby and got checked in. Check-in was pleasant and efficient even though the hotel was very busy. Our suite was not available but they promised they would text us when it was. We ventured out into the city and came back a few hours later when the room was prepared. We stayed in the Michigan Avenue Executive Suite which was nice and spacious. I was disappointed at no Keurig or small coffee maker in the room and no visible coffee in the lobby anywhere. The bathroom was also less than stellar. One giant vanity with a powder area and one small sink accompanied by plastic vanity accessories. Somewhat tacky in my opinion. The bathroom was a shower/tub combo inside the water closet area. The bathroom was not as the pictures on their website depicted at all. The view from the room was beautiful, especially at night. We got ready for dinner and left the ironing board, etc. out and figured turn down would take care of it. Our dinner experience was far less than adequate, you can read about it in Deca Chicago's reviews here on Tripadvisor. We returned to our room to find that turn down was never done and the ironing board, etc. was all still left out. Disappointed. We headed down to the spa area to enjoy the hot tub a bit before bed since we had to cancel our other plans in the city due to dinner taking so long. The young lady at the spa desk was very abrasive and somewhat rude. When we asked how to access the pool area, she looked us up and down and said \"are you swimming or looking?\" To this I replied, we had our swimsuits on under our dress clothes. She said \"sign in, you have twenty minutes.\" I looked at my partner in disgust and commented that the Four Seasons in Las Vegas had much more decorum in their spa area. The pool and hot tub was very nice and is enclosed by a large sky light. We met some nice travelers in the area and spent a while conversing with them. We made sure to not use up the 20 minutes and headed to the locker rooms. Locker room areas were nice and adequately equipped. This is also a Carlton Club so there is a lot of outside members who use the facilities in addition to the hotel guests. Breakfast the next morning was hot, delicious, and on time. The room service waiter was cheerful and very charming. I explained our dissatisfaction with the check in attendant at checkout and she assured me that the hotel manager would want to speak with me regarding the issues. Several days later, I received a call from Anthony, the hotel manager, who assured me this was a one off situation and welcomed us back anytime to try again at letting the Ritz Carlton \"wow\" us. We are headed back in May and we have high hopes that the second try will be the winning one. What a beautiful classic property, I would love for it to meet the expectations of all Four Seasons' travelers.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience, great service, first class\u201d", "Author": "Pamela J", "ReviewID": "UR125473035", "Content": "Excellent service and great amenities for kids.

This location being managed by the Four Season raised my expectations even more. Some of my review may seem tick-tack but it does distinguish this location from others in a less favorable light and therefore is worthy of mention: 1. The lobby is huge and the water fountain gives it appeal but it all gets lost with a certain lack of intimacy. The seats at the windows are high-back chairs which serve to interrupt the aesthetics and view in my opinion. The rock ledge outside the windows is unattractive. I had expected the same feel you get at the Mandarin Oriental in NYC or the Four Seasons in Miami. This isn't in that league. 2. The small bar in the lobby has no TV. There is no other bar anywhere in the hotel. Big swing and miss. 3. The lobby restaurant is a bit cold and antiseptic, large spacious open area, like eating at an indoor food court. Harsh? Maybe. Food was good. 4. Service: RC employees alwasy use your name when addressing you. It's what you come to expect. That is not the case here and I found that to be revealing. 5. Rooms were about what you would expect at an RC. 6. Location, excellent as reported but so are a huge number of other hotels in Chicago.

As with all Four Seasons Hotels, service is what truly sets apart their properties, as the RC in Chicago is at the pinnacle of this! For a 435 room hotel, the level of service I have received each & every stay is so intimate, warm, knowledgable, efficient & classy. The Front Desk is truly flawless- they have such an amazing team of people, including Kate, Sean, Jennifer, Jackie, Leticia, Christine, Pop....I could go on & on, but after staying here so many times, these amazing people have constantly exceeded my expectations!:) The rooms are really lovely- all beginning on the 15th floor (15-31 I believe) & have everything I need- a great flat screen TV with very clear pictures, large windows with stunning views (my favorite are the Lake View rooms on the 20th floor & higher), roomy bathrooms with a nice soaking tub, fantastic beds (I dream about their beds--so good!), nice mini-bar area, soft carpet, perfect closets (I love the small area on the door where I can hang my coat, shirts, etc.), a spacious desk with complimentary internet with solid speed, & an overall decor that is very soothing & masculine- I love it! The rooms are all incredibly quiet & have large wooden doors- I've never heard street noise, people talking, or any outside noise- much appreciated when traveling! The food from Room Service is amazing! The Salads, Eggs Benedict, Lemon Tart, Sandwiches, etc. are all so yummy! I love Deca, the hotels restaurant, for Lunch or an early dinner- I dined there for dinner over the weekend & it was flawless- the scallops currently featured were delicious! The setting for room service is lovely & their servers are kind & will always greet you warmly & special requests are always accommodated, which I really love. If your craving something that isn't on the menu, the staff will prepare it for you, which is so nice of all Four Seasons Hotels! The Location could not be more perfect. The hotel lobby is actually located on the 12th floor, which I love, as it provides a calmer area for guests to relax in & is very large & open with always stunning floral arrangements that are always a treat to admire:) All of the shopping on the Mag Mile is right outside the door & you have immediate access to amazing dining, shops, the lake, fantastic museums, etc. Just the best area, even though I love all of the neighborhoods of the city! It's the little details that I love most about one of my favorite hotels in the U.S.: the staff always recognizes me by name, my room is always ready for early arrival & housekeeping does an impeccable job of servicing my room~ I could constantly gush about this hotel! I wholeheartedly recommend the hotel! I have stayed at The Peninsula, The Four Seasons (which is great, the RC Chicago's sister hotel), The James, Park Hyatt, etc., but the Ritz-Carlton is just special to me- I just love being there, truly my home in Chicago!

The room, nice large enough, bathroom great. We were booked in a king but we needed a double no problem, their staff is wonderful. Beds were nice, but the hotel only had down pillows, of course I am the one of us who does not like feather pillows, but I guess I should of asked for others, my fault. The price point was great since we were on a group rate, but I would never pay their published rates, I travel a lot, but it was not to a point I would pay over $300 for the room.

The brunch was prime rib, eggs Benedict with crab cakes, Cornish game hens, variety of cheese's, yogurt parfait, smoke salmon and bagels, etc. I will have to say the crab cake eggs Benedict were wonderful, the prime rib was not the best, we had some the night before somewhere else that you could cut with your fork even thick cuts.

I asked about upgrades when I checked in, and despite that they were heavily booked for the holidays, the attendant at reception bumped us up to the 28th floor lake-view room at no additional charge. Our room was large and well-appointed, the bathroom was clean and well-lit, the robes were fluffy and comfy. We spent quite a bit of time in the room, and everything about it was exceptional. Deca, the bar and restaurant, was also great. We had some drinks there, a late-night snack, and breakfast, and I was impressed with the menu and the quality of what we ordered every time. Even the bar snacks -- salted nuts and cured olives -- were delicious enough to bear mentioning. One particular accolade: we had dinner at Gibson's Steakhouse and came back with a ton of leftovers. We got home after a late night -- it was after midnight -- and I asked the concierge if they could help us reheat them somehow. Within fifteen minutes, he sent up a microwave to our room!

We found the hotel staff to be friendly and accommodating, particularly at the concierge desk. I agree with another reviewer who described the hotel lobby as a bit tired and dated in terms of decor. Where the hotel was lacking: Coffee and Tea was provided for guests in the reception area; there was not one morning where people weren't waiting for some element (hot water, coffee, cream) to be resupplied. I think one morning I waited close to ten minutes for coffee to arrive. Perhaps coffee makers in the rooms would be a good idea after all. We had two meals in the restaurant and while the food was delicious, the service was unbelievably slow. It took over 60 minutes for us to get our Lunch.

This type of gesture is what sets FS apart from other hotels. As far as ambiance goes, the hotel feels old. Chandelier lighting in the elevator looked dusty, the doors to the room feel like the tarnish is fading, small bathrooms (the shower door swings over the toilet). I'm not used to seeing that from a FS. TV reception went in and out. The spa and pool are small - not really a spa, more like a small semi private gym. As a two lane lap pool, not something kids could just splash around freely. Seems like bldg is shared with apartment owners, and not just hotel guest - saw a lot of people in elevators with dogs. Service not quite consistently there, and never felt that they were over achieving to please. However, hotel is in ideal location. It's connected to a shopping mall, near a lot of stores (i.e. Magnificent Mile), Gino's Pizza, Garretts Popcorn, and a short 15 walk to the Red Line. Concierge and valet were very helpful. To me the true FS service takes care of the little things. They know your name, they anticipate your needs, look for ways to solve problems (example: 20 people waiting half hour for a cab on a weekday morning will just kick start a bad day - thought they would just pull some town cars to help. Here was a perfect opportunity to make it better but instead people just stood in a partly shielded taxi area with wind and rain blowing without the heatlamps on). If I could score half stars, I would have given my experience a 3.5 rating, It's good, better than average but not very good.

You needed some level of acrobatics to get in and out of the bath and the immediate proximity to the toilet was bizarre. The space is clearly there but these bathrooms need to be gutted and redesigned for this to be a truly 5-star hotel. As for the staff and public areas of the hotels - no complaints at all. Staff are very helpful and friendly and the lobby is lovely. The breakfasts were a standout - exceptional quality and exceptional service. I would stay again in this hotel just for those (and I don't usually eat breakfast!). Good location too. A final tip - after I had booked direct with the hotel I came across a site 'WhataHotel' which offered amazing complimentary perks with their bookings. It turned out that it was exactly the same price I was paying direct with the hotel but it included breakfast each day (a must!), an upgrade if available (it wasn't but the hotel was busy) and an $85 credit for a lunch as well! I emailed Greg of WhataHotel (run by Lorraine Travel in Florida) and he organised for the booking to be assigned to them so that we received the complimentary perks. Brilliant!

It is a Four Season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property with the name, logo and towels of the Ritz Carlton but without the benefits of the new Ritz customer loyalty program or the Ritz culture of customer service. For this reason, I am not going to refer to the hotel as The Ritz Carlton, but will call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Pretender.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rooms are comfortable but tired. They were nice in 1982. The hotel has the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lobby. Like many hotels in the Windy City, you must take an elevator from street level to a higher floor where they locate the lobby. The Pretender is connected to a vertical shopping mall, but most of the shops located there are on the lower end and the crowd has baggy jeans and wear their baseball caps backwards and to the side. The fitness center, which is nothing special, is located in a separate elevator bank from the rooms and from the elevators that get you to the street\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, there are three different elevator banks which can be hell if you leave for a drink and you are going to want to leave for a drink. The food in the lobby restaurant is good and the service is excellent. Breakfast is wonderful. The Pretender has a small bar in the lobby and no other bar on the property. If you enjoy a hotel bar, you do not want to stay here\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtry The Peninsula instead. The bellmen are outstanding and very helpful in every conceivable way. The crew is absolutely first rate. The front desk folks try hard to be helpful, but they seem to have very little discretion to accomplish much for you without asking someone else somewhere else for permission. At a real Ritz, when you ask the folks at the front desk for something, they most always answer, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will take care of it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and then they go and try to figure out how they are going to do that. At The Pretender, they share their stream of consciousness thoughts with you about how difficult it will be to accomplish your request and then they never give you much confidence that it is really going to happen. If you are from a small town in the Midwest and you are making a trip to the big city, you might be impressed by The Pretender.

Now, I must say that each time a mistake was made, management went out of their way to compensate us in some form or another. We were eventually placed in a beautiful corner suite and we received many, many, many orders of champagne and strawberries. They even offered to comp our cold breakfast, but our breakfasts were already included in our package. After awhile, the complimentary items lost their appeal. What we really wanted was a wonderfully romantic weekend, indulged in luxury that we usually deny ourselves. Unfortunately, the hotel's missteps caused us to fall slightly short of these expectations. I really hope our experience was the exception rather than the rule at the Ritz in Chicago. I do want to say, though, that this hotel has the most complete workout facility I have ever seen in a hotel gym.

They told me, they will see if they can locate any for us. Within minutes, there was a knock on our door.....they brought us a few boxes. They were exactly what we needed.

When we arrived, one of the desk clerks came from behind the the counter with a wagon of toys for my girls to select one each. Great way to start. Then they had a cookie and gummy bears waiting in our room. The fact that there were little bath robes that were their size just thrilled them to death! They give each child a small bag of fish food to feed the gold fish in the indoor pond. They also do a little cookie decorating lesson where they are given chef hats to color then get to roll out and cookie cut dough. The baked cookies are later delivered to your room with icing for decorating. We never ate there so I don't know about the food. My only problem was that they put us in a room with only one king sized bed. They brought in a roll away cot and my little one (six years old) had to sleep on the couch. It all worked out fine and bc we had such a great rate ($199 which is good for the Ritz) I didn't want to question it and be a pain. But overall, it was worth it.

I saw them deal with other guests (at one point, a lady told a guest one moment someone will be with you soon & she went back to her computer screen to type....it was really rude & I have never seen this occur at a Four Seasons) & they all just seem the same.....it's really strange, b/c they all have Les Clefs'dor status for the most part, which is an honor among Concierges. I'M NOT GOING TO name the Concierges I saw being less than friendly, but maybe it's b/c it's a Union property & these guys have worked there forever & are just not warm anymore......just something to note if you're going to need Concierge assistance while visiting!

Despite some minor slips for this visit, it's still the one we consider first when planning a trip to the Windy City. We come to Chicago almost annually, but somehow missed last year. As it turns out, we also missed the Ritz's entire remodeling phase where first the rooms and then the public areas were redone. The lobby apparently reopened less than a month before our visit. The rooms, previously a pleasant but busy cacophony of floral prints, are now a more subdued and contemporary palette of blue-gray. The bathrooms were redone previously and are unchanged. The rooms now boast a large desk with ergonomic chair and a console with drawers, and shelves that house the electronic safe and DVD player (the old safes that needed a key to open are still situated in the closet). The new large flat screen, high def TV sits on top. The windows now have a sunscreen as well as block-out drapes. There are interesting architectural photos in both the rooms and public areas. Minor changes that perhaps reflect the current economy: the bar of soap for the shower is the same size as the one for the sink (it used to be larger), there are fewer complimentary newspaper choices offered (Chicago Tribune and Wall Street Journal only, before there also was USA Today and New York Times), the room service menu has an all-day section rather than separate lunch and dinner menus. At first glance, the lobby appears unchanged, but upon closer inspection we realize the marble around the fountain has been replaced, as has the carpeting, now also marble. The former Cafe restaurant is now called Deca, with a private dining room in the Cafe's former entryway. The Greenhouse Lounge under the skylight is now the Deca Bar. There is new furniture throughout. Deca has a French bistro menu--we dined there one evening and it was quite good. Like the Cafe before it, it never seems too crowded. The Greenhouse served a fabulous weekend brunch that for now is no longer offered at Deca, but the hostess said it may soon return. The hotel's strongest attribute has always been its service. Four Seasons standards and Midwestern friendliness combine to great effect here. The concierges are particularly helpful; we recognized many familiar faces. When we checked in around 8am after a red-eye flight, a room was not immediately available, so we went to the spa to shower and freshen up. I ran into the same outgoing local resident (a spa member) from my last visit, who loves to greet new guests and give impromptu tours of the facilities. At least this time he was a bit further along in his routine--he was wearing briefs, whereas last time he was nude. We were contacted by phone around 10:30 saying our room was ready, but we then discovered it didn't have the southern view we prefer. We were immediately moved to another room on the same floor with the desired view, but were not informed, as we should have been, that this room was smaller-- a Moderate vs. a Deluxe. We opted to stay in this room and it was fine--it had all the same furnishings and we actually preferred the bathroom, which was one large room with a single sink, rather than the split bath in the Deluxe rooms with a large double sink area, but a cramped toilet/shower/tub area. As always, we chose to take the CTA subway from O'Hare, a cheap ($2.25) 45 minute ride that ends about 3 blocks from the hotel. There are four stairways and a transfer involved, however. The American Girl store that used to be below the nearby Peninsula Hotel is now in an even larger space in Water Tower Place just below the Ritz, only an elevator ride away. We love the hotel's location just off the Magnificent Mile, and as always, we visited the Museum of Contemporary Art across the street and gawked at the landmark Mies van der Rohe apartments on Lake Shore Drive a few blocks away. We discovered Mies' own apartment was in a building across the street from the Ritz. I'll admit we actually split our hotels for this visit and tried the James as well as the Ritz. We had also heard nice things about the new Elysian. Plus there are the well regarded Peninsula, Park Hyatt, Trump Tower and Four Seasons hotels.

The service has always been excellent, the hotel is quiet and elegant, and the location can't be beat (I'm not a big shopper, but since I always seem to forget some item of clothing when I travel, the fact that it is attached to Water Tower Place is a huge plus). Most often I'm there for a relaxing weekend with my husband and we stay in the Anniversary Suite. We were pleased to find on our visit over the New Year holidays that the suite, whose decor had been pretty dated (floral upholstery and botanical prints), had been renovated with a modern pewter and purple color scheme and almost entirely new furniture. Also new were flat-panel TVs and sun-blocking window shades. We did find. though, that the living area of the suite seemed rather sparse. When the surprised bellman remarked that it was missing several pieces of furniture, maybe it should have tipped us off to an inattention to detail that was repeated throughout our stay. Our complaints: -A few of the things we love about the hotel (and that set it apart from competitors) are its bright and spacious lobby with a cafe and lounge area that are perfect for regrouping (high tea is also served there, if you're into that), and its dining room which hosts a fantastic brunch on Sundays and some holidays. We weren't informed when we reserved that all of these are being renovated and are closed until May, and it was an unwelcome surprise to find this out upon arrival. When we complained, we were told that the decision not to inform guests of the renovations was a deliberate one that was made at the corporate level. It's hard to blame the property for a corporate decision, but regardless, for repeat guests it was a bait and switch. -We're used to top-notch, five star service at the Ritz Carlton, and this time we didn't get it. We used the normally excellent laundry service and didn't receive our clothes until hours after they were promised, and only after calling for them. Room service breakfast that was promised within 55 minutes (too long a wait in any case) didn't arrive within 90 minutes, when we canceled and received a weak apology before heading across the street to the Peninsula (which was hosting a brunch comparable to the one we couldn't get at the Ritz). We were happy with management's response when made aware of these problems (comping us a breakfast and promising a room upgrade on our next stay), and as a result we'll probably give the Ritz another shot after the renovations are complete.

The room faced south with what real estate agents would describe as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peek view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier, but had shades and curtains that kept the morning sun at bay until we were ready to greet it. The bath was quite large with double sinks; a separate tub and toilet area; generous, fluffy towels; a hair dryer; lighted makeup mirror; robes and slippers; and high-end L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane en Provence amenities. Lounging about in bathrobes, reading the paper, and sipping coffee is a great way to start the day so, on Saturday morning, we decided to treat ourselves to room service. The French Country breakfast consisted of assorted, cured meats and cheeses, artisan bread, a croissant, citrus mostarda, caf\u00c3\u00a9 au lait, and brewed coffee. It was delivered within 1/2 hour of our call and was delicious! Thus fortified, we got ready to head out onto the Magnificent Mile and enjoy some surprisingly glorious November weather. After a day spent doing a little shopping and a lot of wandering through art galleries along the Mag Mile and in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s River North neighborhood, we were ready for a nice dinner. Chicago is also home to a number of wonderful dining spots, many are within easy walking distance of the Ritz-Carlton. While my wife and I thoroughly enjoy fine food and aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitant about paying for it, some of the trendier spots in the area seemed to smack of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popularity premium,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so we asked one of the concierge staff for other recommendations. The concierge, a member of Les Clef d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Or, recommended a new Mexican restaurant that opened on Kinzie Street in September, just a short cab ride from the hotel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot to do in Chicago, from shopping and sightseeing when the weather is good to a broad range of museums, theatres, and other indoor attractions when the weather is bad. I highly recommend considering The Ritz-Carlton as your base of operations, no matter what the weather!", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Salthillhalli", "ReviewID": "UR47874838", "Content": "Stayed at the Ritz Carlton Chicago after attending a meeting at the Westin Michigan Avenue.

Right on time I received a call on my cell that they were prepared for us. The lobby is grand and probably the one area of the hotel that may need a makeover, not that is anyway bad it is just a little old fashioned especially when the guestrooms have a more modern design. The guestrooms (seemed like were recently renovated) were very spacious, plush carpets, nice comfortable blues and greys, great beds (much better than the Westin \"Heavenly\" beds), spotless, large windows (we were on the 21st floor) and had great views.

Upon arrival, we were greeted quickly by the valet staff in a cheerful manner. After unloading our luggage and taking the elevator up to the 12th floor lobby, we checked in at the desk. I asked for an upgrade (as I was instructed to do when I made the reservation). The woman attending us somewhat ignored my request and handed us our keys and hotel information. I asked again about the upgrade at which point she commented that all the \"suites\" were already appointed. Her non-friendly tone was not what I wanted to begin our stay.

The room we chose (executive suite king) was beautiful! It was a corner room with 3 huge windows and a beautiful view of the city and lake michigan from the 18th floor. We took advantage of the cookie making session with the hotel chef (which is free- just request it in advance). They delivered our cookies later in the evening via room service.

We had made our reseravtion in April, with an arrival on July 28th. My wife was in Boston the week before, and I was to join her in Chicago on the 28. We had to make a change so that she would arrive on the 27, one day before me. When she arrived for checking in, she was rebuffed as she was told that as her name was not on the reservation, even if her passeport stated that she was my wife, she could not stay at the hotel! She was then required to call me in Paris (in the middle of the night) with her cellphone (well she could have called anyone in fact, but at no cost for the hotel) so that I confirm she was to stay with me! That for the greeting! 2. The next day, before my arrival, she was called to the front desk and informed that her Visa card was not providing for the payment of the stay. This was true, but why not wait for my arrival the same day ? I was the one who made the booking. This was truly very poor manners from the hotel to bother my wife at this moment, when you think we were to stay 10 days! 3. A few days later, the same problem arised with my own credit card. I went to the front desk and explained that I had to call my bank in Paris to settle the matter, but due to time difference, had to wait until the next morning. In the afternoon of the same day, I was summoned again at the front desk, for the same reason, by the duty manager. I told him that I already explained that I would call my bank in the morning; but it was not enough for him : first, he showed me that my card was not accepted, then he asked me how I will be paying if it was not accepted, then he suggested that I met someone from the accounting department by 9 am...So much pressure, and we had still 4 nights to stay there. It was truly intimidating, rude, and I felt like if I was a potential criminal. Besides these bad experiences, I must say that the service was not on a high standard. Breakfast was difficult to obtain in the lobby, coffee was cold by the time breads arrived,etc. We were offered to take off a night from our bill, anyway on the next morning, we asked for the breakfast in the room and it arrived with one capuccino instead of two, and no bagels that had been ordered.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, TX", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel\u201d", "Author": "la_walt", "ReviewID": "UR37783613", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for three nights in August.

This would have been too expensive for us with two rooms, (which is what we really wanted) so we crammed into a deluxe executive suite, approx $700 night with taxes...(and don't forget the $40 plus per night parking!) whew! Lucky that third night was \"free\". But we knew all this going in so it is not a strike against the hotel. But what is does is set expectations extremely high... The lobby is beautiful, large, sunny, nice fountain in the middle. Our room, on the 20th floor....eh.... It had a main sitting room with a pull out couch, then the master bedroom separated by frosted french doors. It did have two bathrooms, but they were small and not \"luxurious\" at all, with combined bath/shower. Also, we joked about the \"ergodynamic\" toilets... they are kind of low, and rather tilt you backwards. There was enough room for the four of us, but tight when the rollaway was out. The main king size bed was extremely comfortable, nice fluffy bath towels and I love those four seasons robes. It was clean. Oddly there was no TV channel information, that would have been appreciated. Of course teen sons quickly figured out the remote to get channel listings, but my old eyes couldn't see it very well on the t.v. when laying on the bed. You can request newspapers to be delivered to your door every morning, which we did. We went down to look at the spa/pool area first thing. It was unimpressive, to say the least. The pool is a small, very small lap pool. The whirlpool was small and didn't look very appealing at all, like not so clean, and not filled all the way? As far as I could tell, it was not being cleaned at the time as there was no sign and a family was in it! I did work out in their gym, and the equipment, for a hotel gym, was very good. Nice touch to have cooled towels available and someone going around bringing everyone water. We did not eat at the hotel, nor did very many others by the look of the lobby restaurant every time we passed by. We did have coffee and drinks at the lobby bar, that was nice (and, yes, expensive!) So yes, I liked this hotel, didn't love it, probably will try somewhere else in the future as for me, it did not justify the cost and have that \"Four Seasons\" feeling. It's not fair to compare a city Four Seasons to a resort Four Seasons (like Nevis, one of the most magical stays in the world) but I have stayed at the St. Louis Four Seasons, which was, to me, way more impressive than this one, and will be staying at the Four Seasons Philadelphia in a few weeks, which my husband has already stayed in, and loves.

I am not a big four seasons fan--except for thier spas and Vegas location but someone from their hotel (they own the property) needs to walk across the street and see the tarnish this property is putting ont the Four Seasons name. To me this use to be the place to stay in Chicago--times have changed.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGrand OLD Hotel Needs a Facelift\u201d", "Author": "akboxak", "ReviewID": "UR8314554", "Content": "I was fortunate enough to spend several days in Chicago for work and pleasure. The Gold Coast area and Miracle Mile are wonderful places to vacation, as evidenced by throngs of tourists everywhere. I stayed at the Ritz but also visited the Four Seasons and the Peninsula. My review is based somewhat on comparisons of these three properties. The main issue with the Ritz is that the it is showing its age. We stayed in a deluxe room which rack rate is around $600 a night. And for this rate you do not really get very much. Small rooms, old furniture, tiny television and the view is dependent on the floor you are on. You can just have so much better at the price, especially abroad. In contrast, the rooms at the Peninsula are brand new as are the rooms at the FS. The lobby has a bright, open feel and the atrium is a great place for coffee or brunch. The spa area however is small and the pool is a tiny lap pool with really ugly jacuzzi. This was a disappointment as I love to swiim. In comparison, the spa at the peninsula is on the top floor. It is really lovely with a giant lap pool and a great bright feeling throughout the locker room and workout areas. On the other hand, service was impeccable and the food was very good. Brunch in the atrium was excellent. In the future, I would probably stay at the Peninsula. Pros: 1. Great service. Concierge will do everything for you. 2. Tasty Food. Do have brunch there. 3. Comfy bed. Cons: 1. Tired rooms and facilities 2. Small spa, pool, and gym. 3. Not a great value for your money.", "Date": "August 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent\u201d", "Author": "MusicFlyer", "ReviewID": "UR8252533", "Content": "When you come to Chicago and you want to spoil yourself, your loved one and family, stay here.

Everything he requested was honored (higher floor, great view of city and lake and fireworks). He also requested rose petals to be sprinkled around the room and they not only accomodated his request but sent us a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to toast with... all complimentary! For the 4th of July we had a great view of the fireworks display over Lake Michigan from our room. You can also see the sparkling city buildings, Navy Pier and historic Water Tower from the room... gorgeous views! We had afternoon tea one day and drinks and appetizers the next in The Greenhouse. The tea was quite lovely and the water fountain in the lobby soothing. I also highly recommend afternoon tea at The Peninsula (across the street). The Peninsula also serves a Children's Tea, Ice Cream Social and Chocolate Buffet. We had breakfast only once at the cafe in the Ritz, also in the lobby, but it was not as good as The West Egg, huevos rancheros are excellent there! Room service was always prompt, concierge was very accomodating and assisted with local inquiries and reservations. A taxi ride from the hotel to just about anywhere is always less than $10 including tip. Michigan Ave / Magnificent Mile is steps from the hotel entrance and you also have a private entrance from the Ritz into the Macy's shopping center. All in all, a great hotel with excellent services and staff! The city itself is great to visit summer or winter. There are so many new parks and there are water fountains, plants and flowers every street you walk down. Spend atleast one afternoon just exploring the city and its hidden gems. We also dined at Quartino's... they were open late on a week night (2am) and had wonderful Italian pizzas with a thin, soft semolina crust; cured meat and cheese plates and authentic Limencello.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Excellent!\u201d", "Author": "TheExploringCanucks1", "ReviewID": "UR7976986", "Content": "A very well located property.

The fitness facilities and the pool are great - and this is the area where I found the staff very genuine and helpful. Decor is OK, if a little dated.

This hotel has an entrance at the street level with a desk for an attendant who provides directions from the lobby to the 12th floor where reception is located. The street level lobby is lackluster, the elevators are old and slow and the reception floor is the strangest kitsch decor one could imagine. The reception floor was drab and the skylight windows were grimy. My hotel room was small and continued the kitschy theme of Italianate wallpaper and American colonial furniture. The interior designer of this hotel must be psychotic. I have stayed at many Ritz Carlton's and this one was a letdown for style and age. The hotel needs a remodel and/or Ritz Carlton needs to move to a new location. On a positive note, the location is fantastic as it is on a quiet street but only a 2 minute walk to either Michigan Avenue or to the lakefront and a running path. Don't count on getting a late bite to eat at the in-tower shopping center as everything shuts down early.

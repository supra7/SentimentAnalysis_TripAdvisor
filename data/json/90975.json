But the Silversmith itself is not particularly high-end when you look at the details. The sheets, fixtures, etc. weren't much nicer than any major chain motel. Our shower wouldn't get hot enough, and had an old showerhead. The bath amenities were spare- shampoo, lotion, and a soap, unlike nicer hotels. And the decor attempts to be arts &crafts, but actually is more like a spruced up 70's room. They had installed granite counters in the bathroom, which was nice, but it's like they only went halfway in renovating the hotel. It masquerades as upscale, but is actually just basic, midrange.

We make it to Chicago once a year or so, but we haven't stayed overnight in a while. After some internet searching, I found the Silversmith hotel. Was only three blocks from the Chicago Theater. One plus. The Arts and Crafts style of the decor is something my wife and I like. Second plus. They were running a special, adn it was cheaper than just about any other place I could find on the timeframe I had. Third plus. Took the Metra in from Waukegan, so we ended up taking a cab from Ogilvie Station. The cab ride was $10 with tip from the station. We thought about driving into Chicago and parking at the Millennium Park garage as it was much cheaper than the valet at the hotel, but we decided the train/taxi would add to the experience. We were greeted by a doorman when we arrived at the hotel, and he directed us to the elevators to access the second floor lobby. At check in, I requested a room away from the El tracks, and we were given a king size room on the opposite side of the hotel. Perfect. We only heard the trains when we were trying to. The room was spacious, much larger than we had experienced in previous stays in older Chicago hotels. The bathroom was large, and the bed was comfortable. The window view was of the backs of other buildings, but we were prepared for that. IN all honesty, the Arts and Crafts theme of the room was largely stuck on accents and furnishings, but the room was clean and well kept. There is a 7/11 right around the corner, a Dunkin Donuts across the street, and Garrett's Popcorn is a block away. Just fine for low rolling tourists like ourselves. Just a block off of State Street, and a couple blocks from Macy's.

I then called the hotel, talked to the manager and was told that a group had overstayed their booking, so the hotel had canceled some incoming reservations. She said they would try to find a room for me somewhere else but were not having any luck doing so for other canceled reservations. I never heard back from them. I then called hotels.com several times over the next hour, and they said the best they could do was put me up in a hotel in a suburb 30 MILES AWAY! This was at 7 p.m., and I was arriving at Union Station downtown. I told them that was unacceptable -- I didn't have a car, was unfamiliar with public transportation and a cab ride would cost $50 or more each way and take well more than an hour in rush hour traffic the next morning. They said that after an hour of calling around, that's the best they could do. I told them to cancel my reservation and reimburse my credit card, which they did. I then intruded on someone 10 miles away and slept on their floor. Even then, the cab rides were $25 each way, and I arrived at my meeting the next morning exhausted and upset.

My guess is this would be more significant on the lower floors, especially for light sleepers. The L runs until about 2am, so it won't be a problem for the night owls either way. The mattress was great, and the furniture in general was fine all around. The TVs (there were two) in the room are indeed older tubes & not LCDs, but who'll be wasting their trip watching them anyway? The clock radio was nicer than usual, with two alarms and a CD player built-in. Room overall was quite clean, a couple of notches below 'sparkling'.

The building is an old heritage building and is reflected in the lobby styling. The staff I encountered were all pleasant and helpful.

The location was fabulous. The EL was super close, but you could also walk to many attractions (mag mile, sears tower, millenium park, river cruises). Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby too. The hotel itself is nothing special. We did have a nice two room suite. The bathroom is very large. However, the TVs need to be updated (also have annoying habit of going to the same 'hotel' station whenever you turn the tv on). The airconditioning is extremely loud. Although this hotel is right next to the EL, the noise was not an issue at all (or maybe we just couldn't hear it over the crazy loud A/C). There is a free in-room safe which is handy and a fridge in the room (be wary of brining in your own alcohol as they will charge a corkage fee - ridiculous). The free computer in the lobby is nice, but it is SUPER slow. The staff are not overly friendly or helpful. We saw the same dirty tray of room service left in the hallway for 2 days! The room keys are a huge pain as they keep getting demagnified. The clerks said if you keep your keys near credit cards or cell phones, they become demagnified and have to be reprogrammed. Even though we kept ours in a separate pocket, they had to be reprogrammed almost every day (over 5 days). Annoying. You have to use your card in the elevator, which at first I assumed was a security measure (meaning, unless you were staying at that hotel, you could not access floors with rooms), but it turns out you can access any floor from the stairwell, so not really a good security measure, plus a real pain when your keys don't work. Since this hotel is near the EL you can just take the EL to get to/from the airport which is handy (45 minute ride). We arrived early and our room was not ready, but they put our luggage in storage, so we could go explore the city until the room was ready, which was nice.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cOh I dont think so!!!!\u201d", "Author": "msluv2travel23", "ReviewID": "UR117757565", "Content": "Moved my daughter back to school this weekend and stayed here based on the wonderful reviews.

I should also mention that I have stayed at this hotel with my bike before and I have never had an issue.

The good thing was there were other triathletes also waiting to check in with the same bike issue so having others to back me was essential. Can you imagine having dozens of people (or more) at 4:00 am trying to get their bikes out of the storage area? Plus we all need to gear up our bikes with water bottles, food, pump up the tires etc, should that be taking place in a crowded lobby? Besides, I would need to leave my bike unattended to run back to the room to put my pump back, who in their right mind would do that? Road bikes are not cheap! So the concierge saw that there was a small group of us having an issue and stepped in. She basically made it happen but the young man at the front desk basically said I would not be welcome back again. I will look for other options in the future.

We had a room with 2 double beds. The height of the ceiling really made it feel grand. The bathroom was also surprisingly large, which is plus. Often in big cities you have to give up space if you want to save a little money, but this wasn't the case at the Silversmith! Some people are complaining about the noise from the train. I don't know where their rooms were, but from our room we barely noticed. Every now and then we'd hear what sounded like a gust of wind, but that was it. Actually, the sound was rather soothing. Other people have commented on the \"outdated\" furnishings. With an emphasis on solid wood and an earthy color palette, the design of the hotel recalls the Arts & Crafts Movement of the late 19th and early 20th century. This is very appropriate considering the building's history. If you're a history/design/architecture person like I am, you'll really appreciate it. Otherwise, I can see how some people might simply write-off the furnishings & fixtures as \"outdated.\" There are many things I liked about this hotel. Our room had a nice closet so we were able to hide all of our bags & luggage away. I think it always makes a room look unnecessarily cluttered, so having a closet is great. The room was very clean. Each day we came back to our beds neatly made. The sheets and bedding are comfy, and there are plenty of pillows. The refrigerator came in handy for storing leftovers. Cold pizza in the middle of the night? Yes, please. The price and the location of the hotel can't be beat. The 'L' train is only a few steps from the door, and there are also several bus stops nearby. The hotel is within walking distance to Millennium Park, the Art Institute, and dozens of restaurants. If you like to eat late, there's a pub just down the street that serves food until 2 am. There's one minor thing I didn't necessarily \"hate,\" so I'll be brief. When you walk in, you have to take the elevator up to the 2nd floor to get to the lobby & check-in desk. The doormen are nice though. The ground floor smells like garbage, not sure why.

Overall it was a pretty good experience given the price of the rooms. I think we received a really good deal on the rooms because it was December in Chicago- not exactly the height of tourist season. The Room: My friends and I stayed in 2 conjoining rooms right across from the elevator on one of the upper floors. There was no view out of our windows other than the building next door. I'm not sure if any of the rooms have a view at this hotel or not. The furnishings and overall vibe of the room was that it was quite old, but nice enough. The rooms were decently spacious and comfortable, but nothing special. The bathrooms especially felt very old. The Service/ Hotel Overall: There is a very nice lobby on the 2nd floor with computers, a piano, and lots of seating. This was convenient because we arrived early and our rooms weren't ready yet. The concierge and the other staff were all very friendly and helpful. The one thing that was \"off\" about the hotel was that the street-level interest consistently smelled very bad. The location: This was the BEST thing about the hotel other than the price. The hotel is about 2 blocks from Millennium Park with great museums and entertainment. Most attractions are walkable from the hotel. However, for the things that are not within walking distance, the hotel is located HALF a block from the El- Chicago's transit system. This was extremely convenient, especially because you can ride the El directly to both of Chicago's main airports! We saved a lot by not taking a cab!

Great location is about all I can say that's positive. The smell was bad in the room when we went in- moldy and musty. Windows didn't open, and anyway they were overlooking a brick wall and HVAC units and into someone's bathroom. We turned on the AC which sounded like a freight train, but cleared the air a bit. The bathroom was large, and looked and smelled clean. The \"suite\" consisted of one cramped, dark room, separated into two spaces by a partial-height semitransparent partition that didn't in any way block sounds or light. There was a 1.5-inch gap between the bottom of the front door and the hallway, meaning that one could clearly hear (and see the shadows of) people walking past the room in the hallway. The bed in the living room was- well- I wouldn't really call it a bed. Three inches of wire springs covered by oddly discolored canvas, overlying three hard metal bars and some wires for the \"bed frame\". Sitting on the bed between metal struts resulted in dipping down at least a foot. We took the mattress off the couch frame and put it on the floor so at least it would be flat. It actually hurt to walk on it with bare feet due to the metal springs. It compressed to about an inch-think pancake. I called downstairs and asked if they had any mattress pads or another mattress and they said \"no\". They did not offer any assistance. I padded the mattress with all the towels and blankets I could find, and called down for some more. After several calls, two towels and one blanket arrived, 40 minutes later. The king size bed in the \"bed room\" was very hard but otherwise manageable. Pillows were nice and plush. I have dust mite allergies and had to use my inhaler throughout the night. After a long and uncomfortable night, (btw LOTS of noise from the train, didn't bother us so much but if you were sensitive to that stay away from the train side of the building), we checked out. The front desk person charged my card for the night we didn't stay, claiming there was a \"penalty\" for early check-out. I explained the situation but she said \"that's the first complaint I've ever heard about the bed in the living room\". Given how bad it was I simply cannot believe that to be true. In any case, the front desk person said there was no manager reachable for another 26 hours and there was nothing she could do. We paid and fled. I will never go back and don't recommend to anyone else. BTW, i did see another room on a higher floor. Similarly dank gloomy and musty, wouldn't want to stay there either.

The Silversmith is conveniently located, with plenty of restaurants and theater within a short walking distance. Plus, the L is close by, so all of Chicago is easily accessible from the Silversmith.

The elevated metro does run on the same street at the hotel (about every 15 minutes) and while I could hear it during the daytime, it never disturbed me at night, and I am a light sleeper. I did have a 10th floor room facing the inner courtyard, and that may have helped. This hotel was the quietest hotel I have ever stayed at in Chicago, which was a welcome reprieve from the bustling city. The staff deserves a mention - at every opportunity, they went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and convenient. I really only have three complaints about this hotel, and they are VERY minor. First, they do not provide conditioner - just \"moisturizing shampoo\". Not a big deal, since there is a CVS on the same block. Second, the internet was a little slow, and it was ethernet, not wifi, which was a little inconvenient. But it was free, which is a rare find in nicer hotels. Third, the hotel is difficult to locate between the jewelry shops. I walked up and down the street twice before I finally called the front desk for help, and they patiently stayed on the phone with me until I found the front entrance.

We arrived very early on Friday morning and although our room was not yet ready, we left our bags with the bellman and toured the city. Our room was ready before Noon, which was a big plus. Overall Location The hotel is directly located next to several L lines, but none of which we took during our stay. The Blue and Red line are within a short walking distance, however. Several previous posts included comments noting that the hotel was hard to identify. I'm not sure how that could have been the case since there are several flags hanging outside the building with the hotel name on them. In addition, the awning over the front door says The Silversmith Hotel. Also, I found downtown to be bustling the majority of the day, including late at night. We stayed at the hotel Friday through Sunday. The hotel is located very closely to Millenium Park (a must see) and about a 25 minute, fast-paced walk to the Navy Pier area. Room Our room was on the eigth floor overlooking the L and Wabash Avenue. I did not find the L noise to be a problem at all. I noticed that there are two sets of windows, probobly to seel out the outside noise. Room furniture was very nice, but the mattress or boxspring (not sure which) was quite squeeky. Not too big of a problem because we were extremely exhausted whenever we were ready to sleep. I did think the armoir/tv piece of furniture was way too big for the room and sorta stuck out like a sore thumb. Room was otherwise very clean and had no issues. Staff / Front Desk I was happy not have to pass the front desk every time I walked in an out of the hotel. I see having the front desk on the second floor as a plus rather than a negative. I reached out to the front desk for a restaurant recommendation, but we opted for another restaurant. The bellman were okay and asked if we needed any recommendations or directions when we left the building at night time. Stay Again I'd likely stay again if I were able to secure a cheap rate, but if not I'd prefer to be more north. Chicago is a huge city and L trips can be a little time consuming.

Checkin was smooth and I was given a King suite (an unexpected surprise). The room was one of the largest I've ever stayed in! There was a sofa and sitting area, along with the king sized bed. The bathroom was big enough to sleep in, and had both a shower and a jetted tub. Everything seemed fairly clean, although the furnishings were a bit dated. Being in the Loop, there were not a lot of options in the evening, but if you walk a few blocks north (towards the river), there were plenty of nice eateries to choose from.

I wanted to stay in walking distance of the Millennium Park and downtown and found this hotel at a very reasonable rate ($160/night including taxes) which is definitely on the cheaper side for hotels around the Loop. The location was perfect for what I wanted to do and see - only a short block away from Cloud Gate. Finding the hotel was a little tricky - buried among dozens of similar looking buildings in what is known as Chicago's Jewelers Row, they only have a small door with no distinguishing features indicating they are a hotel as their entrance. I was only directed to it by the valet guys standing across the street. Check-in: The lobby is located on the second floor with the hotel restaurant and store on the first floor. A bit of a weird layout choice but ok... Check-in was fairly quick. I booked a double room, asking for a king, and received a triple. The room: The room was extremely spacious. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was far from modern but the ceilings were extremely high with floor to ceiling windows and overall a clean room. It had two separate rooms, a bedroom with a small desk and a living room. Each room had a TV, which was nice. The bathroom was probably the largest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in a hotel room. The tub had bad drainage issues but otherwise the bathroom was clean. All-in-all, the room was fine...it had the basics and most importantly was clean! Negatives: 1)The hotel does provide free internet but the lobby is the only area with Wi-Fi. Computers had to be hooked up to a cable at the desk in the rooms. What made it even more inconvenient was that the cable was just a couple feet long, forcing you to keep the computer at the desk. 2) My room was facing the trains and unfortunately, could be heard loud and clear all day and night. 3) I used the valet service at the hotel for $47/night with unlimited usage throughout the day. I called the valet extension to have them get the car in the morning but no one picked up for 10 minutes. I finally called the front desk where a gentleman answered. He reassured me that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call down and take care of it and to allow 15 to 20 minutes. I went outside about 15 minutes later to find no one in sight. I figured someone was getting my car. Unfortunately, that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. About 5 minutes later a valet guy shows up, says hello and asks if i needed help.

Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago (near Millennium Park), the Silversmith hotel is surprisingly difficult to locate, at least for me. The hotel staff & valet are very helpful and outgoing, and the room is clean and comfortable. The hotel was a tough find because it's located near the train and has a very undistinguished front door (on South Wabash Avenue between East Madison Street and East Monroe Street next to the TCF Bank). For this meeting, I was deciding between the Silversmith and Holiday Inn Mart Plaza, and I think I'll try the Holiday Inn next time for comparison. The Good 1. Great location. Walking distance to Millennium/Grant Park, State Street (shopping), and Intelligentsia Coffee. 2. The hotel and valet staff are friendly and helpful; even at midnight. I had an 100 lbs product shipped to the hotel, and it was brought to my room when I checked in and brought back down in the morning. While I had no other alternative but to use the hotel's valet service, I felt the valet service was very professional and courteous. Each morning, I would called down for my car to be readied at a certain time and it was always on-time and ready to go. Look it up on Google Map's \"Street View\" before heading there. The Not-So-Good 1. The complimentary internet is extremely slow. Think 28.8k dial-up speed. This was very annoying because I was kept up trying to access emails and vendor info because only one would operate at any given time. 2. While on the highest floor (10th), I can still hear the train operating directly in front of the hotel. 3. Parking is \u00c3\u00bcber expensive: $42/day, but I doubt other comparable hotels in the area are charging less. From previous posts, I read about a nearby parking garage that charges less, but I was told that the nearby parking garage charges each time you enter and exit the garage. Since I was constantly in-and-out, I reluctantly paid the hotel's parking fees. 4.

The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and immaculate. Elevators were quick, public areas were comfortable -- we enjoyed our 4-night stay enormously and will certainly return next time we are in the city. Two tips: 1) If you are very sensitive to noise, ask for a room away from the street. The L runs right outside the hotel and you will hear it. In interior rooms, however, the trains sound more like a whoosh of wind than a clattering train. 2) There is a large parking garage half a block south at Wabash and Monroe. If you park your car there yourself, you'll save about $7 a day extra the valet parking costs. We just parked our car and left it, and used the L and buses -- order visitor travel cards in advance from the CTA website for great savings. The hotel is on the east side of the Loop, very close to Macy's (nee: Marshall Fields), Grant Park, the Art Institute, theaters, restaurants, and all sorts of public transportation. If you're here to shop the Mag Mile, Michigan Avenue is one block east, a 2-minute walk, where a five minute bus ride on just about any bus that goes by will take you to that shopping Mecca. All rooms in the Silversmith have access to free high-speed internet via an Ethernet cable provided in the room. It worked flawlessly. The restaurant is open from early morning until 10 p.m., but we didn't eat there, having our own favorites. It's not cheap.

The hotel was a bit tricky to locate from the street due to only a small sign at the hotel entrance. We called the hotel and the front desk clerk was able to provide us with exact directions. We opted to park in the Self-Park garage located on Monroe Street (just around the corner from the hotel) instead of valet parking. The garage fee was $36 a night versus the $42 fee that the hotel charged. We checked in without any problems and went to our standard room with two double beds. Overall the room was clean and appeared to be spacious with very high ceilings. After a few minutes of getting settled in, we noticed a very foul fishy/urine smell on one of the beds. It was not only on the bed spread but also on the sheets. We promptly called the front desk to notify them and the front desk clerk, Rossi, was more than rude to us. He told us that it was unlikely that he had any other rooms with 2 double beds and he didn't know how soon a maid could come to take care of the bed. He then called back and in a rude tone of voice told us that he could give us a room with a king sized bed and a sleeper couch. We agreed to take this room. When we went back down to the front desk to get our new keys, we asked to speak to a manager. Rossi, snickered and shook his head at us before getting the manager. While the hotel manager listened to our complaint about the room and the rude treatment we had received, he did not offer an apology. After we left the hotel for a few hours, we returned to find a nice gift package with bottles of water, wine, snacks, and a card from management. The room we were moved to was a very nice suite. It had a refrigerator, microwave, and a tub with jets. We had no other problems with the hotel. The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. While you could hear the \"L\" train, it was not an annoying sound by any means and did not bother us at all at night. This hotel was certainly not the nicest we have stayed in but for the price, it was just fine. All in all, we did have a decent stay at this hotel with the exception of our encounter with Rossi.

No complaints or anything. I enjoyed my stay here and would return to the hotel. It's not super fancy but you need to ask yourself what you're looking for.. The hotel is located near the base of the L train and my first impression was that the area seemed a bit dodgey (and that was during the day) but the Hilton (Palmer House) is only a block away. Having walked around though the area a few times it seems totally fine. Also, the L train is right above the hotel and it's pretty noisy (I could hear it inside at the reception desk) The room is pretty large but rather dark (I was facing inward to a closed off area in the hotel complex. But if my option was facing the street and listening to the train, I'd prefer the inward view (and you could hear the train from this room but very faintly). The bathroom is large, the internet is free but they have an older tube tv. The fitness room comprises of two treadmills, a step climber, an elyptical machine, a bench and a small universal type machine. This is located a few doors down from the E. Madison subway entrance. I took a shuttle bus to the hotel and given the ride (over an hour and a half) I would recommend taking the subway/train. The hotel is also near the \"bean\" and the Art Institute of Chicago. Everything seems pretty walkable (Wacker street is probably a 15 minute walk away).

The lobby is a great place to hide out if you want to get out of your room and read. Be aware that if you're looking to spend a great amount of time in your room, there isn't much of a view - it's surrounded by buildings and the el runs right in front. Don't be too afraid of the el, though - from the rooms we were in, you couldn't hear it unless it was really quiet, and then it sounded kind of like the ocean. The location is great - it's surrounded by everything within walking distance. However, I would avoid two things: 1) The restaurant downstairs - it's pricey and not very good, and 2) Room service - it comes from the same restaurant. There's a corner bakery a 1/2 block south which does a great breakfast and lunch, or a diner called B&B's that's on the west side of the next block south that is much better and has a great breakfast special.

Sure it was a queen, and I'd paid for a king, but I could put up with that. Sadly, it was all down hill from there... After heading out for the day I returned to the room for the evening and tried to set up a wake up call, but for some reason the phone in the room was set to 'rotary' and while I could hear it churning, it wasn't connecting with anyone. I gave up and set alarm on my watch and went to bed. But I couldn't sleep because of the stratchy things in the bed: turn out they were toe nail clippings. Yep, the bed had only been made after the last user, the sheets hadn't been cleaned. Disgusting. In the morning I went for a shower, but the setting on the shower head was stuck between two settings and wouldn't move. All I was getting was a dribble by the one cluster of massaging jets: the other two clusters were too full of gunk to send water out. DISGUSTING! I told the Front Desk this (again, phone not working... had to go down in person), and when I returned for my second (and thankfully last) night the shower was working properly and the phone working. And the sheets appeared to be clean. Unfortunately the rest of the bedding wasn't so good. I had noticed it was cold the previous night, but there was a major cold snap on in Chicago so I just put it down to that. That day, however, had been mild and so there shouldn't be a problem. That is when I really looked at the bedding (other than the toenail-ridden sheets) and discovered there was only one blanket on the bed. A summer-weight blanket. And the bed spread was also a summer weight blanket. Also, no extra blanket in the closet, as you'd expect in most hotels. I spent the first half of the night waking up every hour, getting up and turning the heat up in the room and then tucking myself back in and hoping it would get better. Finally, around 2 am I got up, maxed out the heating, folded the blankets over a few times and got fully dressed before returning to bed. I managed to sleep the rest of the night until my early wakeup call. When I tried to check out using the on-screen process it said that it could not be done. Great! Another stop when I am trying to rush out... I go to the front desk and am told that I couldn't check out that way because I had prepaid the hotel through a third party, and I had to pay for the incidentals. I said, yes, but I gave you a credit card for the incidentals at check in. It is the credit card that you just finished saying \"should I just leave it on your ...... card?\" I am treated to a lecture on how if I had gone through the hotel to book my room this wouldn't have happened. Way to punish your customers! To add insult to injury, I am coming off the elevators on the first floor and the bell man walks by, heading away from the front door. I am almost at the front door (a good 30 feet away) and I hear \"Hey you! Do you want a cab?\" yelled at me. No, I don't want a cab, what I want is something to help me forget the horrible stay I had at this disgusting hotel. P.S. It is a day later and I now have a major head cold.

I told the clerk that we wouldn't be able to get back to the hotel until after 9 pm that evening and she said that would not be a problem. However, when we returned at 9 pm,we were informed that no rooms were available, despite the fact we had arrived early, checked our bags, and valet-ed our car. Why did the front desk clerk tell me my later check-in would be fine? To their credit, they had reserved a room for me at another hotel eight blocks away, which seemed promising, but they weren't sure what kind of room it was. So they had to call the hotel and discovered the new room had only one bed. Where was our nephew going to sleep? They refused to pay for a second room to accommodate him. Throughout this interaction, the manager was decidedly non-sympathetic and non-empathetic (the desk clerk did the best she could under the circumstances). He never admitted the hotel made a mistake, he never said he was sorry for our inconvenience, he never offered us additional compensation beyond paying for the inadequate room at another hotel. In fact, he had quite an attitude. He did not seem to care in the least that he had ruined our trip, which was a Christmas gift to our nephew. The only empathetic people were the valet guys, who were very nice. We found out that at least two other parties had also had their reserved rooms given away that evening. Because of the rude management, deceptive (or, at the very least, incredibly uninformed) front desk staff, lack of professionalism, lack of customer service and general sense that they don't really care if a customer has a positive experience or not, I will never, never stay at this hotel.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ajb1207", "ReviewID": "UR18610538", "Content": "The Silversmith Hotel was in my humble opinion a fantastic place to stay.

We all went to college in Chicago and know the area well so a hotel in the loop was very convenient. After reading reviews of other hotels we decided to spend a little bit more for a hotel that goes just beyond the basics, to make sure we weren't in mold, mildew and bad service. What we got was much more! Upon checking in, the room we requested, two double beds, was not availble in non-smoking so we had the option to have a suite with a pull-out bed. We took it and were very pleased. The room was spacious with two small closets, two TVs and a very spacious bathroom with plenty of lighting and a large, beautiful granite counter top and imported toiletries. A wired internet was available at the desk and offered a quick connection, although wireless was not available in the room. The El stop is just outside the hotel and we walked to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Auditorium Theatre, Macys and more. We only took a taxi to save time when traveling far. I asked for assistance on two occasions and the hotel did not fail. Upon my late arrival on a Friday night after 11 PM I asked for a late-night restaurant recommendation and the front desk suggested a few in the area. When I mentioned that I was pregnant and looking for a milkshake he offered to walk to the store and bring it back for me! When I checked out and asked the doorman for the closest El stop to the O'Hare blue line, with an elevator, he thought for a while and could not think of a stop with an elevator. The valet parking guy was next to him and said there was only one flight of stairs at the stop 3 blocks away and he volunteered to walk me there and even took my bags down the street and down the stairs. This was a very kind gesture, and I don't think he even noticed that I was pregnant.", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cGood experience until we got the bill\u201d", "Author": "chicagoshopper08", "ReviewID": "UR13291129", "Content": "We had a wonderful experience with the hotel and staff until we received our credit card bill.

Unfortunately there were no suites available for our first night. The manager on duty, Jeremy, was very apologetic and blocked a suite for our remaining 3 nights. He also offered us breakfast at the hotel restaurant for our inconvenience. Since we are a family of four, with college/high school children, this was a reasonable compensation. After breakfast the next morning (which was very good) we moved to our suite which was excellent (featuring a very large bathroom which apparently is not the norm for downtown Chicago). The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The general manager, Jason was very responsive to our needs and also apologetic for our first night inconvenience. Peggy, the concierge, was very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly (calling us all by name after our first meeting). The room was clean and housekeeping was respectful of our schedule.

You notice that the blankets are a little frayed around the edges, that a button or two won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on the TV remote, that some of the finish work in the bathroom needs touching up, that the concierge gives you wrong directions to a restaurant, that the heavy drapes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite block out all the light from the spotlights in the alley\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 One thing you would expect in such a hotel would be a nicer restaurant than what is on site. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is just what it advertises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a deli, & one with decent food. However, there is no quiet place to sit with a drink of have a quiet conversation or a knock-your-socks-off meal. I guess the Silversmith gave up on trying to compete with Michigan Ave for the food scene \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a shame, as they could charge more, get better reviews, & actually compete with other hotels in the area like the Palmer House & the University Club. I would strongly recommend the bar in the hotel called the 14 Karat Lounge. Though loud & packed with people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a welcome respite from a hard day in the city. Tom is a phenomenal bartender who can mix a heck of a drink, give better directions & suggestions than the concierge, & gives you all the courtesies of a regular after you place your first order. I, like others, had some issues with reservations. After they failed to email the reservations 3 times I insisted they fax the reservations to me. It was received shortly thereafter & there were no problems at check-in. I would stay at the Silversmith again, but the price would be a consideration, as there are other hotels in the area that may not be as nice but offer similar amenities at a reduction in cost. The location of the Silversmith is ideal, with Michigan Ave one block away & a public parking garage a half block away on E Monroe saves you from the $37+tip valet fee you would be charged.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clarkston, MI", "Title": "\u201cHappily Surprised\u201d", "Author": "rn2001", "ReviewID": "UR8132686", "Content": "Booked this hotel through Priceline, so I didn't choose the hotel when I booked, it got assigned to me, which always makes me a bit worried!

The hotel staff was always courteous and helpful, especially Peggy the concierge. When I called the week before our visit to confirm the reservations (orig reservatns made in Dec), I told her that we were celebrating my daughters' spring birthdays. She arranged a surprise of balloons and a plate of cookies in their room the evening of our arrival. Also, Peggy suggested and arranged a flat rate limo for us from O'Hare to the Silversmith. The difference in cost for 4 passengers to take an airport shuttle vs. the limo is negligible, and it was wonderful to stretch our legs in a limo after being crammed in an airplane and crowded airport most of the day! It is difficult to find the hotel if you are not looking for it , but that was part of it's charm. The Silversmith feels like a club or private hideaway. We had asked for adjoining/quiet/non-smoking rooms and were placed on the 10th floor. The king room was spacious, with a roomy bathroom that had a large granite countertop and granite tile floor, the windows in the room were very tall and had deep sills that my daughter used as a window seat. There is no extra charge for in-room internet hookup, the refrigerator is empty for our personal use (no honor bar/weighing crap like at other hotels) and Mon-Thurs there are cookies and cheescake in the lobby. The hotel was in excellent repair, no peeling wallpaper; everything looked freshly painted; the hallways, rooms and bathrooms were pristine. I loved the Arts & Crafts decor; the rooms each had old fashioned desks with wooden chairs on rollers; armoires with usable drawer space. The crisp white duvets and linens and very high ceilings also make the rooms appear roomier. The adjoining double/double room was on the small side, but had the same large windows, high ceiling and large bathroom as the king. The location was great, too! We were first time visitors to Chicago and were delighted to find that we could easily walk to the Art Institute, Oriental Ford Theatre, Macys(formerly Marshall Fields with Tiffany dome!), the Bean, and Giordano's Pizza. We also felt very safe at the Silversmith and the adjoining area. You must have an electronic card to go past the lobby on the elevator and the card only lets you get to certain floors (for instance, my card wouldn't let go to the 3rd floor only mine and the floor below.). The El is located right outside the hotel, but that was never a problem. It was a novelty, not a nuisance, to see the El cars go by at night outside the lobby windows. I would recommend asking for a quiet room if you think the noise might be a problem. Cabs are easy to catch outside the hotel, also. I wasn't sure what to expect based on the conflicting reviews on ths site, but I absolutely loved the Silversmith. I called several boutique hotels before I made reservations at Silversmith, and I can tell you that the Silversmith has many amenities that others did not offer, including adjoining rooms on top floors (other hotels only had adjoining rooms on lower floors facing construction), free in-room internet access, free refrigerator, and because we were on the top floor we had complementary breakfast each morning.

After a lot of research and poring over countless Chicago hotel reviews, we decided to back the judgement of others and book the Crowne Plaza Silversmith via its own ICH website.

We think you will struggle to find a city centre (downtown) hotel anywhere with such spacious, quality and affordable rooms, backed by high cleanliness standards, attention to service detail and superb, polite but not over-effusive staff. For our part, we feel competent in assessing if staff attitudes are forced rather than natural. There wasn't a single staff member at the hotel, who did not acknowledge us on eye contact, smile when necessary and provided what we wanted when called upon. Truly remarkable! We decided to pay extra for a room with a seating area, having been the victims previously of undersized accommodations in San Francisco and Washington DC and we were allocated a spacious, yet tastefully decorated room on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel. It was spotlessly clean and well equipped and had a big comfy bed, superb bathroom with walk-in shower and marble sink surround, efficient airconditioning, and was a lot less noisy than we expected.

Heading south on Wabash, look to the right for flags between Madison and Monroe. I thought the location was great, if you want to stay in the Loop/Theatre District/Grant Park area (and just a 5 minute CTA ride to River North). A taxi ride from Navy Pier cost about $8. The neighborhood is great, not seedy, as it's in the North Loop area, but it does feels more \"downtown\" than Michigan Ave's \"uptown\". When we got in, the front desk staff asked us if we'd stayed with them before, and as we hadn't, they upgraded us to a Suite (retails at $529/night). Absolutely beautiful room. We had asked for a high floor because of the El running parallel with Wabash at about 2nd/3rd floors. We still heard the El at night, but not too bad, sort of like a whooshing noise. The bed was doublesheeted and we had white robes to wear. The two TVs, ethernet connection and refridgerator were excellent amenities and the bed was super comfortable. Our tall windows let in a lot of light and had a window seat too. The view was of another building though. We ordered room service for lunch one day, and although many reviews thought the attached restaurant Ada's Deli was bad, the pastrami sandwich we ordered was fabulous. The gal who answered the room service phone wasn't very pleasant though. Also, our valet took coins from our car - they tell you to remove valuables but I guess that translates to \"or else\".

Crowne Plaza also now offers ear plugs, eye shades, lavender linen spray and a relaxation CD in the room so any EL noise is a moot point. Only complaint is there is no parking (not that I would normally rent a car in Chicago but I had to drive to Milwaukee for a day) and the valet parking available was expensive and inconvenient since they park the car several blocks away.

They are always cheerful and helpful. Our room on the 10th floor even had a minor lake view at no extra charge. Most hotels (i.e. The Drake) would charge extra for a sliver of lake view. Not here! The \"El\" train outside the front door just adds to the downtown Chicago experience. You can hear it in the room but it's not very loud at all. The area seems very safe as long as you use common sense. We recommend The Big Downtown restaurant one block south. Millenium Park was great! Many of the reviews say the same thing but I would like to comment on a few minor negatives for you: The wall dividing our suite into 2 rooms only went about 75% of the way up to the ceiling (for air circulation?!). Provides privacy but not sound insulation between the two t.v.s. Also the lack of a pool is a bummer if you have kids. The cable t.v. channel selection is poor also; not even the Disney channel! If a hotel doesn't have a pool for the kids at least have the Disney channel! There was no bedding for the sofa sleeper in our room. Usually it is found in one of the drawers, some hotels will even have the bed made up in the sofa when you flip it out!. Had to wait 20 minutes for it to be brought up. Our floor had a lounge with a continental breakfast which was just pastries and juice.

I chose this hotel primarily based upon this sites glowing reviews, and it's close proximity to the United Center. We were both incredibly pleased. As I'm lazy and did not want to drag luggage on the El, we opted for the airport shuttle service, which I believe was 30 dollars per person (the price varies slightly according to hotel, and since the silversmith is downtown, it was one of the more expensive stops). Although we arrived at the hotel three hours prior to check in (my genius self forgot to allow for the hour back time change), the staff promptly lead us to our room. About an hour after our arrival, we recieved a call from the concierge asking us if we were pleased with our room. We were in the back on the 4th floor. While we faced a brick wall, we didn't have any problems with noise from the El (although, as I live in Manhattan, I can pretty much sleep through anything). The rooms were spacious (high ceilings were a nice touch), and I only wish I had that bathroom in my apartment. There was a good size desk in the room (good for business travelers), and free high speed internet (as my laptop is glued to my hip, this was a much appreciated amenity). We also recieved evening turndown service, even though we didn't request it, and the front desk was very prompt in replying to my request for feather pillows. We ordered room service for breakfast one morning, and as noted by another reviewer, their potato pancakces were excellent. The portions were also very large -- a little too large. The concierge also called up about five minutes after our food was delivered to ask us if we were pleased with our meal. Unfortunately, as we weren't there for long, we didn't have time to do much site seeing. We did walk to Millenium Park one night, which was quite lovely. I never felt unsafe walking around the surrounding area of the hotel -- as with any large city, just exercise common sense and stay alert. A bus to the United Center also stops diagonally across the street from the hotel. There was a young female concierge there who was definately on too many happy pills -- her ear to ear smile was just a little too eager to please. We did recieve a reccomendation for a pizza place from her (Giordano's -- not bad, but I'm still partial to NY pizza ;). It was also Mother's Day weekend, and they had some free desserts in the lobby for all Moms. I certainly hope to return to Chicago soon, and will most definately stay at the Silversmith.

The Silversmith is in the top of the group in my opinion. A group of 8 of us arrived at 9:00am on a Friday morning and all were able to check-in to our 3 rooms that early. On top of that, we were each given an upgrade to a king suite at no extra charge. Another group came later and received a regular king room. The regular king room was spacious with high ceilings. The king suite I was in had 2 seperate rooms with high ceilings. The bed was comfortable. I was next to the L on the 6th floor. I could hear it, but it wasn't loud enough to keep me awake. Maid service was good. The bellman were very helpful with advice on blues clubs, bars, restaurants, and transportation. Friendly guys. There is a restaurant/bar downstairs open until 3am on the weekends. Good food (according to a few members of our group). A block south is a Corner Bakery with great breakfast. A block north is a Garretts popcorn for the best popcorn anywhere. Different L stations are very close enabling quick/easy travel nearly anywhere in the city. Only problem with the hotel occured when I came home and there was a charge on my card. It took a few calls before I found out I was charged for a robe. Took a few more calls to finally get the charge taken off. The robe had been thrown in with the dirty towels. Understandable mistake but became difficult to get the issue resolved. Although, it was resolved in the end and I thank the management for resolving the issue. Could happen at any hotel.

If you are looking for cookie cutter rooms with bland furnishings, this is not the place for you. However, if you want to stay in the heart of the city, move with the people who live in this great city, this hotel offers a wonderful location and great staff. Several points to some of the other reviews: 1) This isn't a Mich Ave hotel. It's in the business district and as such, isn't as touristy a location. However, you get a wonderfully restored, historic building designed by one of the city's master architects. The furnishings are nice and clean and very relaxing. 2) Yes, the el is right in front of the hotel. As in, you can stand on the L platform and see the entryway to the hotel. But this isn't a problem, if you want to go anywhere in the city. It's a great attribute for those people who don't need taxis to get around an urban setting. 3) Noise...we stayed on the 8th floor in the back of the building. Despite some noise the first night, no earplugs were needed. The beds are very comfy and the bathrooms are something I could only wish I had at home. The hotel was VERY quite in general, though you can hear the slight noise of the urban setting. 4)This is NOT a bad part of town. I was with two other females and we walked everywhere at all times of the day and night. It's not as glitzy or busy as Michigan Ave, but you certainly don't need to freak out about walking down the street to go to a club or for dinner. Yes, there are a couple of people who work the lobby on the first floor/street level. But they are working, not bouncing the street in front of the building. They are getting luggage, helping customers and generally doing things that people pay huge bucks for in expensive hotels. I never once thought they were guarding the lobby. 5) Early check in--- We arrived in the city via the L at 10am. We were helped inside (the doormen could hear us clanking down the steps of the El with our suitcases and were quick to help out). The doorman were excellent, offering a lot of advice for us since we were going to see the \"Cubbies\". The receptionist not only gave us an early check in (we'd asked for a place to store our luggage for the game)...but gave us a great room. In fact, I've never been in such a flexible hotel before. They definitely epitomize the word \"accomodating\". The staff in this hotel is unreal. When we left, the awesome doorman (one who carried two of our suitcases UP the L stairway when we voiced concerns about them being too heavy) always greeted us and offered umbrellas and advice without hesitation. The concierge was very helpful and so cheerful it was almost like being at cheer camp. But everyone in this hotel was awesome, friendly and helpful. I had a nice time just talking to them about the city and local places to visit/see. In comparison, we were sent to the poshest hotel on Mich Ave to get L passes from their gift shop. After waiting 20 minutes or longer in line at their conceirge desk (just to ask where the gift shop was)...we realized that spending more money on a hotel doesn't mean better service. If I had paid that much for a room and had to wait that long for someone to help me, I'd be mad. You will never wait more than a couple of minutes for anything at this hotel. Overall, this was a great trip. We looked forward to coming back to the room and resting between site seeing. And it's location to the lake front, shopping and museums means that you can go for short trips and the hotel is always just a few blocks away. If you have small children who need naps or just want to dump your shopping and go back out, this is the place to stay. We ate breakfast at Ada's several times. The meals were good and fairly priced, even if the staff seemed less than outgoing at times. But if you are looking for a quick start to the day with a wide option of meals, this is a good place to start. I have to say that I will probably never stay in another hotel while in Chicago. The quirkiness of this place is endearing. And trust me when I say that the best way to wind down from an exciting day is sitting in the lobby at night, munching on cheesecake, sipping the variety of coffees/teas and chatting with fellow guests. An excellent touch with great lighting, a soothing piano and really, a relaxing end to the day. I am a picky traveller and a picky sleeper. The rooms were comfortable and very clean.

EL is right out front that we did use a couple times since so convenient. 2) Style: Arts & Craft/Mission style throughout the hotel. Great touches throughout lobby, halls, and into rooms. Bathroom very large w/ marble floors & counters. We had 2 room mini-suite with parlor with separate TV, desk, coffee table and sofa. 12 ft. high ceilings gives added appearance of spaciousness.

None of the windows in the entire hotel open to fresh air so the chlorine and moisture from the tourist-tacky pool area lingers and makes the breathing air unbearable. For our family trip, we booked two rooms. The first stank so bad of ammonia we walked right back out. The second smelled so strongly of mold and mildew that I had a sneezing fit just walking in. When I went to the lobby to complain, I was rudely told, \"We told you over the phone you just needed to come down and we would fix it.\" True hospitality would have offered to send a maid up to inspect and/or fix the problem while we moved into a new room. The new room was pristine, much larger and I had no complaints. Other than the fact that our original rooms should have been just as clean. The buffet at dinner hour, 6:30pm, was terrible. A sad looking salad bar was offered. A selection of enchiladas and dry spaghetti was solely offered. The beef for the mexican food was dry looking and the oil was lifting off of the side bowl of shredded cheese. How long has this food been sitting there? How much of the chlorine in the air has settled onto the food by that point? The stench and \"quality\" of the food and hotel itself is unbearable. The staff and management should be ashamed of themselves for finding their efforts acceptable. Mediocre barely covers their commitment to true hospitality. Don't stay here, there are other options nearby that meet Florida's health codes.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDecent Stay, liked everything\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Maverick182", "ReviewID": "UR114736820", "Content": "Everything about this hotel was good, if not great.

Its not gross or horrible in any way, just a little out dated. Otherwise everything was cleaned top to bottom. The room its self was huge. It was nice that the mirror and sink were out side the actual bathroom so if someone was in there, you could still use the sink and mirror. There is also a small fridge, iron, and plenty of dresser space. As well as a table with two chairs. Its a fairly quiet hotel. You cant expect 100% silence when you are in a tourist city. And if you are looking for a hotel just to sit in all day, why are you on vacation...sit at home where its free. The lobby is clean and comfy even with a little gift shop. The breakfast buffet is perfect and cheap. And the staff is great. An hour or so after getting in to our room, the front desk gentleman called to make sure everything was going well and to see if we needed anything at the time. Very nice. Only down side is the Wi-Fi internet was in the lounge only.

My kids (aged 18-24) and I all live about 2 hours away from the hospital and we needed a safe, clean place to stay near the hospital. My kids were going to be arriving late in the day. The front desk manager was amazing! I was able to make arrangements for my kids to get into their rooms while I was at the hospital. The front desk took all of my kid's names so that they could get drinks and snacks charged to my room so that I didn't have to keep money on hand. Because my husband was in ICU during part of the stay, we were in and out of the hotel constantly. The front desk inquired as to my husband's condition any time we were in the lobby. It felt like we had gained an extended family. The front desk was so accomodating, it felt like coming home at night instead of to a strange place. I'm sorry I don't remember the names of the staff, but if you get to read this, you know who you are and I would like to thank you. I know the purpose of our visit wasn't like most people's, but if you are in the area and just need a safe place to lay your head at the end of the day, I truly recommend that you try out this hotel.", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Villa Rica, GA", "Title": "\u201ckissimmee, maingate, west\u201d", "Author": "lwallis", "ReviewID": "UR14772801", "Content": "My family and I stayed at this hotel very cheap for a timeshare deal my wife booked on the internet. When I say cheap, I mean we paid $50 for 5 days. We were overcharged for this hotel!! I am not one to complain about service, but the service here was terrible. Every employee here that we came in to contact with rolled their eyes at us. From the lady at the desk who checked us in to the service employees in the hallway. Every employee acted as though we owed them something. The funny thing is, for all they know we might have paid the $155/night. If I would have, I would be extremely upset. The sad part is this hotel has so much potential with their indoor pool an restaurant. If you pay $6 for an order of pizza hut breadsticks at the \"pizza hut' stand, you'll get 5 1/2 sticks. If you order 6 hotwings and one of them looks as if the wing has been eaten and you ask for another, the guy will say \"you saw me pull it out\", \"what do you want me to do\", and laugh and shake his head at you while he finds another. If you go to the breakfast, you could possibly wait 10 mins for a plate to use at the bar, and you might not ever receive a drink. And if you complain about it at the register, they'll laugh at you. If you and your kids are waiting at an elevator, the maid will cut in front of you to get in, then act as if you are invading their space when you try to get in and tell them what floor you're getting off on. I wouldn't stay here again, if it were free!!! I don't even think that anyone is managing this place, because no one seems to care about who actually pays the bill. I ready tripadivisor reviews and did see that the hotel definitly needs some refurbishing, from the hotel ceilings appearing as though they are falling in, to the waterfall that appears as though it has never worked. As cheap as I got this place for, I was still overcharged. I would never stay here again, nor never refer it to anyone that I considered a friend!!!!

This hotel was completely atrocious. The TV was broken there was paint chipping off parts of the walls and the room had a horrible smell. The double beds were tiny and will only fit two people who are shorter than five and a half feet. The shower was half shower half bath. There was mold all over the bathroom. The facilities were equally bad. The tennis court had grass growing in the cracks and squirrels were using the putting green holes to gather nuts in. The pool had too much chlorine and yet it was extremely dirty. Half of the hotel was closed off because from what i can assume, hurricane damage. The exercise room consists of two old machines and the sauna is a cramped tiny room with wooden boards on the floor. On the way back from my trip i overheard the conversation between my band director and the bus driver and he said \"i have been traveling for 25 years and this is one of the worst.\" I don't know how i can emphasize how bad this place was enough.

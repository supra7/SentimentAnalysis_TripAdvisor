Cons: First we had one of our wedding events here on the roof top after dealing with horrible staff that went back on a signed contract we had with them (long story). Then most of our wedding guests stayed here and had complaints about the size of the rooms, which are tiny and a bit outdated, and about the staff, who were rude to a lot people at checkin. The hotel is classic but is also very set in their ways and it is tough to find anyone helpful (which we finally did, and that definitely helped and really changed the experience at the end into a positive one) Pros: The Carousel Bar is a must-do. The location is also great, and the roof top pool is quite nice but backs up onto one of the suites which is a little odd and not very good for privacy.

The location for the Fest can't be beat. I found the staff pleasant, but a little less than stellar. The front desk gal could not locate a shop on Royal Street only a few block s from the hotel, and the concierge advised me against taking the streetcar to the 3500 block of Canal Street (she suggested taking a taxi for safety, during the noon hours), which was rather silly as the area was perfectly safe.

So I've stayed here myself many times over the years. (And, although the Sunset Limited now runs only three days a week, I still take it whenever I can.) The hotel had a major restoration a few years ago and came through it well: the public areas and the guest rooms still look like they are a hundred years old, but in a very good way. The bathrooms have basins of polished stone and the bedrooms have Audubon prints on the walls, and everything seems to work. But the Monteleone is a large hotel, and when it's full or nearly full -- as it often seems to be -- the staff seems overwhelmed, the lines can be long, and the lobby and restaurant/lounge can be so crowded as not to be very inviting. My last stay happened to be on one of the many spring weekends when there is a lot going on in New Orleans. In this case it was the national college basketball championship tournament, but sometimes it's just a major conference or two. The hotels fill up and so do the streets in the French Quarter, until very late. My room was on a high floor but it faced Royal Street, which meant it was only a block from Bourbon street. There was a lots of street noise until quite late, and this was compounded by the occasional drunken revelers who walked past my room at 2 a.m., apparently on their way to an after-party in a room down the hall. And I didn't even try to go in to the Carousel Lounge for a drink or a snack. (The good news is that Arnaud's Jazz Bistro, only a block away, wasn't too crowded. It's a great place for a light supper and a glass of wine.) I'll always love the Monteleone, but next time I'll try to stay at a quieter time (a Wednesday night in July?) and get a quieter room, preferably facing away from Royal.

We headed to our room and were pleased to see a fairly large room with a king sized bed, a table, two nightstands and a large TV cabinet/armoire that included two separate closets and four drawers. The bathroom was nicely appointed and very clean. Housekeeping did a thorough job cleaning and detailing our room each day. We had plenty of towels and when I called the front desk for another blanket it was promptly delivered. Our room was dark and quiet at night and the bed was very comfortable. We used the fitness center every morning. All the machines worked great and they provided towels and water, they even had a bowl of apples and oranges for their guests to take. We ordered room service on two of the nights. It took about 45 minutes to arrive and it was hot and tasty. One evening we took our two drink coupons and wandered down to the Carousel Bar. This bar is round like a Carousel and it slowly rotates so you have an ever changing view. Be warned though, the drinks are $12 a piece, I was grateful for our drink coupons.

Unfortunately, the hotel made us check out of our first room at 11:00 am and we were not granted a new room on the quiet side until 5:00 pm.

The room was a bit small but charming. The bed was comfortable with soft, crisp linens. The building feels old but in a good way. All too often we stay in chain hotels that lack charm and character. This place has both. The location cannot be beat, right in the heart of the French Quarter. Bourbon street is around the corner, close enough if you want it but not in your face if you don't. A small, quaint coffee/lunch spot is a few doors down, Cafe Beignet. The guy at the counter promised that their beignets were much better than Cafe Du Monde's. After happily sampling both, I have to agree. The cafe au lait was excellent as well. At the center of the hotel is The Carousel Bar, a seemingly authentic revolving merry go round. It is a great place to meet for a drink. We had appetizers in the bar one afternoon which were surprisingly good. Also, as it was a corporate event dinner was on property. I was surprised at how good the food was. I was expecting the usual rubber chicken fare but it turned out to be very tasty. Breakfast was also quite good. There is a roof top pool which unfortunately I did not get a chance to use. The lounges looked like a nice place to unwind after a day of sight seeing.

I went to school in NOLA and wanted to get back there with my husband who had never been. I wanted a hotel in the Quarter which had the New Orleans charm but modern amenities, walking distance to everything but not on Bourbon St. and that would accept our dog Jack. The Monteleone met all of our requirements and exceeded our expectations. I followed another reviewer's tip to book thru iprefer to get an upgrade and free wifi which was really great cause we got fantastic treatment. We even got a welcome kit for Jack (a food dish with a placemat, a bone to eat and one to play with and baggies for you know what;). We've stayed in wonderful hotels with Jack all over the US and Europe, but never got this kind of kit. The room was just the right size with a King size bed (super comfortable), plasma TV and usual amenities. We were on the 14th floor without a view (well, not one to rave about since it was a brick wall), but we really didn't go to New Orleans to stay in our room so it was totally fine. Besides you can go to the rooftop for a great view of the city and a nice pool, gym area. The staff was extremely helpful, friendly and professional. We spent our first night at the Caroussel Bar and got tipsy even before our first drink (it moves slowly but you feel it). They had just remodeled the restaurant area in a modern yet classy style. Very nice! We never ate at the restaurant, so can't comment on that. Breakfast is $20 so we opted to go elsewhere and explore the wonderful Cajun cuisine. As far as prices, it's comparable to other hotels in the area (not cheap), but we felt that we got ours money's worth given the location and excellent service.

I was disappointed to say the least as I was looking forward to something more than a limited breakfast buffet. The real issues started when I asked the front desk person to charge my personal CC for my last night and leave the rest on my AMEX. When I checked out Laura (very nice person) assisted me and put 1 night on my personal cc and the rest on my AMEX. GREAT! Not really, I checked my account this AM only to find I had been charged over $900!!! I called accounting at the hotel and talked to Brittany who said to \"just wait a couple of days and it will be refunded\". I personally don't have a spare $900 laying around so I told her that was unacceptable and said I would call my bank. She said call my bank and then call her back and conference her in.

Bedding should be top of the line, not a comforter but a duvet. Pillows were tiny and were all soft... no choice. A hotel of that reputation should have a very good coffee maker and excellent coffee.

This hotel is quite old, but in decent shape and of course , it has LOTS OF CHARACTER ! It is located in French quarter in walking distance to antique shops in royal street and the nasty Bourbon street! The hotel is far enough from Bourbon to be safe from the noise of all the party animals, meanwhile close enough just to walk one block to get to that place. great restaurants and attractions are all in walking distance. The hotel doesn't have parking and the valet will cost extra, which is understandable in French quarter. The moment you arrive in the lobby, the decorations of the roof and magnificent chandeliers are eye catching. The revolving bar is quite cool too. Our room was basic and on the smaller size. Carpet of the room and the lousy bed could see more TLC. Bathroom had granite countertop and was in a very good shape. Basic channels on the TV and the coffee maker were more than enough for us. In general our room and the furniture were dated but they were still in decent shape ( you really shouldn't stay in your room if you stay in French quarter ! ) . The roof top pool in quite nice, but the water was cold to get into. There was a business center on property and you had to swipe your card and pay to use the computers. I found this very greedy though ! Pros: hotel's character ( an old historic building ) , location ( great spot in French quarter ), revolving bar Cons: extra fee to use business center, cold pool ( all these cons still cannot convince me to drop a star from this gorgeous place ) I am so glad that I didn't reserve a hotel on Bourbon street , since it gets crazy noisy at night. I really liked this place for its 150 years of history. This may not be the case for you, especially if you are looking for ultimate luxury.

We had two connecting rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c1032 and 1033. Our party consisted of my husband, myself and our 3 young children. On the morning of January 10 we returned to our room at 12:15 am and entered and closed the room to our hotel room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1033. My husband stayed in the room with our boys in 1032 while my daughter and I were in 1033. We had the connecting doors open at all times. At 4:55 am I was awakened by what sounded like a door closing. I assumed that my family in 1032 was going to the bathroom. I rolled over and went back to sleep. Approximately 10 minutes later I woke up again and noticed that the bathroom light in my room had been turned on. Thinking that one of our children was sick I began to get up to check on them. At that time I noticed a man crawling on his stomach in our room toward my bed. The man appeared to be in his late twenties to thirty year of age. He was Caucasian with a shaved head and was wearing what looked like a black T-shirt with white design on it. This man was no more than 3 feet from me. He looked me directly in the eyes and then grabbed my purse which was lying against the wall closest to my bed. He hopped up and dashed out of our room and turned to his left towards the stairwell. I know this for sure because I ran after him to ensure that he would not harm my 5 year old daughter who was sleeping in room as well. When he turned the corner and entered the stairwell I ran back into the room to wake up my husband and call the front desk so that they could alert security. Within 10 minutes security found my large red purse in an opposite stairwell from the one that he fled to upon leaving our room. The only thing missing from my purse was cash. Hotel security as well as two New Orleans police officers came to our room so that we could file a police report. The hotel security was unable to find the robber even though we called them no more than one minute after the robber fled our room. I asked if they could review the security camera tapes and was told that this could not be done until a manager arrived. We were scheduled to leave the hotel at 7:00 a.m. and were told that we would be contacted by the hotel with information later that day. They NEVER called! Any contact that has been made about this incident has been initiated by me. Once arriving home I called to speak to the hotel manager, Stephen Caputo. I was told that he was busy and would call me once he was available to discuss the incident. He NEVER called! Instead Mr. Caputo delegated this responsibility to Bertilia Burton, Guest Services Manager. She called me later that day and told me that she would need to meet with their security company the next morning and review video camera footage to see if the could determine who broke into our room. She also proceeded to tell me that their computer entry showed that no one had entered our room with one of their keys after 12:15. I am certain that the door was shut. One of the police officers noticed that even though you closed that the door to 1033 the lock was not catching. You had to really push and slam the door in order for it to catch. The officer proceeded to pull the door from inside the room without turning the handle and it opened. I was told by Ms. Burton that she would contact me the following day with any information that they could gain from watching the security camera videos. At approximately 1:30 pm I contacted Ms. Burton to see if they were able to learn how the intruder gained access to our room. I was told that they could not find anyone in the vicinity of our room or hotel at the time that the intrusion occurred. My first question was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see him in the stairwell carrying a large red purse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ms. Burton replied that there are NO SECURITY CAMERAS IN ANY STAIRWELLS. I was in shock. My response to her was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So you are telling me that our throats could have been slit by this intruder and you would have no security camera to help piece together a crime.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said let me put you on hold. Ms. Burton then returned to the line and said that she had confirmed that there are no security cameras in any stairwells. Instead they have a security guard walk up the stairwells about every 30 minutes. No security cameras in stairwells after a MAJOR RENOVATION. I asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where are the security cameras located?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was told that she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at liberty to say. Several things about this incident seem unusual. The robber/intruder knew exactly where to flee so that he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be caught on the camera. Also, we discovered a final checkout bill outside our door that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to us. The corner of the bill was a little mangled and it belonged to someone several floors up from us. I am curious to know who was putting out the final bills that morning. At one point after I told the security guard what the robber looked like he said that they have several people that would fit that description on different floors. Later he told me that he thought the robber fled an emergency exit. Yet the guest service manager told me that if he fled an emergency exit it would have set off an alarm. There are too many conflicting stories. They have an exact window of when this happened and they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pinpoint anything about the crime. Lastly, why would the hotel manager, Stephen Caputo, feel that an in room robbery isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t important enough to contact the guest directly? Our family has not heard a word from him certainly not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sorry that this happened and we are doing what we can to keep our future guests safe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what could have happened had I not awakened and startled the robber. He could have severely harmed me and my 5 year old daughter. She has been terrified at night since the incident \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shaking and teeth chattering because she is so scared that someone could enter our home like this man. I find myself jumping up when I hear any little noise during the night. I see the man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face over and over when I lay down to sleep. This complaint is not about the cash that was stolen. It is that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level of security is inadequate. I have stayed in many hotels across the country. Most hotels of this caliber you must show a key to get into the elevator. It was chaos in the hotel. The hotel bar is right beside two of the three sets of elevators. ANYONE could get into the elevator. There was no one checking guest keys before entering the elevator. The bar was packed with football fans who were in town for the BCS National Championship game. I would like to know if the hotel added extra security staff for the night due to the fact that this was such a huge event and they expected so many people inside the hotel bar. In my opinion they hotel is negligent in providing adequate guest safety. Knowing what I know now about the security of the hotel and the attitude of its management I feel that our story must to be told. Once others know about our experience perhaps management will decide to make changes to ensure better safety of future guests. Hopefully the Hotel Monteleone management will begin show cooperation, understanding, caring and follow-up to guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problems as well.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murphy,NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, excellent staff\u201d", "Author": "one-celtic", "ReviewID": "UR123024169", "Content": "We somehow got great prices on our rooms, below their average.

We have stayed there five times and each one brings the same positive experience. The ONLY negative things that have ever happened throughout five visits is once there was a \"less than quick\" bartender on the pooltop bar and once we had to change rooms two times on the same visit (smell of smoke and one of the rooms was not cleaned properly). Neither of these things are reasons to give less than five stars based on the entire experience Monteleone offers. It is a \"classic\" hotel in every sense of the word. The elegant foyer and check-in area and beautiful decor let you know you're in NOLA! From the get go - you are greeted by friendly doormen and desk clerks. Feel free to ask for a room upgrade - if they have them they will give them to you. Feel free to ask which way your room faces and don't hesitate to ask for a change if you find you're room is right over the air conditioners. They will do whatever they can to accommodate you. From there you'll find the concierge staff to he extrememly helpful, the bell people to be a blast to talk with and the carousel bar to be the best place to start you stay. During our last stay the first room they gave us smelled a little of cigarette smoke. I am a smoker - but not in my room and I don't like the smell when I'm sleeping. They immediately gave us a different room which disappointingly was incredibly small and not exceptionally clean. This being my fifth visit I knew this wasn't representative of what you usually get at the Monteleone. Upon talking with the front desk we were given a 2-room suite that made us never want to leave the hotel. There was no bickering - no attitude - nobody made us feel as if we were out of line for expecting something better than we got. It was apologized for and taken care of with professionalism and friendliness. Monteleone has multiple sections and you'll most often find you'll be walking up three stairs and down three stairs to get to your room. We sometimes get confused on which elevator to take to get to the pool - but you always find it. Pool is small - but you're in New Orleans. This isn't an all inclusive Jamaica trip. Ground space is a premium and pools on the roofs. In the summer pools are hot. It's 110 degrees there - so nobody should be surprised. The rooms are nice sized (again - remember you're in New Orleans - all rooms are somewhat small), beds are comfortable, sheets are clean and we're not afraid to walk barefoot in our rooms. Bathrooms are clean - nicely equipped - and if you need anything it's just a phone call away. Service is prompt and friendly. Tipping is appreciated - but not expected - and these people deserve it. We have truly NEVER had a negative feeling from any of them. Even when I've called to ask for four extra pillows at 3:00 a.m. But, again, remember.... these people work hard and leaving $5 or $10 on the bed is nothing compared to the luxury of knowing you will never run out of towels and will always have a stocked mini-fridge. Carousel bar is a great place to start with a good drink and conversation. You will never be bored and be sure to ask the bartender how long it takes for the carousel to make one complete spin. Drinks are good - prices are reasonable. Location is perfect for everything. Walking distance to anything you could want to do. Close enough to the action - but far enough to be in the quiet area. There is no noise and not a lot of annoying street activity. We're all about having fun in NOLA but when we want to relax and/or sleep - we want quiet, clean and calm. While there be sure to eat at Coops, drink at the Chart Room (BEST place to people watch) and if you want an outstanding upscale dinner make reservations at BonTon. All these places are off the beaten path and not the \"typical\" NOLA haunts. Classic - well worth the time - and gets you away from the tourist feeling of Bourbon Street and Brennan's (which are great places - but everyone needs a break once in a while :) Also, be sure to take the trolley ($5 for an all day pass) and ride - get off - ride as often as you like to stop at various places and see the beautiful homes of NOLA. MUSTS: (I know a few are repeats) - Coops - AWESOME fried chicken - Johnny's Po' Boy (the best sandwiches and mufalettas (yes - better than Napolean House) go there for breakfast and start your day with a good base - Tour the Garden District via Trolley - Look for a street wedding - Bon Ton for an expensive - but wonderful meal (lunch is the best time to go) - Chart Room (best people watching - great bartenders - wonderful drinks) I know everyone has to do Acme, Brennan's, etc. once - but those truly aren't places you have to go to \"feel\" New Orleans. And - you definitely don't need a $12 Hurricane from Pat O'Brien's. O'Brien's has a beautiful outside garden - but staff is a bit arrogant and they definitely aren't in it for the \"service\".", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot happy\u201d", "Author": "Gordosmum", "ReviewID": "UR122907333", "Content": "Won an auction for this hotel on Skyauction but was told it was not available on the dates I wanted even though the hotel's own site says rooms are available.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manassas, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cOld Hotel still has charm\u201d", "Author": "a_dreamrers_night", "ReviewID": "UR122902788", "Content": "We originally stayed in early November just for a day before we left on a cruise.

I had a feeling they would be based on the fine print on the web site, but the double (not queen) beds crammed with minimal closet spaces and a teeny tiny bathroom made staying in the room to pass time undesirable. The towels/bedding and other such amenities were average at best, as was the staff. No one was rude, but no one was out-of-their way friendly or helpful either. Don't get me started on the noise - NOTHING is soundproof in the hotel. I was on a high floor away from the street and could hear all the street noise from Bourbon, everything in the hallways, and even the people in the room next door to me laughing and conversing. The bathroom is not soundproof either. Speaking of, on the last night, some friends a couple rooms down the hall had all the lights go out in their bathroom, and the hotel did nothing to accommodate. The lobby was chaotic, though my trip was during a holiday weekend, so that is somewhat understandable. I know people rave about the location, but let's be honest, all the major French Quarter hotels are about a 5 minute walk from each other.

I prefer, for tourists, to stay in the Marigny/Esplanade area.. that's just me. This hotel is world/top class. There were problems: noise inside the hotel was inexcusable at times, but we moved rooms to the 14th floor and it was quiet. The elevators here are a pain as well because you must (currently) exit on floor 8 up/down, catch a DIFFERENT set of elevators to go to/from the upper floors. This was due to the construction going on in the lobby, which made its backside elevators out of order. It happens, but around NYE week, there were times we waited 15 minutes on floor 11 for an elevator. The hotel has character, class, and charm. If you get a room, I suggest going to floor 14 because otherwise it could get quite loud (kids--like 4 yrs and under playing football in the hallways--for this I blame the idiotic parents, not the hotel). Also get a room, please, with a strong blower to make noise. Our first room on floor 11 had a smaller bathroom than 14's.. and its thermostat was useless.. you could not adjust the temperature nor the strength of the blower in a meaningful way (the room was freezing, actually, no matter what setting we used). Once we moved to 14 (after the kids nextdoor began wrestling and jumping off their beds, we think), our stay was amazing. Our floor 14 room had a larger bathroom than our previous room, strong AC/furnace blower, and adjustable thermostat that actually worked(!). Both rooms were \"preferred\" rooms. Both rooms had saggy mattresses, and I'll never understand how a hotel like this has such horrible mattresses, yet invests a fortune into Speakman showerheads. All aside, the hotel's breakfast was great, efficient, and quick, despite the hotel being sold-out. The Carousel bar looked nice, but was way too crowded to bother with; since this is a tourist attraction a lot of people at the bar don't appear to stay at the hotel (we watched them in the bar talking about what hotels they were staying at). The doorman provided great dining advice. I would choose to stay elsewhere next time because this hotel , in my opinion, begins the \"shady area..\" past this hotel towards the trolley, we saw a lot of fighting and crack/drug/homeless people. These people were not unfriendly, but continually asked for money. We're talking about 1 block past the hotel, making a left out of the hotel's entrance (passing Mr B's Restaurant). Outside the hotel, we were continually accosted for \"a dollar\" and it got really old--a few people were really insistent and got in our faces. We've been to new orleans many times and much prefer the area by the French MArket (outdoors) because it's residential--bad things happen anywhere, or can. We saw a woman get run over by a bike, literally, as the rider was cycling away from a crime he'd just commited on a sidewalk. He had a knife, showed it, and had stolen a guy's cell phone. The woman was okay, but the guy riding the bike had no remorse and pulled a knife on the guy whose phone he'd just stolen. This was 1 block down from the hotel, maybe less, outside a Walgreens which had a rentacop apparently picking his nose during all of this. So be careful if you're staying here. Seriously. We saw another guy passed out on the sidewalk 1 block from the hotel outside Felix's. We were unsure if he was dead, honestly, but he appeared homeless and high--everyone walked around him as it was a common everynight deal. If you go towards the French Quarter from the hotel, you won't see this type of stuff, likely. It is highly unlikely we'd stay here again, but that's not to say the hotel's not beautiful. Noise happens. Crime happens. This hotel, despite what people on this site will claim, is sort of on the border of where bad things happen in the area. We know a couple who's lived in the Marigny for 7 years and they warned us about staying in this area. It's not that dangerous.. but it's not necessarily safe, either and I've visited some very dangerous areas around the world (NOLA pales compared to most of them). Nice toiletries, peaceful once we moved to floor 14. Loads of ice available at ICE STATIONS, complimentary buffet breakfast daily (juices, cereal, bagels, yogurts, fruit, no eggs, pancakes, bacon, or anything hot/cooked, and that's ok for us). Wonderful shower pressure. Great doormen outside 24x7. Ornate lobby. Carousel bar is on the lobby floor, not the top of the hotel as some herein claim(?).. this hotel is \"the place to be seen\" but it is nice. Everyone working here was wonderful. We are stil haunted by seeing a woman run over by a bike, but this is not the hotel's fault. Keep your wits about you when venturing out from this hotel (when going left out of the hotel's entrance); even the locals warned us. Nothing ever happened immediately outside the hotel, but venturing down about 100' began the \"hey, gimme a dollar\" tirades.. not kidding. That got extremely old and it's sad to see teens begging for money.. it's also sad to see guys wearing $100 sneakers asking for a dollar, while high as kites on drugs/alcohol.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cIn the heart of the French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "CPACHIC", "ReviewID": "UR122382925", "Content": "The hotel is very quaint and you definitely feel that you are in a special place.

If myself or my husband moved even just a tiny bit the whole bed moved to the point of keeping us both up. The pillows were tiny little squares so if you moved, the pillows came out from under your head and again woke us because you had to readjust. Not one of the five nights did we get a good nights sleep. Upon check in the woman at the desk, with an accent almost too thick to understand,informed us we got an upgrade and it was a large suite. We were ecstatic until she told us how much more the suite was going to be. When I signed up to get an upgrade I was under the impression it would be at a drastically reduced rate based on availability at the time of check in. The website made it sound as such, I guess I missed the fine print. I simply would have made the reservation for the suite if I wanted to spend $600 or more a night. We opted to stay with the original reservation, the Deluxe King, since we were told no other upgrades were available. Upon check out the room was $20 more per night then what was on the website so I questioned it. The man at the front desk, who also had a very thick accent and difficult to understand said that I forfeited my right to get the online rate on the original reservation when I refused the upgrade. He then proceeded to tell me \"how to beat the system\" next time we came and we explained to him that was not necessary. We really felt duped, it wasn't the $20, that's negligible, but it is the bait and switch that is troubling in combination with the room which was very small, no real window, dirty, the carpet disgusting and the bad bed just made this visit intolerable. I explained when I made this reservation that this was a very special time for myself and my husband and that due to health concerns we would not be able to travel for a year. In the last year we have been to Santa Fe, Ireland, two weeks in New England, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Honduras, Belize, Mexico and Destin Fl. That doesn't count the trips for business. We also stay in Historic properties often.

At the very least we expect cleanliness and a good nights sleep and if we had gotten that I would not be writing this review.

The fruit was fresh, bagels were soft and many selections for cereal and a beautiful view of the Mississippi River! We stayed in 862 and the living room view was a wall, but the bedroom view was perfect. Rooftops and the Mississippi along with the steamboat daily. Jackson Square was an easy 6 block walk (or take a cab...no biggie). I had a great day by myself exploring the streets and shops of the French Quarter while mom was not feeling well from gallstones :( . I highly suggest the horse and carriage tour of the French Quarter and cemetery. It's a bit pricey, but so worth it for the history lesson. Royal St. was a great walk down to the Mississippi.

We actually arrived in New Orleans on Thursday and spent one night at Hotel St. Marie (my review is on TripAdvisor). We knew check-in was not until 3, and that it would likely be busy during the holidays, so we decided to park the car in a public lot and do some Christmas shopping in the French Market until time to check in. We drove to the Monteleone around 3 and went to the valet parking entrance. Our car was taken quickly and we were given a ticket to have our bags delivered to our room. The hotel had an area with velvet ropes set up in front of the registration desk for \"arrivals and departures,\" so I got in the queue and waited my turn, which only took a few minutes. Front desk staff were pleasant. I had purchased my 2-night stay as part of a silent auction package, so I'm always a little nervous that they'll have all the paperwork, but everything went smoothly. Parking for an SUV is $36/day plus taxes. Kind of steep, but not unexpected in the French Quarter. Ouch. We had a room on the 15th floor. The hotel is renovating the lounge next to the famous Carousel Bar, and the elevators we used were located along a temporary hallway constructed of plywood. Not a big deal; occasionally there was some construction noise but nothing major for us. However, the Carousel Bar had a large portion of its space - all but just around the carousel - walled off, and it was constantly packed, so revelers tended to spill down the hallway and into the lobby next to it, which caused us to have to wade through a sea of people often on the way to or from the room. Again, not really a big deal and a temporary annoyance of construction. Our room was nice - king bed, big window looking out toward Canal Street, nice appointments. The bed felt sort of springy-soft. It was kind of strange. Like the whole bedframe felt bouncy or something. Not really uncomfortable, but it felt like if you sat at the end of the bed the mattress would bend down and dump you on the floor. Like it was balanced on a pillar. I can't really explain it. The bathroom was hilariously tiny. Seriously, I don't think I've seen a bathroom this small outside of a cruise ship cabin. You opened the door with just enough clearance for the toilet, which was basically set back into the tiny counter top ledge shared with the sink. The tub was right up against the sink, although it did have a curved shower rod, so once you were actually in the shower, it was roomy. The shower did also have good water pressure and an adjustable spray shower head. There was a hairdryer provided. It was just kind of weird.This isn't really a horrible problem, and the space that was there was nice, all marble, and clean. But really, you had to laugh. It probably was funnier to me b/c the last time we stayed at this hotel we got upgraded to a suite, and the bathroom was enormous, with a huge square walk-in shower, double vanity and giant jacuzzi tub. There was a coffee maker in the room, on a small table/desk. Housekeeping forgot to replenish our coffee when the cleaned our room, so on the second morning we only had decaf. There were initially paper coffee cups, and we didn't have any of those either, so my husband ended up drinking his coffee out of a water glass. Not optimal. The Hotel St. Marie had real coffee mugs. Despite being on the 15th floor, I heard a lot of street noise, which seemed strange. Maybe I just slept lightly. It didn't bother my husband at all. Check out went smoothly, although the valet parking was pretty backed up when we went to retrieve our car. It probably took 20 minutes to get our car; not too bad. We checked out sort of early, too, around 9:30, so I was surprised it was already so busy. Overall, we had a very nice stay. I was very glad we had decided to visit the Carousel bar on Thursday night, before we actually checked in at the Monteleone, because it was totally packed out at almost any time of the day or night the rest of the weekend. I guess that's a good thing! The renovations are nice, although I think I actually liked the more gaudy paint on the carousel before the renovation. I'll be interested to see the whole thing once they open the lounge area. I would stay at the Monteleone again and I would recommend it.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Fl", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, Location\u201d", "Author": "elector", "ReviewID": "UR121985017", "Content": "An excellent hotel only one block from Bourbon Street and less than 5 minutes (walking) to St. Louis Cathedral.

The hotel was undergoing a restaurant renovation during our stay, and to compensate for that disruption (which was hardly disruptive) they served a free breakfast to guests. This was buffet style but with white tablecloths on the tables and servers to bring coffee, tea, etc. The spread was lavish and easily the equivalent of the $18.95 pp breakfasts served at other hotels. Due to our connection with a conference held at the hotel, we were given a special rate of, before taxes, about $105 for the room. They upgraded us to a junior suite at no extra charge! The room was beautifully appointed and the spa tub in the bathroom was a welcome extra.

The rooms were of good size and the king bed was actually a king bed; (we measured it!) Too often hotels list rooms with king sized beds but you get the feeling that it is really a queen plus. This bed was the real deal; the mattress a little too soft for my liking, but it did not prevent me from sleeping well. The service was pure southern hospitality (even though a lot of the lobby staff seemed to be from Eastern Europe). The housekeeping staff was great. The room was made up perfectly and even items that were left strewn about were neatly folded and placed on a chair. Even the toiletries in the bathroom were laid out on a towel and aligned perfectly. The Carousel Bar was definitely a highlight. The seating area around the bar actually rotates 360 degrees every 15 minutes. You don't even realize that you're moving. On top of this, the bartenders were spot on, no matter what drink you ordered. And although the prices were hotel high, you did get what you paid for. O.K. That was the good news...now for a little of the bad. We stayed at the Monteleone from October 24th and checked out on the 29th, 2011. I can't review the restaurants since they were all closed for renovation. In itself, this wasn't so bad as you got to experience a lot of the local fare in the Quarter. The problem was; noise, Noise, NOISE. Our room was on the 15th floor (highest room floor) and every morning, just about 7:00AM, the hammering and drilling started. We ended up complaining every morning and the noise was quickly shut down, but the damage was done. Yes, we did receive free drink coupons every day, but a little more sleep would have been more appreciated. So, if you're expecting a quiet room, do yourself a favor; either skip the Monteleone until after renovations are completed, or I would suggest a lower floor. Since we really liked the Hotel, go for the lower floor and enjoy the experience. Ordinarily, this would be the end of the review. However, I'm a little too lazy to do separate reviews and I wanted to give people an idea of the great restaurants, shopping, etc. we were able to enjoy while in town. The French Quarter - This section of New Orleans has everything you could possible hope for in one location. Bring soft shoes because you will be doing a lot of walking. Royal Street is loaded with antique shops and art galleries. You can literally spend an entire afternoon just walking up and down Royal Street. ****Beware - Stores open at their leisure and except for the tacky tourist shops, most do not open their doors before 10:30AM and close by 6:00PM. The Art Galleries are loaded with local artists, some of which are really talented. I have never seen a greater collection of 'weird' or 'voodoo' art in my life. Really cool! The Antique Shops are, well, antiquie. If you're into that, I'm sure you'll enjoy them. Bourbon Street - I guess that your level of appreciation is directly correlated to your age. This street runs for about 5 blocks and is pretty much where all the action is at night. There are 4 types of establishments that occupy Bourbon; Restaurants, Bars, Tourist Shops and Strip Clubs. It is also one of the few places I have ever been where they advertise 'Drinks to Go'. It is legal to walk down the Street, getting plastered. I guess that's why the Strip Clubs are doing so well. My Wife and I enjoyed Bourbon Street for, I guess, around 1 1/2 blocks. We both had headaches by the time we turned off the Street. Not that I didn't like the music; the problem being that every other place had live music and it kept rolling around in your brain. The better thing to do is to pick out one place and park your tush there for awhile to really enjoy the sounds. Other than that, watching people stumbling down the street with drinks in both hands was not exactly eye-pleasing. And some of the women hawking the strip clubs?; I've seen better T&A at Wallmart! Restaurants - Here is where the French Quarter really shines. Be prepared to spend some hard cash, but the food is out of this world. *****Note***** There are some lesser priced restaurants in the area, but you really have to search them out. I'm listing below the ones we ate in and the cost for 2 people. ***Also beware that their tax is outrageous; bordering on 10%. Felix's Restaurant - Forget Acme's. That's the place all the tourists go to.There are always long lines at Acme's and the prices are high!!!! Felix's is directly across the street (739 Iberville St.) and has absolutely the best oysters around. Well, I shouldn't say that since everyone's oysters come from the same place. But get this.. A dozen of these beauties at Acme's will cost close to 15$; at Felix's, only $11.50. Get the point? Also, the char-grilled oysters are to die for...They cost more ($9.95 for 6) but worth every pretty penny. Their bread pudding is to die for; warm and with a whiskey-based sauce ($5.00) On Wednesdays, you get a free draft when you order a dozen oysters. And the staff is great; outgoing, friendly and helpful. The Marigny Brasserie - This place is a little out of the way; at 640 Frenchmen Street. Take a cab. I had the fried chicken which is one of their specialties. It is Crispy, to say the least and the pieces barely fit onto a large plate. Share it with someone since you won't be able to finish it. My better half had the BBQ shrimp and grits (another house favorite), This was the first time I tasted Grits and actually enjoyed them. Dinner for two - $62.00 including tip. Antoines - Make sure you have room on the credit card 'cause this baby will cost ya. The grandest of the grand restaurants in New Orleans as well as the oldest. I wanted to go there after watching one of Emiril's shows. It included Antoine's and a dish he really enjoyed. He was spot on. The dish is referred to as Pompano Pontchartain and it is simply outrageous; a fillet of pompano (lightly breaded and pan seared), topped with loads of crab meat. OMG - heaven on a plate.We also had an appetizer of breaded oysters with this sauce (didn't need it) and a nice salad. For dessert, we had the Baked Alaska. At $16.50 (yes, that much) it was listed as dessert for two. Yeah right! It could have fed us and the two tables nearby. As a special treat, they flambe' it for me (my birthday present). The tab was , you ready? $120.00 including tip..and this was just 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 1 entree and dessert. Our most expensive meal, but really well worth it. It's a pleasure to sit at a table with white cloths and tuxedo dressed servers who are well versed in their field and really enjoy making sure that your experience is a great one. Olivier's - You will not find this place in any of the guides. We were directed there by one of the bartenders at the Monteleone. Good choice; Great Food. Only a couple of blocks from the hotel. My wife had Creole Rabbit and this was out of this world. I was in the mood for meat (carnivore that I am) and had one of the most tender Rib-Eyes I have ever had. Cooked perfectly to medium rare. Make reservations..This is a smaller restaurant and fills up quickly. Dinner with one drink and tip - $75.00 American Sector - This is one of John Besh's places and is inside the National WWII museum. We went there for lunch and had a great time. The restaurant is themed in the 1940's and the food is served in tins, cans, etc. Done really well. We didn't go into the museum proper but it seemed like a cool place to spend a couple of hours. The restaurant is worth it. We had Rabbit pate', with celery root slaw and horseradish and for the main course, we shared Pork Cheeks. Yes, pork cheeks. They were out of sight, so tender and tasty and they came with black-eyed peas and corn bread. The servers were all dressed in the outfits of the times and, once again, were extremely friendly and out-going. Total bill around $40.00 including tip. Best dining surprise? Fried Green Tomatoes. Honestly. Finally, one of the cooler things we did was to take a cooking class at the New Orleans School of Cooking. It only costs $29.00/person and is well worth the visit. You're seated at tables of 8-10 and they take around 100 people at a time. This was an open lunch class and started at 10:00AM and ended up around 12:30PM. Our 'instructor' was Aunt Sandra and what a character. This woman talked non-stop the entire session, while she was cooking the whole time. She was great, giving us a history of New Orleans, the foods, etc. After each course was finished, food was served. We had a creamy artichoke and shrimp soup, crawfish etouffee, bread pudding and pralines. Everything was delicious. There is not a better way to spend 2 1/2 hours!. Overall, I would rate our trip a 9.5 out of 10. We had a fantastic time. Yes, sometimes you couldn't tell the homeless from the tourists, but hey...that's true in a lot of cities.

When the renovations are done, this hotel should have excellent dining areas. There are dozens of excellent restaurants, shops and attractions within walking distance of the hotel. I was there for business, and we found the meeting rooms to be very good. All the resources we needed to conduct business were provided without any problems at all. The Hotel is surrounded by narrow busy streets, with lots of pedestrian traffic. I would not recommend trying to bring your car there... Parking is expensive, and once you are there, there is no need to have a car. You can walk anywhere you want in minutes, and there are Taxis available all the time. I stayed in a standard room with two double beds. The hotel is historic so the rooms are not huge, but they have been upgraded with marble bathroom fixtures. All the amenities are available in the room. High speed internet is available at a fairly pricy cost. Our business planner negotiated the internet into the room charge. Otherwise the highspeed service was over $15 per day. That seems pretty expensive to me. I'm used to that being a free service. One other thing to consider... this hotel is one block off Bourbon Street... There are musicians playing on the street right next to the hotel... and pedestrian traffic all night long... lots of partying going on until late in the morning 3-4am. My room was only 3 floors up and there was lots of music and noise from the street. So this isn't the hotel for a quiet retreat. Maybe a room in the 14th or 15th floor would be quieter.

Raoul was our bellman both on check in and check out. Nice man who has worked there for decades and who always remembers my name. Lucille is my waitress and she's the same, she always remembers us and seems genuinely happy to see us again. Our requested room was not available when checked in, so our first night didn't have a river view, which we always request (the hotel was fully booked), so the next day they moved us to a river view room in the western side of the hotel. Not quite as nice a view as other rooms we've had, but we could see the big bend in the river and watch the ships and barges coming and going. The room was comfortable and everything worked well. There are new bathrooms in this section with the toilet mounted at a diagonal so the door would clear, a little odd, but functional. The famous Carousel Bar was open but was reduced in size by the renovations, but as I understand it, it will be back to its original size after construction with a lighter decor as differentiated from the piano lounge that was there before. They'll have some more window seats which I enjoy. Great spot for people watching on Royal St. The bartenders did their magic and kept the place going with excellent cocktails, even with special requests. Try a Sazerac.

Of course it is OK to close restaurants and renovate. It is not OK to make people line up for a croissant and some fruit. Who was in charge of this idea and do they still work there? The poor ladies who serve the coffee are left to deal with somewhat disgruntled guests. While the overall quality of the amenities was OK it was not great.

The bar could use a bit of a facelift (duct tape was covering several rips on the black leatherette banquettes) but the other restaurant areas are in mid-renovation so the Carousel could be on the list. Speaking of renovation, as a favor to guests who were unable to eat in the hotel restaurants the hotel offered free continental breakfast. Nice perk but \"free\" created a cattle car type atmosphere, as people were lined up four deep waiting for tables in a tiny makeshift dining room. Also, they happened to choose a room that was directly above the renovation work, so drills and chainsaws were buzzing away loudly during breakfast. I'd skip the breakfast, or get it to go. Another small complaint was the hassle in retrieving a valet parked car. Waited for over 1/2 hour for the car and then as I was trying to drive out, I was totally blocked by a car the valet just left in the garage entrance. Had to wait another 10 minutes for them to undo the parking mess. I'd definitely opt to self park if I had to do it over again. All in all, the service at the hotel and the atmosphere is top notch.

I had wanted to take her there for some time as I had been there for work numerous occasions and enjoyed the city. After much research, I opted for Hotel Monteleone because of its location, reputation, and old New Orleans charm. I also got a good rate on Get A Room.com which was slightly less than other comparable hotels near the FQ. But in hindsight, I regret my decision. Although the staff were professional and check in was easy, the room was a disappointment. I expected it to be on the small side based on reviews I read, but I did not expect it to smell old and dank. My wife called and asked for a different room, but were told there would be a wait involved, so we decided not to worry since we would not be in the room much. We tried to take brief nap, but there was too much commotion and noise ( a sign of bad things to come!) We straightened up and headed out to explore the city. The Carousel Bar was cool. It was small as well, but packed and had a good vibe. The cocktail menu was impressive and our drinks were excellent. That was the highlight of our stay. Although we enjoyed the city very much, when we came back to our room around 11 PM, the noise was unbelievable. It seems as though the walls are paper thin. We were on the 4th floor, but we could hear people's conversations on the street outside our window as well as in the hall through our door. My wife had ear plugs but said she could still hear music and some voices. I could hear horns until about 2 AM and could hear every voice anytime someone spoke in the hall. I heard yelling on the street when the bars closed around 4 AM. This was the least noise-proof room I have ever stayed in my lifetime. Needless to say, I did not sleep much that trip. The next morning, we went to have continental breakfast, and there was a cluster of people. The line wrapped around the hallway, and even though they offered plates to go, the coffee pot was set up right next to the hostess stand, so it was an absolute cluster. We checked out and left to go to the French Market instead, passing on the \"free breakfast\".

Upon arrival, the bellman helped me with my luggage up the 5-6 steps from the street to the lobby and the front desk staff handled check-in very efficiently. The hotel's convention facilities are under construction so most of our meetings were held in the Marriott 2 1/2 blocks away - not a big deal. There really wasn't a big deal problem, just several nits. First, \"traditional\" is a euphemism for tiny, as my traditional room was very small. The A/C could not be controlled - it was always cold even when the thermostat was set on 80F. The maintenance man had to adjust it from the hall closet. The flat screen TV was nice, but I did not get any of the local (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC) stations. The bathroom had a nice finish, but the toilet was so close to the sink that my shoulder touched it. One bottle of water was in the mini-fridge, but it was never replaced. The mini-fridge could not reach a cool temperature - milk surely would have spoiled.

She removed two wet towels and the bath mat from the bathroom but did not replace them. She was probably in the room a total of 30 seconds. The bathroom did have plenty of hot water and good water pressure. One afternoon, my meetings ended early and I tried to catch up on e-mails in the room. It was hard to concentrate with the maids yelling up and down the hall to each other. Luckily, I didn't hear any hall noise at night. The Carousel Bar is nice if a bit kitschy with its rotating bar, but is very $$$. I asked the waitress for the price of a drink and she said it was \"either $6.50 or $7.50.\" When she brought the check the drink was listed as $9.25. She said, \"Sorry\" as she dropped off the check and kept walking. Unbelievable. And, don't order a martini unless you're on an expense account - those run $15.00. The rooftop pool was very pleasant and the hotel had a nice continental breakfast set up at no charge due to the restaurant reconstruction. The breakfast waitress was friendly and kept my coffee topped off. A hostess sat you at a properly set table, so it was much better than your typical motel continental breakfast free-for-all. The hotel lobby is what you expect a grand hotel lobby to look like - very nice and old-school. Check-out was quick and seamless and the bellman made sure that my taxi accepted credit cards. Would I recommend this hotel? That is a difficult question. The location is excellent and the front desk staff is wonderful. However, the tiny room had more problems than it had square feet. Unless you upgrade above the standard/traditional room, I think you can do much better elsewhere.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsboro, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a Girls Night/Weekend\u201d", "Author": "DCTower", "ReviewID": "UR118668678", "Content": "I loved their location and outside pool courtyard.

The pool is of a goodly size and they use some of the newer chemicals - not chlorine.

The drinks at the carousel bar are a bit expensive so we were so happy to receive that as well. The room was big and beautiful. The bathroom was especially luxurious with a jacuzzi tub. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t haved asked for anything nicer. The carousel bar was very unique. I would definitely have a drink there. Strong drinks and great service. I never got a chance to use the pool as it was so hot during the day that the last thing I wanted to do when I got back to the hotel was roast in the sun. but my husband used it but because the pool is small found it too busy to really enjoy it. He said there really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t room to actually swim. There are lots of lounge chairs and he enjoyed sitting up there but found the bar drinks expensive. Breakfast every morning was great. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting much as I heard there would be lineups. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not very patient for our coffee in the morning so I almost expected to have breakfast at a close by caf\u00c3\u00a9. But we headed down at 8am every morning and got seated immediately every time. Breakfast options were very nice with lots of fresh fruit, nice pastries, cereals, breakfast breads, and freshly squeezed juices. Service was excellent during breakfast. In the evening we would often take cabs and the doormen were always prompt and friendly and hailed us cabs quickly. The location of the hotel is fantastic too. Right in the middle of everything so walking around to all the shops was easy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a couple of blocks from bourban street but you would never know it as the hotel is very quiet. As well there is a walgreens next door which was very convenient. Definitely eat at mr. b\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bistro across the street. It was the best meal we had during our stay. As well the acme oyster house around the corner was great too for lunch. I would highly recommend hotel monteleone.

My parents stay there, my grandparents stayed their on their honeymoon back in the 30's. It's a true gem in the city of New Orleans and was my favorite place to stay until last weekend. My husband and I visit New Orleans at least once a year and always try to go for my birthday in August. This year a friend was having his wedding at the same time and blocked rooms at the Monteleone. We checked in on Friday and left our car with the garage. We never saw, accessed or drove the car until we checked out on Sunday. When we picked it up I walked around the outside to check for damage and my husband checked the console glove box in between the seats. Everything seemed ok. I got on my phone to call my mom to tell her we were leaving and checked Map Quest about the detour on I-10. I regret not paying more attention to the inside of our SUV. On our way home we noticed \"Steve\" carved into the INSIDE of the passenger side door. The angle is such thought that the vandal had to be standing outside the car, which we thought was strange. I immediately called the hotel and were told to email pictures which I promptly did from my phone. The next day we were told that the security tapes were viewed and they saw no wrong doing. SInce I know that \"Steve\" has never been in my car and this damage was not there before my stay I asked to speak to the manager. He called us two days later and told us the same thing, he viewed the tapes and saw no wrong doing. He did tell us that it is hotel policy that the windows of all vehicles are left down and the keys in the ignition, confirming what we thought about the signature. He assured us only employees could access the elevator to the cars. Well obviously that is not true or one of the employees did this. The staff has always been wonderful and I know most of them have been employed there for quite some time so I doubt it was a staff member. I'm sure it had to been someone who accessed the garage somehow. The parking manager also told us when we \"return to the hotel\" for another stay he's comp us overnight parking - as if we will be returning. I never plan to set foot in this hotel again. He didn't even offer to return our money for the $64 plus tax we spent on our trip to park in the garage over the weekend.

We are a family of 3 with a teenager. We booked this hotel off the reviews we saw here and were so happy with our choice! The hotel is in the perfect location. It is situated between Bourbon Street (1 block) and the river - about 5-6 blocks (where we booked quite a few tours). We are from the Boston area - so we thought a block would be pretty long- but the streets in the French Quarter are compact and narrow, so you can walk anywhere pretty quickly. The staff was wonderful and check-in was a breeze! We had a small issue with our bathroom light, but it turned out to be just the ground fault on the outlet. We fixed it ourselves just as the facilities employee arrived. So no big deal. He was great! The rooms are on the smaller side, but they are in every city we've been to. We didn't want to stay at a big chain - we wanted the whole New Orleans experience and a 125 year-old hotel that is said to be haunted fit the bill! We did not experience any visits from beyond....but.... I thought that the fog-free area on the bathroom mirror might be the work of a spirit...my husband convinced me it was the housekeeper....still - a really cool little touch that I have never seen at any other hotel. There was construction going on, but you'd never know it and the complimentary breakfast was more than adequate. Lucille, part of the breakfast staff was AMAZING!! She was so wonderful and attentive that we would go back just because of her!! Having a 14 year old, we didn't make it into the carousel bar, but it looked lovely and the rooftop pool was a treat!! It was really quiet at night and we were so happy to be just that far from Bourbon St., which was crazy...but an experience! Not recommended for small children!! So my best tips: 1. Cab it from the airport - it was $42 one way for the 3 of us and we tipped $10 We also booked him for the return trip so we wouldn't have to worry about it. We were lucky enough to get Daniel from Amazing Grace cab. 2. Beignets are awesome!! Get them daily just around the corner at Cafe Beignet at Music Legends park. We sat outside and enjoyed the live jazz. You can get coupons for a free small cafe au lait at the tour company by the river. We preferred this cafe to the famous Cafe du Monde - there's were good - but too similar to the fried dough in New England - we preferred the more doughnut like quality of Cafe Beignet's. 3. You really can fit a lot into just a few days....we had 3 full days - Rode the steamboat - don't get the meal ticket - you can get stuff onboard ala carte), visited the WWII museum (tour company by the river provides transportation with ticket purchase), took a Swamp Tour (way better than I thought it would be), went to the State museum, walked all over the Quarter, and heard Jazz at Irvin Mayfield's. Plus....went to tons of great restaurants. So much amazing food and music!! 4. If you can splurge - go to the Pelican Club restaurant....that was our personal favorite and just around the corner from the Monteleone. Dress is business casual. 5. You can follow @hotelmonteleone on Twitter and Facebook and also @VisitNewOrleans to know what's going on around the city and the hotel. Above all.....we loved the Monteleone!! Safe, quiet, clean, and friendly was our experience. We went on a whim through a vacation package with JetBlue and were so happy that we were able to choose the Monteleone!!

Room service, pool bar service and the light menu at the Carousel Bar is still available but not the restaurants themselves.

The rooms were very clean and bigger than I expected. They are doing renovations to the hotel but no matter what time of day or night I went back to my room, I didn't hear a single noise from it. I believe they aren't placing guests in the sections they are redoing. You will not notice a single thing while you are there. No noise/dust/etc. Due to the renovation they are offering a bigger continental breakfast there. A ton of fresh fruit, coffee, pastry selection, cereal, yogurt and the like. All served in a dining room, and was very well done. White tableclothes, and perfect service. The second you are done with a plate or need a coffee refill it is taken care of. There is a cute logo shop there for some last minute things you may need, and hotel merchandise. You cna even purchase the bedding. And you will want to after using the hotel pillow. They were so comfortable! I didn't want to leave them. The carousel bar is fantastic. It slowly rotates while you are there, and the bartenders were very friendly and joked around with the guests.

We arrived late and due to a change in travel plans, had two separate reservations. Front desk staff were able to make our check in smooth and get us to our room quickly. The valet and bellman were wonderfully polite and friendly- our room was spacious and bedding was very comfortable. The location is also extremely convenient, walking distance to most activities. By this point in our trip, Hotel Monteleone had earned 5 stars, no questions asked. In fact, most of our stay earned 5 stars. Some highlights: -Excellent dinner room service with friendly staff -Beautiful roof-top pool with bar -Great rooms and bathrooms -Refrigerator in the room (very important when you have a young child who needs snacks and drinks regularly) We did run into a few unwelcome surprises though: -$30/night valet fee, which is really unavoidable (you don't have other choices for parking, as far as I could tell) -Valet was not very pleased (although they did accommodate) when we needed to retrieve items from our car the next day. It was clear they were inconvenienced. -Breakfast was not available except through room service. They posted a continental breakfast option by the elevators, but due to an event, it was canceled. There was no notice of this and we only found out because we asked. We were given vouchers to go to a nearby restaurant, only to be told (rudely) that we had missed the breakfast time (at 10:30 am). The vouchers were also valid for room service, so we returned to the hotel and ordered a continental breakfast which never arrived (we waited over an hour, with a starving 2 year old). The hotel manager was apologetic and refunded one night of parking, but didn't appear too sympathetic. -The pool closed for a private event one afternoon, which would have been fine, had we been given notice. As it was, I was swimming with my son and suddenly everyone else was gone... Not really a nice way to learn about the pool closing. When we asked, the front desk was able to tell us about alternative arrangements at a hotel pool around the corner. Again, it was made right, but we really had to ask before we were given information. Overall, the hotel was really very nice and most staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately, the negative experiences we did have really put a damper on our stay, especially since the breakfast issue was the day we were checking out. Number one tip: Be sure to ASK people when things are closed, etc. They don't post the information or make it easily available, so you need to be upfront.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laurel, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGrand Dame Hotel Could Use a Little Upgrading\u201d", "Author": "RedSabre", "ReviewID": "UR115893161", "Content": "My husband and I have been coming to New Orleans every year for Jazz Fest, and have always stayed at either the Royal Sonesta or the Ritz Carlton. This year, we decided to try the Monteleone for a slight change of scenery. Location-wise, being on Royal Street as opposed to Bourbon Street made a difference -- no need to push through throngs of inebriated people to enter the lobby, no need to worry about choosing an interior room to get a good night's sleep, and one block closer to the shuttle stop for the Jazz Fest buses. The public areas of this hotel are elegant in an old-timey way -- lots of marble, brass and crystal. The Carousel bar is a must-visit at least once. But there are several minor deficiencies in the hotel which certainly didn't spoil my trip but will make me try harder to get into my preferred hotels next time. In terms of reservations, the website for the hotel didn't let us specify that we preferred a king room instead of two doubles (either that, or our request wasn't honored); for two tall people, neither sleeping together on a double, nor sleeping separately on our own double, was ideal. The room, while clean and generally comfortable, could have used a bit of updating and freshening up, and the bedding was not the high-thread-count cotton I've come to expect even at mid-range business class hotels. We had long-ish waits for elevators, because there are only two, and the crowds in the lobby (which has lounging areas just outside the elevators) led to some clumsy maneuvering one leaving the elevator.

Therefore, when we booked a room at the Monteleone, we knew it would be great. Everything about our stay was great. Throughout our stay, we continuously remarked to each other how caring and attentive the staff was; each department - from the parking garage to the front desk to housekeeping, dining, and the Carousel Lounge - were all at the top of their game. It was also amzaing how meticulously maintained this 125 year old was; we found no wear and tear anywhere - everything looked new! The decor is luxurious, with fine furnishings throughout the lobby and public areas, and beautiful wallcoverings throughout the corridors. We were first placed in what they call a \"Traditional Double\" room - it was beautiful and comfortable but somewhat cramped. Then we upgraded to a Vieux Carre Suite, and how sweet it was! With views overlooking the French Quarter and the Mississippi River, we were mesmerized. Two TV's, three phones, two bathrooms - one boasting marble floors, granite countertops, a Keurig coffee maker, a glass-enclosed shower and the very best jacuzzi I have ever been massaged by - and the bed...ooooh, the bed was so very comfortable! The spacious, well decorated living room (yes, the chairs were upholstered in the same pattern material as the drapes) made the suite all that much more of a retreat as we went back and forth on our daily outings in the French Quarter. Don't miss the rooftop pool! We love that it is only 4 1/2 feet deep, which allowed us to lounge and chat with new friends while drinking frozen drinks from the poolside bar. The other bar - the historic Carousel Lounge on the ground floor - is also not to be missed, as the 20 or so patrons on the barstools surrounding the bar move round and round at a very leisurely, relaxing pace. Another outstanding amenity is the fitness room; there is a very good variety of strength and cardio equipment, and each of the cardio machines have a personal TV attached...or you can just look out over the city or watch the riverboats and ships pass by in the Mississippi. The only difficulty we had during the entire trip was finding the right elevator to the rooftop pool; coming across a female employee who was keeping the lobby spotless, when I asked directions, instead of telling me or pointing the way, she actually walked us across the lobby, around the corner, pressed the button for the elevator, and held the door as we entered. Talk about service! Another nice touch was the ever-present doorman. All in all, the Monteleone is a luxurious, comfortable, and historic place to stay, and its perfect location in the French Quarter (there is no need for a car if you are vacationing here) only makes it better. Do yourself a favor and spend some time at the Monteleone, like we did. We'll be back! Nearby dining tips: The continental breakfast buffet was outstanding - in addition to nice pastries, cereals, and juices, it had the best fruit and berry selection I have seen anywhere except Hawaii. Just around the corner, the Pelican Club was great for dinner, and the \"Someplace Else\" restaurant was good for lunch. Living nearby we can also highly recommend K-Paul's and Arnaud's for great dinners, and the Napoleon house or the Crescent City Brewhouse for lunch or drinks. Susan Spicer's famous Bayonna Restaurant a few blocks away is also nice, but don't bother - the quality is just a bit too subtle to justify the high prices.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston (well, an hour south)", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "su2doz", "ReviewID": "UR115868680", "Content": "My cousin and I stayed here during a weekend in July.

One block over from Bourbon and two blocks from Canal. Plus you are in prime walking distance to many restaurants including Felix, the Oyster House and Deanie's Seafood. The lobby is beautiful and though I didn't utilize it the revolving bar was kind of interesting looking. The pool is on the roof and very nice looking looking, however somewhat small. Now, the rooms are small. Though I realize that most rooms are small in the French Quarters, I just don't remember them being that small. In addition, please note the Hotel has a renovated and non-renovated side. Ask for a room on the renovated side, they are slightly bigger plus you can actually control temperature. The bathrooms are also small and not updated. The beds were comfortable, given me a good night sleep every night I was there. Some of the workers could use a refresher course on hospitality. I had an incident where I remarked that a conference room was locked that we were supposed to be using to one lady who was working on the floor. She preceded to tell me 'she couldn't help me and maybe you should go ask someone else'. It wasn't what she said, but how she said it. Also had an incident where the fire alarm went off (we were on the 15th floor) and we had to take the stairs down. Once we got to the 4th floor we were told it was a false alarm. However, when my mother (who is recovering from double knee surgery) was remarking how upset she was about the strain going down stairs had put on her one of the workers actually LAUGHED in her face. Restaurant was closed for renovations so the hotel offered free Continental Breakfast. Get their early if you don't want to wait in line. All in all this hotel probably use to be one of the gems of New Orleans, but their are numerous things that need to be worked on to be that way again.

The hotel certainly thinks a lot of itself and its place in New Orleans history and its fabulous location in the French Quarter. Here's the good: the bellhops were wonderful fonts of information on where to eat, drink, and be merry. The doormen brave torrential rain to hail taxicabs and escort guests into their chariots with large umbrellas. The location is sweet and a stone's throw from Bourbon Street and several amazing restaurants. The rooftop patio has a bar, a lovely lounge area, nice comfortable chairs and a pool (that could be a little more clean), and a fairly nice view. The carousel bar is nice... but the food is only so-so. Here are the cons: it is overpriced for what you get. The rooms are small and have rather frou-frou drapes and would benefit from a more minimalist makeover. There isn't a lot of soundproofing so be prepared to hear the goings on in neighbouring rooms (particularly when the showers are engaged as it may sound as if someone is taking a shower in your room). While renovations are ongoing the restaurant is closed but there is a complimentary continental breakfast... HOWEVER the staff are ill-equipped to deal with the demand for this free breakfast. The line up to get seated for this free breakfast snakes around the halls and takes up to 30 minutes. While a nice gesture, when you understaff and make so few tables available for this breakfast it almost makes the sentiment begrudging rather than generous. In fact, I ended up giving up for two of the four nights I stayed here. Furthermore, when I did finally get seated for breakfast one morning I asked for milk rather than cream with my coffee. The waitress informed me that there was milk available by the cereal carafes... so I got up and walked across the room and poured some milk directly into my cup from the milk fountain which seemed like a very strange thing to have to do in a hotel that charged $30/day for valet parking. Hotel Monteleone: are you fancy or not? What's the deal? The gym is small and its equipment is a little rickety but you do get an amazing view from the treadmills. Spa Aria on the 2nd floor is very nice though. Several people in my party had massages and contend they are among the best they have ever had. And then there is internet. In a world in which every Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, and Radisson is offering up free internet it is a bit weird to be hit with a daily 10 dollar fee for internet usage. And finally in a gesture I found to be rather disgusting, the hotel asks in its final bill it leaves under your door to rate it 5 out of 5 on Trip Advisor if you enjoyed your stay. It came across a bit like asking for a tip. This hotel is ok but nothing spectacular. It could be incredible if it revamped its rooms, installed a barista in its lobby, maintained its pool a little better, made internet free, and made its hotel more of an \"experience.\" It doesn't take much... free drinks on check-in, or welcome packages, etc. To me, that's what constitutes a true 4 diamond or 5 star experience.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "FrederickNorth", "ReviewID": "UR115327470", "Content": "Loved this hotel, it is two blocks from bourbon st, but you would never know it, very quiet.

Since I'm always looking for a place with a little character, I checked the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Historic Hotels website, and found the Monteleone available for $100/night on a summer special. How can you turn that down? (I paid the convention rate for part of the stay.) The hotel definitely lived up to my expectations for character and quality. Upon arrival, the front desk had no issue linking my two separate reservations seamlessly, and unlike other times I have done that at other hotels, the electronic keycards never locked me out between \"stays.\" The hotel was under renovation during my stay, so some facilities were reduced; the restaurants were closed, and there was a continental breakfast that I didn't avail myself of -- how can one do that when the delicious pancakes of the Camillia Grill are now just a few blocks away in the Quarter? The Carousel Bar was still open, a fantastic venue for getting together after dinner, or writing during some quiet hours. My room, #745, was a nice corner king. The bathroom was somewhat small, but totally functional for me. The room exudes an old-world character, something I've felt in other classic hotels like The Greenbrier in West Virginia and The Palace in San Francisco. The biggest problem with the room was one that's unavoidable in the hotel's location -- it's never totally quiet at night. The Monteleone is probably just as soundproof as any hotel of similar construction in the country, but having Bourbon Street a block away does not make for a perfectly silent night. However, if you're going to stay in the Quarter, you have to take the noise as a given with the location. That said, my room more than redeemed itself with curtains that created complete blackout conditions, something I crave after living in NYC for three years! Overall, the family-run character of this place shows through. Unlike at a larger chain place, I felt like the staff connected more with guests, while still being completely professional. I admit I'm a softie for historic places as a history geek, and someplace that's turning 125 years old this year may allow me to overlook some flaws. But overall, I felt that the Hotel Monteleone delivered much more of an old-world Southern atmosphere than my coworkers got at the MC Marriott or the Royal Sonesta.

I must comment on the shower. Usually the showers in other hotels where I have stayed have no power and the spray spreads out too much. This shower head was powerful and more condensed. Loved it! Also, we had a call from housekeeping in the late afternoon asking if there was anything we needed. That was a first! I was very impressed.

It is actually on the edge of the French Quarter as I found out while trying to explore the French Quarter in 100 degree heat. Still the Carosel Bar was just as charming as I had hoped. It really does inhance the drinking experience if you are not stuck next to a conventioneer talking about the latest in medical devices all night but instead you are slowly moved towards a hottie on the other side of the room who has been giving you the eye from across the bar. Not very high tech but it works. The hotel was also very close to Galatoire's where we ate dinner. That was great given that we were wearing coat and tie as required by the restaurant and as mentioned above it was 100 degrees during the day and the nights only cooled down a little. Still I would try this place again only after they complete thier reservations.

She answered all our questions, offered helpful hints and advise and all with a delightful sense of humor. If you are looking for a hotel where you truly feel pampered and special - look no further, the Hotel Monteleone is all that and more. It's location is close to everything. We walked to the aquarium, River Walk shops, the French Market and many of the sights of the French Quarter. You are so close to everything. It was also easy to catch a streetcar to the Garden District (thanks for the help, Miss Eva).

Nonetheless, the food was very near of gourmet. The one complaint is the horrendous Internet service. Fortunately, my iPad has the cellular service, so it was not a big problem for me. Still, there are times you would like to get on your laptop, and I wound up subscribing to the city service for $19.95 a week. Please, do not even bother with that, as it will make you feel like you have entered a time warp and have found yourself back on dial-up.

A fan sure would have been nice to keep the tiny bathroom mirrors from fogging up and from overheating. The toilet was extremely loud and was of the type you would find in a shopping mall or high school bathroom. Incredibly, the hotel has been recently renovated. It is hard to imagine that these rooms actually used to be worse! The hallway in which my room was located (9th floor-Iberville Tower) actually had a piece of duct tape on the carpet! Maybe because I had the \"discounted\" convention rate of $169 (regular rates were over $200), I didn't get the greatest room. But at $169, you expect a lot more than what you are given here. You are basically paying for the famous name and location. While the location is good, it is not like you are overlooking Jackson Square. You are one block from Bourbon Street but you are located on the far southern end of the French Quarter. In other words, you are much closer to Canal St. and the central business district, than the French Market. Parking is $30/day and the hotel has its own garage.

We arrived during the first weekend of Jazz Fest and although the hotel was busy, we found the service to be very attentive, with one exception (see Carousel Bar). Upon arrival around noon, our room wasn't ready yet, however the lady at the front desk checked us in and told us to go out and enjoy the Quarter and that she would call us to let us know as soon as our room was ready. My husband and I proceeded to go out for lunch, and within an hour we received a call from the front desk advising us that our room was ready even though it was well before the check-in time of 3:00 p.m.!!! Our room, a king size delux, was on the 12th floor and although not large was beautifully appointed with classical furnishings. If you are looking for a room with a modern sterile feel, this is not the hotel for you. Amenities were what you would expect from a top level hotel, and toiletries were alway replenished. Housekeeping was excellent!! We made a point of calling down to let housekeeping know when we were leaving the room and within an hour of our calls each day our room was serviced!! Service throughout the hotel was top notch, from the doormen, to staff in the Cafe, who were pleased to sit us for just coffee on Sunday morning (we had brunch reservations elsewhere for later in the morning and just wanted a cup of coffee and toast to tied us over), to the staff at the pool on the top floor. The pool is small and if there are large groups, it can be difficult to get chairs, but given that you are in New Orleans and most properties don't have pools, this location was a welcome spot after a busy morning/afternoon in the Quarter. The area has a bar, and food can be ordered through room service. The Carousel Bar is not to be missed!! It is a fun spot to stop for a drink or listen to the music/songs of John Autin in the evenings. Given that we were there during JazzFest, the Monteleone had other guest performers join John Autin each evening. Service however in this bar was the least consistent of all the hotel. If you are able to get a seat at the Carousel (very popular), the bartenders were attentive. If however, you sat at the piano section, service was inconsistent. Some servers were very good and always made sure you had snacks and drinks, while others brought you a first drink (without snacks/chips) and then forgot about you unless you called them over. We stopped off at the Carousel each night before retiring and it became obvious to us that this was an issue.

But I was excited because I love the Carousel Bar and had always fantasized about staying at the Monteleone. Well, I knew from a long time ago not to expect a huge room, and since I booked in the traditional part of the building, I knew that I'd be getting something 'petite\". So no surprises or misconceptions there. But, I have to say, the view they hide with multiple layers of drapery is worth hiding. Basically what we call in NYC, an air shaft. OK, I wasn't there for the views from the room. But I have to say the carpet was a little worse for the wear. And something I didn't notice until my traveling comapnion did - our room abutted a mechanical closet which meant that we went to sleep with a vibration and a buzzing in our heads. The hotel could have avoided this in our room entirely by placing the beds on the opposite wall. Or by hiring an engineer to insure proper sound insulation for guests. And our room was more than $200/night. The entire time, my poor friend had to listen to me compare the room and value to the Loews - which I stay at regularly.

We had drinks both nights in the Carousal Bar and Julie was one of the best cocktail waitresses I have ever encountered; great customer service skills. Three things that should change at the Monteleone; 1. Do not charge for Computer use. Even some motels do not charge for this amenity. I know people who will not stay in places that charge for computer use especially when paying full rack rate for a room. At $300 plus per night with prepayment in full in advance; this should be included in the rate. 2. The entry way stairs carpet is tired & worn looking.

Our room was nice with a view of the Mississippi. The fitness center and rooftop pool are great if you want to exercise to justify eating all that great NOLA food. The Carousel bar is truly unique; try a Pimm's Cup if you're tired out and hot from walking around the Quarter. The location is perfect - on Royal, not noisy Bourbon Street, an easy walk from the sights of the Quarter and neighboring areas. The staff made good suggestions about places to go. However, given the high price of the rooms, the Monteleone management needs to do a few things to justify their luxury pricing. First of all, the wifi service is REALLY unreliable and the tech support, while polite, was not much help. Don't count on internet access when you need it - it may be fine for an hour or so, but we found that the signal dropped at least 10 times in three days. When you're trying to fit in a little bit of work between meals and outings, it's important that wifi be available when you need it. Secondly, cleanliness in public areas could use some work. On Sunday morning after 9 a.m., towels were neatly arranged on the pool chairs, but the deck around the chairs was still littered with the detritus of the night before - cigarette butts, food debris, and broken glass. Thirdly, participants in a large scale meeting in the rooftop conference room took up many poolside tables for work meetings (one-on-one interviews about sales performance, it seemed) during peek weekend pool hours. If a business meeting needs \"break-out\" space, assign them to spaces inside the building or in a separate area. It's hard to relax poolside when we had to place chairs next to garbage cans because the table were taken up by sincere young people explaining to their supervisors what factors were affecting their sales records. Finally, it's a mystery to us as to why the only African American employees we met were doormen - and the front desk and gift shop were mostly staffed by sullen Eastern European \"foreign students\" (as they told me). Most of the staff was really friendly and helpful - as we expected in this city of charming accents and nice folks - special kudos to the guy running the luggage checkroom and Brandon on the front desk who helped us on Sunday morning. But in a time of high unemployment in Crescent City, we can't think of any legal justification for why the Monteleone would be employing white foreigners of dubious visa status over natives of the city.

I tried to make a reservation, but unfortunately all rooms were booked at the time of our visit due to two large conventions going on in town. I made a reservation for place d'armes hotel instead. Upon our check in at place d'armes, I knew immediately that we would not be able to spend 4 nights there. At 2:15 am, I called Hotel Monteleone and spoke with Monique in reservations and explained my situation to her. She was outstanding to work with! She was so accomodating and did all she could to find me a room in the hotel. After talking with her for about 30 minutes, she could not book a reservation because all rooms were showing as being booked. Due to the recent storms that hit a lot of the States, Monique recommended that I either call back later in the morning or come into the hotel directly to see if there were any cancellations. Later that morning after trying to sleep a few hours at place d'armes, we went to Monteleone, and between Monique and Iriana (I may have spelling wrong), they were able to confirm a two night reservation for us. Hotel Monteleone is beautiful! It is such a great property and the location is excellent! It is right in the heart of the French Quarter, and very close to all the great places for food, drink, art, music, etc. It is very close to Bourbon Street, but far enough away to escape the noise and have a restful night of sleep. We walked just about everywhere from the hotel, and only took a cab when heading into the Garden District for dinner. Our room was very clean and very comfortable, with very nice appointments. The rooms, along with the rest of the hotel are very charming and very inviting. I did see some folks state in their reviews that they experienced bad service. Maybe it was just an off night when they were there, but I can tell you that the service we received was outstanding the entire time of our stay. The doorman was always very friendly and nice, and provided great recommendations. Each night we walked out, he would ask 'where are you heading to dinner tonight\" and would provide recommendations from the menu. We spent a few hours in the Carousel Bar and had a great time there, again with outstanding service. If you do stay at the hotel, please find time to go to the Carousel Bar. It's a great experience! So, to sum it up about the service, for us, who did not have a reservation prior to walking into the hotel, I have to say everyone we encountered treated us like we were old friends and frequent stayers at the hotel. this hotel and staff truly made our first trip to New Orleans a great one, and a very memorable one. Had we not been fortunate enough to get a reservation there, we would have had to stay the full 4 nights at the other hotel we were booked at, and that would have resulted in a very bad time in New Orleans. Thank you Hotel Monteleone for an outstanding weekend! Monique and Iriana, you two are the best and we can't thank you enough for all you did to help us!

Now, this is where the problems begin. The bar at the pool does not open until they feel like it. The service is slower than molasses and the UP-CHARGES BEGIN...If you buy a beer it may cost $7.50, plus an automatic gratuity of 18%, plus s New Orleans tax, plus a regular tax....wow, that Stella just got up to over $10.00 dollars. They make you tip whether you get your food in 20 minutes or an hour. Yes, it is that disorganized and that pricey for room service as well! In addition room service hours are limited. They offer a Pet-Friendly hotel but there is not ONE ITEM ON THE MENU FOR A PET! WHY DON'T THEY OFFER ROAST BEEF OR CHICKEN OR ANYTHING FOR A DOG! They charge a $100.00 dollars and than $25.00 dollars per day for the dog. They charge $30.00 a night for parking. The management is friendly but the kitchen is DISORGANIZED and they forget the coffee or the toast or the eggs, etc. Since it was the Thanksgiving Holidays and we wanted to have a traditional Turkey, etc. we went on-line and checked out the hotels and restaurants. We chose the Monteleone because their website offered the Tur-Duckin, a turkey stuffed with duck and chicken. We made reservations and when we arrived no one knew what was going on. It WAS A BUFFET THAT WAS LESS THAN MEDIOCRE AND VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE. It was too late to change and manager came over and showed us the menu and it was nothing like we saw on-line. The next day we talked to the concierge about the menu....and lo and behold she had a TOTALLY DIFFERENT MENU THAN we had! The kitchen staff and the restaurant manager need some serious direction. So, in conclusion, the Hotel Monteleone may offer discounts and pet-friendly but the up-charges are outrageous. In March, I will look for a hotel where all of the charges are up front. The automatic gratuity stinks because the wait staff doesn't care how long it takes. They get rewarded whether they take 10 minutes or 30 minutes. In the bar area, if you are lucky enough to get a seat at the Carousel bar, you get good service. However, if you have to sit at one of the tables, I wish you a lot of luck getting waited on. The staff gathers in the service room and chit-chats with each other. We were there for 5 nights and believe me, it became a joke.

It has a heated pool, decent gym facility, and nice roof top views. There is a carousel bar in the lobby that is unique and the lounge is a nice place to hang out at night. Negatives: There is an extremely late check in, 3:00-5:00. They will check your bags for you but if you are coming off a long flight then you won't have a chance to shower before heading out. The rooms are very small and are not what is expected for a four star rating at all. As if that weren't enough, the concierge, Eva, was not only ignorant but couldn't be bothered to assist people when needed. Her favorite reply to everyone who calls, \"I'm on the other line long distance and I have to call you back.\" She did this to us several times and answered the phone to other guests while we were standing in front of her. This is also including the time when she was 'busy' chatting to a coworker. Each time we asked for a recommendation for a restaurant, her responses were vague and not helpful at all.

We paid extra for the preferred king room, my sister and her husband did not. Our first room, on the 10th floor, was okay, but as soon as we started unpacking we noticed it was a connecting room, and we could hear EVERYTHING from our neighbors...whispering, coughing, sneezing.... everything. We went down to the front desk to ask for another room, preferably not connecting. They said all rooms that are preferred king are connecting. (Really? Weird.) We asked if we could get a room with no one in the next room, and they graciously agreed as the hotel was not full. Our second room, a corner room on the 11th floor, also a preferred king, was substantially bigger, I mean really much bigger. So I guess there are preferred preferred rooms? Our first room was about the same size as my sister's standard. Everyone who worked at the hotel was very pleasant and friendly. I called the concierge the day before we left to see about getting a bottle of champagne for the room ( I didn't like the choices and the prices, plus the service fee/taxes/tip that bring the cost way up. We are very particular as we own a wine store.) He suggested a wine shop nearby, which was really nice of him. The Carousel bar is fabulous, we had drinks there two nights. We also really enjoyed the rooftop pool area and bar, even though it is rather a small space. Okay, I am a light sleeper. Even without noisy neighbors, we overlooked a street trumpet player who played much later in the evening than I stay up. Also, our bed creaked horribly, until we shoved a pillow between the bed and the backboard. Also, we could hear guests stumbling to their rooms after a wild Bourbon Street night. Yes, this is New Orleans, and not unexpected. I only say this because I discovered an i phone app for white noise that I am going to use all the time now when I travel!!! It was great! I did get a kick out of the fact that the bathroom was so small the toilet actually sat somewhat sideways to fit. The last day we were there they had a meeting going on, and some meeting rooms are on the top floor (15?) We were on the eleventh. This meant long waits for the elevator, then they would come to our floor and be too jammed with people for us to get in. This happened multiple times. I don't really see how this problem could be fixed, as it didn't seem that other sets of elevators went up to this top floor. Also, one day we consulted the concierge for restaurant suggestions, then asked them to make the reservation for us. When we got to the restaurant, no reservations. The restaurant was rather snotty, and said our concierge never called. We used our cell to call the concierge back, then handed the phone to the restaurant. They argued back and forth about whose fault it was, the restaurant blaming the hotel. We didn't really care, we just wanted to eat! It was weird, but we felt it really was more of the restaurant's fault, especially instead of them just saying \"sorry for the mix up, we can squeeze you in.\" They said \"if it was indeed our fault, we apologize.\" Anyway, great service, nice people, fun, funky old hotel, would recommend and will be back.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA Great Experience!\u201d", "Author": "CLK08", "ReviewID": "UR81336243", "Content": "We were in New Orleans for a conference and stayed extra for a little R&R, and The Hotel Monteleone could not have been more perfect for both.

This is also is a plus when shopping you can drop off packages readily or freshen up vs hotels in CDB or other outlying areas. The carousel bar rotates completely around 4 times/hr is unique and a must. The bartenders are cordial and professional but not real personable.

Being a weekend in the summertime, our rates were $109 for the 1st night and $99 for the second night - you'd be hard pressed to find anything else of this quality for those prices. Highlights of this hotel: smooth check-in and check-out (front desk staff is very friendly and professional...we arrived quite early, but they took our info, allowed us to store our bags, and called us when our rooms were ready), rooms are very clean, nicely decorated, and have fantastic showers and beds (as others have mentioned, yes, they are small, but most historic properties have this issue...how much time are you actually spending in the room?), location is ideal...still within the FQ, but away from the chaos (be sure to wander across the street to the Mr. B's Bistro for a meal or drink...also Royal St. has many antique shops and fun, little boutiques), proximity to a really great bar...you have the Carousel Bar right in the lobby (it really is as special as you may have read in any number of travel guides...there's just a very nice vibe there. Although the actual carousel is the prime seat in the house, we preferred one of the tables for two by the windows overlooking Royal Street - a prime people-watching spot). We really only had one negative experience at this hotel at that occurred at the rooftop pool. First of all, be aware that this pool is VERY small and VERY crowded...we're talking so crowded that you can barely move in the water. Chairs and chaises are plentiful, but with so many people gathering there, it's almost impossible to find a spot to even put your belongings. Our issue involved the small poolside bar. There was only one bartender on duty and when my husband went up to the window to grab a couple drinks, this server continued to take orders from others, even though my husband had been waiting patiently for some time. At one point he told my husband, \"I'll be with you next,\" and then proceeded to clean counters behind the bar and then turned and once again, waited on female patrons who had lined up. The minute my husband turned around to leave, the guy dropped everything he was doing and then offered to wait on him, even calling across the pool area - it was just crazy; obviously he was playing games. What's that all about? Now normally, we would never do this, but after that treatment (and in protest to the bizarre bartender) my husband went to the nearby Unique Grocery (yes, that's the name), bought a few beers, and brought them up to the pool area where I was finally able to get a table and chairs. Now, we are generally rule-followers and understand the protocal behind not bringing in outside beverages, but after wasting 20+ minutes at the bar and then receiving that treatment, we didn't think twice about our \"crime.\" Other than this, we had a wonderful stay and would recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201ccomfort place\u201d", "Author": "sannenaeie", "ReviewID": "UR73121740", "Content": "We got there and we were checked in early just as we requested.

I would have given a higher rating had the service not been so horrible. After a grueling morning of traveling, we arrived at the hotel around noon excited to shower and take a nap. The clerk who checked us in told us that the only rooms they had immediately available were very small. If we were willing to wait 1-2 hours, then she could put us in a larger room. After 2 hours and still no call from her, we returned and asked her if a larger room had become available. She obliged and finished checking us in. We were surprised, then, to discover that our room was one of the smallest in the hotel, judging by the floor plan on the back of the door (and the undeniable fact that the room was, well, very small). I called the front desk and asked to be switched to a larger room and was told (by a different employee) that all the larger rooms had already been booked up for the weekend, and that this is the size room that we had booked. Strike 1. The next day, in search of lunch, we asked the concierge to recommend a nearby Mexican restaurant. She referred us to the Country Flame, which smelled like a bathroom and whose food turned out to be awful. Later, at a shop down the street, the proprieter overheard us talking about \"the most disgusting restaurant we've ever been to\" and immediately guessed that we went to the Country Flame. She said it is widely known to be the worst restaurant in the French Quarter! When we complained to the concierge, we got an indifferent response as well as \"We eat there all the time!\" We tried another staffer, who cringed and said, \"Oh god, I have no idea why she would send you there! That place is horrible!\" and fetched the manager. Surprisingly, the manager was the most unsympathetic of all. Suppressing a smirk, he told us that it's not the hotel's responsibility to pick restaurants and that we should have looked at the menu and decided whether or not to eat there. He was completely unwilling to accept any fault on behalf of the hotel or the concierge, and offered nothing to compensate us for our poor hotel experience and (by now) upset stomachs. We explained the irony of having found excellent restaurants on our own up to that point...some of the best meals we've ever had, really...and now the one time we ask HIS concierge to recommend a place to eat, we get the worst meal of our lives. His blank, indifferent stare said it all. Our very small room was clean and the hotel is in a good location.

We didn't eat in the hotel at all. For vegetarians, pretty much the only place to get a decent meal in the quarter is Green Goddess on Exchange Place, but you have to be careful what you order, because the portions can be small. The whole French quarter is just 7 x 12 blocks so pretty much everything is in walking distance to the Monteleone in general - no car needed or desired. Taxis are also easy to get. We took United Cab wherever we needed to go and the arrived just minutes after calling every time- super punctual. There are cabs always outside the hotel as well. Agree was a bit taken a back by the smallish size of the room and bathroom, but judging by how cramped New Orleans is for space and the comments on this site in general - I think it is par for the course.

The lobby is beautiful and opulent. Behind that entrance is a perfectly acceptable three star hotel, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a luxurious 4 or 5 star hotel -- it is not. But the location is outstanding on beautiful Royal St. and if you'd like to spend time in the French Quarter and be close to Canal St. and the St. Charles streetcar line, and if you insist upon an outdoor pool, you cannot do much better. Check-in staff is perfectly fine, but they don't go above and beyond. They simply check you into the hotel. One nice aspect of the hotel is the choice of three elevator bays. Any one of the bays will help you to your floor and the separate bays ensured that I never waited too long for an elevator, and I was never greeted with an overcrowded elevator. Rooms have their pros and cons. Let's start with the cons: First, the typical room is quite small . . . as small as New York small when it comes to hotel rooms and really a bit smaller than most NY rooms I have enjoyed. There is decent bedding, but no duvets. But what bothered me most about the room was the lack of drawer space. There was one dresser near the television and it had three half-size drawers - fine for one person, insufficient for two. On the plus size, there's a free safe in the room, the A/C worked well, and there's a 32 inch flat panel tv in the room. Also, the room is very attractively decorated. Bathrooms were also very small, there's very little counter space and the shower does not feature a curved shower bar frequently seen these days, making the shower seem even smaller. That being said, water pressure is great. The rooftop gym is pretty nice and features wonderful views of the city. When the sun hits, it can be hot in there but not awful. There are a handful of treadmills, a few ellipticals, a couple of bikes and some weight machines. There's also cold water and apples. The machines are in good shape. The pool area is nice, but really small for the hotel. But note that this is a very common problem in New Orleans. Almost every hotel pool in New Orleans is small and the Monteleone pool is bigger than many. But on two of my four days at the hotel, I arrived after lunch to find no chairs available (the other days I didn't go to the pool). I'm not necessarily saying this is a problem with the hotel. I'm simply saying that if you stay at the Monteleone and the pool is important to you, either arrive early or don't be surprised to find it overcrowded. Also, the pool itself was very crowded so don't expect to swim. Also, there was some garbage in the pool both days and no one seemed to care to clean it up. That being said, drink service at the pool was efficient. The Carousel bar might have been the highlight of the hotel. It was a happening spot where the seats at the main bar rotate slowly around the bar (it's a carousel). Four nights a week there's a very good piano player/singer who plays until about 1:00am and the bar closes about 1:30 (at least on weekends). As for service, my lone experience when I was relaxing in the room in the early evening before going out. The tv picture was pixelating such that there was no real picture, as it had done that same morning. So I called the hotel staff and I was told that this problem simply happens sometimes. I asked if it was a hotel problem or just a problem with my room and the person told me that it was probably hotel-wide, and didn't offer to have anyone look at it. I didn't care that much because I really wasn't watching much tv at all - I'm in New Orleans - but staff at a 4 star hotel would have been more willing to help. My other interactions with staff revealed that they're friendly enough, but I didn't experience anyone willing to do more than is barely necessary. So overall, I think the Monteleone is fine, but I say that with reservations. If you want to be in or close to the French Quarter, if you really want an outdoor pool and you want a more old school hotel, this might be the right choice for you. Don't get me wrong - the hotel is fine, it's just not anything more than a 3 or 3 1/2 star hotel.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "LplusP", "ReviewID": "UR65516217", "Content": "We just returned from a five day stay at this hotel.

They provided plenty of clean towels every day. The view was basically of a wall, which is also typical of hotels in this area, but since little time is spent in the room, it doesn't matter. We met friends in the Carousel Bar downstairs for Sauzeracs. If you've never had a Sauzerac, a word of warning: It's basically rye whiskey and it's really strong. We couldn't have more than a few sips and we were done! This bar is busy all the time, by the way. Ask for a drink list, and they do have excellent martinis. We also used the fitness facility every morning, but it was not very well equipped, unless you're into cardio. They have 4 treadmills, a few ellipticals and bikes, four weight machines (like a bicep curl machine), and a balance ball badly in need of inflating. There are NO WEIGHTS whatsoever, so if you want to do strength training, bring your resistance bands with you. They have a water machine, small towels and apples. It's on the top of the hotel, with windows all the way around, so it gets very hot. It was also very crowded every morning from 6 to 8:30 a.m., but I never waited more than 5 mins for a treadmill. Also on this floor is the pool, with a small snackbar/bar. We spent a few hours there one afternoon, and it was super crowded and the one bartender was superslow. One thing to note: The elevators took forever. However, all the crowdedness and elevator slowness was probably due to the fact that the hotel was at 100% capacity. They had excellent coffee in the Logo Shop. We had breakfast one morning in the cafe, and it was excellent as well. Now for notes on what we did while we were in Nola: On Friday afternoon, after leaving the Carousel Bar, we walked a few blocks to the Napoleon House for Pimms Cups, then up to Decatur St (the main drag, just a few blocks away) and stopped in a \"To-Go Drinks\" bar for daiquiris to sip while we continued to walk around and get the lay of the land. We ended our evening with oysters at Felix's (very good, and no wait, unlike the long line across the street at Acme Oyster House). We walked back to the hotel on Bourbon St (just one block over from the hotel). On Friday, we met our group at the Gazebo Cafe for drinks and appetizers, then crossed the street to the Riverfront and took in the music at the various stages set up for the festival. Great food and drinks were available at all the vendor booths set up as well. We also hit the French Market, but all we bought were beads (only $3). That evening, we ended up on Bourbon St., and we listened to blues music at the Funky Pirate and then headed over to The Beach (a bar), where the main attraction is riding a mechanical WHALE. Very funny, especially if it involves someone very drunk who is not yourself! On Sat., we took the streetcar up to the Garden District and followed a walking tour in our Frommer's Guide that takes you past the most beautiful mansions, many in the Italianate or Greek Revival design. My husband was most interested in the Archie Manning house, which was the least grand of them all. We had the BEST sushi at the Sake Cafe on Magazine Street -- we definitely recommend this if you like sushi. On Sat evening, we wanted to go to El Gato Negro for Mexican, because the waiter at Felix's had said that they had the best guacamole. Unfortunately the festival had just ended for the day, and there was an 1 1/2 hours wait. We ended up next door at the Louisiana Pizza Kitchen, and this was just fine. The pizza was excellent, and they had a good selection of wines by the glass. We then went to Cafe du Monde for beignets and cafe au laits for dessert. It was much less crowded at this time of day (in other words, there was a short line to wait to get in). But service was fast, and it's a classic Nola thing to do. I love sweets and was really looking forward to this, but to be honest, I didn't think they were all that great. They were good, but not as amazing as the guide books tell you. On Sunday, we went to the WWII Museum, the only one of its kind in the country. If you want an indepth learning experience, this is excellent. My husband looked at and read every single thing in that museum. I don't have as big an interest in it as my husband does (he's really into all the military tactics and strategy, etc.), but I found the more personal things interesting, such as the diaries and letters that soldiers sent back home. One case in the Pacific Theatre section displayed a letter a soldier had written to his young boys for Christmas, the Valentine's Day letter he'd writtten to his wife, the telegram 2 weeks later informing her of his death, and the photo he'd carried of her and their three children. The letter to his sons just blew me away. For a Christmas present, he asked his sons to ask their mother every day what they could help her with, since he couldn't be there to help her. And he explained that he couldn't be home with them for Christmas because he was fighting a very bad bully who was hurting people who were weaker, and that he hoped they would always be brave enough to stand up against bullies on behalf of younger and weaker kids. It was such a wonderful gift and example that he gave to his children. We also had dinner at Arnaud's on Sunday night, but we didn't think it was as amazing as we'd been told it would be. The lesson we learned was not to go to the places the guide books tell you to go to. Avoid those touristy places and just go to the little out of the way places that you stumble across instead. Those were the best ones! Basically, we never had to take a cab. The location of this hotel was great, the service and food was good., and it was easy to learn your way around.

In general, I found the service to be sorely lacking for what I expect from a luxury hotel. Our trip started out with check in, where I was a little surprised that there weren't bellmen around to help with our bags. The following morning, I went to speak with the concierge about scheduling some tours and restaurant reservations. When I had called the concierge prior to our trip, I had been told twice that there was no need to book any tour or restaurant reservations in advance. That is why it was very aggravating to then speak with the concierge in person, who refused to help guide us with recommendations or help with reservations other than to give us a Grey Line Tours brochure. Sure enough, we called Grey Line and they were booked for the tours we wanted, and the restaurants that I had mentioned to the concierge over the phone prior to our arrival were also largely booked. One night, we went for a drink at the Carousel Bar, and were treated really poorly by our waiter. Finally, housekeeping was a disaster. Each day, something new would be missing after housekeeping came through, and we would only realize it the next morning when it was too late. One day it was shampoo and conditioner. One day it was coffee. One day it was mouthwash and body lotion. Even worse though was that when we did actually call to get any of these items replaced, the orders would get lost. I literally had to call 4 times between about 9 PM and 9 AM the next morning to get body lotion and mouthwash delivered, the only time that we were able to notice that something had not properly been replaced before we needed it the following morning. By about midway through our 7 night stay, we decided that we would use the hotel services as little as possible. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, we didn't ask the concierge for help with plans and we didn't go back to the carousel bar.

The Carousel Bar is a lively New Orleans gathering place that serves excellent drinks and the hotel breakfasts are superb. Yes, the rooms in this older hotel are small, but clean and well appointed. If you prefer good service, from the concierge desk and the thorough but unobtrusive housekeepers, to the liveried doorman and bell staff, this is a hotel you will enjoy.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great Bar\u201d", "Author": "mrmeryl", "ReviewID": "UR52092857", "Content": "We had a good time at the Monteleone.

The hotel lobby, bar, and communal rooms are beautiful. This is an old hotel, with a lot of traditional features and fixtures, and a lot of charm from it's history. However the down-side of the history, and of the lovely communal rooms is that in the old days beds were smaller, and so were guest rooms. The guest rooms are very small in this hotel, and with a king bed there is no space. The fixtures in the rooms are fairly shabby in places too. The TV is a massive old thing without any free channels really. The bathrooms are a little tired. It's all a bit 'poky'. The main problem however is the lack of double-glazing. This meant that the room I had on the first night - facing the street and on the fourth floor, was ok in terms of size, but the noise was unbearable. I didn't sleep at all. I moved rooms the next day, but some colleagues of mine didn't, and they were all kept awake if they had street facing rooms - even one colleague on the 11th floor - the floor above the floor of my replacement room in the interior of the hotel. I will always think that an independent hotel, especially one with history and charm, is better than a faceless corporate clone.

We started off in a room on the 4th floor on the Iberville side of the hotel. It was really very small (and we are used to hotels in NYC and London) but nicely appointed. We got quite a bit of regular street noise, which wasn't too bad. But then on several nights there was a band playing in the road on that side of the building. One night it went on until 11pm and then stopped, the previous night (according to members of our group who arrived a day earlier) it went on well past that and one of them requested and was given a room change. Other nights we weren't disturbed, but on our last night it started up again and was extremely loud. We requested a room change and they complied, and brought keys for our new room up to our old room while we packed up. When we got to the new room on the 9th Floor on the Bienville side of the hotel and it was a completely different world! Much larger room, very quiet and with a great view of the river. So I'd say it was critical where your room is located in this hotel. Otherwise - the hotel itself is in a great location - very near French Quarter attractions and restaurants with a great Cafe Beignet just two blocks away for breakfast. I also liked the mini maps of the area they give you with your key cards. The Carousel bar was nice as well.

The city itself is fabulous: great food, great people, great atmosphere. I was hoping that the Hotel Monteleone would provide a great way to experience all the city has to offer. The first thing that I can say is that this is a historic hotel somewhat reminiscient of a stay at the Hotel Del. The rooms, while nicely updated and furnished, still have different characteristics than the standard hotel rooms of today. That means odd shaped hallways, odd shaped bathrooms, different size standard rooms, and different architecture throughout. Some people will find this attractive while others will not. Be sure that you do not mind this feature before you book, as it could be a deal breaker for some. To myself, the hotel, especially the lobby and carousel bar, are amazing. I love the hisotrical feel and look of the hotel. The style is almost a shock to the senses after having spent so many nights in plain \"modern\" hotels. It should be mentioned that the hotel has done a nice job of maintaing the structure itself and has provided some modern ammenities (definitely use the workout room and roof-top pool, if only for the view). The service itself is excellent. We were graciously assisted in every aspect of our visit, from check-in to check-out. There was always a helpful hand to help out.

Filet mignon and crab-stuffed shrimp were excellent. The location is great as well. Just a jump away from Bourbon St. (without all of the noise) and located right off of Canal St. the hotel is very easy to locate. It should also be mentioned that the hotel is located on Royal St. which becomes St. Charles St., so it is very easy to hop on a street car and head off to the Garden District (which is fabulous).

I thought my room and bathroom were very cute and my view overlooking the city and the river was awesome. There was an in-room safe, and the maid left chocolates and a mini-weather forecast every night. The work out room was much bigger than expected, with multiple ellipticals, treadmills, stairsteppers, etc... all NEW and with individual TVs. They even had free apples in the exercise room. This hotel was an absolute steal at $100/night. I even got a free drink when I checked in... the bar is very cool with a \"bar-go-round\" that actually rotates. Anyway, the only two things I can complain about are: 1) my husband wasn't there and 2) the in-hotel restaurant was expensive and not worth it. Other than that, I really liked this place and would definitely stay again!", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "ladena", "ReviewID": "UR38173055", "Content": "Absolutely wonderful experience here!

The room was, as always, nice albeit small but the bathroom had almost zero counter space. Worse, the sink faucets leaked water all over what little counter space there was. Also, the shower head sprayed water all over the ceiling until I tightened the connection myself. As I had also found in the past, the TV offered electronic checkout but it did not work. Apparently it is not hooked up even though it is on the screen menu. There was one long line in the lobby for both check-in and check-out. After waiting a while, I simply left (the concierge said it was OK to do so) but I, of course, never got the zeroed out statement that I would have preferred.

It was convenient to have the car ready for us when we needed it. I brought my laptop, but didn't log on to the hotel's server, which I think was about $10 day. Gerard the doorman was very friendly and my kids looked for him every time we left. The room size was fine. We have been traveling the US all summer and a few more square feel isn't much of a difference. Our room was in the Iberville tower on the 9th floor. We had a gorgeous view of the Mississippi and would watch the ships leaving port. Unfortunately, our side of the hotel also sat above two huge ventilation fans on top of the building below. The ac fan was constantly running in the room to keep the heat under control. The fan was very loud, and on the second day, I turned it off for a moment of quiet, which is when I notice how loud the fans on the building below were. I sleep with earplugs and the room fan was extremely loud even for me. It was like having a dull roar in the background the entire time. It was so hot though, that I didn't have a choice. It might be different in the other Beinville tower, though. Another thing to consider is the rooftop pool is in the Beinville tower, and we were in the other tower. So, we had to cross the lobby of the fancy hotel each time we went swimming (every day). The pool was fine, but not too many young kids (good for adults, but no much for kids). One of the in-pool lights was coming loose, so the maintenance needed some attention. The view was amazing. There is an area around the corner from the pool which is where I would have hung out, if I didn't have my kids. Everything was in walking distance, including street cars.

Very safe area. Close to Canal Street and trolley stop, but on same street as famous French Quarter antique shops and restaurants. Easy walk to Bourbon Street and Jackson Square, but far enough so you didn't get the stench and noise. We were able to walk the entire French Quarter handily from this hotel, and it was a stone's throw away from Harrah's and the central business district. Hotel amenities: The hotel is gorgeous. Every corner of the lobby is breathtaking. The Carousel bar in the lobby is hands-down a New Orleans gem. Bartenders were some of the best in the business and the experience of slowly revolving while socializing is great! Free peanut mix and fun oldies music too! Elevators worked just fine, and had no issues with check-in/check-out. They even let me check in very early. Hotel pool is on roof with pretty cool views. The decor on the roof is much nicer than most hotels, great lounge chairs, free towels, and a great bartender making reasonably priced and yummy drinks! One complaint is that the pool needed more frequent cleaning, and the water temperature in the pool was rather warm (esp considering the air temperature is over 90 degrees!). So not exactly refreshing but the whole pool deck was great. Hotel room: Very decent size for a downtown hotel in any city.

This was our 3rd stay in New Orleans, but 1st at Monteleone Hotel. I am a very faithful and loyal Trip Advisor contributor and user, but I sometimes wonder about the reviews written. I'm a New Yorker from birth and we, New Yorkers, can be extremely demanding w/ high expectations at times in regards to fast and prompt service. I write all of that to state, I think many of the reviews I read on this hotel a few months ago in prep for choosing a hotel are very unreasonable, to state the least! Based on the previous reviews, we were so worried about the size of the rooms, that we booked several rooms based on the reviews about the lack of space. That was unnecessary, if you request a large room, they will accomodate. For such a large festival, and the volume of guests, they placed us appropriately according to group size. So our 4 friends from Massachusetts, were placed in a very large room, Room #459, and my friend and I were placed in Room #440, great for no more than 2 people and maybe a small child. In regards to the service in the hotel, I felt that it was up to par with a 4.5 Star hotel. At the rooftop pool, the young men constantly cleaned the water, and re-arranged the towels after other guests left. They were prompt with the drink orders and food service. The fitness gym was up to date with fairly new equipment and was clean. The spa services were fairly reasonable compared to NY prices, and the spa staff, Jennifer and Marie, were very lovely. Our housekeeper, Marisol, was wonderful! She even cleaned our room one day way later than she should have b/c we had the privacy sign on the door until 1pm. Anything we called housekeeping/guest services for, we received promptly! We called and asked if it was ok to remove the items in the mini-bar so that we could store our food, and they explained, as I had thought, that we would be charged, so they offered to bring up to our room a mini-fridge! That was a wonderful touch b/c it's so hot & steamy down there, that we were always in need of cold beverages. And Randy, the Doorman, was excellent, and was always happy to assist us in hailing a taxi. By the way, the hotel AC was always kicking! Our room was always cold, sometimes too cold, but I'd rather have that as opposed to not enough AC! The Carousel bar was wonderful! The drinks were strong and reasonable, $6 for a Tom Collins! The piano singer was hilariously fun and accomodating of special requests! Parker, the bartender is a Rock Star! I was so nervous about eating at Le Cafe for breakfast b/c of the extremely picky reviews! But I must say, that for $15.50/person, the food was great! The omlette station, and the menu was above standard. For the great taste, quality, and service in Le Cafe, I would have expected to pay at least $25 or more. I kept going to Harrah's for the breakfast buffet, which is great, but the hour long line sucks! So for basically the same price I could have spared the heat and lengthy wait, and eaten downstairs. Thanks to my fellow extra picky Trip Advisors, I missed out on breakfast @ Le Cafe everyday of my trip until the last b/c I was so wary!! Unwarranted and Unnecessary! I know that we're in a recession, but don't be so cheap and picky, if you thought that this was expensive, then maybe you should be staying at the Hampton Inn, Travelodge, Motel 6. I'm not discriminating, b/c I have stayed at all types of motels/hotels nationial/international, and you get what you pay for. During a large festival or convention, the larger chain hotels suck b/c of the sheer volume. The taxi stand looks like a block party! The W is overrated in NOLA, the rooms are small, the rate is awful, and folks stay there strictly to be seen and see others! They don't even have a Bliss Spa there! The Loews was an option, based on other Loews that we've stayed at, but the rate was really high, and it wasn't in the French Quarter. The Provincial, Drury, and Homewood Suites are good as far as location on Poydras, if you have an event at the Superdome and you may want to walk! But all of the fun is in the French Quarter! We ate at the Gumbo Shop, which must be a local spot, Court of Two Sisters, Praline Connection, Mother's, and Messina's at the Riverwalk mall! All were absolutely wonderful! In regards to the Cajun Creole Cuisine, us, Northerners/Yankees, are not used to: Everything being Fried, Multiple Carbs on 1 Plate (biscuits, grits, fries, and bread), lack of a Pork alternative like Turkey/Beef Bacon & Sausages, and lack of Salads! LOL! We love it, it's like a guiltless food holiday, that's what makes NOLA special, but everyone was feeling the lack of ruffage/fiber! My only negative criticism of this hotel, is that there seemed to be several meal trays in the hallways during the late nite. I assume that this was due to a lack of late night service. One night I called to inform guest services at 12:30 am that I counted 5 meal trays alone on the 4th floor, and they had someone come and pick them up! Problem solved.

The drinks were the best in town. (Go Marvin!). We booked through GTA hotels and got a great room rate of $125/night. The only complaint is that coffee isn't available for takeout before 7 am (and I had a conference earlier than that). You can make it in your room but no take out cups!

We had never been to New Orleans, and the hotel was one of the most pleasant, memorable aspects of our trip. We arrived an hour early, and our room was ready, so we were able to check in. The desk clerk, Toya, was friendly and helpful, giving us many details about the hotel layout and services. The garage/parking attendants were also friendly and helpful. The hotel was absolutely beautiful with a gorgeous, lavish lobby. Our bellhop, Ricky, was friendly, charming, and helpful, offering lots of useful information and his services at any time we needed him. Concierge was also warm, welcoming and helpful in giving local restaurant advice. Our executive suite was spacious, clean and offered nice touches\u00e2\u20ac\u201drobes, immaculately folded towels and bathroom accessories, and charming d\u00c3\u00a9cor. We discovered we had forgotten toothpaste when we arrived. I called downstairs to ask if I could buy it in the hotel, and I was told someone would bring some right up. Within minutes, it arrived. I even received a follow-up call to make sure we had received it. When our room was cleaned by the maid service, my clothes I left on the bedroom bench were tidied up! Everything was replaced (soaps, toiletries, coffee, etc). There were always plenty of towels, linens etc. We even returned one afternoon after a long, hot day of sight-seeing to find our robes laid out across our bed!!! Now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury! Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t request a room with a view, our suite looked down on St. Louis Cathedral/Jackson Square, the river, and the French market. The revolving carousel bar was fun, and the piano bar performer was delightful. The bartenders, however, were not as attentive as they could have been. They should have served us a little more quickly instead of focusing all their attention on other patrons. The hotel location was outstanding, within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. It was quiet as well. The doormen were helpful and friendly, and we always greeted us with a smile. The in-room safe was convenient, as well as the bar, although all items were expensive. As a final positive note, I felt extremely safe in this hotel. Of course, not everything can be perfect, although the Monteleone came close. The TVs were outdated. At this price point, I expected flat screen TVs. The cable reception was poor as well. All staff were friendly and courteous; however, there was one exception. I asked a maid how to get to the rooftop pool, and, as she left her cleaning duties to walk us down the hall to the elevator, I heard her say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd NOT good customer service. Aside from these few negative notes, the Hotel Monteleone was perfect, and we plan to return in the spring.

We all stayed at Monteleone. I have not stayed here in over a year, and after reading some of the recent reviews I was concerned that something had changed. In the past Monteleone has been perfect all around. The recent bad reviews make no sense. They must be very picky people or not real reviews. From the moment we walked in every person was very friendly and helpful. Some of us drove in and others flew. Some of us had suites, others basic rooms. We were also a large group of women, so we were high maintenance. I can't think of any service we didn't use. Every person we dealt with had a smile, and got to know us. If we saw a staff member on the street, they would say hello. Even the house cleaning would take a minute to give us advice on where to go and what to do. Concierge was very patient with us. We had many requests, and they did everything possible to meet those requests. On the first day one of the employees heard us talking about trying to get tickets to a concert. Later that day, he called us and told us he found tickets for us. (Thanks Rolando). We never had to do research on what to do, we just had to ask a staff member what was going on and they would rattle off many options. They really took a personnel interest in making sure we had a good stay at the hotel and in New Orleans. I don't understand the people who claimed the staff was unfriendly. Far from it. All the rooms were great. The beds are very comfortable. I know some people feel that the basic rooms are very small. I guess I have seen much smaller in New Orleans. In one of the smaller rooms at Monteleone we had 9 women in the room visiting. A really small room would not fit 9 talking women. (I did hear that 3rd floor rooms are the smallest, but have not been in a 3rd floor room) I stayed in a 2 room suite. It was AWESOME! In the large sitting room there was a 1/2 bath, and lots of seating. We had views of the river and royal street, corner room. The bedroom was a good size and very comfortable. The main bath was very big, with a wonderful shower and a great jacuzzi tub. We also had a more basic suite that is also nice. It is two rooms, but seperated by french doors and just one bath. This suite is also very large and a good place to entertain, but there is one bath and it is basic. Room service was great. They do close early. At 10 pm. But the front desk has a bunch of menus from restaurant that deliever to the hotel. We ordered from one place around 3 am, and got great food delivered in 15 minutes to our room. The pool at the Monteleone is a great place to visit with people, or relax by the pool. It is laid out so you can do either. It did take awhile to get one of our rooms, but we all wanted to be close together. It was not a problem though. They took our cell # and our luggage and called us when the room was ready. Not a big deal. The only other thing about Monteleone is dealing with the different towers, or whatever they are called. For example, a group of us was on the 15 th floor. To get to the Pool we had to take the elevator down to the 14th floor, walk down the hall to another set of elevators and take it up to the Roof. Not a big deal, just confusing at first. I was also impressed with the security at the hotel. Late at night it was great to see a security presence. Location has been mentioned often. If you are going to be up late at night this is very important in The Quarter. Monteleone is a great location for late night, both safety and convenience. Tons of excellent restaurants are right there. It is also great to have a Walgreens next door. There is also a liquor store 1/2 a block away. Can't wait to return.

Right away, I realized that they only cleverly worded High Speed Internet in such a way that you would assume it was included with the high price of the room. Well, we found out very quickly that it would cost $10 per day to use it. Even the Holiday Inn a block up the street gives Free High Speed Wireless Internet. Internet isn't my priority when I am in New Orleans, but it's still a huge issue so I felt I should mention it. My next problem was the room itself. Talk about tiny, I felt like I was in an oversized appliance box. There is very little room to walk in front of the beds, no corner table with chairs, I believe this was a \"Traditional Double-Double\" room. The television was on a swivel type stand that seemed extremely dangerous if moved out, it may even tip over. For the price to stay here, the room should have been a lot larger. Again, the Holiday Inn a block away has larger, more spacious rooms for a better price. Now the Holiday Inn isn't quite as fancy, and the crowd gets a little rowdier there, but it's a much better value in my opinion. I don't feel I should have to pay luxury prices for a hotel just because it's old or historic. The Monteleone offered me nothing that I couldn't get more of elsewhere for less money, and I probably would have had a better time elsewhere. The other thing that stinks is the mini bar - pull something out for more than 30 seconds and they try to bill you for it. I also paid for the room with a debit card and told them to put incidentals on a regular credit card - well they ignored that request and tried to hit my debit card up 3 days after I checked out, without contacting me first to explain what they were charging me an extra $54 for, which of course messed up my entire bank account. I had to dispute the transaction, I still haven't heard from them why they feel the need to charge me even more money. I thought I'd give this place a try, it's supposed to be a 4 star hotel, well, it's 4 star as far as the elegance of the building goes, the elevators are extremely fast, and the rooftop heated pool is nice but the rooms are terribly small and it's not worth the price in my opinion, or the headache they give you over trivial issues. Parking is available, valet service - which reminds me - you should see how these punks treat your vehicle, which they leave unlocked and with the keys inside of, in their garage - racing it around, going from R to D and D to R without completely stopping, things like that. Of course, the security is extremely lax, they let you up to get things out of your car, but there is nobody making sure that you aren't getting into everyone else's car either. Don't keep anything you wouldn't want to lose in the car.

If there is one thing I like, it's the ability to make coffee in our room in the am! The trash also was not emptied two different days. The hotel asks if, in the name of conservation, you would be interested in forgoing the daily linen change. I'm all for that since I can't say I change my sheets every day at home. I figure if there are no beds to be made, you could at least clean the coffee pot and leave some coffee and empty the trash! We keep a pretty neat hotel room so wonder if they are understaffed.

First, the good - The location is excellent. The hotel is located in the heart of the french quarter area -- very close to Burbon St., nice restaurants, bars, etc. The lobby is nice with plenty of places to sit. The front desk staff I interacted with was mediocre at best. I had questions about some of the well known establishments in the area, and they either had no clue what I was talking about or gave me completely wrong information about the location. Here is the bad. It pertains to the particular room I was in, so I would not say this is representative of the whole hotel. However, the service I received may be moreso. I went to use the sink in my bathroom, and there was no cold water. The handle wouldn't turn. I called the front desk, and they said they'd send someone right up. I left the room for a few hours, and when I returned, I noticed the sink still wasn't working. I called the front desk again and explained that nobody had been to my room yet, and it had been a couple of hours. He said he would take care of that right away. I again left the room to enjoy the town some more. When I returned again a few hours later, still nobody had been to my room. So, I called and requested a manager. I explained the situation to the manager and how this was my 3rd attempt to address the problem, and he said it was the first he'd heard of it. He was going to contact the maintenance guy immediately. I explained that I was going out again, and confirmed that I did not need to be in my room. When I returned later, there was a voice mail on my phone. (The manager said he'd leave voice mail with the results.) He said the maintenance man was unable to fix this issue. He said they were sold out, so I couldn't be moved to another room. He said that as a gesture of good will, he would leave 2 breakfast coupons for me at the front desk. The only other thing that was wrong with my room was that it was very warm and I didn't see a way to cool it. There was a thermostat on the wall, which was set at 55, but it was way warmer than that. I did mention this at check out the next morning to the front desk staff and to a manager (not the same one I'd spoken with the night before). The other issue that happened was when I went to check out and get my breakfast voucher. The front desk said they had no record of my issue or voucher.

However, there were a few negatives that really turned me off of the place. The hotel seems much more interested in getting every last dollar from you than being hospitable. For example, the room mini-bars will automatically charge you if you even touch the thing too hard - it took my colleague 45 minutes at the front desk to get that sorted out. Another example - I wanted a plain yogurt from the restaurant instead of the large breakfast. They charged me $6 for a 3-oz (mini) yogurt because they were unwilling to price it a-la-carte. When I complained, they said that they don't make exceptions and I would have to pay the $6 (that would have been nice to know before they gleefully brought me the yogurt). Finally, another issue was the maidservice. I had to call and ask that the maidservice be discontinued because they rearranged everything in the room, including my toiletries and work-papers, to the point that I had difficulty finding things. I was also disappointed to see no recycling bins anywhere in the hotel for newspapers or plastic water bottles. Finally, the gym could have been nice, except that most of the equipment was broken.

My stay at Monteleone was very pleasant and had a great time. However, for the benefit of other travellers I would like to point out what some may want to know, specifically about the room and common areas. I had booked as early as January for a conference I would later decide not to attend. For those who look for the bigger the better, the room was just big enough for the \"very soft\" king bed, a desk and chair and armoire for the television. For those who need a firm mattress for bad backs, you may want to ask for a bed board, although I never called to see if they offer this. The bathroom was also small but efficient for one, probably a bit of a challenge for those who need counter space. Plenty of mirrors though, I suppose to make the bathroom appear bigger than it really is? The room was fairly quiet, and had no trouble sleeping, although I could hear the muffled conversations of the guest nextdoor who had a small yapping dog. The window view was not particularly good; completely of rooftops and side of buildings, but who stares out the window anyway? The location was very convenient to Canal St, Bourbon St., all of French Quarter, Walgreens across the way. They also have a spa on the premises which I took advantage of for a facial and body treatment and asked to be charged to my room. The night before, they slipped a copy of my bill under the door and I found a charge from the spa that was not mine. The spa corrected the charge easily and I asked for an updated copy of my bill at the frontdesk. There are 2 restaurants, one for breakfast and lunch and the other for more elegant dining, I did not eat at either as there are sooo many places to chose from in FQ. The bar lounge has a fun carousel seating that turns slowly around, very unique to sit in for a drink. I did not view the rooftop pool or the fitness room. All in all, I would recommend this boutique hotel because of the location and price and staff. Kudos to their maid and bell service as well. I may add though that weather right now is extremely humid and I'm told the best months to go is early spring time as this is a walking town and much more enjoyable if your not sweating as soon as you exit the lobby.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mississippi", "Title": "\u201cGood stay.

Close enough to walk everywhere but far enough to avoid the noise of Bourbon St. The style, as mentioned here is more Old World...kind of on the feel of a Waldorf or Fairmont. We have a tendency to prefer contemporary or \"boutique-y\" hotels but the Monteleone really gives you a flavor for the history of the area. The lobby is very pretty and the staff very attentive and professional. If I had one complaint, I would make sure to ask what actually qualifies as a deluxe room. After reading the reviews here, I was sure to book the largest, nicest room category available below a suite. I'm not 100% sure we got what we reserved because the room was still quite small. It was a true King sized bed and there was enough room to barely make our way around but it was still small with only a very tiny peak of the river from our 6th floor room. The room and bathroom were immaculate however, seemingly recently painted. I usually bristle at ornate drapes and lots of fabrics in a hotel room but it was true to the French influence in the city and everything was fresh and dust free. Our view consisted of rooftops and buildings. As opposed to the comment on this board of noisy surrounds, we were quick to notice almost no noise (one of our main criteria for judging a hotel). That might have been because we faced away from the main street but we also heard no plumbing sounds or disturbances from the neighbors. That said, we spent very little time in the room. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the Monteleone was the lovely rooftop pool. A nice perk in a hot city. We would spend our day out and about, relax with a book poolside in the afternoon and then head out to the FQ for the evening. It made the day truly relaxing.

This was my second stay at the Monteleone and it was just as good as the last time, just with some bumps in the road. The staff is very nice and the property is clean (and the lobby always smells like fresh flowers which I just love!). This time we booked directly through the hotel and got the cheapest king deal that they had. My only recommendation is that if you are booking direct, get upgraded and don't take the standard/base rate King if you want a little more room. The room was itty bitty, but that's fine with us, we're in New Orleans and just happy to have a clean and safe place to rest at night. The only other problem was the walls were like paper and we could literally hear the two ladies next door speaking like they were right next to us and you could tell that they were speaking in reasonable levels. This was strange, because my last stay with some friends, our room was right near the elevator and we never heard a thing, so perhaps parts of the hotel were constructed at different times??? We asked for late check-out and the best they could do was an extra 30 minutes, so perhaps they had a large convention or its hotel policy, I was only upset by it because I just didn't want to leave :) It was fortunate that we did check out late because when my husband went to check out someone had used our room number to buy breakfast at the restaurant. The front desk was polite and the charge was promptly removed when we explained it was not our charge, so when you leave I would most certainly check out at the desk and look over your bill instead of automatic check out. In any case, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit New Orleans. Our visit wasn't perfect, but it was fun and the staff at the Monteleone was wonderful.

I would not recommend the Monteleone for anyone traveling with children (heck, I wouldn't recommend New Orleans for anyone traveling with children.) However, it is a very romantic hotel and perfect for a couple's getaway. Just one word of caution, don't go to the Monteleone without expecting to spend a lot of money. We had room service for breakfast one morning. Two simple breakfast entrees and a pot of coffee came to $52.00 including tip. Also, the Carousel Bar is definitely not for the budget consious. I ordered a glass of \"house wine\" and was surprised to see that their \"house wine\" is $13.00 a glass. I also hear that parking is very expensive, but we have never used a car in New Orleans.

I found a great deal through Travelzoo of $95/nt for Sat.-$85/nt for Sun.-Wed. and was really looking forward to our stay, especially after reading some of the reviews on this site. Our reservation was for a Superior room; however we were upgraded to a Riverview Salon as this was an anniversary celebration. On our arrival, our room was on the 3rd floor and our \"Riverview\" was that of the building next door, literally 5 feet from our window; however being that we had requested a smoking room, we assumed this was the designated floor so not a big issue. The staff had a bottle of champagne waiting for us which we thought a nice touch. The room itself was adequate in terms of size; however one side of the bed was literally almost up against the window, leaving space for only one nightstand on one side. Again, not a huge issue; however it would have been nice if both of us could have had space for our reading material, glasses, etc. So be it, this is an old hotel with rooms in varying shapes and sizes. The bed itself was not comfortable to sleep on - mattress was lumpy and the pillows were tiny. The bathroom was awesome. Glass enclosed shower with terrific water-pressure, and a separate jacuzzi tub, double vanity sinks. The towels were adequate; however not great in terms of size. In terms of my complaints about this hotel: 1. Service of the staff is lackluster. Once we had finished our champagne, the bucket and empty bottle remainded in our room for 2 days - when we put it in the hallway, it took another 24 hours for someone to pick it up. Same with our room service tray from dinner one evening - it stayed in the hallway for a day and a half. Our maid removed our bathrobes with the used towels one morning, and a call to housekeeping for new ones was met with a surly reply of, \"did you hang them on the back of the bathroom door\"? Another time, our ice bucket was not emptied, so we did it ourselves only to find some hair under the plastic liner - we called to get a new plastic liner, along with some extra in room coffee packets, and the reply on the other end of the line was like we had asked for something out of the ordinary. 2. Face to face service was no better - those darn plastic key cards failed to work on a few occasions and upon asking the front desk staff to redo them, we were met with indifferent attitudes about doing so. At NO time did anyone on the staff smile, say thank you, and/or excuse me during our stay. Doormen are too busy chatting with people (especially women headed out for the evening) to open doors or help hail cabs. 3. Do not touch any items in the mini-bar unless you are willing to pay right away as the hotel has a sensory charge system. At those prices anyway, it is better to go to the Walgreens on the next block to buy sodas and munchies. 4. Asthetically, the hotel's lobby and public areas are lovely and well maintained. Rooms however may be a different matter. Ours had a nice hole in the wall from someone opening the bathroom door a little too hard - a simple door stopper could have prevented that from happening. Walls are paper thin - so much so that we were treated one night to our neighbors high TV volume while they were watching a pay per view pornographic movie. In all honesty, since Katrina I am certain the hotel may have issues in finding the staff it deserves, especially since many people have never returned and others are reluctant to move there. It is a shame, as NOLA is a great place, and dependant on tourism/convention revenue for a major source of income. Would we stay here again? Probably so for the price we paid; however this is not a 5* hotel in my opinion and the thought of paying top $$ during high season (Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, etc.) would definetely steer our business to another property.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value - Definitely will return!\u201d", "Author": "KelleyinAustin", "ReviewID": "UR10021922", "Content": "My mother and I stayed at the Monteleone in late September for 2 nights.

The superior room was small, but just fine for myself; for two people it would be a bit too crowded, Upgrading it to the Delux room might solve the problem though. Monteleone is a beautiful medium sized boutique hotel. It was a historical landmark as I fould out writers such as Hemingway and Capote mentioned the hotel in their books. The room was decorated tastefully, simple and elegant. The bathroom was clean and the water pressure was good. The bar had live music from Wednesday to Sunday nights. Some guy was playing a piano and singing when I was there. I liked it. The swimming pool on the roof was small, but had a great view, and the gym was filled with large treadmills facing the river, but no free weights. There was no legit grab-and-go breakfast items: The gift shop offered the vending machine quality pastries and some fresh fruits. There was Cafe Biegnnnet down the block but they were closed for the day. I found it inconvinient since I was in a hurry. Sheraton on Canal st. had Starbucks. I had my morning latte fix picked up there instead. The hotel couldn't be better located. It's on Royal st. which is known for great antique shops. The hotel is sourrounded by the awsome little stores, and yet close to Bourbon st. if you must check it out. Some of the reviewers who stayed at the hotels on Canal st. said their location were good, but if you are not going to drive to French Quarter for late dinner and drink afterwards I can't recommend these Canal St. hotels. \"3 blocks\" in New Orleans wouldn't be as same as walking from the 18th st. to 21 st. street at Gramercy park in NYC.

Our last stay saw us at the LePavillon. We would have stayed there again, but we were unsure about having to walk so many blocks so often. We had heard that security after dark was not as good as it used to be; this turned out to be false. As it was, Hotel Monteleone was every bit as nice as the LePavillon, and smack dab in the center of all Veux Carre! We experienced zero security issues. Our drive in, and down I-10, showed us just a hint of the damage from Katrina. Once we exited onto Orleans Avenue, there was no sign of the hurricane. Miraculously, and even though the danged FQ street signs are on the wrong side for easy viewing, we drove right into the Montelone parking garage. We liked the fact there was a parking facility, even though it cost us $27/day. Once secured, we grabbed our luggage (if they ask if you need help getting to your room, say yes) and headed for the Desk. We booked our rooms straight on Hotel Monteleon website, for $99.00/109.00 a night (we arrived on Thursday). Check-in was easy, and the clerk was very polite. The Concierge is right up front, too, if you need anything. The lobby was grand to say the least. The room was small but immaculate. The furnishing were a tad cramped in our standard king room. You had to practically slide sideways to get between the bed and TV/entertainment system! Still, other than for sleep, who comes to New Orleans to lay around a hotel room;-)? The view of the air conditioning system out the window was even nice. Now, back to the cleanliness. You could eat your soup right out of the bathroom sink if you wanted to. Nice. Not so much as a hair; a CSI team would be left clueless. Lots of towels and amenities. The only dust we saw was around the dry/wet bar under the TV. And, as others have eluded, you don't dare touch any of the cookies and alcoholic beverages located there. If you so much as look at it wrong, you'll find a $4.39 cent charge on your bill. Infrared sensors detect if an item is picked up. No doubt this is why it was dusty! Even the wait staff steers clear! Oh, and the refrigerator didn't cool anyway... Did I mention Hotel Monteleone is right where all the action is? It was a short five or so minute walk over to Decatur Street and Crescent City Brewery, Cafe Du Monde, or the Aquarium. Bourbon Street was just a few over. We experienced very few troubles out on the street, save for the one guy who we kept running into who wanted to talk to me about my choice of footwear... There is a Walgreen's half a block away, as well as a Cafe Beignet; Acme Oyster House is a block over, too. We visited the rooftop pool twice during our stay. It closes at about ten I think, but the bar much earlier. This was a shame. The pool was pretty clean, but had a lot of leaf matter in the water from all the surrounding plants. No biggie. We enjoyed the night up top, but on Friday evening it was overrun by teens who could not comprehend the meaning of \"NO DIVING\". And I'll make it the rest of my life without hearing the phrase \"Marco Polo\" ever again. The pool lacked a sauna, though there may have been one inside someplace (ten extra points to the Le Pavillon in this regard). Everyone we came into contact with at the Monteleon was extremely friendly and spoke fluent English. Our room was always clean and straight very early in the day. The Bell staff was attentive and fast! When you call for luggage help, expect a knock as you put the phone down. We didn't have to ask for much special stuff as it was all there to begin with. We ate breakfast one morning at the Le Cafe. The food was fine and the cost on par with what you'd expect to pay. The servings were filling and, once again, the staff was very friendly. It was close and quick. We did not visit the famous rotating bar, but it was always lively and filled with patrons. A simple phone call and our bags were down in the parking garage. It was a short 25 minute wait for our vehicle (make sure you call ahead before you leave your room). The vehicle was as we had left it. My advice: leave the car there and WALK.

Very nice doormen, garage attendants, maids, etc. 4. Comfortable beds, nicely furnished room. Now for the \"Cons\". 1. The front desk checked in others before us. We were in line. 2. The room smelled musty. 3. The mini fridge is a one door bandit!! It is stocked with candies and drinks and has a very small strip-sign inside saying if you remove the item from the fridge you will be charged. Of course I picked up a can to see what it was and that's when I saw the sign. I immediately replaced the can of candies on the shelf, but was charged on check out even though I didn't open the can or eat the candy. They should put the label on the outside of the fridge so that it can be seen, but then unsuspecting visitors might not check out the fridge and get ripped off. 4.

I would go back to the Hotel Monteleone. Okay, the property is not one of the charming little hotels in the French Quarter (e.g., Cornstalk), but here's all the things it had that those hotels often lack: a good sized room, a great bed, a great shower, and most importantly, quiet. When I stay in New Orleans, I want function in my lodging mostly because if I'm going to lounge somewhere it's going to be in the neighborhood coffee house, restaurant, or bar, NOT in my room. I was there over Mardi Gras season and it was nice to have a safe haven away from the madness. It also has the Carousel Bar, which rotates, but it breaks down if there's too many people. Such is New Orleans. One booking tip- the hotel will match internet rates. So I found a better rate on a travel service (e.g., Expedia or something like that), but booked directly with the hotel at the same rate. If you want food tips: muffaletta at Central Grocery or Johnny's Po'boys; beignets and cafe au lait at Cafe du Monde; and for an upscale meal, I've never had a better meal that the ones I've had at NOLA, Emeril's restaurant in the quarter (try the hickory smoked duck, it's awesome). Tons of great places for music too, but some of my latest favorites: Fritzell's, Sean Kelly's, and One-Eyed Jacks. Finally, we had a great cooking class (Lunch and Learn) at Savvy Gourmet on Magazine; very fun and very tasty. The spirit of New Orleans is alive and well.

Please go back if you've been before and you're wondering what it's like right now. If you've never been, NOLA will not disappoint you. I'll be back as soon as I can! And stay at the Monteleone! I was in room 852, at the end of a quiet hall, in a smaller room (I asked for a quiet room and didn't care about the size) and it was still absolutely lovely. Go on, go for it, you won't regret your stay at the Monteleone or eating, shopping and perhaps drinking your way through NOLA! P.S. I traveled by myself and did not, for even one moment, feel threatened in any way. Everyone went out of their way to make you feel welcome and to assure your return. I live in Houston, so I know better than to wander around by myself in the evenings anyway. I have been to NOLA 4 times before this weekend and really couldn't see any difference in the Quarter, Jackson Square, etc. If you're on the fence about going, I would say do it - it's such a great city. And check out the antique shops on Magazine St (2000 block or so), about a $7 cab fare each way. There are some less expensive shops there, in addition to dress shops, lingerie shops, electic/funky shops too (like Winky's and Up, the store above \"up\"stairs in Winky's.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, LA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "CenlaTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR6453927", "Content": "My husband, son, and I just returned from our annual Christmas weekend in New Orleans.

The lobby was nice but doesn't have the grand feel or very high ceilings that you would expect from 4 star rated hotels. The staff was very polite and well dressed. The hotel was clean but you can tell when walking through the hotel that it's old and has be painted over and over again. I paid extra to get a Deluxe room (largest available before upgrading to a suite) and felt that it was no bigger or nicer than any other hotel room. The bathroom was recently upgraded with marble and granite floors and walls, but they were fairly small. The bed was comfortable and the furnishing were up to date. I paid $119/ night for the Deluxe room. The standard room was available at $89/night at the time I stayed. That is an excellent rate for the French Quarter.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulfport, MS", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "kshenry", "ReviewID": "UR5417563", "Content": "This review would probably be much more favorable had we not stayed at the Wyndham on Canal for our Anniversary last year.

The room was very small, not much larger than the king size bed in it. I called the front desk and was told that no river view rooms were available and that I was in the right room. We did have a nice view overlooking the FQ, but our windows had forehead smudge marks all over them. Yuck. I called the front desk again and requested a refrigerator, which was delivered to our room in just a few minutes by a man named Ceto who was very charming. After walking around we returned to our room to get ready for the evening. I pulled back our comforter and noticed hair on the sheets. It was just too late to change rooms, but that was a first for me. I can say that the convenience of being one block from Bourbon was really nice, especially after spilling something all over my pants and having just a short walk back to our room to change clothes. The Monteleone is right next door to a Walgreen's, and that was extremely convenient. It's also within a short walk to Cafe Du Monde and the Mississippi River. I will also say the room, although so small, was beautifully decorated with an antique look and the hotel as a whole was beautiful, inside and out.

The location was good, but kind of a long walk for little kids to Cafe Du Monde for breakfast. The bellmen and front desk clerks were very helpful. The concierge was okay - she sent us to Bubba Gumps for dinner which was loud, average food and expensive for the quality. I'm sure she took one look at my little kids and thought they could do little damage to that place. One negative was the noise on Bourbon street. Our room was on the 15th floor, but we could still hear revelers at night. BRING A WHITE NOISE MAKER WITH YOU. Luckily, I had brought my trusty box fan which I always use at a hotel to help drown out noises. Also, we had to park our car at a different hotel because Monteleone ran out of parking spaces. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend it for a family. One more point, the French Quarter has changed little just not as crowded and some stores/restaurants are closed. The rest of New Orleans, espcially downtown and east of downtown is strange. It's like a ghost town. Everything is covered in a grey film. Downtown hotels have reopened, but the office buildings and hospitals are are still abandoned with broken windows, many which have not even been boarded up. Abandoned cars sit under the highways. Driving along the highway east of town, entire neighborhoods are abandoned and seem to not have been touched since Katrina. At about 1 in 12 houses, you'll see a white fema trailer out front which is a sign of rebuilding.

The pre-trip research indicated that many of the open hotels in New Orleans were not 100% yet, i.e. either the housekeeping was minimal or the pool was closed. NOT SO at the Monteleone, where everything was great and in full working order! The gracious lobby is large, well lit and welcoming. There is also desk staff on duty 24 hours a day. The front lobby is not wheelchair-accessible, though. The staff were all very polite and cheerful although at least some of the desk staff did not know about the bus that has temporarily replaced the street car. Considering that St. Charles Avenue is very important for tourists, this was fairly important getting around information. The Pool lounge was beautiful and in perfect condition. The staff were great -- as soon as you used your towel after swimming, they came over to offer you another, new towel. The pool was spotless, but small. More for cooling off in than for actually swimming laps. But after a hot day walking around, it was so nice to relax and cool off before dinner, especially with a cool drink from the pool's bar. The hotel's restaurants and bars were open & serving -- unlike many other places that still have not recovered -- although we chose to explore for our meals, and did not eat at the hotel at all. But since the Monteleone is in a perfect location for exploring all of New Orleans, this was never a problem. The Monteleone is on Royal Street, so you are only one block over from Bourbon Street, the heart of the quarter. But that one block also makes a huge difference in terms of noise. Royal St. is generally very quiet and street noise was never an issue. Also from Royal St. it is easy to walk to the rest of the quarter, like Jackson Square, Cafe Du Monde, the French Market, etc. The Riverwalk Mall is also relatively close, as are the buses that go uptown and the streetcar, which is set to reopen soon. The room was large -- two double beds with a large space between them with the normal amount of additional furniture (desk, armchair in the corner, and the large bureau thing for TV, minibar and drawers). Plus a large double closet and two bathrobes! The room was not huge, but we didn't feel crowded once, the entire week. The beds were also very comfortable -- the linens were nice quality, there were plenty of pillows, and the bed was neither too hard nor too soft, as is so often the case in hotels. The bathroom was spotless and quite nice. Brightly lit, all modern fixtures, and great water pressure. Housekeeping came every day and was thorough. These may be things we all take for granted in hotels, but with New Orleans still struggling to recover and rebuild after Katrina, nothing can be taken for granted. We are probably going to go back next year, and will try to stay in the Monteleone again. I also travel frequently for business, and this would be a nice hotel for a business trip, too.

We checked in approximately 6 PM on Sunday, and were told that we were being given a non-smoking room with two double beds. We asked if we could move to a non-smoking king room on Monday. At that point we were told that one of the hotel's buildings was scheduled for power work on Tuesday and that non-smoking king rooms were available and we could have a room in this building and would be moved on Monday morning when a room came free in the other building.

We returned at 3PM and were told that our room wasn't ready and it should be ready by 5PM at the latest. I asked where our luggage was and was told it was still in the original room, and we were told we could return the room until our new room was ready. When we got to the room our cards had been deactivated, so we returned to the front desk and spoke to another clerk who told us that the power was being turned off and there was likely no air conditioning in that building. By this point we were tired and just wanted to rest. He checked again and advised that the room that we were to be given had yet to be cleaned and that they didn't seem to be able to give us another room (even though check in time is 3PM and other people were being assigned rooms). We then told the front desk clerk that we would be willing to pay for an upgrade to a Superior Room . He told us there were none that were clean. To this day, I still do not understand why he was not able to contact Housekeeping and request that they clean a room ... whether if it was the room that was assigned to us or an upgraded room.. By 5PM, I was beyond frustrated and returned to the front desk and spoke to another clerk. She seemed a bit surprised when she looked up my information and had brief conversation with someone else behind the desk. By this point I guessed that the room that had originally been assigned to us had either been given to someone else or was still not ready. We did finally get a new room by 5:30PM on Monday. By that point, I was extremely frustrated by the entire experience and by the overwhelming feeling that my business as a customer was not worth the effort of the front desk staff to resolve things in a reasonable manner. Because of this, we decided to find another hotel as it was unlikely that we would feel comfortable in this hotel. I understand that in some cases, mistakes and oversights occur, but unfortunately, our entire experience during our stay at the Monteleone was one issue after another. The people that we dealt with seemed either unable or unwilling to resolve any of the room issues that we had.

The hotel is a little aged and needs some work here and there. The rooms are nicely furnished, but sort of small and in need of a little cosmetic overhaul. The housekeeping staff could also do a better job cleaning the rooms as not everything in my room was properly dusted and vacuumed. In addition, the front desk staff was very slow while checking in new guests, and not always responsive by answering service calls made from the room.

The Monteleone might have been a great hotel in the past, but now in this century it shows that the hotel has aged and is old. The hotel needs (badly) an overall renovation. The (old) elevators are slow. The rooms are somewhat worn out, have thin walls and are very small with little space to move around. A view out of the rooms window is virtually non existent; maybe a tiny view overlooking Iberville and on some old buildings. The hotel staff does not seem to be very well trained and lacks real professionalism; certainly not that kind of professionalism that is expected standard from a first-class hotel with this high of a rating!

We were told at the desk that they had this room with a window, but no view. Well, when I opened the drapes (room 382) we had a view of the brick wall about 10 feet away. We had a good laugh. The room was very nice but small. The king sized bed (extremely comfortable!) took up much of the room and sitting on the end of the bed you could look up at the tv an arm's distance away. I also used the toilet lid for additional space for my brush and curling iron. The web site pictures are accurate but I thought everything was smaller in person.

You are 1 block from Burbon street (drinking and food for all). A great location to also walk to the Market area in the French Quarter, down to the river and also a close walk to Canal Street (main street). The Carousel bar was unique and right off of the lobby. This bar was normally crowded. The only reason I did not rate the hotel as an excellent was that the bartender was more interested in the three girls at the bar than waiting on his customers. Customers ended up waving him down a few times. On the opposite side of the Carousel bar is another attached bar that is quieter where you can sit and talk easier. I also checked out the pool and workout room. VERY NICE! It's worth a elevator ride up just to check out the view. I read in other reviews that the elevators were slow, not a big deal. I think we opted for the stairs once in our 4 day stay. We didn't eat at the hotel. With all the choices for great food within a walk why would you.

The room itself was spacious and regal in it's colors and textures the appointments all seemed perfectly matched and THE BEDS, MY GOD THE BEDS!! If you are an insomniac please report to the Monteleone immediately. It's impossible to stay awake for long. The bathroom was huge and stately, though it had no fan, and the closet/storage space more than filled the bill. The location, however, was the key for me. Royal Street runs parallel to Bourbon and is less than a minutes walk, but the noise level is incomparable. I loved visiting on Bourbon - but wouldn't want to sleep there. The Monteleone gave us instant access to the best of the N'Orleans buzz but also instant peace and quiet of being just removed from the hyper zone. Perfect, perfect, perfect.

The problems we encountered have more to do with service and organization among the staff. I made reservations for connecting rooms with double beds since we were traveling with our three children and my mother, the day we were to arrive I called to confirm, the front desk person told me that the connecting rooms had already been blocked for us. When we arrived late at night after a long day of travel we check-in and at check-in I remind the front desk person about our rooms, she said that we did have connecting rooms. We lug our stuff and kids to the rooms and they are not connecting. We go back to the front desk and the front desk person says that they show them as connecting (even though they are not) and appologizes and tries to find connecting rooms. She is not able to and informs us that those are the only rooms available for that night, but that she can move us to connecting rooms for the four remaining nights. So, we have no choice but to stay in the rooms since it was almost 1AM. It was hard with three young children and I'm sure we drove the neighbors crazy going back and forth between rooms that night trying to get exhausted, cranky kids settled and the following morning trying to get them ready. The following day we go to the front desk to change rooms and the front desk person says that there has been a mistake and that the rooms are not going to be available the last night of our stay because that entire wing of the hotel is going to have no electricity and there are not connecting rooms in the part of the hotel that is remaining open and that she does not know why the person the night before failed to remember that. So, we take the rooms since we have already wasted a good portion of our first day in New Orleans checking in with the hotel to see of the new rooms were ready and then moving our stuff. The front desk also told us that the new rooms were on the opposite side of the hotel, but that there was a hall that connected the wings on the 10th floor. She failed to mention that there were four steps to get up to the connecting hall and four steps on the other side. It was extremely hard to go up and down those stairs with children and luggage (even though all our luggage had wheels) but we were already so far from the elevators and so close to the other rooms. I also had to spend a good deal of my vacation time calling other hotels trying to find connecting rooms for our last night. I did find them and had a wonderful stay at the Chateau Sonesta (which is THE place to stay if you have kids with you or just enjoy LARGE rooms.)

The lobby of the hotel is beautiful especially the huge grandfather clock at the center of the lobby (great picture spot!). You cannot get a better location in N.O.!! It's in walking distance of everything!! BUT we encountered some specific problems with the hotel service. The first night we were there, my friend noticed a permanent brown stain on the pillow case so she turned it over. The next night we had a pillow fight and as she lifted her pillow the SAME stain was still there! I guess they did not change our sheets. The next problem occured with the doorman. When we arrived to N.O. we scheduled & paid for the airport shuttle on the day of departure. The day we were leaving, the doorman said that we had no reservations for a shuttle, but he can \"hook us up\" with his taxi driver buddy. We kindly thanked him and asked for our shuttle since we already paid for it and it was much cheaper, but all of a sudden he starts to argue with us and begins to yell at one of my friends. Within 5 min. we had a full blown argument on the curb in front of everyone, he threw the reservation tickets at my friend, and with anger he \"allowed\" us to get into the shuttle, while he removed people that did not have reservations. Overall, it's a great hotel, but stay away from the hotel workers!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "June 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairburn,GA", "Title": "\u201cFrench Quarter Perfection\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2153477", "Content": "Our seventh anniversary trip to NO, but our first stay at the Monteleone.

However, I cannot help but compare the 2 hotels, being located only a block and half apart. What's good about the Monteleone is the renovated, albeit small bathroom (no counter space to spread out my toiletries); the tap water doesn't leave your hands slimy after you've washed them; comfy bed w/ turndown service and mint chocolates. And of course, the revolving Carousel Bar is a cool hangout. Here's where it goes a bit awry: street noise and constant garbage truck collection impedes your sleep and serenity; static-ridden clock radio that grates on your ears (I ended up turning it off); no newspaper on your door (you have to walk across the street to buy it yourself?!?); inefficient elevator service. If I was staying here more than just the 2 nights, I'd have asked to change my room to a quieter side.

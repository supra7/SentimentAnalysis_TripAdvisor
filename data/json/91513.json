They even have free dinners four nights a week, which weas very good the evening we took advantage of it. With a large business clientele bas the services were what they needed to be, a comfortable and proferssional business center, unedning flow of coffee, etc. The site is a little remote from downtown in this very large-in-area city but that actually worked well for us -- plus it is close to the shopping ares of the northern quadrant and the arts facilities of adjacent Carmel.

Indy has bad areas, please be aware. This area called The Crossings is a good area and the hotel is located in a pleasant and quiet space, surrounded by trees... very homey and park-like - different from the 'off the freeway-ers'... yet it is 30 seconds from Keystone Blvd and 2 minutes from the freeways. It is about 8 miles or so from downtown, it takes 20-30 minutes to get there.... (Keystone south to River Parkway, turn right to Meridian then left). This is an affluent area, close to Carmel, and 2 shopping malls, drug stores, Target, groceries, a hundred restaurants of all types, Fresh Market, Bonefish Grill, et al. Now, for the hotel. It is an outside access hotel, it's a Homewood Suites not a Hilton. 2 floors, no elevators... stairs. I stay on the first floor, I hear the second floor shoes at times, but nothing from the side rooms. My room is like a 1 bedroom apartment, w/a king bed and a pull out sofa which I haven't used. The bath area is nice. There is a stove, dishwasher, refrig, sink, microwave, 2 flat screen TVs. There is wireless internet and a lot of drawers. My room has been clean and I am picky... not brand new untouched but nice and clean. I stay here versus downtown because I like the staff. They will do whatever it takes to please normal folks... (cranky types seem to be 'cranky' no matter what.. I guess. What is SPECIAL about this Homewood Suites is that their food is demonstrably better.. and it comes with the room. Usually I don't each the 'breakfast' at the free food hotels... I just don't like the quality, but I like the food here. There is a nice breakfast of eggs, meat, potato, cereals, bagels and bread, juices, waffles, yoghurt. There is always fresh fruit, generally 2/3 types and an onsite pay-pantry. Monday thu Thursday they have a nice dinner which is filling and creative. Ex: this week: Potato crusted cod, Rotisserie chicken, Beef Lasagna, Teriaki glazed Asian chicken... all with vegetables, a starch and always a soup and a very nice spinach/lettuce salad with trimmings.There is a comfortable dining and sitting area, a nice laundry and workout roon, a meeting room and a business room, too. There is an outside pool and jacuzzu which I haven't used (closed for winter). I have always been able to get a (free) parking space close to my room. Staying downtown means another $25/day for parking. As someone who stays on an extended basis I am here for a while and can notice things you may not notice staying one/two days.... but I find the stay very pleasant and comfortable and equitable. That's why I give it a well-rounded 5...as I am satisified... and it I wasn't I would go elsewhere.. and I personally like the staff, they are very nice and attentive to making me feel welcome. Just ask them to help you and they will. Oh.. there is a shuttle van to take you anywhere within the area (not the airport)... good when my wife visited and I took the car to work.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hilton Property\u201d", "Author": "cbce1pjb", "ReviewID": "UR120310504", "Content": "I will combine my review of the Hotel and Lucas Oil Stadium.

We called ahead and requested 2 cribs which were set up and waiting for us when we arrived at the room (something we don't take for granted anymore given past experience). We had a 1 bedroom suite and it was plenty of room for the 4 of us. The bathroom was huge, the bed was comfortable, and the rooms have very nice TVs (it looked like a 32\" LCD on the wall in the bedroom). Every imaginable higher end restaurant and department store is within 1 mile of this hotel. Restaurants like Flemings, Ruth's Chris, PF Chang's, Sullivan's, etc all within a 3-5 minute car ride. We didn't go to the Fashion Mall but it looked very nice and was close by as well. The only negative thing that I would give this hotel was the breakfast. I know many reviewers have rated this highly so maybe sampling it on a weekend we hit it at a bad time. Yes, it is certainly a step up from the cereal, bagel, toast options of many 3* and 4* hotels, but that was about it. The hot breakfast was just standard issue cafeteria eggs, bacon, and a waffle maker with patrons lined up 5 deep. The Homewood Suites competes directly with Embassy Suites in the same business niche. I have stayed at both chains several times and this is one area where Embassy is still light years ahead of Homewood.

This hotel was listed as the official hotel with a shuttle to & from the event. My husband & I shared the room with my sister and her husband. The set-up of the room was great. You entered into a living room/kitchen area. There is a small table with two chairs for eating. A fridge, sink, dishwasher, stove top, & microwave, line the wall opposite the door. Our room had a couch & a chair in the living room space to the right and a tv in front of the couch. To the right, beyond the couch, was a doorway into one of the bedrooms. This room just had a (double) bed with a nightstand and a flat screen tv attached to the wall. The other bedroom was more to the left of the living area. It had a king bed, nightstand, desk w/ chair, dresser, & another flat screen tv. The bathroom was through the bedroom with the king size bed. The set-up was fine since we were all family members sharing the room. I wasn't super fond of the sink area being open to the main bedroom; it can just be annoying if someone is in the bathroom when you're trying to sleep. Since we stayed on a Saturday night there was no evening snack reception but there was coffee when we got back on Saturday night and breakfast the next morning. Breakfast was pretty basic. Scrambled eggs, sausage, oatmeal, toast, cereal, yogurt, etc. For the $110 that we paid for the room it was a great deal. The outside entrances and hauling luggage up the stairs probably isn\u2019t great for everyone. Parking seemed reasonably plentiful close to our room. When we arrived at the hotel, the event we were headed to started in about two and a half hours. Lucky we asked the front desk about the shuttle because they were already full?! But before I could get really angry the manager stepped in and said that he\u2019d run an early shuttle for us if we wanted and he\u2019d set up cabs to make sure everyone got to the event & back. He gave us his card and the name of the cab company he uses and said to just let them know to call him about the fare. Excellent! I\u2019d totally stay at this hotel again, especially for more than two people.

It seems like an old apartment complex that was converted into the hotel. The floor plan of the room is similar to other Homewoods. We stayed in a 1-br king suite and there was a spacious living room separated by a door from a bedroom with a king bed and bathroom. The room is nicely furnished with a couch, easy chairs, full kitchen, TV, and small dining table in the living area, and desk, dresser, bed, and TV in the bedroom. Unfortunately, the hotel was otherwise run-down. The exterior of the building with our room was in bad need of attention, with peeling paint on the doors. The room itself, despite the nice furnishings had a terribly moldy smell. The fitness center was poorly set up - two treadmills and an elliptical. bench, but no weights. All of the equipment facing away from the TV.

I'm two months from my wedding and my wedding venue just told me they are closing!\" The lady continued to argue with me that I shouldn't go to downtown Indy that I should find a location closer to their hotel.

Pros: Beds are standard Homewood beds: excellent and clean with comfortable pillows. Baths have been updated with arced shower rod and new shower enclosure. Lots of room, good layout. Good free breakfast. Cons: This place needs a remodel. Most Homewoods seem to have some kind of ongoing renovations going on to keep the furniture, carpet and fittings new. The micro and stovetop were really old. The furniture was clean. Decor seemed somewhat dated. The vanity area was basic and older. Front desk did not seem terribly professional. Although it was a night with very low occupancy, they had not glanced at room preferences. There are rooms with exterior corridors and interior corridors.

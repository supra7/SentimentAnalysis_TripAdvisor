Yes, the hotel is a little older. However, the staff was great, rooms were clean, and we had no problems. The fact that we purchased the package deal got us a continental breakfast (cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, yogurt, coffee, juice) and two tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit. They allowed us to check in early on Friday and we went to the flower show, leaving our car there. The next day we checked out, and then they allowed us to leave our car there while we went to the museum, which was in close walking distance. I would definitely stay here again when in Philadelphia.

This was my only choice for places with availability at the last minute, and I can see why. Check-in was mixed up as the person taking the phone reservation didn't share the information with the other team members. This resulted in delays, confusion and me being turned away at one point. It was resolved when the person who took the phone reservation showed up. Room - The door locks were broken, including the chain lock which is the secondary security system. The room smelled bad and was generally worn down and dirty. Power in my room wasn't always available for unknown reasons. The only working plug was in the washroom, and the lights didn't always work in there either. Unfortunately, no other rooms were available in the hotel or the city. General impression - There were workers doing work in other rooms in overalls. Removing a blood stained mattress from the room across the hall. This was occurring as I was going to my room for the first time. Not a great impression, nor were the people who appeared to be homeless hanging out in the main floor washroom and lobby. On my last morning, after two nights (thankfully) a lady from a neighboring building was waiting for a cab, which we shared downtown. She asked if we actually stayed there and said she thought it had been closed for a while and was supposed to be torn down to make way for condominiums. This may be the same reason they were not taking reservations and turning walk-ins away on the morning our group checked out. (Vacating several rooms) I had a cab driver tell me the same thing that this place was closed down and was shocked I Was staying there.

Our bathroom door did not close properly and, much like a prior reviewer, the faucet would not turn off unless you found the right spot (either we had the same room or many rooms are like that). The bathroom was not well cleaned either, especially the toilet which looked as though it had been neglected for some time. While other Best Westerns offer a free breakfast, this one did not. A buffet was available, but did not look that great and, at 12.95 per person, did not entice me to try it. Instead, we got some breakfast at a Wawa food market across the street.

This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at any where in the world, particularly for the price. They clearly don't use the money to invest in hotel maintenance--never mind upgrades! Everything was a joke: the \"fitness center\" was a 7x9' room that had outdated equipment and anything that was supposed to be electronic did not work so there was no way to add resistance or select any exercise programs. I was afraid to use the elevators as I truly do think they are original to the building and they shook and shuddered every time we got on--if we could get the door to close. The room bathroom was filthy with previous guests' hairs in the tub and dirt on the floor. The toilet paper holder and towel rack were pulled from the wall and hanging on by a ridiculous and dirty patch job done years before. The window in my room would not close though it was 40 degrees outside. There was no hot water (they did respond to that request quickly and the maintenance person was friendly). I found the front desk staff to be friendly 50% of the time and my hotel door key worked 33% of the time. The front desk manager herself was completely unhelpful. The wi-fi barely had a signal in my room and was extremely slow no matter where I tried to use it. Generally, it felt like the building was just falling down around us and that management is just a group of slumlords pocketing the money and not putting a dime into the place; the dank hallway decor and carpet felt original to the place too. There is no security in the building and there were a lot of strange characters coming and going. It was hard to tell if they were actually hotel guests. I wouldn't have felt safe staying her alone. I actually got on the Trip Advisor site to see if anyone complained about bed bugs because the entire place made my skin crawl and I'm afraid I brought bugs back in my luggage. My friend killed a huge cockroach in her room. I never expected this for a hotel that was charging $170/night.

It might as well be criminal. Here is what happened to me: my dog barked apparently shortly after I had checked in and had gone across the street to the convenience store for 5 minutes tops to get a few things. A neighbor complained to the front desk (this was at about 6 pm), and I got a voicemail on my cell phone saying I needed to return to quiet my dog. I was back within a few minutes and called the front desk back to say that I was back and would keep him quiet. The receptionist had a sneering tone in response, saying that he 'had' to be kept quiet, and was generally condescending to me during our conversation. Later that night, at about 11, he barked literally one more time, and we got a knock on the door from a security guard saying we had to leave the hotel. Between those two times, he had kept totally quiet. When we objected, the security guard at our door walked away down the hall before we could open the door and said 'he was going to call the police' to remove us. Keep in mind, this was because our dog had barked once, at a hotel that claims to accept pets. The receptionist told me we could stay, but would 'have to find a 24 hour kennel for our dog' - at 11pm - but he was no longer welcome at the hotel. He refused to even give a single chance for us to stay the night if the dog kept quiet, and he made sure to treat me like an offender instead of a customer while I tried to argue my point. He also refused to refund any part of our room fee, including the dog surcharge! They processed the credit card transaction as soon as we left... I called my credit card company. This hotel is foremost a total dump, and beyond that I have never been treated anywhere close to this poorly at any hotel in all of my 30 + years of travel. I just wanted to warn any prospecting dog owners against staying here, unless you are absolutely sure you can keep your dog silent. You might end up getting thrown out on the curb, and pay for the privilege. Beware, and don't doubt any of the negative reviews about the staff, theft, mistreatment etc......

It took three tries using three different sets of key cards to get into our room. The maintenance man who met us at the room upon try #2 said the front desk clerk didn't know what she was doing in preparing the cards. (She was using a 20-year-old MacClassic computer to do so.) Corridors were dark and gloomy, not helped by navy blue carpeting and minimal lighting. Everything -- doors, furniture, etc. -- was worn or tired-looking. Two ceiling panels in the restaurant had come loose, allowing insulation to stick out. Why could no one fix that? We saw a maximum of six people using the restaurant for breakfast. Our room's sink had gunk around the overflow drain, and what appeared to be mold along the seam between bathtub and wall. I was nearly scalded when I turned on the shower; 45 minutes later my friend had an ice-cold shower in the same place. The water temperature was all over the place. The hair dryer did not work. The air conditioning system's thermostat had a stuck adjustment wheel, meaning we had a choice of 60 degrees or no a.c. When the a.c. was on, it was very noisy. The window had a screen with a hole in it, so opening a window wasn't an option. When the a.c. was not operating, the room was filled with the drone of some sort of electrical motor nearby. Earplugs helped. Weather stripping at the bottom of the room's door had pulled loose at one end. The two elevators appear to be original to this 1960s-era building. Our beds were comfortable, but the fitted sheet may have been a bit too small as one morning I awoke to find my face against the bare mattress. Returning to the hotel after a day's exploration, we noticed that fewer than 20% of the rooms had lights on that night -- we saw fewer than a dozen other patrons during our stay there. The neighborhood was OK; there's a police station across the street. The \"continental breakfast\" offered at $8.95 + tax consisted of cold cereal, slightly old bagels or danishes, yogurt, apples, etc. Juice and milk were served in tiny glasses, 4 oz or less. On the second day, fruit cocktail was added. The advertised $11.95 (+ tax) \"full breakfast\" was not available on either of the mornings, although the chafing dishes were there. One could also order from a menu, but costs would quickly surpass the $11.95 level and from what I could see from another patron's egg dish, it was nothing to write home about. Others have mentioned this hotel's main plus is its location. It's true that the Rodin Museum is quite close, but most others like the Franklin Institute are some distance away, so if you have young children or elderly in your party, don't plan to walk. Also, except for a take-away chicken place and a takeaway Chinese place, there is nothing by way of restaurants within easy walking distance. The hotel's wi-fi was among the best I've experienced, with strong signals immediately available to my computer. There are no room safes, so if you wish to leave your computer, bring a security cable with you. The hotel's exterior featured a dead bush in the parking lot, and a disused swimming pool. Though it was warm outside, there was no sign any use of it was being considered. Free parking was the only other plus I can think of for this hotel. Upon checkout, I noticed behind the front desk a plaque from Best Western's District VII Director commending the hotel for its quality. It was dated January 2006. Either their inspector was very easy to please, or this hotel has taken a huge slide since then. I noticed that the hotel was \"independently owned and operated.\" Nevertheless, Best Western should really consider whether it wants its name associated with this hotel, which needs significant renovation and infusion of capital in almost every aspect. Unfortunately, given Philly's notoriously high hotel prices (to which 15% must be added for taxes), there's little impetus for this hotel to shape up its act. Our two-night stay, with four continental breakfasts, came to about $322, not exactly cheap.

The place is usually half-empty during the week (so there's plenty of parking if you have local friends stopping by, like I did), but fills up on the weekends. A big warning for people who like to eat at their hotel, though: The hotel restaurant is only open for breakfast. The hotel bar is open later, but the food is greasy sports bar cuisine and they don't do room service. I ended up getting a lot of late dinners from the deli across the street.

At least in this area, you have to wait on only one bus route that seemed to come infrequently throughout our entire stay. The hotel was not what we had envisioned. The building is dumpy and one part of the building looks abandoned, complete with ripped window shades. Not exactly inviting. Maybe they were remodeling that part? The area was not Center City, more like the fringes, and there is no nightlife (restaurants, stores, etc) to be found here. The hallways were dark and dingy and lights were out in some parts of corridors to our room. The heater blew hot air in one area and you had to blast it in order to somewhat heat up your room, which took a long time. Not good for a cold February stay! Overall, our experience was unpleasant.

If you like having gold star super luxury hotel experiences this one certainly is not for you. Our group stayed there because it is walking distance from the Eastern State Penn Museum. Location It's close to the prison museum, Philadelphia Museum, Rocky statue, and restored water works buildings. The Old City and shopping is on the east side of the city. If I go again I would take the transit to get there instead of driving. Driving can be a headache as in any major city. The Mutter museum is south and not too far to drive, perhaps 5 minutes. The view was very nice. There was a nice deli across the street to eat breakfast at. Food Breakfast is served near the lobby and it's definitely not worth it. It's $6 for continental breakfast, $11 for warm buffet. The food is not great for the price. Skip it for Dennys or the deli across the street on Spring Garden Road. There is also a sports bar in the Hotel that looked like a dark dive to me. Service The service was pretty good. The staff was never rude or ambivalent. They answered any questions we had with a smile. The kitchen staff was a bit surprised with the large number of people in our group. I don't think they expect to see a lot of people at breakfast. The Room Decent but older due to the age of the hotel. There is wireless high speed access to the internet (also not the Philly has city wide free wireless access). The internet speed was pretty good. TV was nice and even had free HBO. The bathroom as not the most high tech but got the job done. It felt more like a motel than a hotel. There were plenty of towels. Soap and Shampoo provided was nothing fancy. Other stuff There is an outdoor pool that I wasn't too keen on visiting. The elevators are really old and take a while to get moving. I thought they were freight elevators at first. Ice machines were on every floor. We were on the third floor and also had a pop machine (Pepsi, no Coke). Overall Our group paid about $90 per room. I think this is a good price considering it's a major metropolitan city with many rooms costing over $200 a night. If you want to see Philadelphia and your counting your pennies this could be the place for you as long as you understand the limitations. If you want luxury I would definitely stay in the old city near the waterfront and pay the extra for a more luxurious hotel. I was satisfied but might choose a hotel in the old city next time.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location\u201d", "Author": "holycow709", "ReviewID": "UR7165740", "Content": "As others said in their reviews, this hotel is tired looking, but the location makes it worth it all.

No, it's not the Marriott, Hilton or Lowes but it is exactly what you look for in a Best Western.

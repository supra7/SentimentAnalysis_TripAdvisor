The hotel is old but remodeled and very clean. Two story cinder block construction with your car parked right outside your door. All entries are outside. Minimal hotel common areas. They have a good, clean basic breakfast and an operating coin laundry. There is a Denny's and a Starbucks in the parking lot. Well lit, and the rooms are roughly 20X15 with comfortable beds.

I called the front desk to see if I could get another room and was told they had none available. I hesitate to say this was a lie, but there were about 7 cars in the entire lot so....I was force to tether to my smart phone, which burned through my data plan with surprising speed. I now must wait until Feb 8 until my data plan renews for the month. I always stay at LaQuinta because of the rewards program, but if this is how you are treated when you are ELITE status, I'd rather go back to gold.

Let me start off my saying that I did not pick this motel, but rather we all stayed on the suggestion of a staff member, who shall never be trusted again to pick lodging for any work outing. The location was the biggest problem, it\u2019s right off the freeway but in a less than desirable neighborhood. That is unless your desire is prostitutes, drunks going into Denny\u2019s, which is located a few feet from your front door, and shady characters walking along the sidewalk in front of the location. My advice would be to drive up the freeway a few miles and you\u2019ll find a nicer neighborhood, better restaurants, and HOTELS charging about the same price. The second problem was the staff, although they were friendly to a degree, they were dressed unprofessionally, and seemed to have very little knowledge of the area or tourist attractions. A little effort to know the area and answers to commonly asked questions would go a long way. While checking in I saw an ad for a casino, I asked how far it was, they didn\u2019t know. I asked if the pool was heated, they didn\u2019t know because they have never used it. I asked for a recommendation of a good mexican restaurant, they sent us to the wrong location. I stopped asking any question during the rest of my \u201cadventure.\u201d Understand this is not a hotel, but a motel. The property was clean and seemed to be maintained. Within a short walk from the motel is a Denny\u2019s (actually shares the parking lot), a Starbucks, and across the street is a Jack in the Box, Arby\u2019s and a Circle K. The property has a pool, but no jacuzzi. The room was average size, was clean and maintained. The bathroom sink is separate from the toilet and shower. There was a large screen TV with HBO and PPV, there is a coffee maker and Iron w/Board. No safe in the room, which is really needed based on the neighborhood. The bed was a little too soft for me. The A/C is located in the window and kept me awake all night because it sounded like the space shuttle taking off every time is started up. I was also kept awake by the air compressor going off all night at the Denny\u2019s. A free breakfast is also provided daily, but it\u2019s not really much to talk about. Mostly breads, pre-packaged waffles, no proteins. In closing the motel itself is not a bad place, just the area around it is less than desirable. I would never stay here with my family, but if I needed a place for a wild weekend with my drunk buddies and was tight on cash, I might consider this place.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't have been better!\u201d", "Author": "Coloradotraveler2", "ReviewID": "UR59615916", "Content": "We stayed for 9 days while house hunting.

The hotel is centrally located. We traveled away from our hotel in the mornings and back to the hotel in the evenings, always in the opposite direction of rush hour traffic.

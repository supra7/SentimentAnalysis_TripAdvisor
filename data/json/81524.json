{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great for experienced budget travelers know what to expect and you won't have any problems. always check Yelp.com or trip advisor before going anywhere and you should save yourself any disappointment. The Oasis Inn is the best budget hotel that I have found yet in the city that is not in a bad location. It is right in the center of the city - just a few blocks from the city hall/civic center area. The food is really good towards the Tenderloin area, but I would avoid it after dark if you can. Take a taxi or drive - the parking is included and there are in-and-out privileges.The smoking rooms are basic and smokey. The nonsmoking rooms are just basic and look like early nineties. I haven't had any problems with my room, but it can get loud at times if you leave your window open as they are very close to a major thoroughfare for the city (Van Ness).I usually stay for about $75-80, but have gotten rooms from Samsclub/Costco for around $60. I don't understand people who get a great deal on a hotel in a very nice area and then bash it because it's not what they were expecting. there are plenty of pictures and reviews around and the hotel has been renovated in recent years. Who stays in their hotel rooms for any lengthy period of time anyway? As long as there is a clean bed, working shower, and relative quiet for a city, then you should be golden.At these prices, it's a steal. I have stayed at dozens of hotels in San Francisco from 2 stars all the way up to 5 stars and honestly , I'd rather skimp on the hotel and spend my money on dining out or seeing a show.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR569031125", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "drnzyme"}, {"Content": "Gross. We had booked this hotel merely as a stopover for one night before catching a flight out of the city. I know you get what you pay for, so I wasn't expecting miracles, just a place to sleep, but The Oasis was gross, even with our low expectations. We couldn't get a cab so we walked through the Tenderloin to get to the hotel, which was hair-raising enough in itself, but to then get a room which looked like it should be rented by the hour (and smelt like it), was just too depressing. The furnishings were grubby or mismatched or broken, and my pillow smelt of stale perfume -the sheets had a stain on them that didn't bear close examination so I guess they don't do the laundry regularly. The bathroom was ok but it felt grimy.I stay at cheap hotels all the time -I agree with the reviewer who says you use a hotel as somewhere to crash inbetween sightseeing, but there were other hotels in the city for the same price, and I'm sure at least some of them must be cleaner than this dump.The lift was filthy and outside the lobby smelt overpoweringly of air freshener ( a case of too little too late, I think!)We couldn't wait to leave in the morning. It's a horrible hotel!", "Date": "Oct 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR194816597", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ruby_malone"}, {"Content": "Never ever stay at the Oasis I was here with a tour group at the end of July and can say that I have never been to a worse hotel in my life. On the first night my friend who I was sharing the room with, used the bathroom and as soon as he flushed the toilet it started to overflow and continued for about 30mins to spill (--) all over the floor, there was about half an inch of sewage on the floor. The guy at reception took 30 mins to come and see it, as we had called him straight after the incident. They changed us rooms, but because all our toiletries were in the bathroom we were not able to get them out, they told us to get them in the morning (it was 1 am). BUT, in the morning they had all disappeared and nobody knew where they were. Don\u9225\u6a9b talk to me about the \u9225\u6e03ontinental breakfast\u9225?that they tried to put on, it was a mix of crappy bread and nutella chocolate spread and some orange juice that was probably past its sale by, not very continental to me, but whatever. At night I had no more smokes so I went to get some from the local shell but when returning I found a homeless drug addict roaming the halls of the hotel, makes me think about safety overall a very very bad hotel, the management don\u9225\u6a9b seem to ever be there, the staff that are there speak either bare English or such a rude dialect of English that you wonder what they are talking about.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR850578293", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "maple451"}, {"Content": "Never book this hotel !!! When I arrived at this hotel around 8:00pm, a guy was despereately standing there. He got an email confirmation from Expedia, but no room would be available to him. And the front desk guy was going to do nothing about it. Then it was my turn. I had been very confident that I would not suffer that guy's fate because 1) I reserved through a travel agency 2) My credit card has been charged by Oasis Inn 3) I have called the day before to confirm everything is OK. But I was wrong!!! I was told that the just SOLD OUT!!! HOW ABOUT MY MONEY!!! HOW ABOUT THEIR PROMISE ON THE PHONE THAT THE ROOM WILL BE THERE!!!Eventually, I got better treatment than the Expedia Boy, perhaps because I called before. I was sent to another hotel. And I just had no other choice. The story is: Oasis Inn, SF will sell his RESERVED rooms to other people with no hesitation.That was totally a nightmare.

All in all a good deal at $69 a night IF:you are going to be doing a lot of touring and a hotel is simply a ----, shave and shower. This is not a hang aorund hotel, no lobby, no cocktail lounge, no coffee shop, no atriumed lounge area, this is a place you sleep, shower and go see SF and you can walk to ANYWHERE IN DOWNTOWN FROM HERE AND NOT MOVE THE CAR.Yes, the rooms are total Days Inn, Motel 6 but for the most part clean. The elevator from front desk to room floors is filthy but who gives a ----. you are not living in the elevator. You have to ralize where you are staying and that is in the heart of SF very close to the Opera House and City Hall, and you can walk to Polk Street a block over for good restaurants and Van Ness the main drag has great food. You are close to Pacific Heights on the near west side and not too ---- far from Haight Asbury.This is a place to stay folks not an elegant hotel that wants 300 a nite and more for parking. USE that money for a tour to Alcatraz or dining this great city to walk.The Oasis will grow on you. Right on Franklin street to go up the hill to Pacific Heights, the Presidio and Lombard Street. Its safe as the main lobby is totally secured and only the front desk guy an let you in after about 10 pm via a buzzer from the desk.AGAIN this aint the Hyatt. But the $$ I saved made my trip to SF remarkable and not concentrated on a hotel room I was only gonna use to sleep and shower.Yes, they could do some more cleaning as the interior is dated and dirty and they have some college kids living there renting by the month from the SF School of Culinalry Arts down the street but these are not caruousing frat boys these are kids who walk to school in the morn.Leave your heart in SF not 300 a night at the Hyatt.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR689963824", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "In need of a Major overhaul. Have just returned from 5 nights at the Oasis and would not go back.The elevator was slow and in my opinion could have done with a good clean up. On leaving the elevator on the 4th floor we were faced with corridors which have not had a lick of paint for who knows how long.The room itself was unimpressive fitted with furniture well below its best. There was a coffee maker but you were provided with plastic holders and plastic disposable cups to drink from. The room had a microwave but this was on top of the 6ft high television cabinet with no socket nearby to plug into. The nearest usable socket was just outside the bathroom which meant you had to lift this unit from the top of the cabinet to use it.The bath had a crack in the inner skin of the plastic bath which when pressed allowed water to ooze out into the bath, this water was obviously trapped between the broken inner skin and the outer skin of the bath. The towels were plentiful and clean.The bed sheets were heavily stained and of poor quality but were clean.There is a free breakfast but you have to leave the Inn and go a couple of blocks away to a hotel under the same ownership 'The Embassy'.Believe me it was a waste of a walk.Finally the Inn is just of the Van Essen Boulevard yet there were beggars everywhere.This is the first time I have had negative report on any hotel.

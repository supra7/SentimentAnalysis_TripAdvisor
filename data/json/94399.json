There was also plenty of storgae space and free filtered water. There is a coffee machine in the room but no tea (you can not get good tea anywhere in Boston!!). The communal area, the club room, also has free refreshements and newspapers and free internet and printer. The hotel is connected to an English styled pub which has a good atmosphere and good food. The hotel is possibly in the best spot in Boston. As a city small enough to walk, the Club Quaters is ideally positioned between Boston Common (10min walk) and the shopping area of town (Newbury St 20min walk) in one direction and Faneuiel Hall (5min walk) and the North End (Little Italy 15 min walk) in the other. Because the hotel is in the financial district the area around the hotel is very quiet at the weekend.

There was no dresser and only a two shelf bureau in the closet because it wouldn't fit anywhere else. The bathroom had only a shower and it was utilitarian. We also noticed that although we had a king bed, it was really two twins put together so there was a definite line between the mattresses. I'm wondering if a real king sized mattress would fit in the narrow hallway to the room and be hard to handle once it was in the room. If you want to be in downtown Boston, then it's a good location. We had trouble with our GPS because it couldn't get satellite reception in the area and there are a lot of very narrow one way streets so driving is an adventure. The hotel also does not have its own parking garage. It does have arrangements with a garage about two blocks away. The rate is actually very good especially for weekends. The hotel has no restaurants or facilities for breakfast. There is a restaurant next door where you can eat and charge your meal to your room.

The pub that is next door / attached has pretty good food - I had the bangers and mash one day and the salmon another and both were cooked nicely. Breakfast is also very good. The lobby is a bit small but does have an area to hang out. One huge plus was that in the lobby and on each floor they have free bottled water - or rather free filtered water with free bottles that you can take. I loved this! The other huge plus is location. It is within walking distance of many stores and shopping - only about 5 min walk to Fanhiel hall (sp?) and about 12 min walk to Italian North End and 7 mins to the water and aquarium.

After reading tons of reviews I decided Club Quarters was enough 'in' the city with the cheapest rooms (not cheap at all though, almost $300/night but it was a holiday weekend). The concept for this hotel (and I assume all Club Quarters) is a little odd. They sell themselves as a member property for business travelers and apparently also have corporate suites. Overall, I was expecting a bit more. Our room was minuscule, and the bathroom was even smaller with the tiniest shower I've ever seen (no tub). I should have taken a picture of the shower, imagine a 3x3 box cut on the diagonal - try shaving your legs in that! The location was okay. Anything in the downtown area would have been fine. It is in the financial district and as other reviewers have mentioned, if you're there on the weekend then NOTHING is open (except a few 7-11's) but it's only a few blocks walk to the nearest open Starbucks or the waterfront. The hotel doesn't have much staff so everything is sort of self-serve. There is a refillable water bottle station by the elevators and a closet with extras like irons, mending kits, shower caps and so on. Don't expect much service from the staff, they're nice enough but it doesn't seem to be there job to actually serve you. So, the moral is...if it is the cheapest (by far) that you can find in Boston then go for it...but for slightly more it seems as if you can get a luxury hotel room instead. Oh!

But perhaps it was because it was a weekend, but the hall closet of amenities was nearly empty. However a call to room service very quickly solved our pillow problem. (The pillows are not very full and fluffy so most likely you will need more.) We also had a ticking noise in our vent that maintenance couldn't hear but they at least came to look. I also made the change for a double bedded room only a few weeks before our stay and they were accommodating. The immediate area is also very dead on the weekends.

I would suggest you bring your own reuseable water bottle container as the hotel provides purified filtered water on each floor so you can always refill on your way to the elevators.

I put in an open bid on Priceline to stay in one of a few choice areas of Boston, and Club Quarters in the Financial District accepted my offer. I am not a member of Club Quarters, nor had I heard of them before, but everything on their website looked beautiful and the location seemed like it was pretty good as well. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize until the morning I was leaving for Boston that there was a notation on the website for Club Quarters that there were daily parking rates. I suppose that this should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the Financial District of Boston; there are numerous parking garages but few places have their own parking per-se, and even the metered paring that exists is hard to come by and often for limited time frames. This is something to keep in mind for anyone planning on staying in this hotel or any other in the area. Club Quarters had a discount rate worked out with Icon Parking for a lot about a block or two down the street. The weekday rate when I went (right after Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day 2010) was $25 for a 24-hour period on weekdays for self-parking, $32 for valet parking, and $16 for self-park on the weekends (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure about valet rates for the weekends, but I assume it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $7 more than self-park again). There is no in-and-out privilege either, meaning that if you use your car twice in one day, then you pay twice. That said, this discount rate is lower than it would cost to park long-term at many other lots in the area and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no in-and-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stipulation is not uncommon in the vicinity. When coupled with the fact that the hotel is located just a short walk from many points of interest and all of the major subway lines, hence eliminating the need to drive most places in the area, the parking fees shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter anyone from staying here. In fact, the cost of the room and parking daily was still less than I would have paid to stay at a chain hotel with parking on the Massachusetts Bay, which is not close to the subway or public transportation, and from which I would have had to drive to all attractions and then find and pay for parking anyway. You are allowed, whether you self-park or not, to pull into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153valet parking only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area outside the hotel to load/unload your car when checking in and out. And on a final note about the parking, no cash changes hands throughout your entire stay between the valets/garage and you; rather, the hotel keeps records of all of the parking and cashes you out through them as you check out, at which point you can pay for the parking separately or include it in your room bill. As for the hotel itself, it is very presentable. The pictures on the website do not quite match up to the place itself in person, but that should not come as a surprise to anyone. All pictures of the rooms online are of master suites, and to be honest, I am not sure if suites the size of those shown online even exist at this particular location. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was fairly small, with a queen-size bed, one chair, a desk, mini-fridge, microwave, wall-mounted flat-screen TV, and a small closet. The bathroom was well-mirrored with lots of counter space and a stall shower (not a tub). Wi-fi is free in all rooms, and there are also computers with printers available in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Club Room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a lounge on the main floor. Room service is available not only from the hotel restaurant (Elephant & Castle), but from a few other restaurants of various genres whose full menus are listed in an in-room directory at regular prices (not the inflated room service prices many of us are used to seeing). Oddly absent were an iron and ironing board, but those are available on request, as well as extra amenities such as additional linens, pillows or even in-room delivery of a stationary bicycle or elliptical machine if you choose not to visit the exercise room. Everything, from the rooms to the halls to the lounge, was exceptionally clean and modern. The most important factor to discuss when mentioning this hotel, however, is LOCATION. I honestly could not have asked for a better spot in the city. The hotel is a 2-minute walk to the Orange and Blue subway lines at State Street station, or about 5 minutes from the Green subway line at Haymarket or Government Center stations. The MBTA, the public transportation system in Boston, is among the cleanest, most efficient, user-friendly and convenient subway systems I have ever used. The lines all have stops directly in front of major destinations such as the Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of Science, Quincy Market, the Theater District, Chinatown, the New England Aquarium, the Prudential Center, the JFK Museum, etc. The trains run every 6-8 minutes and make it very easy to get to any destination. Boston is, however, a walking city, and this hotel is an 6-minute walk to Quincy Market, 8 minutes to the Aquarium, 12 minutes to Copley Square, 18 to the Prudential Center, and the list goes on and on. During my week-long stay, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to use my car at any point and never ran out of things to do. The location is simply unbeatable for any tourist who wants to hit all of the major attractions of Boston, and I imagine that it would also be perfect for those on business as it is directly in the heart of the government/financial area. I have always been of the mind that, when I am on vacation, I just need a clean room and comfortable amenities, since I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan to spend a majority of my time in the room anyway. As such, Club Quarters was perfectly suited to my needs. I can imagine that for someone in town long-term or someone who desired a spacious room, this might not be sufficient. I cannot speak for the size of the suites, so I would advise anyone concerned about space to call and inquire about the dimensions of the rooms. I would recommend this spot to anyone, and in fact I have already convinced my sisters to spend a weekend there only a week after I left.

One day there was a cab out front and a \"house vehicle\" I asked twice if the house vehicle was standard taxi rates so i jump into this old beat up Lincoln and off I go. its the third time I have gone from the club quarters to another hotel that week and have paid 8-9 and 11 dollars depending on traffic. When we arrive the guy says \"well how does 25 sound\" I felt like I got totally ripped off and we negotiated the price down. I said it was BS and this was a 9 buck taxi ride to which he said \"this inst a taxi\" I had ASKED the front desk and the driver if standard Boston taxi rates applied to the vehicle. Pretty crappy. 3. The club quarters computers don't work what so ever. Anytime I opened a browser I was greeted with pop ups about viruses and \"how to date a cougar\" websites. I wouldn't trust these computers with any sensitive information. Overall a 3 star hotel with a 1 star staff, really hate to rip staff if you look at my other reviews I am a pretty easy going leisure traveler but this was over the top. I moved to the Hyatt and boy was it worth it. I also noticed the dislike of the CQ front counter staff transcended age, race, and gender so they hit the trifecta. If you dislike your job as much as you appear, please quit I hated seeing people so broken spirited and angry.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and quiet.\u201d", "Author": "ElissaLA", "ReviewID": "UR46570026", "Content": "We stayed at Club Quarters for three nights. We got a great price, under $200 a night using Hotwire. The room was simple, quiet and smartly designed for being so small...they used space well. They have a really cool feature in the hallway where they provide empty 8oz water bottles with lids and a purified water dispenser, so you have water at all times! The rooms come with microwave and refrigerator. Free and easy to connect to WiFi. Very basic front desk...you check-in and out at something that looks like an ATM machine. The staff that is there is friendly and helpful with reservations or recommendations when asked. They don't have room service, but they have local restaurant menus in the room to order from. A few drawbacks, shower is small...just a stall, no tub. 2 people in the bathroom at once have a hard time negotiating the small space, and there's a fight for the mirrors. There is a mirror on the door, and a long mirror on the wall by the room door to compensate. The cups and glasses inside the room were a little dusty. The 2nd day we wanted new towels, and came back to the room to only one new towel. When we called downstairs for more towels, they brought up towels and said, \"They just came out of the package, they haven't been washed\"...and they really smelled like chemicals. The location is great for sight-seeing and walking to Fanueill Hall, The North End and the waterfront. It's also really close to the blue & orange T-Line stop. The one major drawback was finding a decent breakfast. The hotel is in the financial district, so most of the restaurants are closed on weekend mornings. We resorted to eating at Quincy Hall one morning, and Starbucks another morning. If you like donuts and coffee, there is a Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks every two blocks. For dinner, we walked to the North End, and to the Long Pier in less than 10 minutes.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cFun in Boston\u201d", "Author": "millsoh", "ReviewID": "UR46260284", "Content": "This hotel was perfect for what we were looking for.

My wife and I went on this trip without our children so this hotel worked out perfectly. We had an early flight in to Boston so we arrived at the hotel @10:30am. Check in was as easy as I have every had. With reservations already made we used the self serve check in had had our door keycards and were on the elevator within 4 minutes of walking in the door. Our first room was small. I heard some international guests describe the rooms as very European in style and size. While the size of the room was a little suprising it was just the two of us and we were not planning on spending hours upon hours in our room so it was no big deal. It had a bed, bathroom, TV clock radio what else do you have to have? We were checked in with our bags in our room and ready to walk out the door and head to the sights within a half hour of arriving. On our way out the door I stopped and asked the gentleman at the desk if they had bigger rooms to upgrade to. He looked and offered us a \"suite\" for $20 more a day. If this is offered to you TAKE IT. We went from a very basic room to a room with a mini kitched equipped with everything from a stove top, microwave and fridge to place settings and silverware! After moving our belongings to the new room we were back out the door to start our walk. This is where we found the hidden gem of this hotel. It is ridiculously close to everything. We were a 4 minute walk from Quincy Market in one direction and 4 minutes from the heart of downtown in the other direction. I think it took us 15 minute or less walking time to be at the aquarium and harbor area! You pass \"T\" stops in either direction if you are trying to get to someplace else. With so many places to eat you could gain weight stopping to eat on your way to whatever it is you want to see. The hotel staff was so helpful we couldn't have asked for more. When I called to get a phone number to a taxi service (we were going out for a fancy dinner) they told me to just call down 5 minutes before we wanted to leave and they would take care of it. When we arrived in the lobby we found a Lincoln Navagator and driver waiting for us. Once we were done eating and checking out some sights we called the hotel and they sent the car back for us. No price gouging here and I really believe it was right on target for what a cab would have cost. This service was also available to us when we left for the airport to fly home. All in all this was a perfect experience. Again I would like to point out this really isn't a hotel for families with small children. It is a no frills hotel for adults who don't expect to spend hours upon hours in their rooms.

CQ hotels are often much cheaper than other area hotels, and although members have first preference, reservations are often open to the public.

I especially appreciated the desk where I could plug in my netbook and other electronics. Yes, there is free wireless Internet here and the speed seemed pretty good. As a guy, I especially appreciated the dark woods and plaids used in the decor. There is a filtered water machine on each floor, and I think they will provide bottles at the front desk. The location is close to several places of interest, although it's definitely in Downtown Boston among several tall buildings (ie. not much of a view from any of the windows here). It's a few short blocks walk from the State T-stop (in the Old State House) to this hotel. Also within a few blocks of several shops at Downtown Crossing, including large Marshall's and TJ Maxx stores. It's also a 15-minute walk to Faneuil Hall, Quincy Marketplace, the New England Aquarium, and the beautiful wharf area. If you're Catholic, be sure to check out the St. Anthony Shrine Church in the neighborhood. We went to Mass there and the music was some of the best \"church music\" we've heard! Finally, there's a nice Elephant and Castle restaurant connected to the hotel which features British pub-style food. I'm an E&C fan, so this was an added bonus for us. My only complaint would be the long waits for the two slow elevators in the hotel. There were often groups of people waiting in the lobby for a ride upstairs and waits were often several minutes.

When we went back to the airport, we walked a few blocks to the subway station (which goes straight to the airport though you need to take a free shuttle bus to actually get to the airport). The subway ride was $2. There is a busy pub next door that is connected to the hotel. I'm going to tell you like it is. This is not a hotel. It is like a business motel with clean facilities, but does not provide the right services to serve properly as a business motel. For example, the phone in the room did not have any instructions on how to connect to the front desk or dial outside of the hotel. There is no room service either. I think that's why the word \"hotel\" is omitted from this establishment's name. From the outside, you can hardly tell it is a hotel as it looks like an apartment building. The room appear clean and looks okay at first sight. But you'll notice the furnishings are kind of a like an upgraded East Coast USA version of IKEA. In other words, it is not luxury or even close to it. The TV hangs above the desk and so you cannot get a straight view from the bed. It does swivel so you can see it better though. The bathroom looks like something that belongs in a low-cost Northern European hotel. There were barely no amenities and the toilet was the same as those found in a public restroom (steel bar for flushing). The shower was dorm room-like with a cheap curtain. I never stay at hotels with bathrooms like this! Maybe when I was a college student backpacking through Europe, but not now! Most upsetting of all was that I could not sleep for even one minute here. The bedding was cheap and rough. I felt itchy all over (bed bugs?) and scratched myself repeatedly on my arms, legs, and neck. I had stayed at hotels just before this and just after this (we were on a long business trip taking us to several different cities) and I did not experience the same situation at other places. I slept quite well in most other places. In addition, something (fire detector?) was making this faint screeching noise all night that I didn't notice during the day when I had the TV on. I wanted to call the front desk, but I couldn't figure out how and I was so tired that I just tried to sleep. I didn't think they'd be able to do anything about it anyhow. I tried and tried to sleep. Of course, I couldn't. Terrible experience. The staff at the desk are young women in their 20s. They are nice, but not professional or experienced hotel staff. In fact, one of them was a trainee. There is usually one staff member at the desk and there does not appear to be a real office. I thought they were nice and tried to be helpful. However, I am used to older, more experienced and professional hotel desk staff. There is no doorman and only an older man who helps with luggage when called. Club Quarters is also overpriced. I have stayed at better hotels for about the same price. SUMMARY: I am really shocked that Club Quarters Boston is rated four stars on certain sites. I want to give this hotel three stars because it looks like a three star, but I just can't because it does not act like one. If it weren't for the nice young lady at the desk was helpful when we were looking for somewhere to eat late at night, I would even consider giving this place one star. I don't think I need to tell you that I will not stay here again. I would rather camp outside in the park if I had no other choice.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cFantastic experience!\u201d", "Author": "LT_Toronto", "ReviewID": "UR31168132", "Content": "I was a bit nervous about our choice of hotel, especially since I had read some reviews online and they weren't all good, but from the moment that I set foot in the hotel I knew we were going to have a good experience.

They only gave us 2 towels in the bathroom, so nothing extra to use. We also had our room cards replaced twice because they would never work. The guy at the front desk thought he was better then everyone there and was not the friendliest. The walls are pretty thin. We could hear the chicks in the next room.

The bathroom was small but sufficient, had plenty of mirrors and hot water, although the walls could have used a coat of paint. The express check-in machine was a nice idea but it wasn't working properly so it was great to have a staff member available at the desk. The woman who checked us in was very personable. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for some of the other staff members, but all were efficient and knowledgeable. The purified water station in the hall was great but the idea of a guest supply closet is just silly. We actually checked it several times each day for extra pillows and/or towels but found it empty every time. (Why not just have the extras in the room already?) Along the same lines, if you choose not to have your linens changed daily, remember that you'll probably run out of such things as shampoo and toilet paper! If you get one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u201c01 rooms (801, 901, etc.), I suggest you ask for a different room. These rooms are literally right off the elevators and you'll hear the foot traffic. It seems that even the most polite hotel guests will tend to talk loudly while waiting for the elevators, at all hours of the day or night, not realizing there's a guest room right there. A word of warning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever you do, do not try to take the stairs to another floor or down to the lobby. Once you're in the stairwell, the door will lock behind you and you will have to walk all the way down, out onto the street and back in through the front door of the hotel. It's an interesting trip if you're wearing only pajamas and wooly socks. The Elephant and Castle restaurant next door to the hotel is a bit expensive but the food, while nothing fancy, is not bad. It's obviously very popular, always crowded and you can charge your dinner to your hotel room. It's a great place to have a nightcap before heading up to bed. While our stay at the Club Quarters was nice enough, I'm not sure we'll hurry back.

But Boston being a relatively small city, pretty much everything is in a reasonnable walking distance. The room size was just fine for two people. Although the bathroom could have easily been a little bigger even to the room's lost, if was very comfortable. To my surprise, there was a fridge and microwave in the room, which happened to be very useful in my case. The room was clean and neat. The proximity of the pub is handy - drinks and beer are great and cheap. Food is pretty good but don't bother getting the brunch on mornings - it's $18 per person for not so many choices. They have a breakfast special - two eggs, a huge sausage, potatoes, beans and toasts for $10. The staff is mostly friendly. Overally, I'd say we had a very good experience at Club Quarters.

Things to know about Club Quarters: 1. the rooms are small - but comfortable for 1-2 people 2. they are catering to the business traveller, that is why it is located in the Financial District 3. this is not a luxury or boutique hotel - don't expect fancy soaps or over the top customer service If you recognize these things before booking and you are OK with these potential issues, then you will enjoy your stay. One awesome feature was the FREE bottled (cold) water available by the elevators on each floor. Every morning before we headed out to see the sites we would fill up. Also, there are 2 computers in the lobby/lounge with FREE internet access. NICE! I would definitely stay here again.

The area appears very safe with the exception of a few homeless individuals. We parked our car in the hotel's recommended parking garage a block away and it was $40 for the three nights (You park your own car and have the ticket validated by the hotel desk for a discount.) Getting to Fenway Park for the Yankees' victory was easy. The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. We ate at the restaurant next to the hotel (Elephant and Castle) for breakfast one morning. I equate it to airport food. It was quick and edible, but not the best food we've ever had. I paid $180 a night on Price Line and I'd say that was a fair price. You're primarily paying for the location, not the hotel amenities. Try Abe & Louie's if you're looking for a great steakhouse that's on the expensive side. It's a $9 cab ride away and well worth the trip if you can afford the tab ($190 for two with wine and tip.) The freedom trail was very interesting and I highly recommend it.

You are literally two blocks away from the Freedom Trail, down in the financial district on a safe Central business district road. Checking in took us some time. We got there on a Friday night. One elavator wasn't working. The card machine for rooms wasn't working well either. The two gentlemen working the front desk were very courtious and apologetic. They were doing the best anyone could do checking in hoards of guests, dealing with grumpy businessmen who could stand having to wait a minute or two for the one working elevator, manning the phones, conceirge requests, etc. They did this all in a very professional manner. The room was small and economical. You get two towels, one wash cloth, one hand towel, two pillows, a comfy bed, small TV, mini fridge, shower (no bath,) coffee machine and that's it.

For 5-10 minutes this woman went from not being able to help the mother to fixing it once she figured out how. She had a chip on her shoulder, made everyone else in the lobby wait without any awknowledgement, including the Fedex service who had a package for the bride. In front of the mother of the bride, she tried to look the bride's name up in the system and asked the mother (still waiting for the one elevator) if she knew this guest. Yes, it was the bride. After spending that long helping the wedding party, how can she not know? Wouldn't any hotel have the wedding party's name at the front desk?

You are close to all 4 lines of the subway which was very easy to use. We were also just blocks from the market and shopping in all directions. The area the hotel was in was the financial district and since we were there on the weekend it was very quite. A great irish pub is located right outside the hotel. We had a great time and for the money the hotel did the job.", "Date": "September 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, England", "Title": "\u201cWould not stay there again\u201d", "Author": "Riverbankannie", "ReviewID": "UR3799338", "Content": "Stayed just for one night in August.

There is an attached pub (Elephant and Castle) where one can get a cold beer and some acceptable grub after a long day of meetings in the financial district if there is no desire to go exploring Boston. Wireless connectivity that is free, no strings attached all over the hotel. A family on vacation here would be quite miserable in one room, they are far too small. A young couple intent on exploring the city and using the hotel as a base of operations rather than as a destination would be quite happy here. As far as location goes, you are less than 5 minutes from Fanueil Hall and the bevy of tourist traps there (Durgin Park seafood being the noteworthy exception), the North End and the wonderful Italian Pastry shops are just 10 minutes walk, and the Blue Line is less than 2 blocks away. Overall, a destination hotel this is NOT. As a clean, comfortable base for adventuresome duos this is perfect.

Finally, I called Hotels customer service, got the agent to talk to your desk clerk, found that it was clubquarters error and got the second room. It took about 4 hours to get a rollaway bed in one room and only 1 of 2 elevators were working, making for long waits for an elevator. Overall, an unpleasant experience.

This hotel is conveniently located between State Stree and Downtown Crossing T stops - both about 2-3 blocks away. (The airport was only about 3 T stops away).

Rooms were clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. We checked in and checked out using the kiosks right inside the door. Not reason enough to decide to stay there - but it was very fast and very nice. The hotel has a nice fitness center that was empty both days we used it. My boyfriend thanked me / complimented me all weekend for choosing such a great hotel, with a great price and great location! Next time I go to Boston, I will stay here again. Actually, I normally use this site for recommendations but got such a good deal and planned the trip last minute that I didn't even check the other reviews.

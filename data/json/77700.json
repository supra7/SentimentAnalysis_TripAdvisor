Westwood is a cute little residential suburb. Although quiet on weekends, on week days the cute cafes and shops are packed with college students and staff. The lobby and bar are classic W. Staff at the welcome desk and concierge were very helpful, and the bell boys brought my bags up straight away. I have stayed at the W in a number of cities world wide but this was the first time I have been upgraded (from a Wonderful room to the Spectacular Suite), which was HUGE considering I was visiting alone! It had a separate lounge and dining area. The bathroom was an odd shape but the shower pressure and towels were good and replaced and cleaned thoroughly each day. Ordered one of the \"make your own burger\"s for in-room dinner one night and was pleasantly surprised it only took about 15-20 minutes. Was very yummy! The pool itself isn't huge but there are lots of sun beds and cabanas so it didn't feel over crowded. Didn't have time to eat at the backyard restaurant unfortunately, but the food I saw people eating looked lovely, and it's a gorgeous spot to sit out on a warm day! This hotel does allow pets. I don't own any pets and was a little worried about noise from dogs in near by rooms, but didn't hear anything at all at night. Not even the music coming from the lobby which was VERY loud on friday night, but I love the young cool W vibe that comes with the chain. The main frustration about this hotel: I HATE that the internet is not free. If I can go to Starbucks and pay $4 for a coffee and get free wifi, surely a hotel where I'm paying $250+++ a night should include it?? $14 per day is insane in this day in age. Otherwise up to the great W standard that I love!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, but beware the Euro-trashiness\u201d", "Author": "iron_monkey_fist666", "ReviewID": "UR127443049", "Content": "The good news: 1. great location-- close to lots of little fun restaurants and coffee shops in Westwood, and of course, to the UCLA campus. 2.

You have to pay for internet in your room = nickel and diming = a pet peeve of mine. 3. The shower was very fancy, but the water pressure was really disappointingly bad, as was the water temperature. It was hard to get it right. 4. At night, the ground floor has a bar with probably the worst DJ I could ever imagine spinning Destiny's Child and some other garbage.

What a mistake. The first \"Spectacular suite\" we were shown to (1511) had no natural light and would have been like living in a glorified closet. We asked to move. A very helpful lady at the \"Welcome Desk\" graciously upgraded us to the Penthouse floor. We noticed a strong smell of drains in the bathroom and maintenance came and poured a whole bottle of bleach down the shower drain. We had a perfectly nice but unexceptional meal in their restaurant \"Nine Thirty\". The smell of drains and sewage became overpowering during the night and we were moved the following morning. The lady at the \"Welcome Desk\" advised us that she had taken $65 off of our dinner bill in compensation. We had already been woken up at 7am by a labour dispute which we were warned about by letter the evening before. The picketing outside the W entrance was extremely noisy. Our third room on the 12th floor was ok but, as with the other two rooms, there was a shabbiness about it. Stained cushions and woodwork, dust in the corners and, yet again, a stale smelling bathroom (but not nearly as bad as the Penthouse room). We were frustrated by this time and ordered coffee via room service. Two dirty cups and one saucer later we were no happier. We decided to have lunch at the poolside restaurant. The service was so bad that we didn't receive our drinks until after we had finished our food! The manager said that the fine weather had caught them unaware and took the drinks off the bill. We returned to our sun beds to find the pool taken over by a party of screaming children. As with many other USA hotels, no shower by the pool, how annoyingly unhygienic. Whilst we appreciated the small compensations made by the hotel we would much rather have just had an uneventful and relaxing stay. Until the W Westwood has got it's act together it is obviously suitable only for drunken partygoers who are oblivious to it's numerous shortcomings. Try the Beverley Hilton or the Hyatt Century Plaza instead. Same price range, maybe not so \"cool\" but far more professional and relaxing.

There is natural wood in the construction and it's a low-profile building, not a high-rise. The rooms are all beautiful, I've been upgraded to big suites a few times and they are amazing, but almost too much room for what I need, just the regular room is huge and fantastic. The staff is great, grounds beautiful, definitely a peaceful place. Only downer is that if you (or friends) are street-parking types, it's all permit parking n the area and pretty much impossible to street park so you need to valet or risk a lightning-quick parking ticket.

Overall, I really enjoyed staying at the W in LA. Location: Westwood is a nice neighborhood, close to all tourist attractions but the area is pretty residential. There is a Trader Joe's and a Starbucks nearby - although the hotel has a complimentary coffee and tea in the morning. We book a promotional deal where the valet parking was included. I strongly recommend valet parking. Room: It was more like a suite. We were given on the 12th floor and the bedroom was separate from a small leaving room/area. It looked really nice and the W has a special \"cool\" style. Gym: It is a small room but has all the essentials. Even though I am happy with the W because of its \"cool\" vibe, here is some deficiencies: 1) We experienced some miserable service at the restaurant - maybe it is because we got served by the bar tender but he was just a pretty bad waiter. But I will discuss that in a separate review. 2) Upon checking in, we went back to the reception area and asked for a bar of soap and slippers. Now, normally, there is a soap to wash your hands in the bathroom. It is such a basic necessity but somehow was forgotten. It is also nice to get slippers to use in the bathroom. When we asked at the reception desk, he just handed them to us. I would have expected that he has them sent to our room. 3) Elevator in the middle - supposed to work if you \"properly\" insert your room card. But it never worked with our cards in the three days we stayed there so we just used the other elevators where you don't have to insert your room card.

Subtly perched on a hill just below Sunset and within walking distance to UCLA, the hotel is a deliberate venue. You're unlikely to happen upon it, and it hasn't the \"Hey, look at me!\" glitz that the W in Hollywood airs. People are mellow here. They act \"normal\", unlike the posers who want everyone to think they're \"somebody\", the conspicuously insecure types, prowling around the lobby at the W, Hollywood. Most people here appear on business or on vacation. The men don't hide their wedding bands, and the women aren't all model wannabes. However, the Sunday pool parties and other public events (like the Friday and Saturday night club) are crashed by the broke but beautiful. As a parent, I like that the hotel draws families. Many mums and dads tote toddlers, and the pool is packed with t(w)eenie boppers, splashing about. However, the hotel couldn't be further from family-oriented. Children aren't allowed to \"indulge\" in any of the W's activities or even sit on the sofas in the lounge because they are associated with the bar, Whiskey Blue. In fact, the only place kids can be present outside of their rooms is in The Backyard, the pool area. Who wants to dine while inhaling chlorine every day? The only thing I didn't like about the pool setup is that unoccupied cabanas aren't available to guests without a $150 ransom. Here, you will bake under the SoCal sun or pay the cabana premium because there aren't even any umbrellas by the pool. Activity restrictions aside, the rooms make this W a gem. Hilltop views to the left; Wilshire Corridor views to the right. The \"Fabulous\" suite is basically a two-bedroom apartment without a kitchen. There is a living room, a bedroom, a wet bar, and an office with a pullout sofa. So far, this ranks as my favorite W, if for the suite features alone. ;-) P.S.

My only gripe is that the bathroom was small and could do with some drawers for toiletries. The bench space was not enough. I thought the showerhead looked a bit cheap but no complaints as the water pressure was good. I did note that the were no coffee/tea making facilities in the room but these are complimnetary at the ninethirty restaurant downstairs. Our corner room was nice and quiet. Staff here, particularly Kathrine (concierge) and Gary (doorman) were ever so obliging. Our 1 year old was really ill so she organised a few numbers for me to call and had the Accura complimentary car, take us to our chosen physician in Santa Monica. Gary organised to have our broken stroller repaired by the hotel's engineerng department. We did have trouble with a request for a microwave oven, needed to heat up our toddlers' meals and milk. When i made the booking, i spoke with reservation and told her it was imperative that we had one and that i would book a room based on whether we could get one. They said we could but when we arrived, i was told there wasnt one available but we would get the first one that became available. One did later that evening but \u00c2\u00a0quickly discovered that it was faulty. A call to them sent engineering to come and take a look at it and wasnt able to fix it. In the mean time, they sent a kettle which was fine. The next day, I had to call again to say no one had since been up to repair or replace the microwave. We had breakfast the first morning we were there. Offerings were good but a little pricey as with room service. Poolside restaurant was good and they staff were really friendly. Found the kids menu a little too pricey compared to other hotels. We were looking forward to taking out kids to the pool one day but it was closed for a photoshoot. The next day, we found that the pool wasnt heated and the cabanas were being cleaned so that was a disappointment. Had a blissful treatment at the Bliss Spa on level 2. This is a must do for any stay at the W. Be su to partake in the complimentary brownies in the lounge. Location is not bad. Near Ralphs, Trader Joes and Wholefoods if you need groceries. Short drive to Century City and Beverly Hills shopping. Note that valet is $35 a night. We booked online and there was package that included parking and 2 sip tickets for cocktails.

The issues, however, seem to be going on chain-wide as several of my last stays at Ws had been quite disappointing. You know something is wrong if at every single property of the chain you are staying at, you'll witness unhappy customers at reception arguing about issues they've encountered. Was the same here and I'm not surprised: The staff seem helplessly overworked, far too few people man the reception and there is hardly ever anyone at the concierge desk. Hence you can literally feel how unhappy and disengaged everyone is which shows in the service provided. Just a few examples were the Accura service which offers the last drive out at 5:15 (who needs it so well before dinner?) and then has an unshaven, hardly speaking driver- I remember that being much better from a few years back. Other usual issue was late check out but then getting the key cut only till noon. As a result I was standing in my bathrobe coming from the pool with water dripping from me at reception, no one caring and making me wait for ages. Then having the guts to ask me for ID! Good joke. Ah and the \"Whatever whenever\" as in almost all W hotels these days totally overpromised: Tried once, no one picked up. Tried twice, person on other end totally stressed and trying to get rid of you as fast as possible. Property itself also a total disappointment: Besides the horrid location (in the middle of no where next to a uni campus, 25 bucks plus for a cab ride each way to get to Hollywood or West Hollywood), the building is an old and ugly concrete block that clearly shows its age. Pool in reality is muuuch smaller than shown on their website and worst of it all, the walls throughout the building are paper thin and most guests seem to be teens and twens who share (officially or inofficially) share their rooms with three four others in order to afford them and then make use of that by partying all night- very classy. Bathrooms have simple stuck to the wall shower heads and come with a yuck old shower curtain (!), like in one of those mouldy hotels from the 80ies. All in all an utter disappointment, cancelled my upcoming trip in March straight away and instead booked with the competition. If you're staying in the area, I would recommend the Andaz in West Hollywood or the Rennaissance up on Hollywood Boulevard- both offer better service than the W, are usually cheaper even and definitely are located better.

This hotel is not on par with the quality of other high end hotels that the W competes against. The furnishings look like they are a product of the \"design on a dime\" team at HGTV. Bulky, white painted 70's wood furniture, massive dated hardware that looks like it belongs in a dungeon, and a fiberglass bathtub you'd find at any Holiday Inn, and plumbing that you can hear working several rooms away. Not sure what this building was before it became a hotel, but they really missed the boat. Simply put, the quality of construction and amenities is crap. Natural lighting on most of the rooms that face the interior of this \"H\" shaped building is terrible, and compounded by plantation shutters that don't match the chic-esq decor that the hotel tries to project. In the morning, the plumbing is so loud it woke us up. Adding to the negative vibe here is that there stress having everything you want, many things that most hotels offer, like an in-room coffee machine do not exist. I don't want to have to get dressed to get my first cup of joe in the morning, nor do I want to pay $8 for it either. In a day and age when most hotels comp internet to their frequent visitors, the W charges. I stay at a lot of SPG properties and haven't had to pay in a long time, until now.

In this case they deliver on a few things but miss the mark on most. Most of the problems relate to design and upkeep, starting with the fact that the hallways and room smelled old and musty throughout our stay. I brought this to the attention of whatever/whenever who could only have housekeeping 'spray', which didn't solve the problem. The problem could likely be solved by being able to open the small windows in the room, but maintenance claimed that they could only be opened by four inches, hence there is little if any fresh air in the rooms. Speaking of windows, the exterior windows were absolutely filthy, looked liked they haven't been washed in years. The windows are small to begin with, allow little light in the rooms, and they have these overly large shutters on the inside of the windows. Combine inability to open windows with dirty, small windows and you have a room that smells stale. Old windows are also not double glazed and the room was noisy - we heard traffic , pool noise, gardeners working all day and night despite being mid-lvel in a largely residential neighborhood. Bathroom was disproportionally small compared to the room itself, had only a single sink with very little counter space and nowhere to store toiletries. Tub/shower was standard (small) and with non-hygenic creepy shower curtain that stuck to you while shower was on. Wood veneer was fraying off bathroom door, grout was moldy and there was no exhaust fan in bathroom. Other than that, the West Elm inspired hipster room with funky decor was ok. Pool area was pleasant enough, but furniture was shabby, lounges torn and stained and the pool itself wasn't the infinity variety one would expect in a hip boutique hotel in LA. It seemed like the old pool from whatever the property was before W took over. Only positive I can think of was a friendly staff, who were always eager to help.

I send back. They bring me a new pot (but no cup). Hmmm. Come back to room second evening after all day meetings, and room had not been cleaned. I was told short staffed--really, on the busiest weekend in LA with the Emmys? Phone near bed didn't work, and I advised them first day. Was never fixed entire four days. Noticed that lobby area near bar and the hallways were not cleaned often. Normally, could care less, but it was very unpleasant to see the same used martini and wine glasses in the lobby and the food trays sitting outside people's doors for days on end. And the hotel could use a better vacuum. Now with all of these minor nits, I did politely raise concerns with front desk etc. Each was met with a lovely smile, a knowing head-shake, and some charming lne about \"whatever we Whenever, what is your wish\" or something. Sadly, nothing was done. At check out, I again expressed my concerns and I think they really do care---but I would suspect nothing was done.

The guest services lady told me they would bring that up, when that took a while I called again then being told that there was a surcharge for a pickup after 9. I told her that I called before 9 am but that delivery could not be made because of the lack of laundry lists.

During my stay on the fourth of July weekend and days prior to seeing my monthly credit card statement, I was very happy with the W Los Angeles Westwood hotel. After that I'm still pissed. The Room - I stayed at the Spectacular Suite. The room looked somewhat similar to the pictures on the hotel website - spacious and nice, however, some signs of dated (particular the couch and its pillow cases) and I was a bit freak out by the countless mold-like spots on the circular mirror above the bed (still unable to figure out whether it was the original design or the real mold). Thin wall though, can easily hear the conversation from the hallway and the big bangs when other guests shutting their doors. No problem with plumbing as mentioned by other reviewers. The Staff and Service - Nice and very friendly staff. Anyway I still wonder why they kept telling me their names. I asked for a quiet room and they did assign me the nice one on the north wing. I didn't have a chance to try Acura Experience which is a drop-off service within 5 miles of the hotel (they don't do pick-up just simply drop-off). The service available M-F 7am-3pm, SAT-SUN 10am-6pm. The free Wi-Fi - I managed to access the hotel free Wi-Fi in my room (on the 14th floor) both on laptop and iPhone for the entire stay. I first logged on to the free Wi-Fi at the lobby from my phone - select the Living_Room Wi-Fi The Pool - The pool is relatively small and suitable for kids, don't trust what you see from the website. Private cabana looks great but they charge you for it. The Neighborhood - Westwood is such a nice neighborhood, the hotel located on the skirt of UCLA campus (one reviewer said the W used to be the UCLA dorm, I didn't have a chance to verify it). Many nice restaurants, cinemas and shops, you name it from Trader Joe's, RiteAid, CVS, Ralphs, Best Buy, AT&T, T-Mobile, Radio Shack, Urban Outfitters to Victoria's Secret. I'd recommend Le Pain Quotidien and Elysee for breakfast. Napavalley Grille has a beautiful outdoor seating area but mediocre food, not sure why it was packed. The sushi place right next to Le Pain Quotidien is so so. From the Airport - I took Prime Shuttle which costs $15. I guess Super Shuttle offers the same price. The GIMMICK and UGLY ENDING - You gotta watch your bills and your credit card statement. The hotel charged my credit card for minibar without my knowledge after I left. During the check out, they told me everything is all set, no extra charge since I prepaid for my room on the hotel website. Fortunately, after checked out, I was waiting for my friend to pick me up for about an hour at the lobby which they could have told me if something was missing but they didn't. When I saw the charge on my credit card statement, I rang them up and they told me it was a charge from the minibar and said can't do anything, I've to contact billing dept directly during the office hours (M-F/9-5). I wrote them and they gave me a refund about a week after. But still, I'm pissed. So without bad ending that they charged me for something that I didn't consume or service that I didn't use, I'd have rated my stay highly. Unfortunately, the rip-off scheme dragged down the whole customer satisfaction level. And I won't stay at this property again because of this incident. It's a big disappointment for the hotel in this class. I saw similar mention from other customers too so think twice before you book or hand them your credit cards. Good luck!

We did park at the hotel the first nigh which was $35/night...but to be honest, I travel a lot for work and in every major CITY (not the burbs) that is not unheard of and is fairly common rate...I paid the same in Atlanta. BUT one tip I might add for those staying is that we found parking literally right around the corner every single other day/night!! Yes, they have parking meters, but we put in a couple of dollars and it was good for a few hours...more than enough time for us to get ready or between our outings and then after 8pm it was free until 8am (M-S) or 11am(Sun). There was an open parking spot every time, so I'd highly recommend if you aren't just hanging out at the hotel all day. But when we did use the valet, they were superb!!! They offered us bottled water for our trip out for the day and if we needed anything else. The location is great also! It's not right in the middle of BH, but literally right down the road from the Bev Hilton and all the Rodeo Drive/Robertston Blvd fun!! I loved the location (PS: Try Paris Bakery around the corner). Hmmm, trying to think of the cons....still thinking....oh, right, we thought the hairdryer was too small...you know how girls need a big hairdryer! And if THAT is the only thing I can come up with, then I'd say this is a definite A+ for the W LA!!! It was my cousin's first trip to LA and she said she loved the hotel and the great service they gave us! We'd definitely come back and recommend to anyone!!! Please pass on our thanks to all of your staff and hope that we see y'all again soon!!! Thanks W LA for a great trip (we also loved the nice plate of fruit you had for us when we arrived in our room!).", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended - save time, money, and aggravation by choosing another hotel\u201d", "Author": "TouristSanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR115070429", "Content": "This hotel did not live up to my expectations. I should have read the reviews prior to our visit. The W Hotel in Westwood tries too hard to be hip. In doing so, they really miss the mark. The exterior of the hotel is aged and unattractive, but the club atmosphere starts with the blue lighted stairs and continues to the lounge like lobby with loud music. If traveling with children, avoid the pool which is small, crowded and filled with drunk young adults making out on chaise lounge chairs. Even the cabana interiors have silhouettes of people dancing with hands in the air. We drove to LA and called the hotel 5 minutes out to see if our rooms were ready, the front desk stated that they could not tell me until I was at the hotel. I told them the cross streets and explained that we would be there in a few minutes if the room was ready, but would rather come later if it was not ready. They again stated that I had to be there in person at the front desk before they could provide any information. Upon arrival, I was told that our rooms were not ready. I mentioned that they needed to be connecting (as we told the reservation specialist and was noted in our confirmation). He told me that the hotel had no connecting rooms and that ours were on separate floors. 45 minutes later, he found 2 rooms on a low floor that were next to each other. He gave me the key to one. It was a queen (we reserved and paid for a king) and was cramped with a garden view (which actually meant we looked out onto the roof). I told the front desk that the selection was not acceptable and told him we would sight see and return later that evening. At 7PM, we returned and were given keys to our new rooms. They were on the same floor and down the hall from each other. Not really what we wanted since the 2nd room was for our children. Every time we needed to interact, we had to dress and head down the hall. We ended up with a queen (downgraded from what we paid for). They layout of the rooms is odd at best. Small bathrooms with shower/ tub combo, plastic trash cans, 1 robe, no slippers, and limited bath amenities - basically what you'd expect at a Holiday Inn. The bathroom did not connect to the bed room. The water heater made the temp too hot or warm with alternating cold. The desk chairs are hard plastic and too low to be useful. Poor lighting. The beds are firm - almost futon like. There is only 1 extra pillow to provide a total of three and no extra blanket. The windows do not provide adequate sound proofing from the party at the pool and the shutters without blackout curtains ensure that you will be up with the sun. There is no newspaper delivery nor turndown service. We called for slippers and waited 45 min the 1st night before canceling the order and re-ordering the following day. The carpet in the hallway was never vacuumed during our 3 day stay and there was hair in our bathroom and in bedroom drawers. Parking was $35 per day. Wi-fi is $14.99 per 24 hours (noon to noon). We were there for a birthday (as noted on the reservation), but no acknowledgement was made by management. Upon receipt of our bill, we noted that we were charged parking for 2 vehicles and also a mini bar item that we did not consume. The best things about the hotel are the: Valet attendants - polite and prompt Location- adjacent to UCLA campus Fun restaurants and snacks - Ditty Reese, Barney's Beanery, Stans Donuts You can experience the fun of Westwood at other hotels.

The following incidents occurred: 1. Upon arrival late Thursday night, my sister and I were given a suite with a Queen at a rate of $389. I recalled that we had a King, and the next morning on my way out the door, I asked about it. The woman at the front desk would not give me the King without my confirmation or unless I would pay an extra $30 or $40 a night. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my reservation confirmation with me, but I found it later that day, and our reservation confirmation stated we had a suite with a King for $369. This was remedied Friday afternoon upon another visit to the front desk. We were ultimately charged $389 for the room, but on Sunday when I checked out, I was able to get the price adjusted to the quoted rate. 2. When I woke up in our suite with a Queen on Friday morning. I went to the bathroom to shower and inside the tub there was a brown/black splatter liquid everywhere. It looked like mud or sewage or someone had been violently ill all over the tub. I immediately called the concierge to have it fixed. I waited a half hour and no one came. I had an appointment I had to make, so I called back. Someone finally came within the hour. He cleaned up the mess but said that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need to come back to clear out the drain. I had to shower and get ready to leave, so I showered in water that literally came up to my knees. Disgusting. 3. We switched rooms Friday afternoon. Again, the shower in our second room filled up to mid calf every time we showered. This is absolutely filthy. 4. Our second room, like the first, mysteriously only had one robe. I requested one on Friday afternoon. None arrived. I requested one late Friday evening. None arrived. I called for a third time Saturday afternoon for a robe, and finally one arrived. 5. Upon arrival in the second room, I went to grab a glass. The glass was covered in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protective/sanitary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plastic, but it also was covered in a yellow fugusy film around the rim. I called for new glasses. None arrived. I called for new glasses with the robe late Friday evening, and they finally arrived. In addition, it was quite shocking that housekeeping did not remove this filthy glass from the room when they cleaned it on Saturday. While all of these things were unacceptable for a hotel with such a high rate, what was so baffling to me was the fact that no one asked me how my stay was (even on check out when I was getting our bill adjusted!!!), tried to remedy any of these situations, or seem to really care about our stay.

They assured me my trip would be Fabulous. I went ahead and booked the room. Once you open the doors of The W you enter what they call \"the living room\". It's a spacious open floor plan with seating perfectly suited for mingling. The young lady at the front desk checked us in quickly and pointed out some of the amenities of The W. Once giving your keycard, you enter the elevator that has a tiny camera that shows still frame images of you with sayings like \"show us your moves.\" My wife and I danced in the elevator till we reached our floor. Our Spectacular room was nice. Although it was small, It was nicely decorated and not too cluttered or overdone. When you walk in the room had a glass reading table with two chairs. Take a couple steps and there was a 42\" plasma tv on a swivel above a wrap around couch. The bed was made up with extra thick blankets and padding. And made me sleepy looking at it. The bathroom was nice and clean. After we checked in to our Spectacular Suite, I had to go to the music studio to do some recording. My wife found herself by the pool a few minutes later and had fun relaxing poolside. She also enjoyed the spa. The location was great. I was able to get to Rodeo Dr, Hollywood, Venice Beach and other sight seeing locations easily. We danced the night away at the club. I wish our stay was a little longer.

Usually a visitor to the Sofitel near the Beverly Centre, I chose W Westwood based on a previous stay at W San Francisco. And was delighted with my choice. The W is a trendy, uber cool hotel nestled in the middle of suburbia in Westwood - which itself is a cool little enclave of great shopping and places to eat. The W itself has a great restaurant and popular bar area, as well as a relaxed outdoor pool. The lobby and \"lounge room\" area of reception are relaxed and comfortable, and modern in design. Sadly arrival at your room will see you settle into a nice (but slightly dated) separate lounge and bedroom area. The cool factor in the rooms is starting to show it's age a little but the bed is super comfy and the layout generous. The staff were always friendly and helpful, and genuinely interested that you were having an enjoyable stay. Bliss Spa is worth checking out where you can enjoy an amazingly relaxing massage.

We really appreciate the convenience and high standards of this hotel property. The staff throughout the hotel really seems to enjoy what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. They truly understand the hospitality business. The property is spotless, and the rooms are very clean and modern. We regularly dine at the hotel and major changes have recently occurred. Although we had always been happy with the food at Nine Thirty (which is the street address of the hotel) and the Backyard, we were anticipating the arrival of the new chef, Dakota Weiss, at the beginning of the year. We had heard from Ren Hirose, the GM, and restaurant managers Chris Cazares and Stephanie Sanders that she had survived an amazing round of tastings, up against some 20-plus other chefs. No doubt the competition was fierce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sounds like it could have been a ubiquitous reality show. We gave her about three weeks to settle in before heading over for our first visit, and the verdict is in. Naturally, in such a short time she hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely redone the menus, but her touches were already apparent. For example, the previous chef had an appetizer (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153side,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referred to there) of Brussels sprouts. Many people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly care for Brussels sprouts, but these were good. Very good. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re something we never would have previously thought to order off a menu. Dakota Weiss changed the seasonings and made the preparation healthier (grilled rather than fried), and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the old version at all. Being independently creative, Dakota moved on from Brussels sprouts to create an appetizer of baby artichokes in smoked garlic aioli and chopped basil that is also healthy, flavorful and out of this world. Her new creations are full of twists. A very grown up macaroni and cheese uses very small, round pasta (their true name escapes us), with bacon, apple bits and garlic bread crumbs. This is definitely not the fake orange powdered boxed stuff we all made growing up, nor even an adult version of a traditional mac and cheese. Other sides were delightfully different \u00e2\u20ac\u201c charred broccoli with lemon, red chili oil and parmesan. Honestly, if all food were prepared and served this way, multitudes of children wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have grown up afraid to try anything green, healthy and supposedly boring. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working our way through the menu \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we often order several sides (and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smalls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which are truly a few bites to share), some of which show up time and time again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and entrees (a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for every palate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seafood, fish, chicken, steak. A favorite is the beef bourguignon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anyone who has watched \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Julie and Julia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might try it for that reason alone, but it is quite satisfying. And the desserts are lots of fun and creative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who would think of a chocolate creation, including chocolate puffed rice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a tall parfait glass? Everything is beautifully plated. But the most fun is Dakota herself. We asked to meet her after our first meal and have spoken with her several times since, and all we can say is, what fun. She definitely looks the part of a creative person. If you saw her on the street, you might think she was an actress. Always bubbly and charming, her tone indicates her love for what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing, which is good given the long hours and weighty expectations. Although many very creative people are thought of as not being terribly business-minded or organized (yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stereotype, but there is a reason they exist!), her comments indicate her seriousness about how she runs her kitchen. There, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely the captain of the ship and she expects it to be run with precision and excellence -- but for the staff to enjoy it as well.

It was the weekend of the Oscars so the hotel was sold out and when I arrived at approximately 11pm, they told me that had upgraded me once, but had to upgrade me again since they were completely sold out. Worked for me, I got to stay in an amazing Mega suite. A bit unnecessary for my 8 hours in the hotel (only spent sleeping), but the 8-room suite was incredible. Very nicely done and very spacious, there was a huge entryway with wet bar area, which lead to a bathroom on the right and one bedroom, a table area straight ahead and a large couch area with TV, etc. Off of that, there was a room with a couch and a desk, another bedroom and another bathroom with a huge soaking tub. I really can't say I experienced much of the hotel since I was there only to sleep, but the little service I had was pretty good. The hotel is missing some of the touches I've experienced at other Ws (personal notes or message on the phone welcoming me) and even when I was being checked in, the man seemed a bit like he was doing me a favor giving me the upgrade. Trust me, I appreciate it, but it's also their choice -- it's a much better experience when they say with excitement, we have a great room for you! without making you feel like you owe them something more. I think the location is great, you can walk to Westwood shops and restaurants so in the morning it was easy to pick something up at the Coffee Bean. I was even able to find street parking overnight. The hotel was chaotic on a Thu night, very trendy, but I didn't have any issue with the noise once I was in my room. I agree with the one comment about the lighting though -- there are lights everywhere but not a lot of light switches so you're attempting to find the switch on each light in the dark which is a bit of a pain. I will consider this hotel again if I get a deal and it actually looks like I need to go back to my LA office next month, so I will check at this hotel first.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cStay away\u201d", "Author": "mndnyc", "ReviewID": "UR97902288", "Content": "Both the physical plant and the service are not up to standard at the W in Westwood.

The feeling was almost claustrophobic. 2) Parking is only valet for > $30/night. Many of the side-streets you can't part on because they are either residential or part of UCLA. 3) My room had non-working light switches. 4) The tub didn't drain. 5) I couldn't wash my hands without my hands hitting the faucet and the sink basin at the same time. 6) There were not many restaurants to choose from around the area.

What a great trip! We were celebrating two birthdays (one late Dec / the other early Jan) with a long 3-night weekend and after reading reviews and looking at many of the Starwood properties I know I picked the right place. First, I was booked into the new W Hollywood and after reading horrible reviews of noise and partying all night I decided that was not the scene we were looking for. Then, booked the Sheraton Delfina Santa Monica (we've been there before, nice but nothing overly special) and because I wanted to be closer to Beverly Hills area made a reservation for the SLS. Then decided that would be overkill (and dark) so finally ended up at the W Westwood. The right choice. What was best about it? The Service. I had let the hotel know that we were celebrating a birthday (via e-mail) and as a SPG Gold member anything they could do upgrade wise would be appreciated. Upon check-in I was offered a corner Spectacular Suite on a high floor (which was great since there were just the two of us, about 600sf). As I used Starpoints, I could have paid to upgrade to one of the bigger suites ($60-$200 a night) but this one meet our needs just fine. The bed was the highlight--really comfy. Check-in was a breeze, the suite was ready (benefit of checking in on a Thursday). Was even asked if I needed a 4 pm checkout on Sunday (nice touch!). Was taken up to the room and not long after we arrived a up came a bottle of champagne and a little chocolate cake with a card from Ren the GM. How cool is that? That is one of the reasons I stay loyal to Starwood-- most of them know how to take care of their frequent guests. As I majored in hospitality and worked in several hotels, I know how difficult it is to try and please everyone and we loyal guests can be demanding. :) Whenever I called for wine glasses, extra towels or to get the room serviced quickly someone was there in 5 minutes. Amazing. Folks on the phone were friendly and professional and were able to answer my questions. A note about the area--it seemed like a strange for a W Hotel to be. I usually think of them as beach front or in the heart of the city. I'm assuming this hotel was something else and was converted into a W. They did a good job. Few things to note: The AT&T iPhone Service was great from the suite. Full 3G - good signal strength. Was a nice surprise. I wish the bathroom in our suite was bigger and more modern. It was really small and the toilet faced the sink. Very strange set-up. When checking in I found out that many of the suites don't have bath tubs (just showers) and we wanted a tub so maybe that's the reason. Don't know how big the shower only ones are. Bring a portable speaker system for your iPod/iPhone if you want to listen to music in your suite. I was surprised that it was missing since it seems like that is common in the W's I've stayed in. With the strange residential like location, you aren't going to get amazing views from your suite like you would if you were closer to the beach or the hills. And, because the hotel was most likely a refurb the windows are small and have shutters. All furniture is modern, TV's are new and the bed comfy. There is only one robe in the suite which is strange. You have to call for another one. Maybe they get more solo business travelers there? The facility itself is the perfect size. Great lobby lounging (a W trademark) and bar area out by the pool with complimentary coffee in the cafe each morning. FYI, housekeeping will also bring up a coffee maker to your room upon request but the coffee downstairs is much better and worth trekking down for. One disappointment is the pool itself. Really small pool (it's much smaller than the picture makes it out to be) and it is very cold... i couldn't go in but a few kids braved it and went in. Cabanas are nice -- the entire pool deck could use a face lift and a large group hot tub would be a great addition to the place. There is room for one. The 24 hour complimentary gym is great-- cold towels for your face after working out along with green apples. Way cool. Watch your face in the elevator... funny and creative. You'll realize what I'm taking about once you are inside the elevator. :) Sunday brunch is a great deal for the areq. For 20.11 you get two courses. Show your SPG card and get 15% off your bill. We sat out by the water fall/pool and had a nice brunch. Food was tasty. Many folks have remarked about pricing. For those of you that don't want to spend $38 a night for Valet and don't mind walking a block, there is a garage that does overnight parking with in and out privileges for $14 a night (cash only, tax included). In addition, you can avoid the overpriced mini-bar by walking a few blocks to Trader Joes. There is also a Riteaid, CVS, Ralph's market, Wholefoods and even a Best Buy right near the hotel. We had a few drinks at the lounge bar but went to TJ's and brought back snacks, water and some wine to share with friends who were visiting us in our room. The hotel is laid back and didn't seem to have a problem with it. They also will bring up whatever extra glasses you need (just tip please!) We had a great lunch a Angelinos (6 min walk from the hotel, Yelp it). Family run and excellent food. $10 bucks gets you their daily pasta special (generous portion) and a salad. It was really good and I high recommend it. We walked around the area and it primarily caters to college students. Looks like some of the more expensive restaurants have gone under and there are lots of for lease signs out where retail shops used to be. You'll find plenty of burger and pizza joints, Starbucks, Peets, Subway, etc. I guess it is a sigh of the times. Need an ATM, they are close... you can easily walk to most places. If you have a car, be sure to check out Nook Bistro. It's about a 15 min drive from the hotel but the food is amazing. Small place and reservations are highly recommended. If you have an iPhone, download the Nook app and you can win a free drink or desert. Very creative idea. Popular place -- we couldn't get a reservation but went anyway and had to beg to get in... it worked, barely. :) Heading over to West Hollywood? Traffic is a nightmare, especially on Wilshire. Make sure allow ample time to get around during rush hour. Ok, I think I've rambled on enough. This place is worth it. Thank you Ren and your amazing staff for a wonderful time and excellent service.

Our industry had offered a few hotels at a discounted rate downtown near the convention center, but after reading terrible reviews of both hotels I decided to spend the extra money (and travel-time) to stay at the W in Westwood. I'm very glad I did. Upon arrival (at 4:30am pst, thanks delayed flight) we were greeted by a friendly and helpful valet. The woman who worked at the front desk was amazing. She made check-in very easy, she even gave us a free upgrade to a suite \"just because\"...I didn't even have to ask. She signed me up for the Starwood Preferred Guests program which I hadn't known about until that point. LOVE the decor and look of the hotel. From the ivy climbing up the exterior to asian-inspired lobby, very cool. Our room: VERY clean. Did a thorough inspection for bedbugs because I'm a psychopath...the bed was immaculate. Love the Bliss Spa products in the bathroom. My boyfriend made me buy him \"Soapy Sap\" when we got home. Very quiet. Came in late Saturday night/morning and the lounge/bar downstairs was still crowded and loud but I couldn't hear a thing in my room. Proximity to downtown LA: About 30 minutes including traffic. I'd say it's worth the extra time, though. Westwood is a great area. Selling point: In-N-Out burger a few blocks away. Room service breakfast: A little pricey but it was delicious. It's a W hotel...you get what you pay for. Only con: While we were out the bathtub and sink faucets leaked weird black stuff. I probably wouldn't have noticed except I left a wash cloth drying on the side of the sink. Not a big deal at all.

A short walk down the tree-lined mostly residential street brings you to several major thoroughfares, with shops and restaurants aplenty. Head up Weyburn Ave. three blocks to the intersection of Westwood Blvd and you'll be in an area that feels like a little college town. I-405 is only a few minutes away by car, and the trip to Santa Monica took about 15 or 20 minutes (much longer at rush hour).

The pancake breakfast downstairs was quite good, but definitely not worth the more than $25 with tax and tip. The room was clean and modern, and fairly spacious. My only complaint about the room was the lack of outlets anywhere close to the bed. So if you want to charge your phone overnight and leave it next to the bed you're out of luck (though the hotel did provide an industrial-strength extension cord when I asked). There's also a kiosk in the lobby for free printing of airline boarding passes. Finally, the big disappointment was the fitness center. While it is fairly well-equipped, with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, balance balls, free weights and machines, it felt extremely cramped. It was also so dark the I couldn't even read the numbers printed on the machines' weight stacks (or the instructions). That was an annoyance, but could also be a safety issue and should be corrected.

At $30 per day it may be considered expensive but not excessive in my view. The Hotel has all the features standard to a W, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little smaller so there is only 1 bar ( quite nice with a good cocktail menu and wide range of booze for late night drinking ) and 1 restaurant choice in house. There is a gym, pool, day spa and other such facilities tucked away within so your not going without if the need arises on any front. The Room I booked was a Suite, I was surprised by the size with a very sitting room and smaller bedroom and small but usable bathroom that probably is due to refurb in the next year or so but was still immaculately clean and well presented at all times. The Rooms d\u00c3\u00a9cor is typical W its chic, cool, unusual even zany in places.

I am a Starwood Preferred Guest and I've never seen anything like this in terms of lack of responsiveness and lack of Customer Services. I am also a business traveler, have been travelling for 30 years and I have never had a negative experience like this that a hotel has apparently taken so lightly. I'll give my business to the many nice Marriotts in the area. Suffice it to say, myself and my colleagues have no intention of staying at this hotel again. I was travelling on Corporate Business so I will be notifiying Corporate Travel as well. PS: SPG called me to tell me that indeed there was \"an error\". . .really? what a surprise.

The room had a large sectional sofa, and was full of all sorts of nick-knacks, making it feel more like a home. They sent up a bottle of wine and some candied nuts that were delicious. The bathroom was a decent size, had high-end bath products (Bliss), and had an excellent shower. Needless to say, coming home each night and waking up in the morning were always a pleasure. Parking was $32 a night, a bit steep for LA, but the valet's always had our car ready w/ in 5 minutes of calling. The concierge always had suggestions for sights, and printed directions if we needed.

I took advantage of the SPG program and paid through points. Keep that in mind for the rest of the review. I am a SPG Platinum. I checked into this hotel on a Thursday night, just before the July 4 weekend. On the drive up, the hotel is located adjacent to UCLA and a very residential area. I almost didn't notice the hotel until my wife pointed to the \"W\" on the side of the hotel. The exterior looked nondescript. The valet was extremely courteous when I drove up beside them as I wasn't sure where to \"stop\" the car. I arrived early, around 11 am, and didn't expect to have a room ready. The pre-allocated room wasn't ready but a simliar room on a lower level was. I declined in favour of the higher floor room and had them hold my bags while I went out & about the local area. I returned many hours later and found out they had upgraded me to a 2 room suite. Unbelievable! The lobby areas and the front of the hotel was super chic. It was in line with other W's. The elevator has a built-in camera that \"plays\" with a photo of the elevator occupants. Kind of a fun and unassuming way to ensure privacy and security. Upon arriving to my suite, I immediately noticed it was huge. Not beside the elevator (which I hate elevator and associated guest noise) but in a recessed corner. The furnishings are funky. They are modern, without try to hard to look it. Lots of art around the rooms. There was a full-size LCD in the living room and a smaller LCD in the bedroom. The 2nd room was more of a workspace which mainly comprised of a sofa and workdesk. Hey, works for me as I can't get enough desk space. There were several thermostats around the room controlling ambient temperature in each. The A/C units were more than able to handle the July heat. In fact, I had to turn up the temperature as it was getting a little frosty. The bathroom was very large. Good counter space. As opposed to a shower curtain, I got a funky half-glass with a hole. While aesthetically pleasing, you can probably imagine it was tough trying not to let out too much water from the mssing half of the glass. Interestingly enough, Thurs night was super busy due to some event happening. Having said that, even though I could hear some noise in the living room, it was completely quiet in the bedroom. Fri night was extremely quiet in comparison. The service received, from everyone, was literally incredible. Everyone introduced themselves and remembered and greeted me by name every time. Am I in a W or a Ritz Carlton?. I mean that in a good way. Front desk - excellent. Concierge - excellent. Valet - surprisingly excellent. Anywhere, anything phone service - excellent. Before you think I'm a shill working for the W, do note that I've been a SPG Platinum for many years and have tried hotels all over the world. This is probably one of the best, if not the best experience, that I've had in any hotel in North America. Certainly better than most European luxe hotels and certainly on par with Asian luxe hotels. In comparison to the W Seattle, which I stay at frequently, this W is clearly superior. Would I return? Absolutely. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend? I'll do that even without them asking me. Was it all perfect? No. An extra charge appeared on my CC after checking out. However, a quick call to billing and it was sorted out. Another problem occurred when they brought up my bags. They only brought up one and both tags were attached to that one. I was getting worred they had lost my other one but, no problems, as it was shortly brought up. I enjoyed this stay so much, I even emailed Starwood corporate. I never do that. Ever. Tips: 1) The restaurants in the nearby village are high quality and not that busy. I got into Palomino without any problems, unheard of in Seattle. Good food at decent prices. 2) Free internet in the lobby for guests. 3) If your room faces the BACKYARD, you might find an interesting WiFi signal. 4) There is a Best Buy and a Ralph's a block away.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThey Could've Tried Just A Little Bit Harder....................\u201d", "Author": "NYC_Pat_C", "ReviewID": "UR33481253", "Content": "The W Los Angeles Westwood is a quaint hotel in a residential area which we loved.

The first thing I noticed was several large employees standing around the entrance steps, wearing those silly mini microphones and curly behind the ear Secret Service earphones. Even though I was wearing a tie and a jacket, I felt uncomfortable just walking up the steps to the front door. I expected to see a nice lobby, essentially a public place that one can check out. Instead, it is really a large foyer, with a check in desk and elevators. I was quickly accosted by an ostensibly friendly large employee who asked \"May I help you?\", but more in the manner that a retail clerk asks if they suspect someone is shoplifting!! I explained that I was just visiting the property, scouting it for a possible future trip, and the employee nicely took me out into the garden area ,told me when lunches and Sunday brunches are served, etc.. I thanked him for the tour and left,feeling that I had been \"handled\". I have stayed in major hotels all over the world, and so I don't think I was overwhelmed or intimidated, but instead I got the impression that this place is stuck on itself as a very \"secure\" place for celebrities, and that the guys in the lobby and the front step area have a Kevin Costner \"bodyguard\" complex. So maybe it is just \"me\" in this case, but I think this place is overly impressed with itself. I have not experienced this at the Beverly Hills Hotel or the Huntington in Pasadena.

Great seating area with couches and comfy chairs! Whiskey Blue had a crowd on Saturday night and we had to show our room key to get into the hotel and once again for the elevator. Was crowded and did not visit that night. We did have drinks the first night, $12-$14 a drink, standard LA prices. Valet is very attentive and always willing to give great directions for those traveling without a GPS. Valet is $32 per night with unlimited in/out. Arriving late on evening I found that my room key was not working. You do need a key to get up in the elevator to your room, but my friend's key worked for that. My fault for carrying my key next to my cell phone, but the front desk was helpful -- and keeping a hooker in her place. She was demanding to contact a room (didn't have room number but only a name and it wasn't a full name..hmmmm) and the front desk simply told her she could use the courtesy phone and the operator would connect her to the room if she had the full name .. The lovely hooker in her fashionable cut off shorts and extremal high heels used some colorful language that allowed security to remove her. I like the idea that they do take care of their guest's security and volume levels. It allows a relaxing time. The rooms are quite and the do tell you in the in room guide that no parties are allowed in the suites and violators will be evicted. So if you are coming here to have a big party -- better think twice! I liked this as it allows you to sleep in peace!!! This hotel has excellent customer service at all points of contact. People are friendly and seem to enjoy their job! I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is planning on visiting Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, UCLA, Hollywood and Santa Monica..close to all. For those without a car, they do offer transportation within 10 miles by booking the house car at no cost.

The third part of the suite was a lounge/bar area with another large flat screen TV, and also DVD player and iPod dock. As with most hotels there was a mini bar, and snacks to buy. These were extortionately priced, and if you did purchase a bottle of water at $8 you then had to pay a 20% restocking fee also.

Rooms are all very large with sitting area for entertaining, desk, fridge, nice bathroom, and great bed as always at the W. Staff is very kind and attentive, they definitely have a little \"Hollywood\" edge to them, but are very helpful & kind. However, be prepared to spend money...lot's of money if hanging out at the hotel and pool. It's hard not to spend $20 just walking around the place. Spend a couple hours at the pool and you'll be down a hundred or so bucks in a heartbeat. I went there expecting everything to be expensive, but I blew through money so quick it was scary. In addition, this may sound odd, but as nice as the room and atmosphere was...it really got on my nerves after a full day of hanging out. The best way I could describe it is that it's a place for every Hollywood \"Wannabe\" and the occasional actual movie or TV star to visit. You go out to the pool, and every local wannabe movie star, singer, or otherwise comes there to be seen, and I mean \"be seen\". The sights are incredible and WELL worth the time at the pool (do not bring someone under the age of 17 to the pool). However, the fakeness is so thick it'll gag you...it's like being at a live Broadway show, but you're in real life. The girls and guys are top notch, but they also feel like they ALL have to act the part - all the time, which get's annoying. They even set-up a fake security force (it's real security, but not at ALL needed) with velvet ropes outside of the hotel at night with guys having the ear-piece radios and everything to keep the \"lesser cool\" crowd out of the hotel lounges/clubs. It's kind of funny to watch because it makes you feel like you're going to the most exclusive hang-out in the world, but it's really not - it's just a show so they feel like they're one of those super exclusive Hollywood clubs...again, all the \"Wannabe's\" come rolling back in for the night shift. I know this review sounds crazy, but it's one of those things you have to \"see to believe\". It's a great place to stay and experience a great atmosphere - but if you go there to hang out all day/night, it will drive you crazy and cost tons of money unless you have 6-pack abs, and a face of gold, a million dollar wardrobe, and another million sitting in the bank.

Wait is just what I did. Feeling that there was absolutely no reason to wait since it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t busy at all downstairs, I called the front desk to request that the bags be brought up soon. At the Renaissance, the bellman waits while you check in and then follows you in the same elevator to your room with your bags.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if the hotel never did an analysis of basics that traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s need. There was no place around the sink to put anything except a toothbrush and the toothpaste. There was no makeup table and mirror. The closets were tiny and there were no dresser drawers big enough to lay more clothes in them, except for the small ones in the closet. At the Renaissance, in fact, at every Marriott, there is always a makeup area with a mirror. There are always large dresser drawers. The sink area has plenty of room to lay out your toiletries. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I called for the concierge and the operator put me on hold (with my permission), but then she came back on the line sounding very flustered and asked if she could take a message for the concierge.

PRICE: I paid $279 for one night and the other night I used my 12,000 SPG points. ****Suggestion****** If you use points only, you might not get an upgrade. Since I paid for a night and I asked the booking agent to put a note on my file to request an upgrade, I was being upgraded to a suite, which was very comfortable and spacious. However, the best deal is to use points and cash, which is $89 a night and 4,000 points. So for 2 nights you will end up using 8,000 points and only $180 but you need to book ahead to avoid blackout dates. PARKING: Some attacked the $31 valet parking fee but I found it being rather fair, considering we have in and out privilege, and we stayed for 2 nights 3 days there but W only charge $62 for about 20 times in and out. POOL area is VERY nice and hip with great music; fruit juice/apples for free. BREAKFAST: Smoked salmon bagel for $13 very good portion of smoked salmon; Lobster Omlette $20 had good serving of lobster meat and mascarpone cheese in the middle, yummy! BAR: Very happening at night, HIP, good gimlet, had a great cucumber martini there, $12 each which every nice corner bar in LA charge at least $10 anyways so at the W it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad. SHOWER: The shower head is amazing with the best water pressure ever! BLISS shower gel and face wash is very refreshing. BED: My best sleep for the longest time. Heavenly!

The service is exeptional and you get really people cattering to your needs.

ROOM CONDITION: - As expected, our room was decorated in a very modern, contemporary, and minimalist fashion. - When we entered the room, the television was on with a hip sound-track playing.

As a young female, I felt very safe walking in the neighborhood, anywhere from 5am to 11pm. The front desk staff, especially Alfie, went out of their way to make check in easy and smooth. Upon arriving, I found the two rooms we had booked were across the hall. A little too far apart for me to hear if my mom had another seizure or complications after the surgery. Alfie immediately solved the problem. We were upgraded to a larger office suite with a bedroom and a pull out bed in the office. The W still charged only the UCLA Patient rate for the original room. The suite was spacious and clean. The only downside was the shower. The shower head is a little low, but no great difficulty even for a 5'10\" person. The style department of the W even sent a fruit basket and a card telling us to ask for anything we needed after my mom's return from the procedure. Well, we took them up on the card. The third day after her procedure, my mom had a partial seizure while alone in the hotel room. She called the desk and the staff was immediately in the room to help her. She states they gently eased her to the ground from where she was slumped between the desk and the wall and had help there quickly. I was notified and at the hotel within 10 minutes to find the paramedics already present and treating her. The W even had a car ready for us to follow the ambulance to the ER. I called from the ER to ask if we could extend our stay as we were scheduled to leave the next morning. I was told not to worry, the room would be ours as long as needed. The next day, the staff, from Dione who helped my mom to the cleaning staff were asking how she was and if I needed anything. The entire staff really rose to this medical emergency.

I had a small problem getting a light bulb replaced in the room (it took a call to the front desk, then two follow-up calls on their part to see if it had been done before it was actually accomplished), but I don't consider a burnt-out bulb to be a big problem, so fixing it right away wasn't something that irritated me. So I might agree that perhaps the staff is not up to the typical W standard for coordination, but I did not at any time find anyone unprofessional or rude. I lived in Westwood for a while and feared that the location would mean lots of noise and drunken carousing outside, but their street is away from Westwood Village and very quiet. The building seems nestled in a private jungle, and I found that its reputation for being dark was well-deserved. At night, they keep the lobby area relatively dim and use projections on the wall for decoration. I was impressed by the execution of this, since it can be glaring if not well integrated. The use of projection along with the closed-circuit tv in the elevator (not recorded or monitored, just for entertainment inside the elevator) is a nice nod to \"The Industry\" of the host city. The rooms are very big for hotel rooms (I had the lowest level of room), and while it is true that they do not have lots of light fixtures, during the daytime, the windows that ran along the entire side of the room (and open wide) let in plenty of light. But yes, at night, the rooms seem kind of dark. The decor is nice, but a bit reserved for a W. Again though, there is a tie-in with Los Angeles in the photos of the city at night that adorn the walls. The bathrooms are huge, and have a stand apart from the vanity for locating your own toiletries. That's a nice touch. As for the staff, I found everyone to be amazingly friendly, putting forth a lot of effort to achieve the W goal of making you feel like you're coming home when you arrive at the curb. The welcome ambassador (or whatever they call them) that greeted us upon arrival remembered my name, my interests, some amazingly obscure details from brief conversations we had and offered some amazing tips each time I passed through the doors. As for the Internet access not working, I first experienced that problem, but when they sent an engineer up to the room, he explained that the little black boxes that are inline between the ethernet from the wall and your computer often fail, so if you just use the blue ethernet cable from the wall and plug it directly into your computer, it works like a charm. I am surprised at the report from the previous reviewer that had employees talking about it being a widespread problem, since even the bellhop seemed to think that might be the problem before the engineer arrived. Perhaps they only recently discovered this workaround. Pros: Amazing welcome staff, friendly (if not well-coordinated) staff in other areas, lush surroundings, good public area design, beautiful views, that killer W bed Cons: Expensive parking rates ($24/day, I think), dark rooms (at night; maybe a pro for some), not very funky room elements for a W, although I felt the lobby made up for this", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "dayton", "Title": "\u201cprofessionally mediocre\u201d", "Author": "mjk97", "ReviewID": "UR3943151", "Content": "My wife and I had a reservation for 7/31-8/2/2005 on a first leg of 10-day vacation of LA-Vegas-Bay area swing, but checked out early 8/1 morning, headed to Anaheim. $279/nite may not buy much in the area, but doesn't seem justified.

The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153W\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel is walking distance to Westwood and is nestled in a residential area. This is not a large hotel and is very popular for evening gatherings for the young and single on the weekend. The hotel is nicely decorated with contemporary furnishings. They are two bar areas. The out side bar is a great place to hang-out on a nice day. The room is categorized as a suite with two small rooms. The queen size bed took up most of the room, with very little walking room. Replacing the analog TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with a plasma TV would help with the lack of space. Room was clean. I am not sure if these are regular room or for last minute reservations using Starwood points. During the night we were disturbed by doors slamming shut, they need to put hydraulic on those doors. I can say room service has never been so fast, less than 20 minutes for a full breakfast order two for 3 days. Unfortunately, on the last day they delivered an incorrect order. Now here are some issues that some feel are minor, but I think important if I were running a hotel. There was no menu for room service and no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cards for the door. There were no bath robes and house keeping did not leave any face or hand towels on our third day there, subsequent to our call they could not get it right for the rest of our stay. And there was some paper work left by a previous occupant. Calling valet to have your car available was not good. I still had to wait for them to get the car. Having the vehicle out front and ready to go would be a plus. The front desk and valet was friendly and courteous. However, the elevator security during the evening gave us the cold shoulder and the bar attendants took there time serving us, so I ordered our own drinks from the bar.

Typically, we stay at Le Meridien Beverly Hills, but wanted to mix it up this time and got two suites at the W Hotel LA in Westwood. (They only have suites, no rooms, which is nice) We paid $430 a night and our friend spent over $1100 for the two nights. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, although it was a little too dark inside. My friend suggested the dim lighting was to prevent guests from noticing the fact that the building was slightly run down, but I don't agree. There is two pools - a main pool where everyone lounges and a smaller pool off of the gym. I'd recommend coming early to guarantee a lounge chair at the main pool, otherwise you'll end up having to rent one of their cabans for $200/hr. And that is probably why they allow many of the lounge chairs to sit empty for hours just because someone had reserved it with their towel. You can also enjoy a nice lunch at the restaurant by the pool. Make sure you order a mojito. BTW, the gym is very nice and well equipped with free weights as well. The rooms themselves are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. The walls are obviously very thick as you can't hear your neighbours. Scott, at the Conceirge is also very helpful. For example, he got us last minute dinner reservation at Koi and got my friend (female) into some of the hippest night clubs in LA. It didn't hurt that she was blonde and stacked. However, there were serious problems: 1. They misplaced a pair of jeans I had laundered and didn't really seem to care about it. However, the jeans were eventually recovered (by my own efforts) but they didn't charge me for the service. 2. They initially placed us in a room with a handicap shower, i.e. a nozzle attached to a hose which you had to hold when you showering - very annoying. We had to move to a room with a 'normal' shower. 3. Before heading out for the evening, we had requested clean towels. When we returned, we discovered a stack of clean towels on the bathroom sink and a pile of damp towels still sitting in the tub. We called downstairs and informed them that we were going to put the used towels in the hall way and asked them to send someone up to pick them up. At that time, the night manager (who had only been there for 2 months) threaten to throw us out of the hotel if we did that. I have never have been threaten to be kicked out of a hotel ever. When I went downstairs to confront the night manager, he was agressive, hostile and rude. There was no apology or attempts to resolve the situation in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, we had requested a bliss kit, i.e. a package of the mini-shampoo, lotion, etc... you get in your room. What we got was a brown paper bag with several of the little bottles sitting in our sink. Overall the experience was fine. However, that experience with the night manager soured our entire stay.

I had to call the concierge because there was no list of dvd's in the room. She told me to look for a W book with list inside. There wasn't a W book. she promised to send one up. It never arrived. I had to call her TWO MORE TIMES to get the list of dvd's. list arrived: I ordered. 11) someone brings up film -- its not a dvd -- its video. I send it back. I don't have a vcr.

Here is this beautiful property where a fortune has been spent on a face lift for the former Westwood Marquis. The suites are all done in W style--which I think lacks personality and could use some splashes of color--color which is strangely absent from this hotel in its entirety. I question whether the furniture was completely new due to the rather staggering number of stains on the upholstery in both rooms I had. I had one of the larger suites--three rooms--a living room, bedroom and office--which face the rear of the hotel and was much more quiet and serene than anything facing the street or overlooking the pool area....which was the fate of several of my co-workers. This is a scene hotel--the lobby bar is packed with pretty young things and there are a steady stream of hipper than thou young people who party hearty. You'd do well to avoid any room on a lower floor in front or overlooking the pool. The noise is such that one of my co-workers had to be moved in the middle of the night. But the problem here isn't the rooms with their excellent beds-- it's the service or almost complete lack of it. I came home at 8:00 to find two maids in the room giving it the first housekeeping service of the day! There is no turndown service at all which might solve the ice shortage... I waited up to 45 minutes for ice from room service The only competent service is in the Parking Garage...everyone else gives attitude and looks pretty and that's about it. One bellman promised to look after two things for me and never appeared again. The other problem here is that the the menu is extremely limited and unchanging from brunch to lunch to dinner. What is served is certainly passable but no one would want to eat there 9 days straight which was our fate. The main restaurant, which we were assured would be open, was not. The outdoor restaurant is the only option and in the flooding rains of last week, was forced indoors to take up a position in some conference rooms on the second floor. There tables were set for 8 and 12 so you were forced to sit with strangers--not my idea of a good time. The only option to this unattractive arrangement was room service and the delays were horrific -- 45 minutes for abowl oif cereal and juice and this with a 20% service charge attached to it. Amazingly, one young bartender told me that they had staffed up in preparation for the opening of the restaurant. Why these waiters weren't pressed into service to cope with the room service is beyond me. This really is a sad state of affairs at a hotel that could be so much better. I think service in this Hotel seems to suffer from the fact that there is only one professional waiter (Moses) in the bunch--the rest are all incredibly cute boys and girls who clearly have no intention of staying longer than it takes to pay for their head shots. I do feel badly about writing this. But it's just a dirty rotten shame that this place hasn't got its act together. If I were W management, I wouldn't allow this place to denigrate my brand the way it does. I'll wait here to read whether it ever lives up to its potential.", "Date": "October 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cDisgraceful\u201d", "Author": "Rob1233", "ReviewID": "UR2502848", "Content": "Some of the staff were very kind and helpful, but this hotel was a complete waste of money. The rooms are adequate, but the walls are paper thin, the traffic noise from outside is terrible (no double glazing) and it was especially disappointing to hear the staff cleaning the next-door room at midnight with the stereo on full-tilt! The pool staff are hilariously bad, way too cool to actually do their job and find somewhere for you to sit - prefer to just grunt at people and tell people where they can't sit! Reading other reviews, it seems to be a regular occurrence to close the swimming pool and the bar down for private events, leaving nowhere for the guests to go. Indeed when we stayed there a couple of weeks ago, the whole hotel was taken over by a film crew and we were even banished from the lobby!! Would never go back. the W hotel in San Diego is decent, though..", "Date": "August 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton UK", "Title": "\u201cWish I stayed longer\u201d", "Author": "JCSide", "ReviewID": "UR2267547", "Content": "Stayed here for one night only after flying to LAX, before driving to Las Vegas the next day. I wish we had more time here. I found the atmosphere very relaxed, and the environment very pleasant. The hotel was in a fairly quiet neighbourhood. Lobby, restaurant and bar are very nicely presented. We had drinks in the bar (great but pricey), and also breakfast in the restaurant, which couldn't be faulted. Pity we didn't have time to use the pool area, but that looked stunning. Our junior suite room was clean and well decorated, bathroom was large and nicely appointed. Staff were efficient but not stuck up. They all seemed to be models and made us feel a bit unglamourous though !

Restaurant/Bar is being renovated which is by far the best reason to stay here. It normally has great atmosphere and good drinks, albeit expensive.

Westwood is ok for a night, but gets old so if you don't have a car don't stay at the W. If you are visiting kids at UCLA and don't mind overpaying, then the W is the nicest walking distance hotel.

The service at the poolside restarvice was pathetic to say the least. Ontop of this, every single chair around the pool was booked for a private event, so screw the paying guests.

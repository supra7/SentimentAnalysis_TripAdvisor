All of the surrounding hotels were charging $100 plus for 1 night for New Years Eve, but at the Hawthorne website they had rooms for only $59 a night. Upon arrival the hotel looked like an apartment complex, which I liked. The suites looked like an effienciency apartment, with a small living area with a pull out sofa and a flat screen tv that swiveled so that you could watch in either the bedroom or the living room if you wanted to, a patio, a nice size bathroom, a full kitchen with bar/bar stools, a king bed, and a large walk-in closet. It was definitely a place I could stay in long term if necessary. I wish I had taken pictures, but for the money, I was pretty impressed. Now its not the nicest suite I have ever stayed in but I would definitely stay here again because it really was nice and very comfortable and the location was fantastic. We were minutes from the freeway, the nightlife, and neighboring cities. The only thing I disliked was their breakfast. The itenarary the hotel staff gave was that breakfast was served from like 7 to 9 and was a buffet, and bc my husband loves breakfast, I thought this was bonus, but when we got there they only had hard boiled eggs (no scrambles eggs, like the paper said) rubbery bacon, gritty sausage, biscuits and toast (no pancakes or waffles, like the paper said), cereal, juice and coffee, and none of it was really good, so with that I was not happy, but the overall stay was good.

It was not the end of the world as the upstairs bathroom had hot water, but it was inconvenient for washing dishes, and I REALLY hate being lied to by the front desk people. I wish the room numbers would have been better marked on the end of the building. Once we found building 900, there were absolutely no markings anywhere on the building to designate the room numbers. The room numbers were small, hard-to-read numbers posted at the door. I had to wander around each side of the building until I got lucky, and spotted room 926. As someone noted earlier, the neighborhood left a bit to be desired. That being said, we had no security problems of any sort. The beds were phenomenal, and I slept like a baby!

The breakfast is always very plentiful and tastes amazing (buscuits, sometimes gravy, bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, multiple cereals, oj, cofffee, and milk) We love to go to social hour on wednesday nights, eat dinner and mingle with the other guests and the staff (there are a lot of long term guests here and it really makes you feel like your having dinner with the family) I read below that someone felt the area was unsafe for her family and young children, however, my 3 yr old and i go for walks almost daily around the area, there is even a lovely little creek that runs just behind the property and there are always lots of little ducks down there to watch. and the pool is inclosed by a fence for safety so that young children can not get to it while unsupervised. (not that i quite understand why a child would be outside of a hotel unsupervised in the first place?no matter how safe the area.) Our room gets cleaned 2 times a week since we are long term guests and the house keeping staff is always very friendly and makes sure that everything is stocked for you, and during the week if you run out of anything whoever is at the front desk is always more than willing to help whether it be dish washer detergent, towels, paper, etc. and if they dont have it. they will go out and buy it (neccessities anyway) Our stay here has been more than enjoyable and hawthorne and its staff have blown our expectations out of the water.

I had previously called at talked to 4 other hotels in the area trying to make a decision, but once I spoke with the hotel staff at the Hawthorne, it was a no-brainer! **STAFF** First of all, let me say that all the positive feedback you may have read about Keith, Tom, and the entire staff a the Hawthorn Suites is TRUE! (They took over the property in November so anything negative you read before that...please understand that it was a different management company). They were so accommodating it was almost unbelievable. Having worked in the travel industry for 13 years, I know what level of service to expect. I have worked for Delta Airlines and worked as a travel agent, so I know this industry. They went so above and beyond what good customer service is, it was almost unheard of. I have only taken the time to write 1 online review in my life, but I knew I had to give credit where credit was do in complimenting & praising the staff at the Hawthorn Suites. I was there with a baseball team and they bent over backwards to make our kids' trip the best ever! He even had a huge canvas Welcome and Good Luck banner professionally MADE for our team and another team. It was hanging on the hotel exterior by the front door as we came in. Who does that in today's customer service world. They threw a big hamburger, hotdog, chips and dip social for our team and the other guests at the hotel. They took me to the airport to get my daughter who was flying in and they WAITED in the van while I went inside to get her. I told them they could leave and I'd get a way back, but they insisted. Just unbelievable. One afternoon, my young daughter and son went into the lobby vending machine to buy some Oreos. The staff there (I think it was Tom) saw how excited my kids were to have their Oreos...he said, \"Would you like some milk to go with those Oreos?\" Surprised, I said, \"Well, sure.\" He went into the back kitchen and came back with 2 glasses of milk. Small gesture, BIG statement! These people really do care about making their guests number one. **ROOM LAYOUT** This hotel has such great reviews for a few reasons...the layout of all the rooms is a HUGE plus! We had 2 rooms, living area, full kitchen with pots, pans, plates, stove, oven, etc....the works! If you are on a business trip, staying one night or if your preference is fine luxuries, marble countertops, restaurant with bar, and a spa this may not be the place for you. If you want a place where the beds are new, SUPER comfortable, 3x the space you'd get in a standard hotel for a fraction of the price, free parking, free hot breakfast, laundry onsite, then you've found your place! I will say that they are renovating the entire property and are still in this process. The microwaves are definitely old school, but who cares really, so long as it heats and pops popcorn. Keith told me those are coming in soon. It is an ongoing process to renovate, paint, etc. a property, but the beds and showers are clean and neat. He even showed me the paint colors he is about to do on the exterior. **BREAKFAST** Angelica made a fantastic breakfast for us everyday! We had sausage, eggs, potatoes, breakfast burritos, and belgium waffles. There was fruit, cereal and juices as well. One thing I appreciated was the fact that even though they were closing in 15 minutes, she came out with a huge plate of eggs and bacon because there were still quite a few people hungry in the eating area. Most places shut down the last 15-20 minutes and make you feel like they are ready for you to leave. We tipped her at the end of the week and thanked her for feeding us so well. **OUTSIDE EXTERIOR** The outside does not look like some of the brand new properties yet, but they are working on it, so if that is the most important factor to you, you may be somewhat disappointed. I have stayed in some of the nicest properties all over the world..yes, I had a marble entry way and granite countertops, but really who cares. For most of my trips, and I can probably speak for a lot of people, I feel like most people usually want clean rooms, safe area, close and convenient to local attractions, (6 minutes from Dallas Love), and great management staff. You'll get that here at the Hawthorn Suites. We will most definitely be going back to the Hawthorn Suites again.

BAD: - Not a great part of town. We actually had some \"working girls\" in this hotel who had different men with them every morning at breakfast. Beer bottles, trash, etc was strewn about the perimeter of the property. - Not a clean and fresh room. The carpet had stains, the bathroom was small and old, the kitchen was old, and I found old medicine cups behind the drapes. Let's just say I didn't take off my socks and kept my suitcase off the ground. BOTTOM LINE: There are a lot of other hotels in the area, and even the hospital had rates for about $10 higher at other places. Next time, spend a little extra and get a LOT more.", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Dallas Love Field", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98655-Reviews-Hawthorn_Suites_by_Wyndham_Dallas_Love_Field-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$73 - $90*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7900 Brookriver Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75247</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "98655", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/3c/03/street-view.jpg"}}

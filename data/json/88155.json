Parking is an adventure with very tight parking stalls and tight turns into and out of. It would be a much better entrance if it wasn't up at least one level, (closer to two) and then often crowded with cars, which makes it difficult to walk to the parking garage or into the entrance.

The parking garage was very old and had a very narrow entrance. There is an escalator to go up to the lobby. But we had a lot of bags, so we had to get our own cart and use the service elevator to get to our room. The elevator smelled like trash. But finally we get to our room, and I was happy. Even though our room was right in front of the guest elevator, it was quiet. We had a newly renovated room. It was clean and there were so many amenities! 2 flat screen tvs, 2 sinks (one in the front and one in the room) and a huge bed! The bathroom was pretty small, but since there is a sink outside it really didn't matter to me. The lobby is pretty! Also they have interesting elevators (see pics). There was hot breakfast in the morning and made to order omelets. They also had a variety of TAZO tea. Overall the staff was friendly and the room was satisfactory.

Upon close inspection the room looks worn and could use a remodel. The couch had a big stain on the upholstery, wallpaper was coming away from the wall in the bathroom, corners were nicked - all things that come with use. As others have noted, the only way to cool the room after October is to open the window and turn on the ceiling fan provided in the bedroom. That I can live with, but the ceiling fan made such a loud noise that I couldn't have it on when trying to sleep. And regarding noise, a very loud roar was coming from a nearby building - we guessed the exhaust fans for the Weber Grill. Luckily I brought earplugs and finally resorted to those. My husband said the roar quit in the middle of the night. (Maybe when Weber Grill closed down?) The mattress was comfortable and the bed linens were very nice. The televisions were great with a good selection of channels. The location downtown is fantastic and it is tied in to the downtown skywalk system. I think maybe the noise issue is dependent upon where in the hotel you are located. We were on the 9th floor facing north (hence suspecting Weber Grill noise). The ceiling fan issue is probably just one of those things. I would recommend management have their maintenance staff check for noisy fans and fix or replace them. I've stayed at this ES in years past and found it quite pleasant - however, I do remember being on one of the top floors in a past winter and finding it quite hard to cool off the room due to the heat naturally rising in a large open atrium like ES. It's probably time for ES to refurbish the paint and wallpaper in the rooms at this location as well. I still find the suite set up very comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast is very nice. We had the typical option of cereals, pastries, breads, plus fresh fruit; but they also provide a hot bar with eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy; and made to order omelets. Very nice!

But getting there can be challenging. To start, there is no true front door. There is a small sign, on a road under heavy construction, that leads to an entrance up a hill to a covered area. This is the 2nd floor. If you have a stroller or are unable to use a narrow escalator, you have to get in to a service elevator that is barely big enough for a single stroller and one person. You take this (mashing your finger on the up/down button the entire ride) to the 3rd floor (lobby). From here, you can get in to a regular elevator. Now, this is from the parking area. If you want to go to the street level, for say dinner, you have to take the regular elevator to the service elevator, walk past the off-track betting facility, down several long hall ways and take another elevator to the street level. Let me tell you, if you have kids, this is terrible. As for the room, it was ok. The guy at the test claimed we were on the most renovated floor, but the tub leaked water at a pretty good rate. It is a little loud in the rooms from the lobby, but this is an embassy, so I have come to expect that. Unfortunately, our room wasn't cleaned very well as I found soap and shampoo in our tub from the previous guests. Breakfast from the buffet was cold, but the appetizers during the manager's reception were fine.

The temperature of our room was very comfortable even with the almost 100 degree outside summer days. The desk staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful. They are the best attribute of this hotel, in my opinion. We were pleased that the elevators were all operational this year and it seemed that they moved between floors faster than just a year ago. There were plenty of food options provided at the morning breakfast. When we arrived, the hotel was very full of guests from a national fraternity, their spouses and friends occupying most of the rooms in this hotel and the hotels nearby. They were a loud, rowdy bunch, and a lot of fun to be around. Although they spent many late evenings, partying in the atrium area on the main floor, our room was very quiet. As the fraternity folks left and the our dance party friends arrived, the hotel became much quieter and more sedate with the arrival of our senior citizen friends. I missed the noisy, happy fraternity guests. This hotel is directly across the street from a large shopping mall and within easy walking distance to the State Capital and state offices. The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art and the Indiana State Museum is six or seven blocks from the hotel.

There was a vanity area in the bedroom, separate from the bathroom as well, which was helpful for our family getting ready for our day each morning.

We have stayed at other Embassy Suites and always found them to be nice. I was quite disappointed with this location however. Things started out well. After a 4 hour drive, we arrived at 3PM. The hotel entrance was easy to find since I knew we would be driving into a building. I went to the front desk and fully expected to be turned away as it was an hour before check in. I was pleasantly surprised when the very friendly woman at the front desk told me she had a room for us on the 16th floor! When I made our reservations on-line I mentioned in the comments section that we were celebrating my husbands birthday and would appreciate a room on an upper level. She even told me to wish my husband (who was waiting in the car) a happy birthday. So far so good! I went back out to the car and told my family our room was ready! We parked in the attached garage which was easy to use with our room key for in and out access. We had no elevator trouble at all. We made it to our room with ease. At this point is where the trouble began. We walked into the bedroom and found a huge capsule type pill laying on the floor. It was clear as day, and not hard to see. It was obvious that the carpet had not been vacuumed. We immediately called housekeeping for 2 more towels and pillows, and when they brought them, I asked them to remove the pill from our room. We had no idea what kind of drug it was, and didn't want it left in a garbage can in our room. The woman from housekeeping was very nice, apologized and took the pill with her when she left the room. I then went into the bathroom and found splattered toothpaste on top of the faucet and water spots on the mirror directly about the faucet. At that point, I should have called the front desk and requested a different room, but decided to just make the best of things and go out to explore the city as we had planned. When we returned that evening, my husband pulled the comforter down and found chocolate on the top sheet. Not just a chocolate stain, but an actual piece of chocolate stuck to the sheet. It was late and the kids were ready for bed, so we took off the top sheet and didn't use it. We wrote a note for housekeeping the next day to please change the sheets and left the note on the sheet next to the chocolate explaining that it was from a previous guest (or a snacking housekeeper!) When we went down to the lobby the next morning there was a woman laying face down, sleeping on a bench in the lobby. When we walked by again about 15 minutes later, she was still there and I was concerned that she may need help. I went to the front desk and told the clerk that I was concerned about the woman who was sleeping face down just a few feet away from the front desk. He told me in a very unconcerned and annoyed tone, \"we know who she it\". I was quite taken aback by his response. Not something that I would expect to see at an Embassy Suites. The breakfast buffet was the usual that you would expect at an Embassy Suites, but the evening reception was below par. On July 3rd, the bartender was not pleasant at all. She was extremely slow in filling drink orders. The night before, the bartender was very nice and efficient, but the carrots that were out, looked as if they were very old, as the color was as much white as orange. They ran out of crackers, and replaced them with little packages of saltines, which seemed a little odd to go with the cheese ball.

This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a hotel. Upon Check in, I asked for a veiw of downtown. I wanted my daughters to be able to enjoy the view. I was given a room with a view of the roof and backside of a building. I was not told about the managers reception and when I came down, and asked where was a place we could get a snack and relax, I was told they were conncected to the mall. After having dinner, when we returned we went to get pop from the vending on our floor to find it only accepted change. I went down to the conceirge and asked where else we could get something to drink from, or get some change and was (again nothing about the managers reception which was going on at this time) told we have room service. I asked if I could just get change for the vending machine. And he seemed to be annoyed and asked how much did I want. I asked for $5(which by the way the pop was $1.50 a piece, I was putting $4.50 back into the machine) the guy acted like I was disturbing him. Also, as I went to make popcorn, the mocrowave was unpugged and I could not reach the plug under the counter to plug it back in. In order to use it I had to carry it to the table to plug it in. This was all in the first night. The next morning I took my kids down for breakfast and according to the room info the breakfast was until 10:30. However at 9:35 when we went down the area was cleared out. They allowed us to eat because the food was still. I do have to say the ladies in there were extremely nice about it. This was one of the only highllights to the stay. However after this it again went downhil. I took my kids to the pool and was told by a cleaning person they were going to be doing a photo shoot so I needed to stay in one area and be sure that I didnt take any towels other than the 4 he handed me. I was quite put off by this. I felt like we were just in the way. I went up got our stuff and began to check out, there was a lady from housekeeping on the floor and I asked her for an extra garbage bag so that I could clean up some of the things that did not fit into the only can that was in the room. And she told me that I needed to wait untill she got to my room. She was only 2 rooms away and would not be cleaning my room while I was there. So i left the garbage on the table. Next to the microwave and left the room. Upon trying to exit the garage I swiped the room card (because I had been charged $22 fee) I was then stopped by the attendant and asked for the parking ticket and I stated I had already paid and she asked for proof. Mind you I had swiped my card already which read my room number and such. I reached in my bag and showed her the check out receipt. Then I finally left and felt more frustrated than I had before I had gotten there. Its a shame that my staycation had to be such a headache.

You couldn't hear anything from the outside or our neighbors. And hopefully they couldn't hear us while watching the World Cup. The one problem I had with the room was the condition of the bathroom. The sink area was fine, but the tub looked like it was possibly under repair or soon to be under repair. I would disagree with previous reviews of the rooms (as a whole) looking tired because the rest of the room looked like it had recently been renovated... except for the tub/shower area.

The hotel is in the downtown core, about four blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium. There is an IndyGo stop for the vans to/from the airport right in the front. You can travel on the vans for $7, or $3.50 for seniors (over 65). That beats a $40 cab fare. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. We arrived at noon, and they had a room ready for us by 2 p.m., even though the normal check-in is at 4 p.m. We got a free breakfast that was scrumptuous! I had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, yogurt, fruit, cinnamon swirl French toast and coffee. They also make omlets to order and they have cereal and a variety of teas and juice. This saved us at least $12 each. They have a \"Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 p.m. I had three marguaritas, plus lots of finger food including swiss cheese cubes, a cheese ball with almonds, chips, salsa and dip, We watched NFL football on the large TV. That saved us about $25 each. There is a morning paper, USA Today. We had a 2-room suite, with a TV in the sitting room and another TV in the bedroom. We had a king-sized bed. The bedroom had a view of the War Memorial. The hotel is also linked directly to the downtown SkyWalk Mall. If it is inclement, you don't even need to go outside to walk around at least 15 city blocks.

First of all; whoever designed the front entrance needs to go back to architecture school. When you arrive you are greeted by steps as well as an almost unusable winding luggage ramp. Plus one you get up the stairs you must take an escalator up to the main lobby level. If you have to use a luggage cart you must use the smelly service elevator. Check in took a while as the woman at the front counter seemed to have a troubling time getting us taken care of. We did get the room requested. Since others stated there were elevator problems we asked for a low floor. Level 4 is the lobby. Meeting rooms are on the 5th and the 6th to 20th levels are guest rooms. We did find the heating and cooling controls to be extremely odd for a modern hotel. It poses a problem trying to get the room comfortable; especially in a swing month like April where you never know what the weather will be. We had to open the window to get cool air and this was not good as our room overlooked an large A/C unit for the Weber Grill restaurant. The lighting in the bathroom was very good. Women doing makeup will appreciate the light. High speed internet was good. But I find it annoying to be charged $11.95/day. The parking garage was a bit of an issue. The ceiling is low and the whole thing is very narrow. People in SUVs will have a hard time navigating and most of the times have to take up two parking spaces. Plus the elevators were out of order and the whole place is underlit. The hotel location can\u2019t be beat though. Plenty of dining and shopping options all within a short distance. The room was clean and well taken care off. Typical Embassy Suites layout. Decent selection of TV channels. The living are features a nice, new 37\u201d LG brand HDTV: but only standard def channels are available.

Our most recent stay was Thankgiving weekend 2008 for 2 nights with our 2 children and my mother and father in law. I am a Hilton Honors Gold member and other than a few occasions, we always stay with the Hilton chain. The hotel staff are all very friendly and accommodating, it is the hotel itself that needs some improvement. The elevators are painfully slow. It always seemed to take at least 10 minutes to get an elevator and hope that there was room to get on. My advice, whether you are going up or down, get on the first one that comes or you could be waiting a while. One evening we returned to find that my in-laws room key would not work so I went down to the front desk to have it fixed. It took me 25 minutes to get to the desk, have the card fixed (which only took about 3 mins.) and return to the room. Another problem is the climate control rooms. In the winter, you can only use the heat and at other times of the year, only the air conditioning works. The room was miserably hot throughout our stay. The bedroom window can be opened, but with 2 kids and a room on the 17th floor, we did not want to take a chance. The first night we went down to the pool, there were dirty towels everywhere, and not a clean one to be found when we got out. One hot tub did not work, and the other one was all foamy and disgusting looking. Thinking it would be better the second night, we went back down. Same thing, one broken, and the other disguisting. The pool is way too cold, so I sat and watched the kids swim. It was cleaned up and towels were available this time. The breakfast is ok, but the offering had changed. There used to be waffles available, but were not offered while we there. Also, no bagels or flavored hot teas, only Lipton. I appreciate that they offer the free breakfast, but lately the hotel has been priced higher than even the Hilton, which offers a nice bed and breakfast rate for usually a lower rate than the Embassy. The Queen deluxe room at the hilton is like a mini suite. All in all the stay was just ok, but with so many Hilton brands available in the downtown area, I think we will go with one of the other ones next time. I realize it was a holiday weekend, but we have been down at other times and it always seems to be overrun with some sort of event. We have stayed at the Hilton before and it was very nice and the Conrad looks absolutely fabulous. If you are travelling with a group and can get a good rate, this is probably a good choice.

The game (despite being a blowout) beat the hotel by a mile. First off, there was a computer glitch that hamstrung the reservations desk terribly upon our arrival. There were dozens of people milling around, waiting for rooms. It was a matter of \"get into a line and pray.\" I was lucky enough to get into a quicker (but not quick) line, which afforded me a mere 45 minute wait. The guy in the line next to me (who had been there for hours, he said) went ballistic. Partially at me. In one respect, I can't blame him. They did not have enough staff for each line, so they were bouncing back and forth. Because my line was the Hilton Honors line, I guess they were keeping one person on that at all times. Bad move...and one that led to a lot of anger. While I grant that their computer system was out of their control, they absolutely botched trying to do it without the technology. How do I know? We were one of several parties who were given a room, given a key, and then promptly headed off to a room...already occupied by another family. It was the most bizarre experience I have ever had in travel. So, we headed back downstairs, where the throng was still mostly assembled. At one point, all of the reservations staff disappeared for nearly half an hour. My guess is that they were meeting in the back wondering what the heck to do. Every now and again, the manager (who, and I should not hold this against him, looked to be about 19) said we'd be helped in \"five or ten minutes\". After nearly another hour, we were finally assigned a room that was UNOCCUPIED. We asked for the manager, we were told he would call us. We're still waiting. The room was fine (good view of the Capitol dome), but was in some disrepair. Shoddy TV reception, bathroom was a little dirty, etc. The stay did not improve substantially. Housekeeping did not arrive. Ever. Maybe they clean every third day, or something. We were out of the room from 10 AM til 7 PM on our second day, so I don't think it was us. Breakfast at Embassy Suites is usually a high point. The food was adequate, but lines were impossibly long, and there was little or no silverware available on either day. Parking was steep ($20 a night), but in a downtown area I suppose that is to be expected, to an extent. Embassy Suites is usually my first option when I book a hotel.

It is my feeling that if you want attentive and efficient customer service, do not stay at this hotel.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeville, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "dixonconsultinginc", "ReviewID": "UR8269163", "Content": "Needed a place with easy walking distance to Victory Field and comfort for the family.

It was part of a business trip, booked by my company's events planner, as it was for a conference we were holding at the RCA Dome and Convention Center. My initial expectations were to expect an average hotel stay, after reading the previous reviews of the place and hearing about the other nearby hotels (others in our company were staying at the Marriott, Hyatt Regency, and Westin hotels). I was pleasantly surprised left and right at Embassy Suites. Apparently a major remodel has been completed, and the rooms and hotel show it. From the check-in, which was handled quickly and easily by the staff at the front, to the room, cleaning, and check-out procedures, I had no hiccups or trouble. The room is amply sized, with the front room containing a TV, a couch, large chair, a table with two chairs, and a bar area with a mini-fridge and microwave. The bathroom was in between the two rooms, and was fine for one or two people -- the counter was solid marble, and everything was clean. The bedroom had a king-sized bed, with loads of pillows (love extra pillows), an armoire with pull-out TV, a sink/make-up area, and full-length windows with blackout shades. As I mentioned above, the cleaning staff was superb, with everything clean and tidy when I came back exhausted every day after the conference. I will admit that there were a few things out of place when I first arrived -- an empty soda bottle on the floor underneath one of the tables, burnt-out lights in the bathroom, and a broken hot-water handle for the sink in the bathroom (there were 2 other sinks I could use, though). All of this -- all of it -- was fixed and clean without my asking by the next morning. I saw it as a temporary oversight, nothing to worry about. One other niggle might be that the lobby is on the 4th floor -- not immediately obvious to newcomers going up or down the elevator or arriving from street level. Coming off the street you might be tempted to look to check-in at the off-track betting area on the lower level. :) I would definitely go back, and would recommend this place to others, whether visiting Indianapolis for business or pleasure.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest US", "Title": "\u201cCircle City Classic\u201d", "Author": "GeoSoul", "ReviewID": "UR7350753", "Content": "My fiancee and I stayed at the Embassy Suites during the Circle City Classic in October 2006. We usually look for an Embassy hotel when we travel because it is a great value. We have typically been very pleased with the Embassy. Our stay in Indianapolis was OK, but somewhat disappointing in comparison to other stays. Here the the PROS and CONS: PROS: The hotel is literally in the heart of DT Indy and you can easily walk to local restaurants, the stadium, etc. The hotel is actually connected to the Circle City Centre (mall) so that you can get there without going outside. This is really nice when the weather isn't so great & the mall is really nice. You can also walk to the capital and the civil war museum, which is free, although a bit creepy in the inside (dark & dank). The suites are a nice size, but the decor is a bit dated. It was still clean overall & beats a regular hotel room by a long shot. The manager's breakfast & evening reception add LOTS of value for your stay. They are included free with your stay. It's a full breakfast in the morning (bacon, egs, omelets, etc) and snacks & drinks in the evening. It's best to get there early as both fill up fairly quickly. Seating place is limited, but you can take items back to your room. CONS: We stayed at this hotel in October and found out upon check-in that you can't control the heat in your room. It is controlled by the hotel and they had not yet turned it on for the year for some reason or another. We were FREEZING most of the weekend. This took a lot away from our satisfaction with our stay. There was a note in the room suggesting that we use the ceiling fan to help control the temp! I'm sorry, but when it's only 40 or so degress outside, running a ceiling fan is not going to warm the room to a comfortable level. The hotel lobby was always dark...even in the day. Catching an elevator was a challenge, but that might have been because there were so many people in town for the Circle City Classic. The hotel was also EXTREMELY noisy--Lots of teens, young children running around w/o adult supervision. Of course, that's to be expected whenever a major event is going on, but you just need to be aware of it. Overall, the Embassy is usually a good value for what you pay versus what you get. However, we will probably stay at the Hyatt in the future. Not being able to control the room temp is a BIG problem...expecially in the Midwest. Unless you are traveling at a time when room temp will be comfortable, I'd say to stay someplace else. This hotel is in the heart of the action, but so are other hotels in the area.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!!!!\u201d", "Author": "UMgirl", "ReviewID": "UR7316193", "Content": "Stayed for 2 nights.

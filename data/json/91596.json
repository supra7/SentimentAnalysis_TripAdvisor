I travel frequently for business, so I think I have a good sense of During the weekend we stayed, there was a cheerleading competition in town, so all the hotels were at maximum capacity. This Courtyard was no exception. That said, I cannot excuse the issues we experienced to a busy hotel. If I had to stay in Indianapolis again, I would stay elsewhere. Location - The location was convenient to the wedding venues we needed and we didn't explore much of Indianapolis (outside the Children's Museum), so I can't really speak to the location. It seemed very proximate to other downtown attractions, though not sure how walkable it would be (it was also 20 degrees the weekend we stayed, so no one was walking anywhere!) There is a surface parking lot - I think parking was ~$20 a night with unlimited in and out privileges. We never had an issue finding a parking spot, even later at night. Rooms - The most serious issue is the noise level in the rooms. We stayed on the 3rd floor and could hear EVERY STEP taken by the people above us - who happened to be family member's of mine, so I know they weren't jumping/stomping/being excessively loud. When the floor above us flushed the toilet, it sounded like water was rushing into our room. Other friends/family who had 3rd/2nd floor rooms complained about the noise level. Otherwise, rooms are well appointed and have been recently updated. We stayed in a room that was a 1 bed room suite, with a door separating the bedroom from living room area, which was helpful since we were traveling with a younger child. Room size (at least for these suites) was very large. I had a chance to visit some of the standard size rooms and those were more of an average hotel room size Service - We had significant issues with housekeeping. We were up very early on Saturday (again we have a young child) and left our room around 8:00 AM, returning around 1:30. When we got back, our room had not been cleaned. We had wanted our daughter to nap during this time, so were really hoping to have the room made up. I don't believe that it's unreasonable to expect a room to be serviced by early afternoon. We called down to the front desk (more on this later) and after reaching someone to explain the situation, were told that housekeeping was working until 5:00 PM. Since we had to leave around 4:30 for the wedding, we asked if we could just have the room made up then. The front desk said this would be fine. As we were leaving for the wedding, we stopped by the front desk to let them know we had left the room and to request housekeeping. No one was at the desk. We waited for around 5 minutes. I was in the process of leaving a note when the front desk clerk arrived. (Sidebar: When I told her that we had been waiting, her reply was \"I had to use the bathroom. What do you want me to do?\" Nice attitude. I would start by suggesting that the Marriott staff more than one front desk person when the hotel is fully booked. I know that is not the clerk's fault, but it's not mine either and I expect someone to be at the front desk and to answer the phone when I call down. But I digress. We informed the front desk clerk that we were leaving and needed our room made up. She told us that housekeeping had left for the night. This information was obviously counter to what we had been told earlier, so we were upset. She said that she would see what she could do, but no promises could be made. We called back to follow up and found out that our room was made up, but it really should not have been such an ordeal to have our room cleaned Food - We ate breakfast at the hotel both days. It's an a la carte menu. Food was OK - prices are probably better elsewhere, but it was very convenient. This hotel did not meet my most basic requirements of having a decent night's sleep (due to soundproofing issues) and of service (I like to have my room cleaned every day, which is not a huge request in my mind). To management's credit, when asked how my stay was and I raised these issues, they did offer to refund me a night's visit of give me Marriott points, which was a nice offer.

It was modern and spacious and included a small cafe where you could purchase Starbucks, sandwiches, pizza, etc. All the rooms have also been renovated and our King room was great. The bedding was comfortable. Lots of quality pillows. Flatscreen TV. The vanity was granite but small most likely because they tried to maximize the amount of space in the room. With such a great renovation, I do wonder why they; haven't upgraded to plusher towels. The ones they are are plentiful and adequate, but should be thicker. Even though the hotel was full both nights of our stay, we slept wonderfully. You could not hear noise in the hallways or from the outside. The hotel shares a surface parking lot with a Residence Inn. It costs $18/day, a quick way for the hotel to make extra $$$ but you do get unlimited in and out privileges. The hotel is considered downtown but not in the direct heart. It is a short walk (4-5 blocks) to actual downtown with shopping and restaurants galore. It is also close to IUPUI.

While I appreciate the thought, the \"upgrade\" was to a room with an extremely old refrigerator and microwave. It did face the street, which was nice for the fireworks. This is an older Courtyard that could use some remodeling. While it is clean, the carpet, elevator, and the bathrooms look a little tired. Another drawback is it doesn't seem to have a lot of soundproofing. This is a hotel in an urban location and you can hear a lot of noise coming through the windows. From this hotel, you could easily walk to White River State Park/Canal, Victory Field, or the State Capitol as it located on the outskirts of the downtown area. If you are interested in going to the Circle Center Mall, it would be about a 10-15 minute walk. As is typical of Courtyard hotels, you don't get a free breakfast, which is a little bit of a negative. Parking is $12 a day but you do get in/out privileges, get to park in a surface lot, and you don't have to worry about a valet. Considering I paid $48 a night to park in downtown Chicago last week, $12 didn't sound so bad. I did notice other downtown hotels in Indianapolis were charging around $20-$25 a night for parking.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "BlueberryMoose", "ReviewID": "UR17921507", "Content": "Got this hotel on a Priceline bid. Great deal. Super downtown location close to the canal. It shares a parking lot with Residence Inn which is on the canal. Parking was $12 a night but we found parking easily on the street on a Saturday night. We were given an accessible room with 2 beds. This worked out great because the extra grab bars are helpful for little children. The room was pleasing to the eye. I found nothing to be unhappy about. What else? I liked the toiletries. Good smelling shampoo and lotion. The desk staff were friendly. 24 hour coffee available with flavored creamers (a plus in my book!).

Despite its downtown location, you can expect the cookie-cutter, \"highway-style\" Courtyard; this probably won't appeal to urban architecture buffs. The desk staff are beyond friendly, and don't be surprised if they don't need to ask your name on a subsequent visit. If you don't walk away from check-in with a smile on your face, then you are beyond hope. The rooms and breakfast area are just about what you'd expect from this brand. Free munchies and lemonade/water are left out in the lobby early in the evening. The exercise room is serviceable, though a bit cramped. Location: Just a few blocks NW of the epicenter of downtown. To the West, most of the IUPUI campus can be reached (on foot!) within ten minutes. Unless you're using this location as a jumping-off point for more distant business, ditch the car and get some exercise, fellow road warrior!!! Oh, and the nightly rate is generally $100 cheaper than the full-service Marriott that's only three blocks away.

All of us that are a bit over-awed and apprehensive about staying in city-center of a large metropolis, forget it when staying at this inn.

My wife and I spent two nights (Mon- Tues) and walked the Central Canal ((adjacent to the Courtyard) without any concerns. Rooms a bit pricey but it was Indy 500 weekend. Breakfast charge $8.67 (tax inc) for all you dare eat and great service. A parking fee! but wait, not for staying guests.(secure parking area) Desk staff bubbly and assuring.

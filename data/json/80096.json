I read tons of reviews on this place and was a little concerned by all the negativity! But the location was amazing, so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot, and for the price, it was too good of a deal to pass up. People were saying the, carpet/room dirty, no hot water, no ice machine, loudness of people outside, no parking, rude staff, no one helped with carrying bags, blinds falling apart, etc. None of that is true!!! I had called on our way into town, and the extremely nice lady at the front desk said we could get an early check in. The moment we pulled up, there was tons of parking. Yes the Diamond Head Inn does only have 4 parking spaces reserved for guest only, but along the street, right in front of the Inn, there are about 20 parking spaces. And we found a spot everytime we came back from somewhere. Although you really don't ever need to take your car anywhere, because everything is within walking distance. (But we like to venture out, and cruise down pch!) So we got there, checked in, the lady was extremely helpful; she even walked us to our room to be sure we wouldn't get lost! As soon as we walked into the room, I felt so relieved. You could smell the cleanliness of it, and the carpet was not dirty at all!! I guess this place was renovated about 4+ years ago, but if you ask me it is still in very good condition! The room was beautifully decorated with a bungalow type feel. And no blinds falling apart! When you walk straight into the back of the room, you enter a very nice size kitchen with a table and seating area for about 4 people. It was fully equipped with a refridgerator, microwave, and stove. And all cooking and silverware utensils, along with plates and glasses. The bathroom was extremely clean!! A little on the small side, but definitely did not bother us! As for the ice machine, there isnt one easily accessible, but we did go to the front desk, and the lady said they had some, but because she was so friendly and honest, she said it was most likely old, and told us we could go to the hotel next door and get some from them. She even called over there to let them know we were stopping by to get some. Our stay here was absolutely amazing. We went out during the day, but ended up just staying in at night because it had that nice, warm, cozy feel. We celebrated my boyfriends birthday, Valentines day, aaaandddd he proposed to me here down on the beach!! I am so glad we stayed at this Inn, because it just made all the celebrating that much better!!! This will always be a place we return to, not only for the great memories, but for the wonderful stay that we had here! Thank You to all the staff at the Diamond Head Inn! I hope this review helps a lot of people find their way to this beautiful spot in Pacific Beach!", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "31\u00b0 54\u2019 04.32\u201d N / 35\u00b0 00\u2019 51.82\u201d E", "Title": "\u201cPleasant rooms on a good location\u201d", "Author": "GeoPhil", "ReviewID": "UR121550312", "Content": "We: 2 families with adult children We were friendly received by the front desk staff.

Ok, some some reviews were extremely negative - but most were very positive. There lies the issue. Don't believe all you read!! We booked into the small untidy office and collected the room key. As soon as we entered the room (110), we were in total darkness and no light switch. After opening the blinds and turning on all the sidelights (this was at 3pm), it became obvious why dark would have been better. The carpet was badly stained in several places, pillows were off white with stains, walls had shoe scuffs on them and the chair was badly stained. It's at this stage you look deeper. The vertical wall radiators were filthy with dust/dirt/grime on every element and the place just felt dirty. Even the wall picture above the bed was broken. The back door opens out to a very dubious rear footpath and the rear windows have no security on them at all. Rear door just has a standard lock on it. Kitchen utensils can be counted on one hand. We asked to see another room, that was even smaller though marginally less stained - with the staff being entirely indifferent to our issues with filth and staining. Time to call Hotels.com for a full refund and get the hell out of the dump. I read a lot about the wonderful staff offering up a valuable car parking space. But lets figure this one out. The Hotel only has 4 spaces allocated to it - when it has 21 rooms. The Manager thinks its ok to suggest having to use parking facilities several blocks away - and yet reviewers have thanked staff for moving their cars to allow them to park????? So you think Diamond Head is cheap? Think again. You have to pay $7.95 a day for internet and will probably have to park several blocks away. We got a reservation at the Dana om Missionary Bay for the SAME price as the Diamond Head. If you have already booked or are still going to book - CHECK THE ROOM OUT FIRST. Also book with someone with clout who will ensure you get a 100% refund - like hotels.com. A final note - I emailed the Hotel 3 times before we arrived to inquire up an upgraded room - not one email was replied to. This may be a great hotel for surf bums, who will likely be too smashed out of their heads to notice the filth - but with age comes an expectation of what a Hotel should be - and clean is usually top of the list. It amazes me that there are so many positive reviews for what is a dump of an establishment.

It was quite miserable when returning for the night - very hot and stuffy. Location was perfect, down town San Diego, Sea World, and San Diego Zoo are all less than ten miles (about 15min car ride depending on traffic). Overall it was a very enjoyable weekend.

I grew up in this Pacific Beach & was visiting for the first time in 15 years. My main priority when chooseing this hotel was #1 price, #2 proximity to the Beach (i'm not a pool person). 1st: Our initial surprise was the NO A/C since it was 90 when we arrived. Slowly that became no big deal since we had the 2nd floor ocean facing room & the breeze from the ocean cooling our room off quickly. At night how ever this was a problem because you could not close the door & block out the outdoor boardwalk & parking lot noise. Also there was no screen on the balcony sliding door just a sheer curtain, luckily no sparrows or bugs really got in the room. 2nd: Our room did face the ocean BUT before the ocean was a parking lot, then a grassy knoll where the bums LIVED & then the ocean. So the view was a little not so great or private feeling. 3rd: The \"contential breakfast\" was pretty weak! Coffee & doughnuts, a muffin or pastry maybe, & juice. I guess I was expecting the best western level of food. Hit Kono's at the Boardwalk & Garnet... the Best breakfast in PB & cheap. Sit inside on windy days & enjoy a surfing video or take it outside to the patio off the pier over the ocean... You can't beat it! On the up side the room & kitchen was decent sized & well equipped. Overall Diamond Head inn: you get what you pay for. Great location, as far as in the center of it all, but not a secluded or romantic. Feels very exposed to the parking lot & baordwalk. But close to Garnet Ave. Beach etc. But great price considering the Pacific Terrace next door charges $400+ a night. Not sure that I would book this place again or suggest friends to stay there for more than a day or two & would definitely not suggest staying in the other rooms where your windows open off the main walkway. Spring for this room if your going to this place! Weather was a little shaky, 85 & 90's & sunny one day & then 3 days of clouds & 55. May & June are prone to Fog & what locals call \"June Gloom\" so avoid if you've never been there. SD Overall: PB & La Jolla are the best that San Diego have to offer... PB is more surfer, laid back, the BEST Beach & college partiers. LJ more lush, beautiful, secluded cove beaches. I highly suggest any traveler to take La Jolla BLvd. North from PB into LJ & explore along the coast on the side roads. The beautiful beaches & homes are spectacular!

We booked a promotional rate on the website and ended up paying $69/night, an unbelievable price considering the amenities, neighborhood and proximity to the beach. We requested a one bedroom suite and mentioned that we would be two adults and one child. They accomodated us well by putting us in a room with two queen beds (I didn't even see this option listed). I thought that was a nice touch. The lobby area isn't impressive, but who spends time in the lobby. The rooms are very nicely decorated and clean. The kitchenettes are very newly remodeled and have granite countertops and table. It was a very comfortable room (despite the lack of air conditioning). It was in the low 50s on the first night and we couldn't get our wall heater to work. A maintenance person came within minutes of reporting the problem and it was fixed immediately. The temperature ended up in the high 80s on the last day of our trip and to be honest the room was uncomfortably warm. I was glad we were packing up that day. The continental breakfast was muffins, awful coffee, and \"juice.\" Fortunately, we went to Trader Joe's on our first night and stocked up on breakfast items, so just used the muffins as a snack. The kitchennetes have a stove-top, full-size microwave, a small fridge, and sink. I think that adding pantry staples such as cooking spray, salt, and pepper would be a good idea, because cooking eggs on old teflon pans isn't always tasty. We never had a problem parking within one block of the hotel during our six day stay. I'm sure this becomes more of a problem during the late summer, but it wasn't an issue for us at all. The only major complaint that I have is that there was no internet AT ALL. The website lists \"wired\" internet as an amenity. This would have been a serious problem if my husband couldn't connect his computer to the internet through his Blackberry. I wouldn't have booked there at all had I known they didn't offer internet. This oversight needs to be immediately updated on their website. I'm glad however, that we stayed at the Diamond Head Inn. The price was exceptional.

We would stay at Diamond Head Inn again because the people were great, it was right on the Boardwalk, and it was a great value....Thanks for the great service, and we can't wait to return...Randy and Annie", "Date": "February 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torrance, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot what was promised\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2499133", "Content": "Stayed here in May 2004 with my husband and 2 children. Was told by reservations that I booked a 2 room suite (each room having its own tv), that the hotel had been completely remodeled, there was parking in the street which would be no problem as it was not summer yet, and there was a complimentary continental breakfast available in the morning. We checked into our room which had a tiny room with a very uncomfortable fold out sofabed and a small tv, the bedroom was so small we could hardly walk by the bed to the bathroom and there was no tv in the bedroom. The room had been remodeled but it was very poorly lit and the bathroom was very tiny. We went back to the front desk to change our room but was told we got the last one. We had the unfortunate luck of having someone celebrating her 21st birthday so at 2am we heard loud yelling, cursing, etc... from the party. As there was no number to call for the front desk, my husband had to walk outside to the front desk. No one was there but there was a number of who to call in an emergency. We called the off-site manager and told him about the noise and he said he would do something about it. At 4am the noise continued so again we called back. We would have called the police but there was no phone book to look up the number. After a horrible night's sleep, we checked out in the morning and complained about our room and that we were not given what was told to us by their reservations agent. The manager did apologize about the noise but what could he do. The continental breakfast was 1 thermos of coffee, a tray of danish and a plastic pitcher of something red that looked like punch. I don't know how they could feed all their guests with that little. We never found parking near the hotel so we parked on the next street over which was a little bit of a walk. I emailed the parent company right away 2 times to complain and never heard from them. Finally I called their reservations line and she forwarded my complaint. Someone did call back from the hotel and I told him I felt deceived by the promises made by reservations and I wanted a partial refund of my price paid. He offered us a free night in the future but we would NEVER stay there again. To his credit, he did authorize a partial refund of our rate paid so at least we got something back for such a horrible stay. The only good part is that we could walk to the beach but I would never stay there again nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone! Thanks for your site which lets me tell others not to stay at this hotel.", "Date": "August 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1674837", "Content": "We were pleasantly surprised with our stay at the diamond head inn, you always wonder what kind of hotel you are going to get for less than $100 night.

HOWEVER, what is it that you want from your hotel? The price was incredibly inexpensive especially for being right by the beach and in southern California. From what I have read, some travellers were expecting a world class resort with five stars. The hotel and its staff never promised nor advertised such amenities. If that's what you want, then expect to pay for it. One person made the comment that he or she moved to the hotel across the street, which he or she commented as being \"much nicer\". Well, I noticed that the price was $100.00 more a night. That is a significant difference! The hotel marketed itself in a very professional manner and when I contacted the office, they were very honest in letting us know the amenities, location, and condition of the hotel. They told me that it was under repair but we would get a spacious room with a kitchenette. We had a suite with four separate rooms and a complete working kitchen! All this for less than $100.00 per night! We were usually outside on the beach or in town anyway and the room was more than enough to give us a place to rest at night! It was extremely safe and clean. In conclusion, the Diamond Head Inn and its staff surpassed my expections.", "Date": "December 21, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loudon, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel ever!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1424425", "Content": "This is the worst hotel ever... I will never suggest this hotel to anyone. In fact, because it was so horrible my husband and I moved to another hotel after only one night. We got to this hotel on Wednesday, September 24, 2003 for three nights. When we checked in the front desk clerk immediately told us that there wasn't any water for at least an hour because they were doing construction on the building. Fine, I understood that these things happen. We dropped our bags in our room and went for a walk on the beach. This is the only thing that was going for this hotel, it was so close to the beach. When we opened the door to the room it was not clean and it had a gross mustly smell but I was determined to make the best of it. When we got back after two hours we did have water. I was looking at my reservation confirmation wondering how I could have spent $100 on this hotel and noticed that it said \"all rooms with kichenettes.\" This room definetly did not have a kitchenette. I decided to ask at the front desk. He told me that he did not have any rooms left with the kitchenette but could move us to a suite. I thought, oh good this has got to be better. Well I was wrong. Yes, technically it was a suite. A kitchen, livingroom, bathroom, and bedroom but this room smelled worst than the last. The rug looked like it had stains all over it so bad that I wouldn't even take off my shoes to walk around. The bathroom was missing the toliet paper holder, the toliet ran constantly and faucet dripped. The bathroom had stains all over the walls and looked liked it had never been clean. The pillow cases had stains and because we didn't have any air conditioner we looked in the closet and they had three box fans that were covered in more dust than my grandmother's attic. We decided to suck it up for the first night to see what happened. It actually made me nausea to lay my head down on that pillow. The next day we moved across the street to the Pacific Terrace Hotel which was heven compared to this hotel and only cost $100 more a night. A small price to pay for piece of mind. When my husband checked out the guy at the front desk told him that this happened quite frequently and that's why they were attempting to renovate. At our check in they told us that because this particular hotel didn't have a pool we could use the one at their sister hotel (never told us where) and that a continental breakfast was served in the morning (never told us what time or where). I think this hotel attempts to rip people off. They need to do more than renovate and it really isn't fair if they know that there hotel is in such bad shape to rent it out to others. Close it down and renovate. I will never go back.", "Date": "October 28, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Diamond Head Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80096-Reviews-Diamond_Head_Inn-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$111 - $246*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">605 Diamond St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "80096", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/04/2a/042aa4dbd2fdbd14c60c7db643cb37ae3large.jpg"}}

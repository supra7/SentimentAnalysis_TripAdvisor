The indoor pool is nice but was extrememly cold. My five year old didn't seem to mind. We ate the free breakfast on the first of our three days there. It didn't offer a large enough variety to please everyone in the family so we chose to go out the following two mornings. We booked through priceline and had no difficulty checking in on a busy Friday. The room we were given had a nice view and smelled clean. There were spots on the carpet but the carpet appeared vacuumed. Initially we were pleased with the room. After unloading the car and putting things away, I let my eight month old down on the floor to crawl around. She crawled across the room a couple times and then when I picked her up, her hands, feet, and knees were black. I rubbed my hand over the carpet and it turned black as well. When I told the woman at the desk about it she informed me that the carpet was due for a shampoo but that they had not been able to do it because of the busy season. I said I understood but that I would like a room with cleaner carpet. She stated that they were 100% booked and there was nothing they could do for us. I insisted that I needed a clean room for my child and she spoke to the facilty manager. He repeated everything she had said and implied that because we booked through priceline and not through them so we would not receive \"preferential treatment'. I said I expect a clean room whether I book through them or through an alternative website. After several minutes of insisting on a clean room and refusing to change rooms each night I was staying with them, they agreed to put us in another for the duration of our stay. The new room we were given only turned my daughters knees grey, not black so I suppose it was a step up.

It is also kind of spooky walking that far at night. We had no soap or shampoo or whatever it was supposed to be in our bathroom dispenser and I told the front desk- it didn't get filled for the 3 days we were there. I just asked for bar soap instead. On the last day they didn't give us an extra roll of toilet paper and we barely made due with what we had. Otherwise, I was really impressed with the staff- there was always someone there to help out. The woman re-filling the breakfast nook was unbelievable.

My sons and I stayed at Angel Inn for spring break, which happened to be just three weeks after the tornado hit, leaving one of Angel's Inn's building without a roof. At first, I was concerned that the noise from the construction would ruin our stay, but we never heard a sound from them, or from our neighbors in the room next door for that matter. By the time we left, it appeared that the roof had been replaced so I'm sure the hotel will have all there rooms available in no time. As for the rooms, that is what impressed me the most with Angel Inn. In most hotels anymore, they put the cheapest possible furniture they could find in their rooms; well all I can say is if this was the cheapest furniture Angel Inn could find, they found themselves a GREAT deal! It really makes me feel as if they see me a guest, not a body with a credit card. Also, the rooms are noticeably larger than other hotels and if you are traveling with kids, that extra foot or so makes a HUGE difference!

I told the somewhat uncaring girl at the desk I saw only a few cars in the parking lots so there were LOT of room available. She would not budge. Since I was tired from driving all day, I agreed to try the room. Big mistake. Besides being difficult to get to, the AC thumped all night long so i got very little sleep. The next day I went to the desk to tell them our problems. There was a different girl on duty. She CHEERFULLY gave us a FIRST FLOOR room exactly as we had requested in the first place. However, we had to move all our luggage etc ourselves as no help was offered. So why were there a ton of room available on Tuesday but none on Monday ? IMHO because the first girl just didn't want to be bothered with it (or us). The second room was fine. I noticed the WIFI was better than it had been in June when we were there. At that time, they had no Internet connection for over a day. It still disconnected very quickly, but something is better than nothing !

We have 2 small daughters and got a room with two queen beds. Upon arriving, I asked the boy at the front desk where a good place to eat dinner was. He said he really didn't know, that he \"hasn't eaten anywhere in Branson\". Huh? anyway, we got our keys and went to our room. While it it didn't look great, I've seen worse. However, besides the main comforter (that I usually avoid using in hotels) there were no other blankets. Also (and this may be small) but there were no bottles of shampoo in the bathroom, just a big dispenser mounted on the shower wall. But none of these were the deciding factor in us leaving and getting another hotel after one night in the Angel Inn. The deciding factor was the two large bugs we saw under the sheets of one of the beds. This was not well received by my daughters or my wife.

The next day I went to check out and was told that he gave me too much change the day before. I explained that I gave him $40 and he gave me $15 change and that was correct. Then I was told that if they gave me the $25.00, which by the way was still in the sealed envelope that the man the day before had me put it in, then his drawer would be short $20.00 and he would get in trouble so would I just take the $5.00 so he wouldn't get in trouble. I am not sure how his drawer being $20.00 short became my responsibility but after discussion with the lady behind the counter I did not get the $20.00 I only received $5.00 of my deposit back.

We are so glad that we did and we agree this is the best hotel, amenities, staff, location, etc. that you can get! The front desk personnel were helpful and attentive. Every morning, Michelle greeted you with a cheery \"good morning!\" in the breakfast room. She was very attentive and diligent about checking food levels, cleaning up counters and tables and running the dining area. She was wonderful and we left her a nice tip on our last morning there. In fact, I'd say she deserves a raise! It's nice that you can get toast or bagels, donuts, fruit, cereal, etc. every day and that the hot dish is either eggs and french toast one day or biscuits and gravy the next. Something different each day, depending on how many days you stay. My only suggestion for the breakfast room is that when there are bus tours staying there, the breakfast room is very crowded and seating is limited, so maybe building onto the room to make more room for seating would be helpful for all involved. The rooms were immaculate and housekeeping did an awesome job of cleaning them daily. My boyfriend appreciated that there was a hair/body wash dispenser on the wall in the shower so he wouldn't even have had to bring his own. We also left them a tip on our last morning there for the housekeeping staff. The service staff really do a good job and deserve a tip for their hard work! The indoor pool/hot tub area is nice and relaxing (as long as there isn't a slew of kids in there). Great that you can go swimming indoor at a hotel in October when all the other hotels with outdoor pools have drained theirs! We also appreciated that there was a fridge for drinks and ice in our room and to keep our leftovers in, and a microwave to warm them up in. Saves a lot of money and is a great benefit! The pillow top mattresses were nice and we slept great. We didn't have to run the heater but did run the air conditioner. We wouldn't really have had to if only we could have gotten the cool outside air into the room with a fan feature or some sort of fan in the room. Also, be aware that somehow the faucets were wired backwards (in our room at least) with H actually being Cold and C actually being Hot. Not a big deal for us adults once we figured it out but maybe for kids it would be confusing. Angel Inn is just a block off the strip and you can take the yellow route if you don't want to go on the strip. The grounds are well lit and feel safe and we liked the balconies to stand or sit and just relax. If you stay in the back of the first building, watch for the volcano going off at night at the nearby dinosaur miniature golf establishment. Kinda cool!

(Our original plan was to switch hotels after two nights if we weren't happy with this one. However, in the end, we decided to stay here, because it was less of a gamble than moving elsewhere.) Rooms are spacious... probably a bit more than competitors... since this is a former Hampton Inn. However, this is one of those exterior-access / balcony-access hotels...no interior hallways to get to your room. That said, this is probably considered to be high-quality of that tier of hotels. Our room was clean, though housekeeping seemed a bit inconsistent in some things (ice bucket emptied and cleaned-up one day, but not the next). I was showering the first morning and bumped the lower soap dish with my knee... and the dish fell off (and thankfully, didn't hit me because it was pretty heavy-duty). Maintenance had it fixed the next day. One front desk person was very friendly and helpful. The other...well... not as much. When we asked for extra towels, they actually recorded in the computer that our room had received two extra towels! (Wow, talk about making you feel like you're in some sort of \"camp\"!) Which was silly, because you can walk right into the pool area and steal slightly-smaller towels all day if you want. My wife complained that the towels were very scratchy. Called them \"sandpaper towels\". Air conditioner pumped out cold air, which we were very thankful for, given that it's been 100 degrees all week. My wife and I agree that the best feature of our stay was the pillowtop mattress. We had some great night sleeps and one afternoon nap. This is what kept us at this motel. The pool is smaller than photos would have you think. I think perhaps, given the high volume of families here this week (right before back-to-school), we would have used the pool more if it had been a bit bigger and less crowded. But hey, there are plenty of other hotels around here that I can see with same sized pool. One thing where they're obviously cutting corners though: energy expenses for the pool area. Despite the fact that this is an indoor pool, I was disappointed to find it with windows wide-opened all around... and the water unheated. So, it's basically like being at an outdoor pool with sun and rain protection. I'm sure one might say that they wouldn't want to be air conditioned in an indoor pool area....might be too cold. But if it's 100 degrees or is very humid outside, you might. Breakfast offerings seemed in keeping with what just about every other hotel offers for a continental breakfast. Biscuits and gravy some days, french toast others, doughnuts, breads, and cereals otherwise. Breakfast was usually quite crowded. We're thinking of coming back to Branson in two months for a shorter stay. If we do, I will most likely try to cough up the extra $20-25 per night to put us into a hotel one notch higher. Still, if you're trying to stretch your money and you don't mind a balcony-access hotel, give this hotel at least a one night try.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jonesboro, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, affordable, accessible\u201d", "Author": "bssfuller", "ReviewID": "UR73951628", "Content": "I have stayed in this motel with my husband and grandchildren so I knew it was a nice motel...this time I was traveling solo.

I found Angel Inn on Tripadvisor, and most of the reviews were wonderful. And with the price being a great deal, I figured why not try this hotel. We arrived on Saturday and the room was nice, very comfortable beds and it seemed clean. After checking in, we decided to go swimming. The pool was smaller than the pictures I seen on the website, but it was good enough. The stay was fine until Monday. The first encounter we had with a lady at the front desk who was very rude, was when my fiancee went to the desk to turn in our dirty towels and ask for some new ones. The lady told my fiancee, in a rude way,\"I don't even know if we have any towels to give you. \" We got three and that was it. The next encounter was later that day. We slept in a little Monday after a full day at Silver Dollar City on Sunday. I got in the shower about 11:00 am and had a full head of shampoo, when the water just stopped. We had no water at all in our room. My sister went to the office and spoke to the same older woman at the office. When my sister told the lady we had no water. The lady just grabbed a letter ( that we had never seen anywhere) and said \"didn't you get one of these?\" My sister said no, and the lady said \"well we tried to call every room\", and she offered no other solution. When my sister arrived back at the room and told me what she said, I decided to call the front desk and speak to someone. The same lady, who didn't seem to interested in my problem, said \"well I told the lady who just came down, you should have recieved a call and got a letter, what would you like us to do?\" I said \"I have been in our room all morning, no one has called. And when we checked in on the 24th (this is also the day the letter was dated), we received no letter.\" I said,\" I am full of shampoo and body wash, what am I suppose too do? \" She said,\"well the water is expected to be off most of the day.\" I said \"well can I get into another room just to finish showering, I am full of soap.\" She said \"yeah well we will see what we can do\", and hung up. Then she called back and said, \"well come to the office and get a key to take a shower\" So I went to the front desk and she said well I am sorry about that. Which is great, I'll accept the apology, but she did not seem very sincere and was still rude. I said, will this be a move for the night with the water being off all day? As noone could use the bathroom or anything. And her response was, again very rude tone,\" well Ma'am what do you want to do?\" I said I just want to wash all the soap off of me. So I got another key to a room and go tto finish my shower. Which was a great solution, after I suggested it. I would probably of had soap all over me for the rest of the day, if I hadn't brought it up. I was under the impression that at a hotel, the staff works with their customers to make them happy. This was not the case with this particular lady. I was not impressed with her, she seemed very rude and wasn't friendly at all. And the letter my sister got from the lady was dated 7/24, this incident happend on 7/26. I would have thought a letter about the water being shut off for the day, should have been put on display at the front desk, or given to us at check-in, or posted on the entry door to the office so all the guests would be prepared for this. Overall, the hotel is nice. Breakfast was not bad at all. The bed was very comfortable, and we did get a good night sleep. One thing that was puzzling to me is, the cleaning people continued to clean the rooms the day that all the water was shut off. I don't know how the rooms could have been cleaned thoroughly with no water. The lady at the front desk was awful, she is not someone who should be working in hospitality. Also, the computer that was int he lobby for use by the guests was out of order the whole time we were there. We did have to check out a day early due to having to make an emergency trip to the dentist. I was not charged for the extra night, that was nice and got no complaints when checking out.

So when I read a review that said the Angel in was formerly a Hampton It got my attention. However the price of the room made me wonder if it had been run down since then, but from other reviews I took the chance. We were not disappointed! It is an older model with the outside access to rooms and no elevators, but once we stepped inside it was like visiting an old friend. The bed and pillows were so comfy, and the furniture, fixtures and even the towels and shower curtain were just like being in a Hampton for half the price. The staff was very friendly even the pool man went out of his way to take care of me when I wanted to use the jacuzzi after breakfast and he was servicing it and the pool. Located just off the strip and very easy to access the colored routes that will save you so much time in getting places if you get a map and use it. Considering the cost of the room the Breakfast was a great deal. If you have special needs for shampoo you might want to bring you own, as they have the dispenser in the shower with a combo Shower gel/ shampoo ( that smelled really great ) Tip.. if your room is on the third floor, park in the spots on the side close to the office and use stairs from that side.. you will only have one flight of stairs vs. driving around back and entering from the center of the building.

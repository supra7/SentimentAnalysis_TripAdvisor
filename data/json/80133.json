We rented a car for a days' drive up the coast to La Jolla and beyond, and the office for renting vehicles is about 15 steps from the front desk. Both Jeff and Rich were very polite and timely on their shutle pickups and deliveries. Thanks guys. Jeff made a recommendation for a nice meal our final night in California - a steak house and prime rib place just walking distance from the hotel and provided a couple of discount coupons to boot. It's a great restaurant and if you are looking for an off property special meal, this is the place!! All in all we had a wonderful trip to San Diego and the Handlery more than met our expectations.

My family went to San Diego for a 4 night vacation and we were so happy with the Handlery! $20 cab ride to hotel from the airport. Excellent front desk service right away...gave us options for which room we would prefer...answered all our questions. Jeff at the concierge desk was so helpful. We had hoped to hop on the Old Town Trolley tours that stop in front of the hotel but we arrived late in the afternoon. So Jeff offered to drive us directly to the Old Town Trolley ticket office so we could still get in on their last few routes of the day. My family tired out quickly that afternoon and we called Jeff. He jumped in the Handlery van and quickly came and picked us up downtown. Day 2: We wanted to go up to Disneyland. Jeff set up the Grayline to pick us up in front of the hotel and take us for a day of fun in Anaheim. Day 3: The Handlery provided a ride again both ways for us to go to SeaWorld (only 10 min. away from the hotel). Day 4: We wanted to head to the San Diego Zoo, only 10 min from the hotel. Again, the hotel provided a quick ride to and from the zoo. The driver gave us lots of helpful information on tours in the zoo and quick tips. The Postcard Restaurant in the hotel is exceptional! The first night they quickly (in 10 min) brought us room service (club sandwiches, fries, & onion rings). We had breakfast every morning in Postcards. They have many choices for breakfast at a reasonable price. Jose and Juan took care of everything we needed. (Now that we are home we miss them already!) Supper in Postcards was excellent as well. On Sunday they had prime rib dinner for $20...Excellent!! The room was quiet, clean, and very comfortable. They recently had a makeover renovation and it was very contemporary with big screen tv.

A desk with a lamp with power sockets. The room didn't have a safe. The bathroom was on the small size but still very clean.

MISC - big car park so no problem with parking you need a security pass to get in and out of the car park however what they fail to tell you is they charge $8 per day to park. Another downside was that they charge $10 per day for wifi. However they do provide a free shuttle bus to San Diego zoo & sea world. OVERALL THOUGHTS - while I recommend this hotel and had a pleasant stay I would suggest that they reconsider their wifi charges as this was the 3rd hotel I had stayed in on this trip and the only hotel that charged for their wifi.

We went to the zoo and sea world and transport to those are free with a shuttle supplied by the hotel. And the driver, well, he was perfect. Made us feel very welcome and explained everythong we could and should do while we were staying so if you see him and want advise... Definitely ask! And although we never got chance to see the Safari Park the zoo and Sealife centre were amazing so would definitely recommend. The breakfact was continental so we werent expecting much, and although it was basic they offer a huge range of items that they bring out with a huge pile of fruit... Im sorry i didnt always eat mine, i had an ulcer! But apart from that it was lovely and the waiters an waitresses are very accomidating. We had dinner when we got back from the zoo at the Postcards restaurant and we couldnt have been happier. Portion sizes are perfect and your given a basket of bread which is a lovely touch. We had starters and mains and it only come to $39 which we think is phenominal.

After arriving with no luggage due to the airline losing it on our travels, the reception staff were genuinely lovely in accommodating with toiletries and anything we needed. All staff at this hotel were friendly and went out there way to help us get the best out of our stay. The concierge and reception staff offered great assistance and advice on how to get around in San Diego, as well as calling various taxi services to get the cheapest deal for our return trip to the airport! The manager also opened the small store when it was closed so we could purchase suncream before heading to the beach. The rooms were to a high standard and the pool area tranquil, with the added luxury of a actually good band playing into the sunset. One aspect of this hotel's amenities was the shuttle service that runs to the Old Town, San Diego Zoo and Seaworld was a fantastic service, and free to use! Jeff who runs the shuttles was our perfect tourist guide, giving us the inside tips what to see first at the zoo, and making extra runs to fit us in as we forgot to book the shuttle the previous night. He took us to bus and trolley routes and explained how we got to the districts we were visiting, which were only two stops away, as well as telling us to buy the $5 all day ticket to save money! So helpful and kind! As well as always on perfect time to collect us at the arranged time after the zoo and seaworld! Could not fault this hotel in any way!

Initially when I went shopping for a room I came here to tripadvisor and read the reviews about the hotel which were decidedly positive. Then I decided to take it one step further and actually call the hotel in order to get a few more questions answered and get a feel for the professionalism of the staff, as I'm one of these people who firmly believes that you can tell a lot about a place by the tones of the voices you hear over the phone and how they handle your call or your inquiry. The guy I talked to was Jason who was super professional and welcoming, not to mention extremely informative about the Mission Valley area as well as the hotel itself. At the end of our chat he even went above and beyond by telling me to ask for him at check in and he would see to it that we were not only well taken care of but also that he would hook us up with whatever upgrades he could. While he wasn't actually there when we checked in - he had already worked his shift and was done for the day - I dropped his name and what he told me to the girl at the front desk and she was more than accommodating by wasting no time in upgrading our room to one with a patio which I thought was nice. Every single person working there is friendly and courteous and helpful and seems to really care about seeing to it that your stay at their hotel is an excellent one and you can tell this straight away. The room, I'm happy to say, was nicely appointed, VERY clean and comfortable, and at night was PERFECTLY quiet for relaxing and sleeping which is a huge deal to me, especially when you've stayed at enough places in the past where the walls were thin and you could hear all kinds of noise from people out by the pool, etc. Not so with this place and just on this point alone I would stay here again. Also the Handlery is well situated as it is well within about a 15 minute walking distance to a really nice mall as well as the trolley station for local transit. This came in handy as a few times I had to buy some things that we needed and also my bank had an ATM there which was perfect because I really don't like to pay the fees that come with banking at a foreign (bank other than your actual bank) ATM. We will definitely book at the Handlery next time we hit the Con. The only thing I think I would change or make better, and this is not necessarily a criticism so to speak, is if the Handlery could somehow find a way to provide transportation to and from the airport. There's a limo service that does a lot of business there (in addition to taxis pulling up there in front all the time), I think it was called Green Ride or something like that, and it costs about $25 to get to the airport ($21 plus $4 gratuity) and that's what we ended up having to go with. Perhaps it has something to do with being located in Mission Valley I'm not sure but like I said it's not a criticism of the place overall. GREAT job Handlery staff and thank you again!

The nightly rate was very reasonable considering all this, and I was in for such a pleasant surprise. ROOMS- were very clean, bathroom modern and clean and wow the shower was great - water pressure was high, what a nice bonus that was. Soap was lemony yum and shampoo was also pleasant. They had a dryer and iron as well. We had a balcony upgrade for free which was great. Mini fridge available but no microwave (boo). PARKING- plenty of spaces near our hotel room, but I think it's ridiculous to charge 12 per day for hotel guests. It would be better to just back it into the price instead of remembering to calculate into our expenditures. POOL- one of the nicest hotel pools I've seen. Not packed when we went, which was a surprise, and everyone should know that the pool itself is open to the public - so anyone can come in , park and enjoy this pool too. I don't think that's a well known fact due to the # of people I saw at the pool each day. Pool was large and L shaped, kids stayed mostly to the shallow part, and us adults enjoyed plenty of space in the deeper section. There is a whirlpool/hot tub there but since there were oodles of kids in there, my boyfriend and I didn't want to um, share with that. You should expect the whirlpool to be occupied at all times! Still, that was ok with us. Indoor bar onsite, served pretty decent food and just about all drinks. Pool closed at 10pm. On certain nights they show a movie poolside at 8pm. Great concept, expect since the pool closes at 10, you may have people - ok KIDS - splashing and screaming in the pool, and so unless you are like right up on the screen, may be hard to hear. Maybe someone should rethink the rules or set up a louder speaker system when they do movie night.. it was a nice experience for us except for the moments of noise, screaming, and occasional splash of water on us (really parents? you couldn't be just a little bit more considerate of us by asking your kids to keep it down a little or just not to splash us?? Hello!) I think the hotel would get more people to watch movies if they restrategize this, thus making the set up and equipment worth it. STAFF- pleasant enough, no complaints here. WIFI - you have to pay $10 a day for WiFi. Really? Another gripe - so if you're driving in, and need to use your computer, tack on 22 buckaroos per day between parking and wifi fees. Since we stayed 5 days, that can really add up. Thankfully my phone allowed for mobile hotspot so we bypassed that, but it was a big pain. Nowadays nearly every place has free Wifi - we stopped at a Super 8 on our costal drive up to San Francisco and even they had free wifi! Come on - the parking and wifi may be enough to turn a lot of people away from this hotel, so I highly recommend rethinking this. My boyfriend couldn't stop complaining about the costs and I really wished the price was baked into the nightly rate so it didn't annoy me as much. Overall, the hotel was wonderful, easy to find, reasonable car ride from all major sights of beautiful San Diego. If I had to go back, I may not go back only b/c of the extra fees which I really feel are ridiculous for this hotel.

The bathroom was large enough, with a shower/tub combination. We spent most of the evening poolside, and made a quick trip down to Old Town for some great Mexican food recommended to us by the really helpful and friendly security officer. The room was absolutely quiet and because of the non-linear lineup of rooms, we heard no other guests, so a great night's sleep was had by all. The next night's entertainment was a poolside, kid-friendly movie. We liked the property very much, and the fact that we had a fridge enabled us to pick up some things for breakfast so that the kids weren't starving first thing in the morning (no free breakfast, though they did have room service if you wanted). Now, my pet peeve rant: It seems that almost all properties in the Hotel Circle area charge a daily parking rate. I'm not sure why this is essential for paying guests, and it's something that is a personal issue for me. I find this particularly strange, however, in that Hotel Circle isn't in the city center, or next to one of the many attractions in San Diego. ...it's a bunch of hotels and conference centers and a golf course or two. So, why the parking fees? Are there really that many freeloading locals wanting to park their cars out in the middle of a bunch of hotels?", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Ang", "Title": "\u201cBeware parking fee\u201d", "Author": "Justfuntraveler", "ReviewID": "UR115928982", "Content": "This is an older hotel that was renovated, but they seemed to have spent a lot more money on the lobby area than on the rooms.

Normally parking is $12 per night and you have to pay for Wi-Fi. -centrally located, close to mall, easy access to freeway, really close to seaworld, downtown san diego, zoo, etc. -lots of towels provided, nice TV and room furniture The bad stuff: -something came out of the drain the first time we turned on the shower - it was like a large cockroach or something, about the size of an inch. it wouldn't go down either, had to keep putting extra hot water as it scurried around. Scared the bejezzus out of me and my son. -had some water dripping out of the air conditioning in the morning. We were in a hurry to get to legoland so I we just put the ice bucket under the leak and said we'd come back in the evening to report it but it stopped. The air conditioning is on the ceiling so it was dripping down to the carpet. Wonder how often it does that. -complimentary breakfast (also a part of the online deal) was a joke! I understand continental but it was kind of ridiculous, I've had so much better free breakfasts at other cheaper hotels. It consisted of some cut up fruit, yogurt, some croissants and apple pastries that were too small and hard, and I think you could order toast/a bagel. We had breakfast for 2 for 2 days and on the 2nd day we didn't even bother, we just went out for breakfast.

Starving, we went down to have lunch @2:15 at Postcards Bistro which according to the hotel's website is open for lunch 11AM - 3:00pm. We were told it was closed and did not open until 5:00pm. Staff suggested we go into the poolside bar. ON a Sunday afternoon they were having a \"pool party\" with a very LOUD band. The combination of the smell of freshly applied lacquer on the tacky surfer decor tables and benches and the horrible band that we found unbearably painful to listen to, we left. We asked for a shuttle ride to the San Diego Zoo to have lunch there and spend the rest of the day there. (shuttle is complimentary according to website). No problem except it was weird how the driver kept asking us our room number. Good thing we mentioned our husbands were back at the hotel. Then all seemed well until 9:00pm when the zoo closed because by the way - No shuttle. It stopped at 5:00pm \"because they only had one driver\". Hmmm, too bad for us I guess. So, out $20 for a cab ride back to the hotel. Approached exterior door with note to slide room key card for entry BUT door opened without it...so much for security. Decided to have balcony doors open for fresh air (paid upgrade for the balcony room). Door opened very wide but NO SCREEN to keep out any bugs! And staring right at us all the people at the hotel next door. Plus the rotted and termite eaten wood and peeling paint...another $20 out the window since we didn't use the balcony. Went down for some ice. On way back up bumped into my friend turning on the landing and she bumped the \"railing\" and it almost came off wall! OMG! What a joke! Shower - Ha!! I could stand in between the streams of water or stand directly under it with head against wall for the faucet like flow. In morning no pressure, toilet tank didn't even fill properly and we had to play around with it filling it with water using ice bucket. Before I forget, my friend was congested with sore throat and itchy eyes all night but we didn't know what was affecting her allergies...until the morning. On top of a couple of our items was a vast layer of dust which obviously was coming from the vents where the A/C came out as it went on and off all night. Clearly those ducts need cleaning.

Not even a chair to sit in except a fancy desk chair which was the place for the big pillows that smelled like other people's heads.

We came down from Los Angeles to visit the San Diego zoo before returning to New Zealand. The hotel was not what we expected from looking at their website, not in a bad way, just again not what we were expecting. The service was amazing! The reception staff could not be more helpful and the concierge who's name i have forgotten deserves a medal, as there are no elevators in the hotel and he was kind enough to help us with all 6 of our suitcases which were extremely heavy. He had a \"good morning\" for us each day we were there and was one of the most hard working people i have come across in all of my travels. The location for us was fine but i can see how it may be a problem if you want to see \"downtown San Diego\". The hotel is a little bit out from the central city, next to the freeway. We did not see any buses pass by but there was a shopping mall about 10-15 minutes walk away which had all the necessary shops, cafe's etc and a bus station. I must admit that the hotel was not what i was expecting, to me it seemed more like a motel but without the kitchen amenities. As i mentioned there are no elevators and there are three different blocks of rooms so there is a little walking and lifting involved, not good when you have 6 suitcases. The house keeping was exceptional and the rooms were spotless, however they were a little dated, our toilet lid in the bathroom had obviously broken and instead of replacing it they had reattached it with what looked like putty and superglue. The walls are also quite thin therefore we heard our next door neighbors talking and yelling for most of the second night both in their room and in the hallways. We had room service on the second night, it was delicious but by the time it arrived to us it was almost cold. It was also strange that i tried to order something from the menu and the women proceeded to tell me that it was no longer available. I thought they could have at least updated the in room menu. The breakfast each morning was really nice and again it was the waiters and waitresses who made it great, nothing was too much bother, however half of the breakfast seemed to be buffet and half was order, i.e you could go and get your own yogurt but had to order your toast which meant it took a little while. On the second morning we arrived at about 8, the dining hall was full so we had to sit in he lobby for about 5 minutes and by the time we were seated there was no yogurt etc left.

Pros: - Reef Lounge staff by the pool. Almost every single one has been top notch, with big props to Dan, who made a very long travel day seem better by being one of the first people we interacted with here. - Bed and pillows pretty comfortable, and extra pillows without asking was a plus. - 2 gentlemen in guest services (Michael and Rich) have been very pleasant to deal with in terms of looking up addresses for us or getting us a taxi quickly. Rich was also our shuttle driver and was very friendly and answered any questions we had. - Housekeeping and janitorial staff is very friendly and has been very accommodating when we've needed something. - Continental breakfast included as well as free internet (through bookit.com-it's listed on their website as \"fee\"). Cons (some may seem like no big deal, but they all add up to a mostly miserable experience): -When first arriving, no one was at the front desk or guest services desk (which we came to find out is very common). When a woman finally came out, she wasn't very friendly or helpful, was very abrupt, and then in the course of conversing about our airplane flight, made a joke about hanging herself. - We finally get our room only to find out it's in some other building that we had to walk to, that had no elevator to the second floor for carrying our baggage. They did offer to have someone help us with them, but I shouldn't really have to tip someone to take bags to my room because they don't have a way to do it yourself. -We get our keycard to finally open the room door (after about 4 tries, which is about what it's taken each time we try to get in our room) only to discover that the door is very sticky and needs to be slammed, and also that we were in an adjoining room connected to the room next to us by 2 thin doors (not to mention thin walls). This was OK for the first few days while it was quiet, but for at least the last 2 days there is a VERY noisy family that's been next door making it really annoying to listen to...not to mention listening to everyone else's doors slamming to get them shut at all hours. - There's a line of dust around the entire room, the drains go down very slowly, the water pressure is terrible, the bath mat wasn't clean and had hair in it and the bathroom doorknob wasn't even screwed in to the door. The room was VERY warm in here when we walked in, only to discover there was no A/C by the window as we're used to. We found the thermostat on the wall and it was set to 74, which we then dropped down to 68 or 66. It wasn't working so we turned it on high fan and down to 60 (which is as low as it will go) and it finally got better about halfway through the second day. - The continental breakfast that is included is a nice touch, however there is barely any choice of food, the fruit they put out is all cut up in a huge bowl and doesn't seem fresh at all. The dining room literally only has like 15-16 tables and always takes a few minutes to even get one. The first day we had to sit at the bar. The only staff member at Postcards (including hostess and waitstaff) that was pleasant and helpful was Lindel. Everyone else was just ho-hum and barely attentive as soon as you show them that you're using the free breakfast coupons, they could care less. We finished eating our breakfast one morning before we even managed to get our OJ and when it came, she brought the wrong juice. - During dinner tonight in the Reef Lounge, the bartender (who I don't know the name of but was an older guy maybe in his 50s) was discussing quite loudly with another patron about how he used to live in Hawaii and that Hawaiians speak \"pigeon English\", are \"working the system\", \"getting their welfare checks\" all while \"jumping the fence\" to sleep with each other's wives. Not exactly polite conversation for someone in the customer service field to be saying so loudly, or pretty much saying at all. - The gift shop (Paul's I think it's called) has limited hours posted on the door to the gift shop, however if you go there during those hours, we've mostly only seen it closed, which isn't helpful if you need to just grab some medicine or something to drink. We asked guest services if there was a local, walking distance pharmacy or grocery store and were told to walk 15 minutes down the street to the Fashion Valley Mall. This was at 9am and the mall didn't open until 10am, which we discovered WHEN WE GOT THERE. - The \"open pool policy\" here is ridiculous and NOWHERE did I see it listed on the hotel website because if I had, I never in a million years would have stayed here. They basically throw \"pool parties\" or show movies that invite the public to come hang out in their pool. However, this past Sunday when we were hanging out down there, we didn't know this and quickly saw all the lounge chairs fill up with \"the locals\" (particularly one sketchy guy that has been there every day) and the poor people that are PAYING to stay at the hotel were forced to sit on towels on the concrete surrounding the pool. - The \"shuttle\" they provide to the zoo and Sea World is nice and convenient, but is deceiving. Firstly, you see a long cargo van in front with their logo on it and expect that would probably be the shuttle, but you'd be wrong. They have an Enterprise Rent A Car in house and according to one comment the driver made one day, they use a regular mini van that they borrow from the Rent A Car place. This van they use is ridiculously small and cramped and they fill it on each trip so you're jammed in with people you don't know pretty much sitting on each other's laps. And it only seats 6 guests per trip, so if you miss one trip, you pretty much lose an hour and a half waiting for the next shuttle, and they also don't have very late pick-up times (4:00 was the latest and each park closed at like 7pm). - The bed had no fitted sheet on it. This might not seem like a big one, but if you toss and turn a lot (you know, like when you can't sleep due to hearing everyone in the hotel) then you get stuck laying on the mattress itself. The bed was made with a flat sheet, another flat sheet, a light comforter, another flat sheet and then a very scratchy bedspread on top. Weirdest thing I've ever seen. - One last little thing is that someone near us got room service twice. The first time they go it, they left their tray in front of OUR door (which I know isn't the hotel's problem) but then the second time they left it across the hall (not in front of anywhere in particular) and it's been sitting there since we went to breakfast this morning to when we came back from dinner tonight with half eaten food still on it. So it sat in that hallway, with housekeeping having to walk back and forth by it who knows how many times, for at least 9 hours (that we know of). MY BIGGEST ANNOYANCE: When we booked the hotel, we used bookit.com and it's prepaid for the week. However, when you check in they take a credit card from you for \"incidentals\". That's all fine and good, and to be expected, however when we checked in she just took the credit card info and entered it in, without explaining how it works. I logged on my credit card online banking to discover I had a \"pending\" charge of $300 from the hotel!!!! I called the front desk immediately and they acted like I was bothering them for asking about it and said there was nothing they could do about it (but explaining it beforehand would have been helpful!!!!).", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Janey1UnitedKingdom", "ReviewID": "UR112366173", "Content": "I stayed here for a week in April with my best friend and our daughters aged 9 and 11. We had just spent a week in Newport Beach (Hyatt Regency - separate review) and came to what we thought was a centrally located hotel. We didnt pay a vast rate (Virgin holidays UK) so our expectations were not very high and it's a good job they were not. The hotel, I should say motel really, is located near a busy freeway and other cheap hotels/motels. If you choose to use public transport to get into downtown San DIego, should your timings be out it can take over an hour. A bus stops outside the front of the hotel which takes about 8 mins to the Old Town station where you can get on the trolley (tram) into San Diego - 7 stops to Seaport Village. The other alternative is walk the 10-15 mins to Fashion Valley Shoppng Mall where you can get the trolley to Old Town and change. All very tedious and time consuming. The buses only run every 30 mins and after 6 every hour and finish at 8. The staff at times did not know the timings and gave me incorrect information so it took my daughter and I 1 hour 15 mins to get into San Diego. We were very disappointed with the rooms. It had 2 double beds that just about fitted into the room and a tiny bathroom, and very little storage for clothes. There was no safe in the room and no conditioner in the bathroom. We had just spent a week quite easily in a room with the four of us. We couldn't here. We had to pay for an extra room for the week. The only plus was we had a terrace, most rooms did not. Car parking was included in my rate. The pool area was reasonable but lacked sun loungers. I think I counted about 20. If we wanted a drink we had to go to the inside bar to get them. We tried the continental breakfast as it was included in the rate. Little choice of croissants, yoghurt and cereal. You can ask for toast. No ham or cheese. Slow service. We did eat the first night in the bar and this was typical bar food - burgers, sandwiches, fish and chips which was ok. That night Daniel served us and he was the only member of staff who was really helpful. The hotel has a free shuttle bus you can book to go to the zoo or Seaworld in. We used it to the zoo but it only runs during the day so we left without having done the zoo justice. We took the car to Seaworld!! I needed to get somthing from a shop on the way back but the driver would not stop so my daughter and I had to walk the long way round to the shop which although is located just over the freeway, you can't cross it. The bar closed really early - 9.30pm one night so after arriving back at 9.45pm on the Monday and wishing a night cap we couldn't have one. A bar that closes so early in an establishment that calls itself a hotel and resort is ridiculous. Towards the weekend it seemed to stay open longer - 10.30 ish but often no barman was present and 1 night I waited 10 mins until someone could be located to serve me!! We all loved California and can't wait to cross the pond to come back but I certainly won't be staying here again. It's too far out, has too much of a motel feel to it, small rooms that just about accommodate 2 and services that are not available for enough hours in the day", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe Dream Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Traveling_Teacher_32", "ReviewID": "UR111201210", "Content": "Hello fellow travelers: My husband and I stayed at this hotel. It was in-between low-priced and a little pricey. It was the best hotel that we ever stayed at! The staff was wonderful. The free breakfast was delicious. The room, pool, and spa were delightful. The plants were also lovely. All the positive adjectives can be used to describe this hotel. On the last day, I lost my glasses by the spa. The staff, my husband, and I searched for it. Mr. Rick, the kindest pool cleaner, found them, and returned them to me. He jokingly told me that some guests had left behind items such as ipods. PS, this is the only hotel that I have been to that offers guests free tooth brushes. San Diego was great to visit. Imperial Beach looked like it was made of diamonds, and the ocean was made of pearls and sapphires. Some people took their dogs out for walks. The air was between warm, cool, and chilly. There were flowers and trees that I had never seen before. Balboa Park had stunning and artistic buildings to view. The Museum of Man, although it was small and had a few exhibits, contained evidence of the existence of Nefertiti and her family. The Zoo had many creatures, some familiar, some unfamiliar. It had an adoreable black puma or panther that talked a lot. The Cheese Factory and Bchans had tasty food. But, my husband and I never got to eat at these places. These restaurants were packed with people who were dressed like if they were going to a ritsy nightclub. Some people camped out in front of the restaurants. Joes Crab Shack, Chipotles, and Dave/Busters treated us better, had better food, didn't make us wait all day, etc. Most people were nice. There were a few rude ones. At the Cheese Factory, a kid kicked me, and his mother didn't correct him for it. On the roads, a few road hogs cut us off. At a burger joint at Balboa Park, the staff cooked me a tasty cheeseburger, but mostly ignored me, and a few other customers. Every city will contain its good and and bad aspects. Nevertheless, San Diego was awesome. I still dream, hear, and read about it. TripAdvisor assisted us greatly with planning this trip.

We chose this hotel based mainly on the reviews on trip advisor. I'd have to say that overall the hotel was disappointing. This hotel is spread over a large area of land with all of restaurants, bars etc located near reception. Our room was literally as far away from all of this as possible which would not have been a problem but when staying for 5 nights it would have been nice to be closer to the facilities for meals, drinks etc. On check in we were surprised to be given vouchers for a buffet continental breakfast which turned out to be disappointing, only offering stale croissants and a sparse selection of fruit, not even toast. On one occasion we forgot our vouchers and the women at the restaurant advised us we would need them for breakfast, again not a problem usually but to get back to the room and get them would be a good 5 minute round trip, not ideal when pressed for time She could surely have checked the computer system to check we were guests. We skipped breakfast that morning and ordered a cooked breakfast the next. The hotel offered a free shuttle to local attractions, beware they do not go to the Safari Park, you will need to seek alternate arrangments to get there. We booked this with Grayline who told us the wrong pick up time and left us out in the rain waiting for a pick up that arrived an hour earlier. The room was a comfortable size, the bathroom is a bit on the small side. The location of the hotel is out of walking distance from the Gaslamp area of town so unless you have a car you will need to cab or bus to get to a great selection of restaurants. Due to this we ate in the restaurant a few nights, the meals ok value but limited selection compared with other restaurants around. We could rate highly enough the service of Michael at the concierge desk, he went out of his way to assist and was extremely helpful.

We stayed at the Handlery Hote for 7 days. I have to say, the Handlery and its staff really made my first trip to the US that perfect. We loved San Diego, such a beautiful city, Thank you guys! We chose this hotel for it's promotion. The price was unbeatable. I knlew it was an old family hotel so I thought it would be dark or smelly, but when we got there, I was surprised by how clean it is. It is recently renovated. I loved the carpet and that fresh scent. I'm a light sleeper so I requested a quiet room, we got one at the end of the hall far away from the Highway side, with a balcony too. Very quiet, good nights of sleep gave us the energy for long walkings at daytime. And just like all the other comments, the bed was really that comfortable!! I'm very picky about beds but I miss the Handlery bed now! When we get up in the morning, have our breakfast, the Hotel has a shuttle to drive us to the Zoo, Seaworld, Old Town, Fashion Valley and etc. It saved me a lot of money for taxi. I really have to mention the shuttle driver Jeff, he was the nicest guy there and gave us so much help. We went to all the restaurants that he recommanded and we loved them all! One afternoon when we came back, we even received a little gift of treats from Jeff and the front desk staff, how sweet!! (The next day was my birthday so it made me so happy :D) I saw that some people were complaining about there is nothing on Hotel circle except hotels, but you can always walk to Fashion Valley, it's a big mall. We took public transportation everyday, it is very easy. Usually we go out in the morning with the shuttle and take either 120 back from Downtown or the Trolley. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, specially the Concierge, sorry I forgot his name but he helped us with our trips a lot! The pool was so nice, and the Hottub. After a long day of walking in the Zoo and parks, it feels so great to relax in a huge outdoor hottub. I went to Cancun last year and we stayed in a Luxury 4.5 star hotel, but quite honestly, the staying at Handlery is actually happier than that one. I liked the warm \"family\" feeling it gives me. Everyday when we take the bus back to the hotel, I feel like I'm going home :) For those who were complaining about there is too little choices in breakfast, maybe they didn't know they can order Toast, Cereal or Oakmeal from the kitchen, it is included. No one told us that until the 4th day of our staying, lol. There is one Mexican looking waiter, he was very nice and helpful. The other waiter, however, looked at me as if I was stealing when I ordered one more toast in the morning :S. We didn't have a car but the parking seems very convenient, having a car for this city is a wise choice. Wifi was not bad, last time we stayed at Cancun, my bf lost his wallet in the hotel :(. So this time I was kind of worried about bringing my laptop. End up I worried too much, lol, the room service ladies are very nice and professional. Everyday when we get back, everything is cleaned and new shampoo lotions are stocked. Thank you ladies~ I wrote so much, but trust me, you can stay at this place and enjoy your vacation with such a low price. I travel around all the time and I will go back to Handlery Hotel.

When I read the reviews about the hotel on this site I was truly expecting a TINY room. I thought for sure we would have to get another room. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the room and found it to be quite large. We had 6 (large) suitcases, and 3 carry-ons and still had plenty of room. We even had a roll away bed in there. When I walked down the hall to get ice I looked into a room that the housekeepers were cleaning and it was TINY. We obviously lucked out and got one of the bigger sized rooms. There is no way all 5 of us would have fit into the tiny room that I looked at. Having seen that, I understood where people were coming from that said this hotel was too small for them on this website. Cons: The beds are definitely doubles as the website states. They are not queens. My husband and I are used to sleeping in a king at home, so we really didn't sleep all that comfortably. Also, the beds are not the best I have slept in, but I have slept in much much worse. They won't give you a roll away bed unless you are sleeping in a room with a king size bed. We asked the front desk for one and the housekeepers and both said no. We broke the rules and found a clean one and put it in our room so no one had to sleep on the floor. They do offer cribs for babies, but we had a 2 year old with us. There is no way he was fitting in a crib. I would imagine that if we were staying in one of the tiny rooms the cot would not have fit anyway....so again, we lucked out with the room. The whole breakfast scene was weird. The waiter we had was rude and not helpful whatsoever.The restaurant was not even busy. It was a weekday and there were 4 other people in there with us. When we sat down he didn't even come to our table for the first 5 minutes we were there. Then he came and asked what we wanted to drink. Someone else brought us out our drinks and after that no one came by again. They all stayed in the back by the kitchen. We had the continental breakfast cards and had no idea how to use them. We literally sat there for 10 min until I finally got up and asked the hostess what we were supposed to do. She was nice and told us where the \"buffet\" was. It is quite far from the table and behind a wall, which is odd. I'm still not really sure what comes with your breakfast. They do not offer you toast, or a bagel or cereal (which apparently comes with your meal) you have to ask. So half of the breakfast is buffet style, the other half you have to ask your waiter for. The fresh fruit was nice, but the pastries were mediocre at best. The wait staff (especially the male the helped us, Jose maybe?) could use a course on customer service and more training. They need more ice machines. The closest ice machine was on the other end of the long hall, and down the stairs. There is no fan in the bathroom. It stayed humid in there for hours after we all got done showering. The water pressure was terrible. But expected since it was built in the 1950's. No elevators. As I said we had 6 bags, plus a child and carry-ons so it would have been helpful to have an elevator. The business center is where the internet is. It is NOT free, and it was quite expensive. We did not check in online for our flight because of this. We figured it would cost us at least $9 to print off our tickets. Not worth it. This should be a free amenity. Pros: Our room was at the end of the hall way so we only had one neighbor. It was pretty quiet. We did not hear traffic like past guests have said on the site. Luckily our window was facing the pool, not the road. The walls are very thin and I can see how annoying it would be to have neighbors on both sides of you while hearing traffic outside the window. The Bellhop was very helpful and knowledgeable. He gave us addresses and directions to places that we wanted to go. Also, when we checked out we still had 7 hours before our flight so he took our baggage and held it there for us until we came and got it. Worked out very well for us. The front desk staff was nice and helpful as well. The pool was very nice and clean. I have noticed that sometimes when hotels post pictures of their facilities on the internet, they look nothing like the pictures when you actually show up. This is not the case for the handlery. The pool area was very nice and well kept. The rooms were clean. I'm weird about germs and carpets, but I did not have a problem here. Very clean. The staff around the facility (housekeepers, security, etc) were friendly and always said hi when we walked by. The housekeepers were more than willing to give us towels or whatever we needed. Overall it was a very good experience. I would go back again, but only if I got the same room. I cannot imagine cramming 5 people into one of those small rooms. Unbearable. We went through bookit.com and got a good rate. $78/night. Remember that you are not staying at the Ritz. If you want something extraordinary and elegant, this is not your spot.

He was most disrespectful, particularly to my disabled daughter. Thankfully, another person working in the restaurant (manager?) politely attended to her. The way the \"complimentary breakfast coupons\" are handled could be more polite. When the waiter rudely asks, \"Do you have coupons?\" before they even greet you politely, there is a problem.

We chose this hotel because of the overall good reviews left here on tripadvisor and because of a good offer from the hotel itself. There was a few things that would have made this a great trip from the start rather than later. First of all the rooms are VERY small (we were told all rooms are the same size, unless you get a suite). If you are just a couple you will be just fine. However if you like us travel with children you will probably go crazy sharing this tiny room with double beds (not queens) and an itzy-bitzy bathroom. There is no sink outside the bathroom, very very little counterspace in the bathroom, so four people sharing this will be a challenge. Also there is no extra space in the room whatsoever. We talked to the front desk and they found connecting rooms for us the next day (at an extremely reasonable price), so we were all happy with this arrangement for the rest of the trip (5 nights total). Another huge issue with me was the balcony. When I order a room with a balcony I tend to expect to at least have something nice to look out on. The first room we got there was NOTHING. A piece of grass underneath us the size of a skinny sidewalk, no view at all. Also the balcony wall is so high, that once you sit in the chairs you just stare into that wall. When we were moved to the connecting rooms we were also moved to the rooms with balcony toward the pool area, which really is a nice area. But unless you can get a room around the pool, you might as well save the extra money it cost you to get a balcony. The original hotel package we bought included two free continal breakfast at the Postcard restaurant in the hotel. We are not big breakfast eaters so this was no problem for us, but be aware that it is literally one cup of juice (the size of a kids juicebox) and a cereal bowl the size of a teacup. If you ask for more you are told that is all that is included (you can also have a bagel or a piece of toast). Ordering off the menu is extremely expensive (a bowl of oatmeal is $9) and service is extremely slow (took us 15 minutes to get utensils the first morning). So most mornings we simply ate breakfast on our way to the park we were visiting for the day. The Handlery hotel is located on Hotel Circle a very fitting name because there is nothing but hotels there. This means there will be no walking to a neighborhood restaurant or fast food in the area, you will need a car. Now to the good stuff. Front desk the niecest people I have ever met in the industry. They quickly found a solution for us, that we were happy with and we truly had a great stay there after the initial hickup. The beds are wonderful. I would trade it for my own at home and I don't say that lightly. Great pool area with big heated pool that we enjoyed every day. We got a great deal that included free parking and internet (and breakfast for two of us - although that was nothing to write home about). Would we choose it again.... Yes, would we recommend it to friends.... Yes, but get two rooms if you travel with kids, make sure you have a rental car, skip the restaurant at the hotel, and bring you own shampoo and showergel :)", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cDecent older hotel\u201d", "Author": "atraveller57", "ReviewID": "UR101308579", "Content": "I was comfortable in this hotel.

It is fantastic! We even called and asked to be picked up early one day and the shuttle was there in about 10 minutes. The shuttle driver is a very nice man. The hotel area is great, only a short walk to a mall and a train. We spent one day riding the train to different areas: seaport village, gaslamp district, and it cost $5 for an all day ticket. The train was very easy and convenient to use. The front desk gave us a map of the train routes. I had read some bad reviews about the free breakfast, but we loved it. The breakfast ticket cards make it seem like you can only pick one item on the card but this is not true. We had delicious fruit every morning, strawberries, and melons. There was yogurt and muffins and you could ask for toast, bagels, english muffins, cereal, and oatmeal. They left a pitcher of coffee on the table for you to help yourself and it was very good coffee. We always looked forward to breakfast. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly, I felt like every time I passed anyone I was greeted with a smile. The people at the front desk helped us out multiple times. Our room was always very clean. The maintenence man helped us one day with our balcony door. He was there in about 5 minutes and fixed the problem very quickly. Very nice man. We had a balcony in our room, which I highly recomend. It does not cost much more and it is so nice to have fresh air and a nice place to sit. The hotel restuarant was a little pricey for us (i'm sure it compares with surrounding area prices) so we ate elsewhere. I highly recomend the spaghetti factory in the gaslamp district, really good food and prices! We did have the restuarant pizza one night and it was delicious! I was surprised when we checked out that we had a water fee. I just didn't realize that it cost something, if it had a little tag on it with a price I would have known. I was pleasently surprised with how quiet it was at night. I normally am awoken a lot when I stay somewhere, but it was very quiet here.

She proceeded to inform me that she considers a quiet room to be a room with quiet neighbors and there was no way for her to know what kind of neighbors I would have. Huh? I've traveled all over the world and as a light sleeper I usually ask for a quiet room on the top floor. Hardly ever is that a problem.

Yet when I got to the room, it was on the BOTTOM floor across from an ice machine and next to an exterior door that banged every time it closed. Since I was late for a meeting and there didn't seem to be many other people around (it's a large hotel), I decided maybe noise wouldn't be a factor. Was I ever wrong! People were getting ice at all hours (clearly filling coolers) and the door was banging at all hours.

So soft and comfortable. And I am one of those picky, hard to sleep anywhere other than home people. Only needed one pillow and was not lumpy, held it fullness all night. Mattress was PERFECT, down comforter, SO COMFY! And the blackout curtain...REALLY did black all out! This might sound minor but what a difference it made dragging two toddlers sightseeing for 3 days, to have a WONDERFUL nights sleep and to sleep in a bit AND they napped because room was dark, no sore back, shoulders etc.. that I usually get from low/moderate priced accomodations. (slept better than at home I think LOL!) This was a 10 day trip for us (cruise too) with husband and two toddlers (18 months and almost 3yr). So we had a TON of baggage/gear. Big enough rooms for all of our crap, a AND a crib AND for kids to play around without us stepping on each other. AND way clean enough to let kids sit on carpet and play (and I am one of those that does not walk barefoot in hotels but here, I did not have a problem letting kids play on the floor) And a note about the crib...not only do they provide cribs (not all do) but they have the \"pack and play\" cribs vs. the metal cribs with slats, which is AWESOME for a few reasons...First, I did not have to bring mine from home and pay extra luggage fee on the plane to and from. Next, you can easily fold it up when not in use for more room. And last but most important, they have soft mesh sides, every other place I have stayed have those small metal cribs with slats, which work and are fine...but these are better (especially for bigger/older babies and those who use binkies)..the small metal ones do not have \"bumpers\" so my son was always waking up either because hitting head on metal frame or foot caught in slat or binkie fell out to the floor. The mesh \"pack and plays\" have more \"give\" and are soft and no openings for hand/feet/binkie. Again, all things that may not matter to most...but was a super great perk for us. And not to ramble...but just a couple more things...Location was PERFECT...and with a 18 month who HATES car rides and knowing that sometimes 5 miles in CA traffic can take FOREVER, it is close to EVERYTHING from major sight seeing attractions (Zoo, Seaworld etc..) to stores & mall (from SuperTarget to upscale) close to restaurants Denny's, McDonald, In & Out, Bennigans, to upscale restaurants. Even one on site. The parking costs $12 but kind of cool for people who fly in rather than having that built in to price of the room. (and with the free shuttle service they provide, you do not have to rent a car) And for those of use who did have a car...room WITH parking was still close to the same price as many nearby motel/lower end hotels and worth the piece of mind that car is safe and secure. I have stayed places with a bit more selection with \"free continential breakfast\" (waffles, multiple, \"all you can eat\" selections, etc...) but minor issue and what is offered is just fine for kids or something fast to tide you over. I guess the only things that weren't PERFECT was: Would have been cool to have a microwave too, (there is a fridge and coffee and hairdryer). There was NOT free wi-fi (internet) in the room (which seems everyone, even super cheap motels usually have, don't they??) and cable TV selection way limited...NO PBS, Disney, Nick, etc... for kids favorite shows...just Cartoon Network (nothing of nutritional value there!)

Located just 1/2 mile from the Fashion Mall - which is huge and has an array of stores not commonly found in smaller cities - and also 1/2 mile from Riverwalk Golf Club, which has reasonable rates and 27 holes of good golfing experience. We had poor service at the in-house restaurant for breakfast two mornings in a row and told the Front Desk about the problem. Their response was so quick, professional, and comprehensive that I am booking another stay at the hotel with my spouse next month. The continental breakfast was included in the hotel package, and had a menu price of about $5, so it wasn't that big of a financial deal, but the Desk and the entire staff treated our disappointment like a personal failure. They immediately altered our bill, although we neither asked for this or expected it. They comped us to dinner so that we could, in their words, \"experience the proper dining experience they expect every guest to enjoy.\" The manager came to our table at dinner to check on us, and he was also in the lobby the next morning at checkout to greet us and other guests who were leaving. From this you might conclude that we made a big issue of the breakfast and caused some type of scene and became notorious to the entire staff. Not true. We very quietly explained that their was a shortcoming in one area of out stay, and the remaining experience had been exceptional. Their response was that every guest should have an exceptional experience in every aspect of their stay at the hotel. Wow. They deserve some credit, and some loyalty. I have found my hotel for every trip to San Diego. Finally, their location could not be better. Access by freeway and by surface streets to anywhere you may want to go is perfect. We drove to Coronado twice, and both trips were done in 15 minutes. The Zoo (with which the hotel has a free round-trip shuttle service) is ten minutes away. The only area I gave less than \"5\" to was the rooms. They were fine, but a little crowded, with the bathroom being noticeably small. Cleanliness and quality were fine. The fitness center has about four cardio machines - ellipticals or treadmills- and one bench with a rack of 8-10 dumbbells. It is a very tiny room.

We were initially a bit confused about the room we'd booked . The clerk at the front desk did her best to accommodate us & offered to book us an upgraded room but we decided to stay in our original room instead. Every staff member we encountered during our stay greeted us with a genuine smile & was very friendly. The hotel grounds were clean and nicely kept. The pool is heated but we opted to take advantage of the spa tub on our last night there which helped us out relaxing after a very long couple of days. We stayed in one of the superior king rooms in the last building of the hotel. I liked the fact that in order to get in to the building itself you have to use your room key, the downside to that is that the key slot seemed to be faulty in our building so it took a couple tries to get it to open. The room itself was a decent size. What we liked most about it was how amazingly comfortable the bed was. They could use a microwave in the room and maybe a bigger bathroom as it was difficult to have two people getting ready in the tiny bathroom. We stayed for a total of 6 days and the bath products they provided were gone by day 2 but we asked for more and they had someone bring it up while we were out & on that same occasion they took care of a bug we found on the bed side table and reattached the knob in the shower which came out while we bathed. We didn't come across much of the hwy noise that was mentioned in other reviews which was good. The menu at the hotel's restaurant was a bit overpriced so we only ate in once. We ate at the hotel lounge on Monday night as they run a special for Monday Night Football for $5 burgers. The plate comes with french fries but cheese on the burger is an extra $1.50 so make sure to ask for cheese if you want it added. The burgers are a good deal if you find yourself there for MNF. I cannot stress enough how important the location of this hotel was. Its about a 10min walk to Fashion Valley Mall. You can jump on the trolley/bus from there & go just about anywhere in San Diego.

We're so glad we found this hotel and would definitely stay there again on future San Diego trips. Having had a terrible experience at the Town & Country (admittedly quite a few years ago, perhaps it has improved since then), we were searching for an alternative nearby. While perusing google maps, we discovered an icon for the Handlery just a block away from the T&C. Based on the Handlery's website - and tripadvisor reviews of course as well - we decided to take give them a try. Wow, are we glad we did! They have some of the nicest housekeeping staff we've ever encountered and the room was always spotless when we returned in the evening. The front desk staff were super-efficient at check-in (much appreciated after a long and tiring trip due to airline delays) as well as helpful when it came to printing out boarding passes (they offered to do it for us). Our room, as requested, was on an upper floor, far from the pool and road, comfortable and quiet. It was very handy to have the mini-fridge in the room to keep some sodas and snacks chilled; the large closet was nice. The bathroom isn't huge but it's sufficient. The only two minor comments we have: it would be useful if there were a handtowel holder somewhere in the bathroom as well as a makeup (magnifying) mirror. The landscaping around the property is just beautiful and impeccably maintained, with lovely flowers and plants situated in all sorts of corners. The hotel's location was perfect for us: an easy walk to the Town & Country Conventon Center as well as Fashion Valley Mall (googlemaps indicates it's about 0.5 mile). There's a transit center at the mall as well, with both busses and the trolley. As we did not rent a car, we used the public transportation quite a bit to see some of the San Diego highlights (Hillcrest neighborhood, Balboa Park, Harbor Drive, Little Italy, Gaslamp, Downtown San Diego). A general San Diego travel tip: we discovered that there's a Water Taxi service which will come to pick you up where ever you are along the harbor. You just give them a call to let them know where to pick you up. We took it from near the Seaport Village over to the Hotel del Coronado, then walked back through Coronado to the Ferry Landing to catch the ferry back to San Diego.

(Don't rush away from San Diego folks!. This place is GREAT!) The staff were very all helpful and pleasant. To illustrate we decided not to hire a car. We used the hotel's courtesy bus/public transport. Jeff the driver is a great guy & he dropped & picked us up from local attractions. He helped make our holiday so enjoyable & has a few recommendations for restauants etc (Jeff - thanks for the \"Little Piggies\"restaurant recommendaiton on Coronado Island - we seriously pigged out!!) (Ryan's also a great & helpful guy who drives when Jeff's off). We'd also like to thank, one of the hotel's managers, Sandra. After returning from a fishing trip I'd hoped to have my catch cooked but understandably food hygiene rules did not allow the chef to do this. Sandra organised a cook out pack for us with tin foil, olive oil, lemon etc - how thoughful & such a nice touch!! We had a great cook out at Mission beach!! With regard ot the room this was very clean & comfortable - lovely bed! We hardly spent any time in the room! You'll find the facilities are very good. The pool was very well kept & I reckon this is the sign of quality hotel (poolside rest rooms were also very clean - as were the others we used). Poolside entertainment was fun & the bar there was a gathering point for all visitors. I used the gym which was small but had good equipment! The shop sells breakfast stuff, rolls, salads drinks etc. In addition Jeff suggested we visit the on site ticket agency who booked us great seats at the Padres base ball. The hotel is well located for all of San Diego's best attractions. We ate a lot at Fashion Valley (including breakfast). Hotel was a little pricey on food & not unusually for the US I guess we ate out all the time. You can hire a car at Enterprise in the hotel. We used the trolley bus & the buses to get around so with the hotel drop offs we didn't need one.

I booked this hotel through Bookit.com back in June based on the reviews on this website. I got a deal that I was able to lower by looking at the prices again before I left. Althought I got it cheaper, it still wasn't worth the $120/night. If you travel to Vegas, staying here is like staying at Imperial Palace, it will do if you can get it for $80-$90/night. But even with the free wifi, the $12/day to park is just ridiculous. If it was 1/2 full (Mon-Thurs) stay, I would be shocked. Pluses: Great pool although we only had 1 morning to swim. The grounds including the pool were very clean. Our room, although small, was clean in the sleeping area. The staff was very accomodating and easy to contact. The location for Sea World and San Diego can't be beat. Negatives: The room is SMALL. If you have more than 3 travelling, it is cramped. The bathroom is even smaller. Although it looks like the hotel room was redone, the bathroom needed more work as the tub was old and the grouting was moldy near the bottom. Plus, the shower didn't drain. As for the walls, paper thin. I had a room with a door and I could hear everything in the next room. I will say that they did check us in early and were willing to move us from the front of the hotel that faced the road. Even then, if there is another person staying next door, you will think they are in the room talking. Add $12 to your price if you are renting a car.

Check in was easy and no problem even though i think $12/day for parking at a hotel outside of a downtown area is ridiculous. Our room was small but clean and appeared updated. The double beds were tiny but comfortable. There was a flat screen TV which i think should be standard now in any updated hotel. The bathroom was small and the water pressure was awful. Our Room 153 overlooked the pool but had no balcony which i thought was misleading from the pictures on the hotel website. It looked like our room was the one of the very few overlooking the pool without a balcony. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning. The property itself was clean but laid out like a big motel. The exterior hallways were this drab brown colour that made it look institutional. The pool area was nice and our daughter enjoyed it. The location of this hotel was very central with easy access to the freeway and the tourist attractions (SeaWorld, Zoo, beaches, etc.) One thing that really bothered us was the housekeeping service or lack thereof. On 3 different days our room was not cleaned. We left each day at around 7am and came back around 1pm so our daughter could take a 2 hr nap after which we left again until 7 or 8pm. The first time we called the front desk but it rang and rang and nobody answered. The second time the person we spoke with at the front desk (?Jose) kept talking about how the hotel was full. Im sorry but thats no excuse. Are we supposed to expect a lower level of service because the hotel was full? No. The third time I went down to the front desk and spoke with Sarah who was apologetic but didnt really seem to eager to compensate us. After repeating several times how upset we were to come back at 8pm to an uncleaned room 3 times she finally offered to waive our parking fees for our stay. I figured this was better than nothing but we were still disappointed. Overall we werent impressed with this place. Its not terrible if you are on a budget and can get it for well under $100/night.

Complained but got a blank look from staff. Shuttle bus service was good if you could get a seat. Tried twice but missed out. Food overpriced in restaurant. In my opinion it is a 3 star hotel trying to pretend to be a 5 star and missing out badly. Would not recommend and feel completely ripped off.

On Saturday evening they set up a large movie screen by the pool and showed the movie \"Scooby Doo\". Several families were down at the pool sitting in lounge chairs enjoying the movie. It was kinda neat. The only thing is, is that if your room overlooked the pool, you could hear the movie with the sliding door open. But it was shown early enough in the evening that it wasn't an annoyance. The hotel circle area has many mid-range hotels to choose from and this one is pretty good size and probably my favorite right now.

It was a bit rushed since we wanted to explore Seaworld more, but overall the free ride was worth it (otherwise would have costed about $15-$20 in taxis) - Very close to the Fashion Valley mall - the hotel is about a 10 minute walk. My bf and I walked there twice to grab dinner at the Cheesecake cafe and then go shopping. Great stores and fairly upscale - Nieman Marcus, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, JCPenney, Macy's, Abercrombie etc. (stuff us Canadians do not have in our malls) - The room was clean, towels were clean and the room had all the amenities we needed (fridge, hairdryer - however, they do not provide an iron) - we got a pool view and it was fairly quiet. Do not get a room by the highway. - Buy bottled water in the little souvenir shop in the main floor. This is better priced that buying water outside. - Pool is very clean. The towels were replaced daily and the surrounding is kept organized. - Location is good. The surrounding area is very safe for first time travellers to San Diego. Options for getting around also include taking the bus (which is $5 for all day pass). The bus stop is right in front of the hotel. - Take advantage of the discounted SeaWorld/Zoo tickets at the hotel - Complementary Safe - it was good that the access was through front reception. Cons: - The breakfast was overpriced. There isn't anywhere else to grab breakfast aruond the hotel so we had to eat at the Postcards for $14 each per dish and it was good, however too expensive. They usually had the buffet breakfast but on the day we were there, for some reason, they did not offer it. A bowl of cereal was like $6 or something! - We booked a King room in advance. When we got there, they could not find a King room which was one of our specific requests. Instead they offered two double beds which was fine but still we had to adjust to it. - Lots of activity around the main floor. While we were there, there was a prom and wedding and numerous conventions everyday.

The Handlery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complimentary shuttle to area attractions was GREAT, saved us the parking $ when going to the zoo, and provided a good little overview of the city from the driver. It was very nice to have a shuttle that left on time from the hotel and picked us up at EXACTLY the time they said. We have found this to be a seldom occurrence with other free shuttles. Our first night we had dinner at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Postcards restaurant and were pleasantly surprised by the sophistication and elegance of the menu options! The salads were wonderful, and our steak was top-notch. Good atmosphere and d\u00c3\u00a9cor as well. Also had breakfast at Postcards one morning and were just as satisfied! The Handlery Hotel was overall a great value and a great stay, and the best part was its location. Close to the Zoo, the Cruise Ships and Whale Watching Harbor, Gas Lamp District, even the suburbs!

But I digress. As for the Handlery itself? Overall, this is a nice enough place to stay. The reception, bar and restaurant are all well decorated and welcoming. And the food at the restaurant is excellent - we dined there twice in our four evening stay and have nothing but praise for the standard of food. The corridors to the rooms and the rooms themselves could do with a lick of paint to brighten them up - but that said, we found the bed comfortable enough and the facilities were good (no room safe though - something of an oversight). The pool area is excellent - one of the best we've enjoyed. The sunbeds were better than the ones at the MGM and I think the pool was better as well... and the hot tub really is hot! I would ask the management to ensure that the key-pass activated doors at the bottom of the stairs genuinely lock - coming back to our room. we were less than pleased to see that a pizza company had free rein to wander the corridors, slipping advertisements under the door. Other than that? A nice touch is the hotel shuttle - we took this to the Zoo and were also picked up at the end of our time there. The staff were all friendly and helpful - special praise to Manny, who, if he didn't know something, made sure he found out for you. It would have been good if a proper map of the trolley routes was available in reception, the one there was very much a 'tourist one' and had to be read in conjunction with other maps to make sense of it. Overall opinion of the Handlery? It is a nice enough place to stay - but they do need to make people more aware of the local transportation options (this is a hotel very much geared up towards the driver).

We also went to Carlsbad and that was no more than 30 minutes. They have a great pool and a lot of services. We did room service and it was not outrageously priced. They have a spa and hair salon, I did not use either but I thought it was good to know that they were available. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was especially impressed by the Concierge Jimmy, I don't normally ask for more than a restaurant rec,s and directions, but he was a wealth of information and very easy to talk to! The other staff standout was Lindel she worked in the restaurant and her efficient and pleasant demeanor was definitely a treat! There were a couple of things I did not like about the hotel; one was the $10 a day parking fee, it seemed a bit silly since parking did not seem limited like some of the downtown hotels. The other was that there was not a courtesy PC for printing boarding passes or directions, there was a PC but it was $.40 a minute, with a 10 minute minimum. Since I got such a good price for the hotel I am not complaining, but I did kind of feel like they could be nickel and diming you on some of the charges.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cDirty and Horrible\u201d", "Author": "mkanski", "ReviewID": "UR7381596", "Content": "I live in San Diego and had believed this to be a nice place to stay from driving by.

It certainly isn't the fanciest of places, but as we were just looking for somewhere clean and comfortable to rest our heads every night, it worked fine. At check in, we were offered a room either in the third or fourth block; we chose the fourth because that room had a balcony, and we were pleased with the choice. The view from the balcony wasn't fantastic (it looked out over the swimming pool of the hotel from next door!), but it's a nice place to sit and relax, and the hotel is compact enough that the walk from the end block to the lobby only takes a minute. We were actually quite surprised at how nice the room was; it was basic, but decent-sized with really pretty decor and probably the nicest bathroom of the six hotels we stayed in during our trip to the States. As for the location of the hotel-we didn't have a car, but it's only a ten minute walk to Fashion Valley Mall (via a well-lit road, past a golf course and convention centre, which we had no problems walking down late at night) where you can get the San Diego Trolley. You do have to change trains at Old Town to get into Downtown, but the journey generally only takes around fifteen minutes. Fashion Valley Mall was also a really great place to spend our evenings, with a big cinema, and plenty of restaurants and shops to keep us occupied. The hotel shuttle is really handy, getting us to the park in time for opening, and then picking us up promptly at closing time, though it is quite small, so I would recommend booking your seats at check in. My one real complaint about the hotel would be the tour desk; on check in, we mentioned that we were interested in doing a trip to Tijuana, and we were told about a tour where we would be given a tour of the city and then dropped off for two hours shopping before returning to the hotel at about 2pm. We only wanted a half-day trip, as we were planning on spending the afternoon at Coronardo, and this sounded good, so we booked it. However, on the day of the tour, about halfway to Tijuana, we were told that it was a day long trip, and we wouldn't be returning to the hotel until 5pm. This really irritated us, as there is simply not enough to do in Tijuana to spend a whole day there, and we felt like an afternoon of our time in San Diego had been wasted. So if you book a tour, make sure you find out exactly what you're getting! We also didn't think too much of the restaurant-we ate there once for breakfast, and thought it was a bit too expensive (the food was really quite bland), with slightly rude and inattentive staff. It really didn't have the same feeling as the rest of the hotel, where the staff made an effort to create a very friendly atmosphere. If we were to return to San Diego on a similar budget, we would definately consider staying in the Handlery again; it may not have been the best hotel we've ever stayed in, but in general we had no problems, and we would certainly have no complaints about a second stay.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tweed Valley, australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Aussie064", "ReviewID": "UR6061188", "Content": "If you are visiting Seaworld, then this hotel is ideal.

The hotel is a 1950's style motor court that looks like it was last updated in the mid 1970's. I made my reservation on the internet. When I checked in they couldn't find my reservation. They kind of winced when I told themI booked on the internet so they must have recuring problems with that system. I had a printed reservation confirmation so I gave that to clerk to assist. It didn't help. The young lady at the front desk told me that I made a mistake in booking the wrong date, was charged a no show and that was the reason why they couldn't find my reservation. But she said at that point everything was fine. I asked for the confirmation back the check for myself and as I suspected, I had booked the correct dates. I later checked with my credit card company to see if they had charged me with a no show and they had not so the front desk clerk had totally lied to my face to cover their mistake. So they put me in first floor room that had two double beds, which would have been fine except that I had reserved a king. So back over to the front desk I went. The clerk (different one this time) moved me to a different room with a king. We wake the next morning to find that the pipes had backed up into the sink in the bathroom and left a deposit of rust and god knows what else.

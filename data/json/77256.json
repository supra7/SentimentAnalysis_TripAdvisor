Priced reasonably for this area. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Seemed to have some trouble with the keycard not working (this happened twice - stayed there 3 days). The indoor garage is $8.00 per day which you would need as parking on the street is very difficult as most areas are permitted or metered. The continental breakfast was just OK, no waffle maker, no yogurt (although they had bananas and apples), no eggs of any sort, had oatmeal and bagels and danish and cereal and juice. I like Starbucks coffee and even though there was a Starbucks on the corner I didnt go there as the coffee was fine. Breakfast bar opened at 6:30 AM promptly. As I said my rates were very reasonable (used the Entertainment Book discount) and accordingly my room was small but sufficient for only myself. Had to unglog the refrigerator as it was quite noisy - also a microwave in room. I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room free of charge. The internet was a little slow but free. There was no suitcase rack in the room when I arrived but one was delivered promptly. I would recommend a room on the upper level rather than on the main level. My room led out to a courtyard in the back of the hotel with a gate perhaps four feet high leading to the courtyard (no access to the courtyard). The courtyard was protected with barbed wire but I didn't feel comfortable leaving the sliding door open during the night which was the only source of outdoor ventilation. The bathroom area was small but nice and shower was newly tiled. The desk personnel were friendly and helpful and allowed for a late check out on departure day. Didnt use the outdoor pool (was there in the second week of December, 2011) but ate a midnight snack from In/Out Burger (which is next door (had to try it as there are none of those on the east coast) - 24 hr IHOP is across the street as well as a 7/11 - saw an altercation while taking a walk with a security guard from 7/11 and someone who must have tried to help himself without paying for his items) in the pool area. The outdoor pool area was well kept and attractive. About 3 blocks east is on Sunset Blvd is a guitar center that has a walk of fame in front of the building with many famous bands and singers - worth the walk.

He came in and checked it, flushed the toilet ,did a bit of looking around found nothing and said that the room in the below the bath had flooded and it seemed the water was coming from our room. Well it must of been a busted pipe somewhere as he belted on it for the next couple of hours. I couldn't sleep due to this and of all nights we were getting up at 4am to go to the airport. Anyway the clock hit 2am and the next thing there were shots being fired in the in and out next door and I'm lying there thinking were all gonna die as this is the first time ever I have heard a real life non movie gun being fired, so I froze until I heard the police sirens then got up and looked out the window. If the police hadn't of been walking around the carpark with torches looking for bullet casings I would of thought I was dreaming as people were just walking around like nothing had happened. Turned out shots were fired into store but no one was hurt. The breakfast that was included was plentiful ( i'm not a big brekkie eater) toast, fruits, cereals, croissants, juices, coffee and tea. We would of liked a refrigerator in the room, but I found in most places we stayed in America they didn't have them in the room unless you paid something like $25.

She told me okay and that she would send someone to check it out. 15 minutes later a maintenance man showed up with spray deodorizer. He did not seem to care what caused the smell, and stated it must have been kids smoking marijuana in a non-smoking room. He then proceeded to start spraying everything with the deodorizer. I advised him that while I appreciated the deodorizer the room still stunk. I asked him if he would tell the clerk about the smell so I could see about another room. He said he would and left. I went up to the front a moment later to only here him talking trash about me in Spanish. Unfortunately for him, I speak some Spanish and was aware of what he was saying (very unprofessional). I asked the clerk who told me no more rooms were available, I stated absolutely none. She then huff and puffed checked the computer and gave us another room. Room #2: This room had a musty smell but was bearable compared to the other room. The carpet was damp feeling and rolled up in some areas. The sheets had stains on them. The bathroom was clean. The towels did not appear to be dirty and did not smell bad. Breakfast: Nothing special, but I did not expect it to be. cereal, fruit, and a few other things. The water spiket in there was nasty. Parking Garage: CHEAP for the LA area so you can not argue with that. They also let us park it there the third day all day after we checked out till our flight left later that night, so props to them for that. It is however, NOT as secure as you think. They have a gate for access which requires a room key to open. However, around the corner is a hallway that leads out to the front that is wide open, and has no security measures in place. Location: The location to all the touristy things is great, and the area is in a rather safe part of Hollywood. You can walk to many attractions. Many restaurants and nostalgic locations are not a long drive away. Within a block is an IHOP, Bar, Starbucks, and In & Out Burger.

Room was clean, and bathroom was a good size and modern. (Note: there was only a shower, no tub.) Beds were very comfortable. You do hear some noise, but honestly, it wasn't something that a little bit of cotton in your ears wouldn't cure. Room was on the small size for having 2 adults and 2 almost adults (young teenagers.)

Breakfast was typical fare of cereals, yogurts, fruit, etc. It was fine and kind of what you would expect for this type of hotel. The nice thing about the hotel is that if you walked out the front doors and turned left or right, and walked up three blocks, there is the walk of fame. Very convenient. Nice when you have teenagers who want to see lots of things. It is also next door to an In & Out burger joint and there are also several other eating places within a block or two (a Quizno's comes to mind also.) Our price was about $161 using a 5% off Entertainment book code. Parking was $8 a night underground. Then there was state and local tax of about 15%.

Parking ($8.00 per night) was provided in a secure underground garage, easy to navigate with a mid-size car. There was a mandatory safe/warranty charge of $1.00 per night plus tax.

There is a complimentary breakfast of cerial and fresh Bagels and Toast and Cereal and Fruit and of course Juice and Tea and Coffee; it was fresh and plentiful and most pleasant. Seating can be difficult at peak times but a short wait is no real problem The rooms are large enough and the Bed is extremely comfortable. It's location for Central LA for the Chinese Theate and Kodak Theatree couldn't be better really and local convenience shops and Dining makes it well located too. There is an ice dispenser [free] by the pool and also reasonably priced canned drinks machine and a snack dispenser -also reasonably priced. The price to stay is reasonable for LA. A Few Negatives you need to be aware of before you book [so you can make a proper value judgement]: If you are going to stay, a room to the back of the Hotel is better as Sunset Boulevard can and often is 'traffic noisy' at night. The room we had, on the top floor overlooking the pool, had an unpleasant smell to it -a bit 'old peoples home' smell, if that is not too politically incorrect. The shower was useles in terms of delivering Hot Water. We did complain and the Maintenance man attended swiftly but ran thre shower a while and said '..there you go...' -when I tested it with my hand I advised him it was no different, to which his response was '...let it run a while...'. You could run the shower for an hour and it would never get any warmer and it was nothing to do with peak demand -it was like that at all times BUT plenty hot water at the basin. As a water engineer, I can only assume they have Temperature limiters fitted to the showers for some obscure reason and they are set at 38 degrees to 40 degrees max and that is way too cool for a shower. This is assumed to be common to all rooms I guess. The walls are either stud or light block because there is no sound deadening between rooms so you hear the conversation next door [also the snooring] As this Hotel [rightly] does not allow smoking in it's room, smokers go out on the balcony and if they chat whilst out there and it is next to your room you WILL NOT SLEEP if this is late, although Reception do take swift action if you call them and ask them to have a quiet word. The pool is dirty in the base and on that basis, I personally would not use it. Finally if you ask reception to organise you a cab to the airport MAKE IT CLEAR you want a licenced Yellow Cab or they will order you what is losely described as limo service -a bit nicer than a cab but about $15 extra - worth knowing For me the Negatives out weighed the Positives and I would not recommend this Hotel to my friends BUT it is clean and convenient so you need to make your own vlaue judgment.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, but mediocre hotel\u201d", "Author": "HWZJH", "ReviewID": "UR83729384", "Content": "The location was awesome, one block away from many attractions, but the hotel was very basic.

Buyer BEWARE! For unforeseen reasons, I had to postpone a reservation with Days Inn and I provided them with 3 days notice to either change the date or cancel the reservation and they refused to do either, stating \"online bookings are non-cancellable\". I offered to change my reservation to a later date, and they refused. I also had a reservation in another town with Comfort Inn & Suites and they were very accommodating of my cancellation request. As was Southwest Airlines and Dollar Rent a Car. Those companies were fantastic, but NOT Days Inn. Why would anyone consider booking at a hotel chain who will not cancel & refund or even change a reservation with plenty of advance notice? They are in the travel industry for heaven's sake, where unforeseen delays or changes occur quite often. They had enough notice to rebook the room. It wasn't like we gave them last minute notice or used the room. What an insane customer service policy for a company which relies on future customer bookings, repeat business and customer word of mouth. Myself and my employees travel very frequently throughout the western US. I'm very easy going, and don't expect much from a hotel except a clean place to sleep. I don't complain about things, I run a business and I know problems happen, and a company can only do their best to make things right. But you don't shaft a potential customer because they couldn't make it to your door. If these clowns ran a restaurant, they'd be charging you for meals you didn't eat because you called and changed or canceled your dinner reservation. By grabbing a few dollars now, this company has permanently lost a potential repeat customer and any future dollars they could have earned off of me or my company. How stupid is that? Especially after I even gave them the option of holding my funds as a credit toward a future stay. I have already re-booked my trip, and I will definitely use Southwest Airlines, Comfort Inn & Suites and Dollar Rent a Car, but I guarantee I will never book or stay at another Days Inn. Ever. And I will make damn sure I comment to everyone I meet who is traveling or considering a trip to stay away from the Days Inn chain of hotels. By the way, Days Inn is part of the Wyndham chain (Ramada, Travelodge, Super 8, Howard Johnson) If they treat customers this crappy before you get in their door, imagine how poorly they treat you during your stay.

I got there and told her that i thouht we had to be out by 12 at the latest. She took a very judgemental tone and started saying she wanted us out right away. I said this wasnt possible and she started to say she would charge us. I told her about the staff member from the night before and she said she would sack him.

The hotel looked nice and was very clean; the staff friendly, helpful and efficient. The room with two double beds could have been a little bigger, but was ok.

I generally stay in 2 and 3 star hotels, so my expectations are not that high. But this has got to be the worst hotel I've ever been in. While the location can't be beat, I would recommend you stay somewhere a little further away for cheaper and use the money you've saved to pay for parking or taxis. You'll have a better experience, trust me. First of all, the place is aged and falling apart. The lobby and outside appear to be in order, but the room itself was ridiculous. Peeling and worn wallpaper, huge hole in the carpet, large holes where pictures have been moved/removed, discolored ceiling, and a terrible smell are what greeted me when I walked in the door. Then, while trying to use the shower, my husband nearly scalded himself because the temperature control takes a full 2 minutes to respond to any changes. Now, I'm a pretty intelligent person, but I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out how to use a shower. The drain in the shower was also slow and I was disgusted at what I had to stand in. The a/c originally appeared to not be working and when I brought this up to Juliana, a member of the front desk staff, she snottily asked me, \"Did you press the mode button?\" Like I worked for Carrier and automatically knew that was what you were supposed to do, especially since there were absolutely no instructions and the a/c in every other hotel in the world has an on/off button and temperature controls and that's all you need to know. This girl had someone come to my room to get the a/c to work, but it took him 10 minutes to figure it out. So if it takes a member of the staff 10 minutes to get it to work, why I should I be expected to do it at all? Then, when I brought up the matter of the shower temperature, she didn't actually address me but turned to the other girl at the desk and said, \"That shower works, right?\" I couldn't believe it...this girl actually just called me a liar. I replied that no, it wasn't, because I just told her it wasn't, and the matter regarding the shower was dropped and never taken care of. I brought my grievances up to a different front desk clerk the next morning and asked to speak to the manager, but apparently he doesn't feel it necessary to work on weekends, when hotels are the busiest. As a matter of fact, there wasn't a maintenance person working either which leads me to believe that the management at this hotel is amateurish at best. I have reported my experiences with Days Inn and have put a call in to the hotel manager but have not received a response as of this time.

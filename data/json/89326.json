If you're looking for a low cost stay in a convenient location in the city of Baltimore, and your willing to overlook the fact the hotel has probably seen better days, as I was, then you'll be fine here for a night or so. Pros: reasonable price good location convenient parking ($3) clean beds and bathrooms pleasant, helpful staff Cons: old property (some would say \"run down\") lots of stairs/ no elevator potential to be loud not for children The Biltmore is over a hundred years old and the floors and walls are no longer square. There is no elevator. The lobby is a flight up from the street and the rooms start above that. There are two flights of stairs for each floor, so the lowest room would be two flights up from the lobby, and the fourth floor, where I stayed with my teenage daughters, requires ascending (and descending) eight flights of stairs. Our room had two queen beds with a small sitting room and bathroom off of that. The beds and the bathroom were clean, which is the most important thing to me, while the rugs, furniture, curtains and such were somewhat shabby. There was a water stain on the bathroom ceiling, and there was also some peeling wallpaper and plaster in the bedroom which is one of the reasons I would not recommend this hotel for young children or toddlers. There was a cable outlet hanging from the wall by its wires down low as well, and the windows opened up with no kind of screens or safety devices to keeps little ones from falling out - so adults or older children only. Parking is located about a block away in a hospital garage and costs $3 with validation from the hotel. It is free on weekends if it is unattended. Although we worried about the possibility of late-night ambulances waking us up, that didn't happen. We could hear our neighbors talking in adjacent rooms, but everyone was quiet at night. The staff was friendly, and although they were willing to gives us directions multiple times, they didn't really include street names so bring your GPS. Some would say this hotel has \"Old World Charm\", others would call it \"run down\". We were fine for the one night we needed to stay in Baltimore while visiting colleges, and it met my budget.

I felt perfectly safe in the neighborhood and left my car 2 blocks away at the Maryland General Hospital ($9 total parking cost for a 3-day stay). The Mount Vernon neighborhood is filled with lovely old buildings and I felt quite safe as a woman walking alone. My room (211) was a delightful surprise. Yes, it was up 41 steps, but it had an enormous sitting room as well as a large bedroom. The furniture was a wonderfully eclectic mix of antiques from all periods and the bed was quite comfortable. Yes, it could use a face lift, but it was very clean and comfortable. The microwave, coffee maker and mini-refrigerator all worked perfectly. There were plenty of drawers and closet space to store a month's worth of stuff. There were also plenty of lights and electrical outlets. I liked the decor and the artwork. My favorite was the antique sewing machine in the corner. I loved the view of the church spire out the sitting room window. The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the silk flowers, which looked a bit tired and dusty. The woman at the front desk was helpful and friendly. The bathroom was in need of work. There had been water damage on the ceiling which was warped and discolored and the handle on the tub was loose. However, it was clean and how much time do you spend in the bathroom anyway?

Yes, this place is homely, but there are so many things to see and touch and has a museum-like quality. The lobby is an wonderful place to have coffee/tea and relax. Mr. Patel, the owner, was a joy to work with and very responsive to our needs. The bedroom suites were like real parlors and bedroom combinations. I found myself wanting to see each room out of curiosity as they were all decorated differently. If you can get the Biltmore Suite, Room 101, ask for it! The location is perfect and in close proximity to food, coffee shops, theaters, natural food stores, ethnic food places, bars, and museums. Hop on the Charm City Connector (free) and tour the city. Parking at the hotel is only available on the street and it can be hard to find a space at night since residents have priority, but if you find a space, stay in it and walk around. (Read the meters!) Look, if you are looking for a modern, sleek hotel (and one with an elevator), then avoid this hotel. You will look immediately to the cracks in the walls and the lived-in furniture.

It was an old beautiful building that I later found out was over a hundred years old and used to be a boarding house an a dormitory among other things. The staff was very helpful and kind. We booked a smoking room and were given a non-smoking, but were given a new room as soon as the clerk was informed of the mistake. Each room was unique and included a small kitchenette with a fridge and stove top. The rooms were old fashioned looking and had old fixtures in the bath but all was very clean. The section of town it was in was not as bad as I anticipated and we were directed to park in a parking garage about a half a block over. The clerk was extremely friendly and talked to us an answered questions for about an hour. He directed us two blocks over, which is really the heart of the city. I know that people usually want to do touristy things in the harbor, but the Biltmore is for those who like to explore the real Baltimore. There were lots of little local stores, art galleries and cool shops. There are no elevators in the Biltmore but that was not a discouragement for me at all. The building is unbelievable lovely. The rooms are nice and homey. It is a lot more like a bed and breakfast than a hotel. I really am hard pressed to believe the bad reviews on here. I absolutely adored the place.

All things considered we were successful on that point. We met with frineds at the Inner Harbor and called it a night with a night cap. Showered down in a bathroom with holes in the drywall, mildew stains embedded in the seamwork and bugs on the floormat. We really did not mind that three of the lamps inside the room were missing light bulbs, nor the fact that a chair in the room had a storage covering on it. We were only interested in having a place to lay our heads. After showering, which took a bit of time because the water pressure was low and coming out of the main spout, we bedded down but woke up later on with sever itching. I did not see the bugs on the spread or the covers, but did get a glance at a couple on the pillow casings. They had bitten us so bad that the whelts were half dollar sized for almost three days. The young man on duty contacted to GM/Owner who invited us to leave citing that- if we did so we would not be charged for our use of the room. We explained that we came on the bus and had nowhere to go, the young man then went further to try and put us into another room one flight above us, but with no elevator and our very tired souls; who had the energy. We were trapped, we slept in the chairs until daybreak with towels covering us because we did not trust the sheets or coverings. Needless to say, the next morning when the GM/Owner came in- he was quick to state that they have never had complaints of \"BED BUGS\", and also recinded the offer of \"No Charge\" and would only knock off $25.00 from the one night stay. We had to remind this guy and even showed him the whelts left on our backs. But he would only take half off the total price. We had to settle this quick and get back home before our scheduled departure. Otherwise we would have missed our bus because of the construction to the Lightrail. I wish someone could have pointed me in the right direction before I made this reservation, if the Owner of the Biltmore is reading this, the swelling on my back is beginning to subside and this is the third day (A**HOLE).

The area is considered a National Landmark Historic District and it shows. A lot of construction is happening in the area as many older buildings are being renovated, as well as the streets. This hotel however, is a little late in receiving it's make over. Our room included: - 1 king bed, night tables - TV - breakfast table and chairs - full bathroom with bathtub - second room with mini-kitchen, couch, access to bathroom - free parking LOCATION Close to Inner Harbor, Lexington Market, Camden Yards, John Hopkins, the Washington monument, University of Baltimore, and Pennsylvania (Penn) Station with easy and cheap access ($14 return) to DC. The area itself is historical and beautiful with lots of character. If you appreciate history and architecture, you will definitely like the area. Pretty good selection of restaurants within the area that were surprisingly good. The hotel is a short trip off the I-83 on West Madison Street near the Maryland General Hospital. Some people in other reviews were bothered by the homelessness in the area. We saw a fair bit, but were never harassed (they asked for money and give what you can), and actually found one to be helpful with directions to attractions. AMENITIES The area is the real amenity. The hotel offers a free continental breakfast and wireless internet at $10. Cable TV is in the room, is that even an amenity anymore? PARKING No parking directly with the hotel. They recommend you go to the Maryland General Hospital, where you can park for a hotel-negotiated $3.00 rate. We stayed 3 nights, and the parking lot attendant was nice and only charged us $7.00 in total. The lot seems secure and patrolled. CLEANLINESS The lobby, rooms, and hallways were kept relatively clean. COMFORT The furniture and decor of the entire hotel is quite dated, but it has character. Everything is in need of an upgrade. Much of the hotel hasn't had much work for many years. Peeling wallpaper, peeling paint on the walls, stained tiles and holes in the walls. The floor boards were broken under the carpet in our room, and many areas in the hotel are lopsided. That said, everything worked, it was clean, and...we'll leave it at that. The pictures will tell the rest. SERVICE Excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful, the continental breakfast was ready every morning, and the wireless internet worked well. The hotel wasn't busy and they upgraded us to a larger room. OVERALL It was of good value given the competition in the area. About $120 per night. The place is in pretty rough condition, but it's much more affordable than other hotels in the area. I really hope they restore the building as it is beautiful, and modernize the rooms. That said, I think I might stay at the Biltmore again when in the Baltimore/Washington DC area due to the value. Try the Afghani restaurant around the corner if you like lamb dishes.

I was a bit wary after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, but once I walked into my room, my first thought was \"it's so cute!\" and when I saw the bathroom (clean), my fears were put aside. As other reviewers have put it, if you like the standard sterile hotel room, with everything up-to-date, then this is not the place for you. However, if you like history and charm (and possibly are willing to put up with a few idiosyncracies), then this is a very cute hotel. For me, it was extremely convenient, since it was within walking distance of a conference held at the University of Baltimore (others at other hotels like the Radisson had to walk or drive, and one person got her car towed!). I found the staff very friendly, and were willing to help in getting the right forms so that my company would be charged. The biggest delight of my room was the 4-poster bed. The mattress was a little soft, so if you have back problems, you might want to sleep elsewhere. The room had a small stove, sink and refrigerator (perfect for putting restaurant leftovers to munch on later), and a table with 2 place settings. It also had a non-working fireplace that was a nice touch. The room had cable TV, although the remote control didn't really work. The bathroom (very important to me) was clean, and I had no problem with hot water or water pressure (I was in room 214 on the 3rd floor). I did have a colleague in another room who said her bathroom ceiling leaked a little. I had hangers in a walk-in closet to hang up my work clothes, and the room had a full-length mirror. I didn't feel like the air freshener was too strong. I stayed during the summer, and when I first walked in, the room was very hot. But once I turned the AC on, the room was very comfortable. I didn't get to eat breakfast, so I can't comment on that, but there is a water cooler in the lobby, if you don't like to drink tap water. The lobby was very nice. The hotel is old and a bit worn--e.g. it could use a new paint job in certain areas, but I didn't feel that it was dirty. The entrance is up some steps, and the door is very heavy. If you are physically disabled or have leg problems, then you might have some trouble with the entrance. Also, I didn't ride the elevator, but it looked very very small. The area around the hotel looked very interesting. I live in a city so to me, the area didn't feel bad at all. In fact, I thought the neighborhood was quite charming and there are a bunch of independent (non-chain) restaurants that I would have liked to have tried. The inner harber area is about a 30 minute walk, and the hotel is very close to the Walthers Art Musuem (which I didn't get to go to). It's about a 5-10 minute cab ride (or 15-20 minute walk) to the Amtrak train station. The room was $99/night + tax. In all, I had a good stay and it worked very well for my purpose.

It seemed like a good alternative to the high-priced, crowded convention hotels around the Inner Harbor, but not quite good enough. My room had a sitting room (with a daybed and TV) and a separate bedroom along with the bathroom. The room was clean, but the room and the hallways had a air-freshener scent that remained in my bags and clothes after I returned home. The furniture in the room was rather dated. The TV set, for instance, had a loud buzz until the set 'warmed up' after about 15 minutes. The bedroom had an armoire for storing clothes, but no hangers. I asked for some hangers at the front desk, but they didn't have any either, so I left my dress shirts piled on the daybed for my three-night visit. Not the end of the world, but still an annoyance. A much larger problem was the lack of hot water on two of my three mornings there. Apparently there was a problem with the pilot light in the boiler that served my room and another one, and I happened to be the first one up. Not having hangers is one thing, not having hot water is another. (The hot water worked at night, so I had to adjust my showering schedule). There's not a lot of dining in the neighborhood, and the hotel doesn't offer room service, so don't return to the room hungry. On the plus side, the location is in a nice quiet neighborhood. The Mount Vernon cultural attractions are a short walk way, and It's about a half-hour walk to the convention center, which may or may not be a problem for some travelers. (Charles Street seemed like a safer choice than Howard for walking downtown). It's less than a five-minute walk to the light rail, which was very convenient to the convention center and Orioles Park.

The suite I booked was clean and spacious and fairly quiet for a hotel on a major downtown thoroughfare. The hotel also has wireless internet, which is something I needed. While I liked the Biltmore and plan to stay again, I must say that the rooms need someone to repair such trifling inconveniences as bureaus and armoires without pull handles -- hard to open drawers without any handles at all. Old hotels require more routine mantenance than it appears the Biltmore is receiving. The breakfast is marginal at best, and the hotel management is unable to cash traveler's checks.

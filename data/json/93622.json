We stayed here for 4 nights, with 3 nights in a double-double room and 1 night in a king room. While costing more bucks, the king room was much roomier and had 1 microwave, 1 fridge, and 2 one-seater sofa. The closet was much bigger too. I would suggest offering the in-room coffee/tea maker. Also avoid using the paid-computer in the lobby. The minimum charge for the use of the internet was 2 bucks. After I put two dollars, the computer screen still showed that one more dollar was needed. I asked the front desk, but the gentleman asked me to call a 1-800 number on the computer. Apparantly, the hotel was not in charge of the machine.

We live only 2 hours from the city, so this stay was more to avoid the St. Patty's Day crowds on the train. The first thing that I LOVED about this hotel, was the free parking garage. Parking in NYC is always very expensive and hard to find, so being able to park for free right at the hotel was awesome. Check-in was quick and easy. We were on the 4th floor in room 408. We had an awesome view of 42nd Street. It was especially cool on the 18th, because we were able to watch the NYC half marathon run right by the hotel. The hotel's location was great. A quick walk to Port Authority, Grand Central, and Times Square. There was a deli/restaurant right next to the hotel that was good for a grab and go breakfast. The hotel room was pretty big for an NYC hotel. Usually you get a room about the size of a small closet, where you can touch both the walls from your bed. This room had 2 double beds and a decent sized bathroom. It wasn't as small as most NYC hotel rooms. The room was clean and comfortable. The windows were a bit thin, and you could hear any street noise clearly, but this isn't unusual for the City. My only complaint with this hotel (again, for the money this hotel was excellent) was the elevators. They were so slow, that we often had to resort to the stairs because after 5 minutes of waiting, we would get fed up. It's a small hotel, so the elevators shouldn't have taken so long. But I would definitely stay at this hotel again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a good value in the Big Apple.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cHidden Gem in NYC\u201d", "Author": "Michelle028", "ReviewID": "UR126366721", "Content": "Stayed for 1 night at the Travel Inn hotel before a cruise.

Within half an hour a room was available so we checked in. The room itself as stated in other reviews is a little dated, however the cleanliness could not be faulted. We had a twin room which was a good size for a manhattan hotel, the flat screen tv, microwave and fridge were an added bonus. The diner next to the hotel is a great place to begin your day, they have a large variety of drinks and food, all at reasonable prices. The hotel is located within hells kitchen, an area full of great restraunts and bars. Stay away from times square and head down some of the side streets which are filled with hidden gems, at about 2/3rds the cost. During our stay we wanted to visit the 9/11 memorial site (an extremely emotional but worth while experience). You have to print your passes off beforehand which we tried to do at the hotel recption, unfortunately the printer stopped working. The hotel porter however saw what had happened and very nicely took us up to the managers office area where he let us print out our passes. During our stay it was my girlfriends 30th birthday, we booked a car to take us back to jfk via the hotel reception. The hotel very kindly urgraded us to a limousine which was a perfect way to end a fantastic holiday. So all in all i dont think you will find a better value hotel in manhattan, clean spacious rooms, fantastic location and very friendly staff! we look forward to our return in the future! couple of useful tips - *dont use taxis to get around manhattan, they are extremely expensive. the subway is safe and it is only $30 for a weeks pass * as a uk visitor the new jersery gardens shopping mall was very cheap compared with manhattan. get the train from penn station to newark airport. from the first stop at newark there is a shuttle bus that takes you straight to the mall. all the named outlets are there and if you go to the help desk with your uk passport you get a voucher booklet that will give youu more money off. *for the best view of manhattan the temptation will be to go up the empire state building which is a little small and extremely busy. for a better view go up to the top of the rockefeller centre instead. it has multiple viewing platforms, and you have a great view of central park, as well as downtown and the empire state.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCannot fault this lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "thedales34", "ReviewID": "UR126170711", "Content": "For our fitst time in New York we were apprehenisive regaqrding this hotel as some of the reviews were not so good.

BARELY a 10 min, walk & you're in Times Sq! AND the hotel is HALF the price of a place in Times Sq. This is an economy/budget hotel so don't expect the world but it was safe, convenient, the staff was nice enough and the room itself was pretty quiet. (Don't know if this changes on the weekends or in the summer.) Based on this first visit I would recommend this hotel for the budget conscious traveler. Positives: Again, location (Times Sq./Hell's Kitchen/Chelsea; also right out of the Lincoln Tunnel). Price. Parking. Fast check-in. Clean bathroom. HDtv. Windows open. Felt safe. A small lobby to relax if needed. Pool (closed while we were there). A staff member offered cool help squeezing into ultra-tight parking space in garage. Gym (although equipment is old--it is an option at least, includes tv in exercise area.) Negatives: The housekeeping staff left a little to be desired--Found old cigarette butts in the window frame of our non-smoking room. After room service our comforter was still on the floor, mattress pad on bed wasn't attached, bed a little old, pillow case almost see-through.--It's a little petty but I'm just offering details about comfort/quality. No bellstaff offered/seen. Heat would not turn off completely. If you hate noise (then I guess you're doomed cuz it's NYC!) however, the back hotel rooms (north tower) are right over a train track and construction sites.

After parking for free in the dedicated hotel lot (read: no non-hotel guests allowed, attached to the hotel), we were able to walk or take the subway all over the city. The ease of the location made the trip that much better. There are several great restaurants right around (Amy's Bread Bakery was one of our favorites). It is also very close to the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum which is part of the reciprocal admission plan with many museums (we were able to use our Chicago Field Museum Membership to get in for free). Thanks to all the wonderful reviewers at Trip Advisor, I was able to ask ahead of time for a room with a fridge and microwave so we were able to have breakfast in our room with things we brought from home. The cons for this hotel again echo what many others have said- The room was very warm in the evenings, so much so that it did affect my sleep. I would suggest that management consider getting fans for the rooms if there is no way to fix the heating issues. If you like a warm room though, this might be best for you. If you do not, definitely make sure that you open your windows as far as you can before you leave during the day so the room is cooler when you get back. This helped us a lot. One other small thing- The front desk staff, while not outwardly rude, also were not overly friendly or helpful.

The rooms are very hot despite turning the heating off & due to the layout it didn't feel safe to leave the window open at night.

A would say that the hotel is basic and nothing was not good. I went to this hotel maybe 6 years ago and got a room that was with an entry outside (the room of the door was outside the main building, around the outside pool which makes the hotel look like a motel sort of. That room was a little damp and older, but maybe since then, they done renovations. I even shipped a parcel to the hotel, and they received it (at first, the person from security didn't remember receiving it, but then confirmed the name of the person who had signed for it, and then remembered...). You also need to book at this hotel in advance and with its 24hr cancellation policy, it's worth booking in advance and just cancelling if you're not leaving to NY finally. Last minute bookings at this hotel must be impossible. I always book directly on their website and get the best rate. This hotel is literally 2-3 blocks from Times Square and maybe a block from the bus terminal. I couldn't ask for better for the same price.

First impressions were great, very welcoming reception area, warm and festive looking, check-in was fast and efficient. Reception staff were helpful but not over friendly. After having read some negative comments regarding staff attitude I was expecting worse but it really was no problem at all. We were directed to the lift and made our way up to our room where we encountered our first problem. I had emailed ahead to ask for a quiet-ish room to find we had been given a room facing 42nd street. It was very noisy and on being in the room for just 5 mins, I realised there was no way we would have had a peaceful sleep so back down to reception we went. Our room was changed with no bother at all and our second room was in the 'older' part of the hotel - motel style rooms that surround the outdoor pool. We found it to be clean, well appointed, great fridge and microwave that we used most days but a very dated bathroom which could really do with updating. Two comfortable double beds and a lovely flat screen TV (could have done with a channel list though!). No real complaints - brilliant maid service too. One thing to note is that you had to run the shower for a good 10 minutes before you got any hot water out of it, might have been the time of year though?? After the first night we started to feel the cold in the room. This was probably down to the fact that the heating in these rooms is pretty ancient looking and that you actually have to exit the main hotel itself to reach your front door so you are not benefitting from the heat in the main hotel. I rang down to reception to be told that the heating was on an automated system and when it dropped below 40 degrees we would get heat!! Not ideal and we spent that evening watching TV under our bedding! Thankfully the following night the temperature dropped and we got heating!! Not ideal in winter but I can imagine that these rooms are lovely during the summer. The next issue that we came across was the paper thin walls as mentioned by others. For the first couple of days we had two ladies who woke me up at 6am chatting. After that a family moved in with a young child who didn't stop talking/shouting from the hours of 7pm to 10pm - we were glad they left after just two nights! During our stay we had need to use a few of the facilities namely the safety deposit box behind reception, the printer to get our attraction tickets and the wi-fi in our room. Absolutely no complaints at all - in fact the wi-fi worked brilliantly in our room and was a really great price, $6 for 24 hours. I can also recommend the little shop in reception which is like a Tardis!! Slightly overpriced but stocks pretty much anything you might need. Most mornings we ate breakfast at the deli next to the hotel. Fantastic service, great prices and lovely food - highly recommended! Within 5 mins walk of the hotel there is also a liquer store and a small but well stocked supermarket if you wish to stock up your fridge - we found this invaluable after a long days sightseeing when all we wanted to do was crash out in our room.

Bathrooms were nice and clean and we had no problems with the water pressure or temperature. Some staff at the desk were more helpful then others. Had to call the manager (ext number is available in welcome book) as upon check in the lobby staff told us that our request for a smoking room could not be granted. Called manager and within 5 minutes we were moving to our smoking room. Other wise staff helpful, with directions and things to see. One female staff even gave us a map and wrote on it directions and subway stops we needed to get to our destinations. The free parking is great (you will have trouble finding parking at all, let alone a FREE parking garage at any other hotel in Manhattan) and the hotel is only a couple minutes from the Lincoln tunnel so you dont really have to drive into the city traffic.

Me and my friend were just looking for a base, somewhere to wash and sleep and this is what we got. A slight mix up on the booking found us in a very small dark and dingy room, the staff at reception did move us to the correct room but got the impression they weren't overly pleased about doing this. Location: Pretty good to be honest, just far enough out to be quiet and close enough to walk everywhere, you do have to walk past some dodgy people from TSQ to get back to the hotel though. NYPD right opposite though. Cleanliness: Bed and sheets clean, bathroom clean, fresh towels daily, what more do you want? I'd rather smell air-freshener than any nasty smells. Sleep Quality: After miles and miles of walking each day we were pretty tired each night so slept ok, despite overlooking the main road, we did sleep with the window closed though. We weren't located by the lift but there was a resonable loud droneing sound that may affect some people. Rooms: Double - two double beds, large TV that worked, large fridge which was a bonus! Adequate sized bathroom and good sized wardrobe with iron. Yes it's dated and not very modern would be an understatement! Service: Hmmmm it was ok, staff not overly friendly but they did what they had to and sometimes made you feel awkward when asking for anything. DO NOT book a taxi back to JFK through the hotel, we did it as it was easier but they charge $20 more than a yellow taxi! I was unaware until I came on here that there was air-conditioning in the rooms, I presume it wasn't working, the pool looked ok and clean, the gym had what was needed, there was somewhere to put your luggage if you have a late flight....saying that this was away from reception and unmanned and unlocked when we turned up at 6pm to collect our things!!!! Overal this is an old and outdated building, if your looking for a base to stay this is good, you will save some money to spend on 5th Avenue!

The hotel is a 5-10 minutes walk from the theater district and from Times Square and therefore in a quieter area.

On check out i told the guy at the counter there had been no hot water in the room for 12 hours to which he replied \"That's ok\". Hmmm. It wasn't really. To get to our room (637) we had to get one lift up to the 3rd floor, walk down the corridor and get another lift to the 6th floor. This got a bit tiresome after a while of coming and going throughout the day and night. Our room was located behind the lift wall so we had the noise of the lift coming and going all through the night which got a bit irritating after a while. The room got quite cold at night which, along with the noise of the lift, woke us throughout the night. There was a strange, white stain on on our blanket and strange marks on the wall. There were no extra blankets, and only 2 pillows on the bed with no extras. The lifts were very slow, at one point I thought they might break down, low and behold when we returned one afternoon one of the lifts was 'out of order', although I admit I don't know why. The tv reception was poor and the remote control was tedious, I think it needed new batteries. Internet is not included and costs $6 for 24 hours The reception staff are not overly friendly, you need to call out to them to get their attention-even for checking in despite 3 staff standing there, seemingly ignoring you. We did not realise it was the UN Grand Assembly week which may have been why it was difficult to find alternate accommodation, and perhaps this is why the rate was so high but this was a VERY expensive motel considering the quality of it. I would not stay here again, or recommend to friends.

The room was a double double and cost me $681 (incl all taxes and fees). Hotels in NYC are the costliest in the U.S., so I tried to find a balance between comfort, cleanliness, location, and cost. This hotel met all my needs, and I would stay here again. My daughter would disagree, but she wasn't the one shelling out the $$ for an amazing trip to NYC. - I used the fitness center once - it was pretty bad (old equipment, no towels, cheaply made life cycle and elliptical machine) but it got the job done. - We didn't use the pool because we didn't have the time. - Nearby (1 1/2 blocks away) there was a full grocery store. - On the hotel property is a great restaurant/deli with good food at a good price. - Located about a 6 - 8 minute walk from the subway station. - Front desk (not a concierge) provided faulty information regarding taxis. The woman told me the cab fare to LaGuardia was a flat rate...not true...the taxis use a meter. For us it cost $36 (tip included) if I remember right. Now the taxis do charge a flat rate from JFK into anywhere in Manhattan - $45; this does not include tolls or tip. -One thing that annoyed me is the A/C was working just fine, but there was no way to control it so I had to have housekeeping bring up some extra blankets. -Microwave and fridge was provided in the room. - There were several fluff and fold laundry centers nearby. I dropped off 10 lbs of laundry and picked it up the next morning (could have picked it up at the end of the day of drop off) and paid $12.00 for clean, folded laundry. Extremely reasonable. - Located in Hell's Kitchen, unfortunately I didn't make it out to the many bars and restaurants in the area. I'll hit the shot glasses and pints next time if visiting with colleagues. - What's holding me back from giving it a better review? Cost is one thing - It is NYC, even so, I'm still expecting a bit more for $200 a night. The other is its an old building - the uncontrollable A/C and dated drapes/bed coverings show it.

The hotel is located in a decent spot...short walk to Times Square and Restaurant Row. For NYC, the price is usually quite reasonable. The hotel itself is decent. Nothing outstanding, nothing terrible...mid-range. I would say a 3* by American standards. The staff is sufficient for a hotel of this standard. By that I mean, not incredibly friendly, but they serve the purpose. I've never had an issue. As far as rooms, they are a decent size. Some are louder than others based on the location. So, you may want to request a quiet room if you prefer. For 3 of my 4 visits, my room was clean. One visit, there was hair in the bathroom and even on the sheets. I am certainly not one of those people that takes photos of the cracks on the hotel walls and the toilets...however, hair is unacceptable to me. I called down to the desk, and someone was up in my room in ~15 minutes and cleaned the bathroom and changed the sheets. That's acceptable to me. There is also a small pool which serves the purpose and a pathetic \"gym\"! haha (it should just be removed) Find your workout elsewhere. You could walk a few blocks to get anywhere or jump on the train. There are numerous things right nearby also. The restaurant downstairs has a good variety of reasonably- priced items. There is also a grocery store and liquor store next door, in addition to numerous restaurants, bars, etc. Overall, I have enjoyed staying here and will likely stay again. (mainly for the price & parking) If you are looking for fancy, don't bother. If you are looking for average, fairly priced and a decent location...this may be perfect. If you don't plan to spend much time @ the hotel, it's sufficient for sleeping and having a cheap breakfast.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel would return\u201d", "Author": "Tia75", "ReviewID": "UR116352301", "Content": "Very nice hotel.

Our room (4th floor overlooking the pool and patio) was perfect-- large (a king room), spotlessly clean, with fridge, microwave and a very comfortable bed. Although air-conditioned, it was such a pleasure also being able to open the window and let in the cool night air (I won't say \"fresh air\", since this is, after all, New York City!).

Although we didn't make that much use of it, the pool and the patio in downtown Manhattan were a delight. The hotel's location is excellent: walking anywhere in Manhattan is a breeze, and the Times Square and theatre district are a very easy walk. Starbuck's is just around the corner, a CVS pharmacy across the street, The Food Emporium (great supermarket) a block away and a 24 hr 7-11 just down the street. The police station across from the hotel gives a nice sense of security and the neighborhood felt completely safe and secure no matter what time of day or night we were outside. Many many great restaurants within a ten minute walk (check out Restaurant Row along 9th Avenue!) and we found the Theatre Row Diner diagonally across the street (at Dyer Avenue) a great value with excellent food and service (we breakfasted there every day). We found some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor totally bizarre--- who ARE these people? Do they expect five star ambiance and service at these prices? If so, they are delusional. The Travel Inn offers excellent value and very comfortable surroundings; if you want plush bathrobes and chocolates on your pillow, then go pay $500 a night elsewhere! No, the front desk service isn't the friendliest (who cares?), but our chambermaid's friendliness and efficiency more than made up for that. City noise at night?

We did have a king room, so I cannot vouch for the doubles. We were suprised that the rooms were normal size rooms and the A/C worked just fine. My wife and I had heard about how small NY hotel rooms typically are and how bad the A/C units are hot NY summertime. The room was great and we actually were cold most of the time and had to turn the air down. The room also had a good sized fridge and a microwave. This was great as there is a grocery store right down the street and a 24 hr CVS right across the street. We thought the location was great. Close enough to walk to all of the action in Times Square or catch the subwy or bus to a different location, and just far enough away that you don't get all of the noise at night. If your looking for a \"Trump Towers\" type of experience this is not the place for you. If you want a great place to stay without going broke, this is a great option.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBest deal around for free parking, location and extras\u201d", "Author": "wendanny", "ReviewID": "UR74947847", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on the fact that it had free parking, which is a huge money-saver in New York City, and it was fairly close to Times Square.

Good location, about 15 min walk to Times Square where there is a subway station. There is a bus station closer, but we did not use it. We were across from the police station right on 42nd street.

Once my mother and I arrived we found that my brother had not been allowed into the room and had been sat in reception for over an hour despite being able to provide id as to who he was. The staff on the reception desk had been rude and unhelpful. This set the pattern for our whole stay. The staff never said so much as a Good Morning or a Thank You when we dealt with them, they didn't even look round when we walked through reception but carried on their own conversation. When I phoned reception to book a taxi they said they \"didn't do that\"...if we wanted a taxi to the airport we were to come down to the gift shop on the ground floor and arrange it ourselves. They were consistently rude. Our bathroom was extremely small for what seemed a pretty expensive hotel ($370 on Saturday night for 3 people sharing), the bath was small and very old and the shower was non-adjustable, stuck to the wall with a very meagre water pressure. Certainly not a refreshing shower. The hotel was extrememly ungenerous with soaps and towels etc as mentioned by the previous reviewer...pretty gauling as they cost next to nothing and is just a sign of cutting corners and bad service on the part of the hotel managment. Internet access costs $1 for 5 minutes which we found very mean considering our $370p/n bill and the fact that free Wifi is available all over New York when you buy as little as a coffee. This hotel did everything it could to squeeze more money out of its guests at every opportunity. The pool is lovely, but it should be noted only open between 11am and 7pm so no early morning or evening swims. Beds are very comfortable and although the rooms are dated in their style of decor they are comfortable enough with good air conditiononing. The deli opposite is also excellent for inexpensive, good quality bagels for breakfast...the service THERE is efficient and friendly. The location is reasonable but not outstanding...it is a ten minute walk to the nearest subway and the section of 42nd street where the hotel is situated is not particularly attractive or interesting, although we always felt safe. Free parking is a bonus I guess, but we didn't make use of it and I question how many people will take advantage of driving a car into New York. The final straw came when the swipe cards they issued us with failed to open our door 3 days in a row. Each time we had to travel back along the corridors and down three floors to reception. We never once received an apology or even an acknowledgement they were at fault, they just reswiped it and handed it back without so much as a word. The reception staff at this hotel really could not care less once they have got you into their hotel.

I'll start with the good: - The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring Manhattan. Very close to Time Square and well within walking distance of many of the major NY landmarks - The hotel itself is very clean and well kept. The room was clean, comfortable and more than large enough for three adults - Swimming pool was great at the end of a long day sightseeing Now the bad: - We flew in from London and had a late arrival into NY. I called the Hotel the night before we checked in to confirm our booking and let them know that we wouldn't be checking in until after 11pm. When we arrived we were told that they didn't have a room for us so they sent us to one of their other hotels for the night (Hotel Riverside). Had we know the quality of this hotel I would not have stayed there. The hotel smelt terrible (I'm still unable to describe the smell), the first room they checked us into hadn't been made up, the second had mouldy food in the fridge. The air-conditioning made a huge amount of noise without cooling the room and all night we could hear what sounded like mice in the walls. If you have a booking with the Travel Inn and they offer you Hotel Riverside, even for just one night, DO NOT ACCEPT IT!! - On the first night we actually stayed in the Travel Inn a group of incredibly noisy guests came back from a night out at 3 45am and decided to sit directly outside our room window, drinking and making a lot of noise (not really the hotels fault, granted, but still irritating). - One of our bags was lost by the airline and was to be delivered to the hotel when it turned up. We kept asking at reception and were told it hadn't arrived only to find it in the security room. Later that night (at 12 30am to be precise) we received a call from reception telling us that the bag had arrived and could now be picked up. Maybe I'm just getting a little old but for me 12 30am is sleep time and I would have thought anyone with a small amount of common sense would have called us at breakfast time, not the middle of the night... Anyway, good to get that off my chest. Like I say in the title, this is a good hotel, but with three bad nights sleep out of a five night stay I can only really give this hotel 2 out of 5 stars.

The room was quite warm so we opened the window and left it open the entire time (except 5 am - we awoke. There was street noise with it open so we shut it and it was pretty quiet.) The room was small, typical chain hotel size with two double beds. The beds were a bit hard, sheets were clean and soft. The bathroom was clean, but the shower was stained and old. It needed to be refinished. We placed a towel on the floor of the tub and showered standing on it. Having a refrigerator and microwave was a great value. We bought milk and instant oatmeal and ate breakfast in the room. It was a bit tricky without a table and young kids, but worth the effort to save $20-$40 on breakfast. I would stay here again. The location is really great. The price was good ($160/night). I orignally booked the hotel room for $200/night. I went back to website and found that the rate dropped to $175 a night, the hotel changed it for me. I went back to the webisite the night before we arrived and the rate was $160/night. The hotel again changed my rate with no problems. The Veterans Day Parade was the day we arrived and the hotel street was closed. It would have been great if the hotel would have informed us that the parade would be starting at 11 causing streets to close and traffic to be much worse. Parking is free at the hotel. We only had a car for a few hours, so I am not sure how easy it was to get in and out of the garage. There were no bugs, no roaches, no rats! Overall, a good value for very pricey New York.

Don't get a per ride card..too much of a hassle. Get one card you can keep swiping. Only problem is with multiple family members, you have to swipe for each member.

Two block up from the West Side Highway meant that we didn't have to fight traffic in the heart of the city. We pulled in and were greated by a very nice parking attendant who directed us to check in. They were more than accomodating to us when we said we would like a quiet room. *note: always ask for a room overlooking the pool* it's very quiet and it's a nice view of the Empire State Building. After check in we drove the car to a nice clean secured parking garage (on the hotel property,something you NEVER FIND IN NYC) and went right from the garage to our room. Also I might mention that you are able to enjoy in and out services with your car,meaning you can take your car out for the day and return, this again is something you never find in NYC. Our room was clean quiet and very comfortable. A mini fridge and a micro made it all the better. I will say the room is a bit warm but if you leave the window open a nice breeze blows in. * Note,it's NYC folks. Close and lock your window before you leave for the day. Times Square was a few short (3) blocks away as well a a great Irish pub, right around the corner (Landsdowne). There is a great deli on site as well as a liquor store and grocery store within 2 walking minutes. Also a excellent flea market on 39th and 10th (again,a short 3 blocks away). We stayed for 2 nights and upon check out they let us leave our car so we could walk around a bit more. I can't say enough good things about the place.

Try not to take a shower in the evening, as you will find lukewarm water at best. Also, do not take your film to the 1-hour photo at CVS across the street.

I have been reading all of the reviews here religiously trying to decide what to expect of this hotel. Based on the mixed reviews, it seemed like a 50/50 chance that I would have either a positive or negative experience. We arrived at 9am Friday morning. Our check-in wasn't until 2pm, so I was hoping to just be able to park our car at the hotel until we could check-in later. When I walked into the lobby, the desk staff was friendly & there was another staff washing the windows. Not only could we park at 9am, but they said our room was vacant & they let us go right up!!! That was a huge plus for me - an 8hr drive & to have a bed right away was fantastic. Our check-in literally took 30 seconds - completely hassle-free. Parking was a bit tight for our Crown Victoria, but my husband pulled it off without much effort whatsoever. We were on the 7th floor, room 733 just outside the elevator. Pretty standard room as far as size & furnishings go. The bathroom was Tight. We made it work, but compared to the room space, the bathroom was disproportionately small. Our room overlooked train tracks & a smaller side street without as much traffic. I actually requested a street view - I should have specified the street I wanted to view was 42nd! Nonetheless, the view was lovely & perhaps the most amazing & unexpected bonus was the breeze that came through. While in our room, aside from when sleeping, we left our hotel door open the entire time & the cross breeze was incredible. The occassional trains & little street traffic were welcome sounds that did not disturb - we enjoy the sounds of the city. The beds were like concrete - very hard, but that mattered none. Each night when we came in after a very long day of sightseeing, etc. we all slept like rocks (no pun intended). I typically wake in my own bed at least 1x per night. I never stirred in these beds. Housekeeping was fine & everything was clean. To be honest, I don't pay attention to many details while in NY. I love the city & that's why I'm there, so I'd be just as happy staying at a hostile or on a bench in the park. But, mom, brother, & husband preferred a hotel. We did eat at the Theater Row Diner. Very close by, quite lovely on the inside, a strong contrast to it's outside appearance. We also ate at the Broadway Diner next door - also very good. The hotel's location is good, pretty central to everything you'd want. A short walk & you're at Times Square - definitely on the way I recommend Pax Whole Foods (a chain deli w/ delicious sandwiches that you can also get uptown at 2 other locations) & Madame Tussaud.'s wax museum - very entertaining. If you plan on making repeated trips to the city, I recommend avoiding the tourist traps around the bus terminals & Times Square. Head to the upper west side where you will find The Buttercup Bake Shop on W.72nd just before Amsterdam. Or, head to the village to eat at The Magnolia Bakery. Both of these bakeries make the same basic cupcake (the 2 ladies used to be friends & when their cupcakes created instant mania & booming business, they fought & split up, thus there are now 2 different stores) which is the most delicious baked good you will ever put inside your mouth - get them - $1.98 each - terribly underpriced!!! Just know that you can only get a maximum of 12 per person/party at the Magnolia Bakery - so if you plan on getting lots - go to the one on 72nd. Upon checkout, which also took about 30 seconds, we were allowed to leave our car in the garage until 5pm at the latest. Overall it was a fantastic stay, no real complaints about the hotel other than the bathroom being tight. Although, I was impressed that toiletries were vegetable based, rather than animal based, something that is important to my husband & I.

By this stage i was very tired and became quite upset. I was given another room and thought finally my awful day was over, but on arrival to the new room it seemed one of beds hadn't even had the sheets changed since the last guests used it. The sheets were crumpled and had pubic hair on them (very inviting.....not!) by this time i had just had enough so ended up sharing with my male colleague because the stress of dealing with the reception staff was just too much. My trip in general was fab and i loved New York as much as i always thought i would but the staff at the hotel put a dark cloud over my stay in such an amazing city.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus, ohio", "Title": "\u201cIt's a good deal\u201d", "Author": "ohjoe", "ReviewID": "UR8370658", "Content": "We stayed five nights at the Travel Inn and found it to be a good value.

You might want to ask for one of the rooms that overlook the pool -- they seemed more peaceful. The location is pretty good -- three long blocks to Times Square and near the incredible collection of restaurants that line 9th Avenue from 42nd Street north for many blocks. Also, there's a nice little deli right next door and a grocery store a block or so away. Parking is free -- such a deal -- in the attached garage, but it's tight.

As I read the reviews I cant figure out what people expect from a budget hotel in New York City. This was wife and mine third time to New York City and kids first. We needed a place that would fit four in two beds, most budget hotels only sleep two and the cost is way high (200/400$ nightly) This is a excellent budget hotel (we paid $150.00), the room was always clean and the maids went the extra mile by replenishing the soap, shampoo and conditioner daily they always spoke to us in the halls. The hotel lobby was always being cleaned, there was always a doorman or security in the lobby no matter what time we came in even if it was the parking garage security. Our 12 yo daughter was always going to get ice and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153see who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the pool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she even went to the deli, we always felt safe. The pool was clean and an extra-added bonus in New York cause most hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have them. The location could not be beat, on 42nd st a three block walk right (west) out the front door and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at the river, where they have a nice marina, where several \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go fast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tour boats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd operate from, nice restaurants and outdoor concerts. Turn left out the front door (east) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a three-block walk to the bus station/subway. The next block over on 9th ave, a full grocery store. Next door to the hotel is a nice little WINE only store on the other side attached but not owned by the hotel is a Deli/Coffee shop opened for breakfast and lunch, no dinner. The up side is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a safe area the police station is right across the street and its only 4 blocks from Time Square. We took a train in from white plains to Grand Central ten walked the 9 looong blocks to the hotel, I would not suggest this unless your in good shape. Now down side- the front rooms that face 42nd are noisy, the walls are extremely thin all conversations can be heard, there are vents in the bathrooms that lead the bathroom in the room next door, I am not joking I could talk to the people in there just like they were standing next to me. Also there are only three temp settings on the air in the front rooms, high, low and off. We kept ours on high all the time for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white noise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because of loud, obnoxious neighbors. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A LITTLE SIDE NOTE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c travel off the tourist path, we took the subway every where or walked, I suggest that after you see time square once avoid it the rest of your trip. Go to Coney Island and Queens. My son and I walked the whole width of the city to the UN, while the ladies went to the pool. One block from the hotel we spotted a man talking on his cell phone, the voice sounded familiar then we noticed who it was, I tried to sneak a picture when he noticed us. He motioned us over, my first thought was that he was going to be angry and demand the film, but instead he stuck up a conversation with us and ASKED US could he take a picture with us. (Yes that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin Sheen) So be observant, we also saw Robin Williams, Kelly Preston and her daughter making a movie in Central Park. Oh back to the hotel, every hotel has problems; don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the negative comments from some posters keep you from trying this hotel. It fit us perfect.

We lucked out as the whole experience was a good one. We were leary of driving in NYC, but getting in and out of this hotel couldn't have been much easier. From the Lincoln Tunnel, it's 2 left turns, 2 blocks and you're there. The parking lot attendant was very helpful in getting our van in to what can only be described as a very tight parking garage. But hey, free parking is free parking, and we weren't planning to do any driving while in town. Check-in was a breeze, the staff was \"New York\" courteous. Our room was high enough to not hear the traffic below, and the view was of the train tracks snaking under the building (my 3-year old son loves trains and ran to the window every time one passed). You could definitely hear the trains when they passed, but it was no where near what I would call too loud. The hotel's location was fine for us. We had 2 kids and the 10-minute walk to the Times Square area was fine. The Subway is right there, but I should mention that the closest station to The Travel Inn does not sell MetroCards. You will need to walk a little bit closer to Times Square. 2 extra minutes, no big deal. We felt safe walking the streets, even late in to the night. The streets were always fairly active. Our room was clean and well maintained. My wife was concerned when we first entered our room, as there was an open Coke bottle and a used soap in the otherwise clean bathroom. We checked in a bit early and I imagine we got a room that was quickly prepared by the cleaning staff. We never had a problem with the cleanliness of the room for the rest of our 3-night stay. The pool is half indoors and half outdoors. The water was a bit chilly, but the kids didn't mind too much. The pool was clean and towels were provided. The fitness room was tight. The room is rather small, and there's quite few pieces of equipment. However, the equipment worked fine, and the TV was appreciated. We loved the small diner right next to the lobby of the hotel. The food and service was excellent, and we ate there more than once. My only complaint is minor: the WiFi was $6.95 per day and you had to walk back to the lobby and get a new code every day. Codes were not distributed over the phone. These days, charging extra for WiFi is a bit greedy. We stayed at several hotels on this vacation, and most offered free WiFi. They don't charge for TV, why internet? I imagine a couple years down the road everyone will offer it for free.

After finalizing our decision to stay there based on reading some of the reviews on here, I felt I should offer my positive experience as well, to help other future travellers make a decision. My girlfriend and I were making our first trip to NYC so I did a lot of homework comparing hotels/location/prices online before we chose the Travel Inn. Our criteria for selecting it was based on location, reasonable price, and it included free parking (which was in the building and was a big help in comparison to third-party parking garages that charge at least $30 per 24 hrs, which most of the other hotels in that area of the city use.) We were pleasantly surprised!! If you want to be close (within 10 mins walking) to Times Square and the Theatre / Restaurant district, and want a price that is a fraction of many of the others in that area, this is the place for you. Even if you want to take a cab to other parts of the city, being in Midtown Manhattan means you're in the middle of it all, so it's a good central location to start from. We drove from Maine and being first-timers to the city we weren't sure how easy it would be to drive to the hotel and exit the city when we left. It could not have been easier!!! To get to the Travel Inn from the north is simple, since you can bypass all of busy streets in the middle of the city, all you have to do is drive down the west side (Henry Hudson Pkwy) and make a left on 42nd street and you're there!! To leave it was just as simple since it was just a reverse of that. When you get there, just find a place to park on 42nd street while you check in, then drive into the parkade. Our room location was great (7th floor) with a perfect view of the Empire State Building. In that part of the hotel you just have to go up in the elevator to the 3rd floor, walk down the hall to the other set of elevators and continue up the rest of the levels to get to your floor (if you're on a floor higher than 3). To get to our room we just had to walk down a covered outside balcony which kind of reminded me of a Motel rather than a Hotel, but it was still great! Our room was a double (2-double beds), which were a bit on the firm side, but we weren't there to do much sleeping anyway. We didn't have a remote for the TV in our room for some reason, but when I called the front desk they were very helpful and said he would get me one within 5 minutes and sure enough they brought it to our room in 5 minutes. The heater was controllable and pumped out a lot of heat quickly, but you could shut if off if you wanted, which was good. The only thing that could have been better was the water temperature in our shower. It kind of had a mind of it's own, a few seconds it would be very hot, then it would get very cold, and keep alternating like that. We just had to try to adjust the faucet a bit while showering, but not big deal it still did what we needed it to do. We had a laptop and wanted to access the internet to check on some things about the city while we were there, so to get connected to wireless, all you have to do is call the front desk and ask for it and they will give you an access code that is good for 24 hrs (which we got twice since we were there for 48 hrs). It only costs $6.50 for 24 hrs, so well worth it if you want it. The lobby of the hotel has a section with many brochures and pamphlets about everything to do with the city that may come in handy if you're looking for something in particular. Check out is 12:00, but the front desk attendant told me if you want a late check out you can ask for a 1:00 check out instead. If the reason you want a late check-out is because you want to go somewhere and leave your vehicle in their parkade it's not even a problem and you don't even have to tell them. He told me we could leave it there even a few hours after check-out if we wanted, no questions asked, which is a big help if you have things you want to do before you want to leave the city. There are plenty of good places to eat very close by, so I won't even begin to list them, but I will say that we had some excellent Asian food from Ollie's, which is just one block from the Travel Inn towards Times Square on West 42nd street. We plan on going to NYC again in a few months to do and see some more of the things we didn't get to do this time and we will definitely be staying at the Travel Inn Hotel without hesitation.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place - Recommended\u201d", "Author": "RylandsFolk", "ReviewID": "UR6813289", "Content": "This hotel was great - we booked it after looking at reviews on trip advisor.

Unfortunately the room was on the back and overlooked the railway line which ran under the hotel itself, but to be honest we were not there to sit and look out the window all day so this wasn't a big concern. The main selling point about this hotel is the location. It's only about 10 minutes from Times Square and only another 10 more minutes or so to the other big \"attractions\" like ESB, Rockefella Plaza, 5th Avanue and much more. If you are happy to walk everywhere, as we were, it's just perfect. It took approximately 90 minutes (with a brief coffee stop) to walk from Battery Park back up to Midtown, so you can really walk anywhere on Manhattan if your legs are up to it.

What an excellent choice! As we walked into the hotel after 8 hours of travelling we were greeted by very friendly reception staff who checked us in with the minimum of fuss. The standard double room I'd paid for, ridiculously cheap compared to all the other hotels I'd looked at that were even vaguely near Manhatten, turned out to contain two double beds and was HUGE. The bathroom too was very spacious, with a piping hot and powerful shower which compensated well for the subzero temperatures and icy winds in New York at that time of year! The room was always kept very clean, and the reception staff were friendly throughout, even when we New York newbies asked them to explain to us how the subway system worked. Fine, our room looked onto a police station, but so what? We'd come to see New York, not live in the hotel, so great amenities were all we wanted. Anyway, the Empire State Building still looked wonderful, lit up at night. You wouldn't see that if you got a much more expensive room in a high buildings area. And location-wise too there was nothing to complain about. Right next to Times Square and the theatres, and no time on the subway or taxi to downtown Manhatten. And at a fraction of the price of the glitzy Times Square hotels. Amazing, since the only other hotels I could find for vaguely similar prices were miles out of the city.

My husband and I stayed here on the final night of our honeymoon in July 2006. We love New York and wanted somewhere central. We also wanted somewhere that was easy to get to from the Newark airport bus stops - knowing we would have heavy bags from our two week trip to Hawaii. When I found the Travel Inn, it seemed to good to be true. I thought a swimming pool was a great addition - not normally something i would look for in New York, but again, coming at the end of our Hawaii trip, thought it might be nice to get a last dip before heading home to Engalnd. Also, I knew we would be looking to chill out after the long flight so thought we might use the pool a fair amount. The hotel itself is lovely. Clean and spacious, the rooms are not the most contemporary looking, but the furnishings all seem new and it's clean, so we didn't mind. The neighbourhood is a little off the beaten track for tourists, being over on the west side of 42nd street. I wondered about the safety before we went, but as we'd never felt unsafe in NYC before, decided to give it a go. WE need not have worried. We wandered to and from Times Square after dark with no problems as well as walking around the neighbourhood itself. It is the perfcet location for that airport bus as it's about a three minute walk to Port Authority. It's also very close to Times Square and its subway - perfect for exploring the city or eating out. The only negative we had was getting a cab back from 5th avenue after a heavy afternoon shopping. It wasn't a major deal, it's easy to walk from the subway, but we had lots of shopping, so could have done with a cab. That pool - the pool is a great area. It is like being somehwre else. The hotel surrounds the pool, which is half covered and half open, and you wouldn't know you were in NYC. We enjoyed sitting by it with a beer bought from the store next door and reminiscing about our fabulous honeymoon. If it's your first time to NYC then this hotel probably isn't for you as it's not exactly tourist central.

Some relatives then made plans to come to NYC by Greyhound bus, so this hotel became the most convenient option (it is located just 2 blocks away from the Port Authority bus terminal). The location of this hotel is just awesome. Getting to the hotel by car is easy - it is very close to the Lincoln Tunnel entry into NYC. It is within proximity of the excitement of Times Square and the Theatre District - we walked there a few times during our 2-night stay (about a 10-15 minute walk). We also walked all the way to Rockefeller Plaza and took the Top of the Rock tour (a little longer of a walk, but well worth it). The 42nd street subway station at Port Authority is also very conveniently located near the hotel - we purchased a $7 one-day Metrocard and traveled to Lower Manhattan in the morning to check out Ground Zero and the Staten Island Ferry (total travel time on the subway to Lower Manhattan was just under 20 minutes). We also took the subway in the early evening to Columbus Circle (Time Warner Center, Central Park) - it is located 17 blocks (but only 2 subway stops) away. The rooms in the hotel were clean but small, though I'm not complaining. We didn't travel to NYC to relax and sit around in our hotel all day long, we definitely went there to visit the sites. There were quite a few people at the outdoor pool - I guess to each their own but my intention wasn't to travel to such a prime, exciting location to enjoy the ambiance of the hotel and take a dip in the pool. I definitely think that the best feature of this hotel was the free parking. I was considering another hotel nearby, but I would have had to pay nearly $30/day to park across the street. I was definitely happy that I did not have to worry about parking and that my car was in a safe & convenient location. The deli near the restaurant was fine, but there was also a Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and a 7/11 within walking distance... not to mention 8 million other eateries near Times Square. Bottom line: this hotel is a bargain. We had a total of 3 people staying in my room for 2 nights last week and we paid just under $350 USD (after taxes) without having to pay for parking. I could not find any other deals this good in such a convenient location and I searched almost daily for nearly a month. With everything else being as expensive as it is in NYC, it just makes sense to save as much money as possible on lodging.

The previous reviews are pretty comprehensive and we found the postive reviews borne out by our experience, which was just fine. I was especially impressed with the size of our room (normal hotel room size! In New York!) I've previously stayed in Chelsea at the adorable Chelsea Lodge, but their rooms have only one bed, and we needed two beds. I was a little worried that this hotel is in Hell's Kitchen but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the neighbourhood. The streets were so busy that we felt very safe walking back to the hotel even at midnight. EATING The local Starbucks is right around the corner on 9th Ave (head north) on the main floor of the large apartment building on the corner. Pax Whole Foods (42nd Street, on the way to Times Square) is a great place for a quick, healthy lunch. Lovely Bryant Park (behind the NYC library) is just past Times Square on 42nd Street. It has dozens of free cafe tables, fantastic people watching and public washrooms that look like they belong in the Waldorf. It's a perfect spot for morning coffee and breakfast while you plan your day. There's a little takeaway on the south side of 42nd street (Cafe something or other) similar to Pax - all sorts of sandwiches, yogurt, sweets, fruit, drinks to choose from; and the ubiquitous Starbucks across the street. We managed to get same day reservations at Nobu in Tribeca by eating at the unfashionably early hour (by NYC standards) of 5:45 - 7:45p.m. Considering that Nobu is usually fully booked a month in advance, we were pretty happy. Also loved Pastis, a French-style cafe on 9th Ave at Little West 12th Street. Go before 11:00a.m to get a seat without waiting. TRANSPORTATION If you don't have a lot of luggage, you can walk 2 blocks to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and catch a shuttle to JFK or LaGuardia & save about $7.00 per person over a hotel shuttle booked through the hotel gift shop. SHOPPING We found 5th Ave north of 42nd Street to be much better shopping than Soho; or at least, we both had better luck there. I noticed that prices vary wildly at the souvenir shops around town, so look around before you buy. We saw T-shirts advertised at everything from \"3 for $10\" to \"14 for $10.\" Personally, I think the best souvenir is a framed photo that street vendors sell for $12-$20 (all the major sights are available). I buy one to commemorate each trip to NYC. MUSEUMS Warning: our two guidebooks (2001 and 2005) both had MOMA and the Neue Gallery (with a cool Klimt exhibition) closed on Mondays... when in fact, they're closed on Tuesdays. Serves us right for not purchasing new guidebooks, I guess. HOTEL DOWNSIDES I would stay at the Travel Inn again without hesitating. It's great value for the price. The only downsides I can think of are these: - 42nd street is fairly boring (parking garage, police station, post office, supermarket, bank, bus terminal) for two blocks toward Times Square; it's not a NYC street with lots of cafes and boutiques on your doorstep. 9th Ave. heading north offers more restaurant choices, all pretty standard fare. - The hotel is the budget offering of the Empire hotel chain, meaning you get decent quality and zero character. It could be any hotel room, anywhere in the world. - If you're in town to shop, a hotel in the Midtown East area would put you closer to the action; for theatre goers, Travel Inn is perfectly located.

The FREE SELF PARKING IS SUCH A PLUS. We arrived around 11:00 am and told them we were here. They checked our reservations and told us we were welcome to park the car and go sight-seeing. They told us we could check-in after 2:00, but our reservation was guaranteed if we wanted to return later (which we did). The parking attendants were very friendly and helpful. You can either leave your luggage in the car (which we felt very safe doing) or check it in the security room in the parking garage. The front desk was friendly and helpful in telling us where the nearest Subway stop was. They even gave us a free Subway map. We walked back to the hotel around 10:00pm and we felt very safe. The walk from Times Square is about 4 (longer) blocks. It is an easy walk with alot to look at, so my children didn't even mind it! Our room was VERY CLEAN and QUIET. It was even facing the train tracks and the noise was muffled. We needed extra towels which were brought to us immediately! The beds were nice and the air-conditioner worked great. The city view is a plus. The pool looked nice, we just didn't have time to use it! The deli (Broadway Deli)next door is WONDERFUL for breakfast. I got 2 eggs, bacon, fried potatoes and toast for less than $4.00. The portions fill you up too! I HIGHLY recommend it! Once again, I can't wait to go back!

It's an urban place with many different characters and faces. I don't consider any place in NYC \"kid friendly,\" we're definitely not at Disneyland people.

We had requested a nonsmoking double overlooking pool room months ago. Upon check in (3pm), we were given a room on the 3rd floor overlooking 42nd street. The room was dirty and there was a man repainting door casings upon arrival. We were told we could leave our luggage there and it would be cleaned shortly. (The doors were all open on the floor due to the painting). I went back to the front desk to inquire about a room in the back overlooking the pool, and was told there were none available. Traffic noise is very loud and apparant all hours of the night (including multiple sirens from the police station across the street). Especially large buses up and down 42nd street all hours - many going to the convention center located down by the water. The room had beds as hard as rocks and thread bare sheets/towels. The room was cleaned shortly after we arrived but not to my standards. There was still several hairs to be seen all over towels, floor, tub, etc. Both the tub and the sink did not drain properly. The hot/cold in the shower/tub was just that - either hot or cold - no warm! We learned to quickly shower as there were no other rooms available in the city due to conventions. Otherwise we would have moved! Our room smelled of Raid insect spray, the hallway was never airconditioned, the elevator lights did not light up and you often had to wait. The pool is a nice size but don't count on the lifeguard there who sleeps while on duty! The hotel was full of European travellers (not a negative, just a fact). This hotel is NOT in a tourist area. It is 3 blocks from Times Square - 3 LONG blocks equivalent to 9 or so of the short blocks. I agree it is not that safe of an area after dark. There is a Food Emporium grocery store 1/2 a block up which was good for quick snacks/necessities. We did try the Theatre Row Diner about a block up once for dinner. It was reasonably priced by NY standards but the food was adequate at best. We requested late checkout and was denied. The lady in the gift shop (size of a small closet) was nice. Taxi's are difficult to obtain in front of the hotel but the city bus (M42) does stop right in front. This is not a \"nice\" hotel by any means, but would be better than sleeping in the airport! We paid $50.00 MORE for this hotel than our first 4 nights at the Hilton New York. Which of course is many moons nicer/cleaner/noise free/comfortable/better located than the Travel Inn.

Instead of offering the small security room which is located in front of the parking garage (I did not realize it was there until check out), I was told to just put our luggage in our room. Not a good idea, since when we got to our room, it was still a mess from the last occupants, and the door was wide open. I also did not find the location to be that safe at night, especially being a lone woman with 2 children, coming back from the theater and dinner at midnight, having to pass not so child friendly streets. The halls always seemed deserted, and had a wait for the elevator. I would not recommend this hotel if traveling with children, especially small children, as the walk from Time Square tires them easily, feeling of uneasiness, as it is situated away from the hustle and bustle, and in a kind of desolate area.

The hotel staff were wonderful though about explaining the reason (building heated by one main boiler so heat is maintained at an even temperature in all rooms and although the unit in our room was turned \"off\" by us, heat was still leaking through) Lastly, the fact that you had to call and pay each day for a code to keep the wireless on for the computer, I wished I could have just paid for the week obviously! But considering the overall experience of the hotel and it's staff, these were minor annoyances, believe me.

There wasn't enough light in the shower/tub area though...once the shower curtain as pulled, it was a bit on the dark side. Wireless access was easy to get for a fee of about $6 per 24 hour period. You have to get an access password every 24 hours from the front desk. The rooms were clean enough BUT we had specifically requested a non-smoking room. When we arrived on a Saturday at 2pm, we were told there were no more non-smoking rooms and we were given a smoking room. It reeked of smoke...everything did. They sent up an ozone air purifier for us and delivered fresh pillows to us but for the first 2 days, it was still pretty bad. By the end of the 2nd day, the room smell was ok (a combination of the air purifier and us leaving the doors and windows open when we could). So...would we stay there again? Yes...because after the room stopped stinking, it was a pretty nice hotel and you can't beat the price for that location.

It was clean, friendly and safe and the staff were all more than helpful. It is a 5 minute walk from Broadway and 10 minute walk from Time Square and Maceys. It was lovely going at Christmas, as all the decorations, the ice rink and market in Time Square and the father christmases on the streets all made it magical. We were a bit concerned being two \"girls\" on our own, but we did feel safe. The hotel is right opposite New York Police Department and we had a lovely view of the Empire State Building which was illuminated at night. The hotel is only two blocks from the harbour, where you can get cruises around the statue of liberty. There is also a supermarket and deli 1 block away, so everything you need right on your doorstep. We were so tired after two days of hard shopping and sightseeing, that we didn't have the energy to go out again, so ordered room service. They've got quite a good choice of menu and it is delivered from the deli one block down, and both nights we weren't disappointed at all with the quality, amount or price we paid. There is also a deli right next door which is ideal for breakfast. All in all, an ideal hotel, in a good position and friendly, clean and comfortable. One slight downpoint though. Just beware if you book a chaffeur driven limo to the airport. I don't know if it was because we were two women on our own, but we were told that the price of $75 was a flat rate and included everything, including tolls and tips (and it states this in the literature in the hotel), but when we got to the airport he tried to charge us extra on top for the tolls. I was going to give him a good tip (gratuity), because the traffic was really bad and he seemed fed up, but because he tried to rip us off I didn't bother, so he missed out.

I have stayed here many times although I feel the real reason I stay here is the price rather than the quality of the hotel. They do offer free parking which is a plus, but I decided that I can no longer overlook the other areas that leave me a bit miffed. I had booked two non-smoking rooms and called a couple of days before to request that the rooms be located in the back of the hotel because if you get stuck facing 42nd Street, it's just as noisy as if you slept right on the sidewalk. When we arrived, our rooms were in the back, but they were smoking rooms. The desk said that when I called, they just gave me two rooms in the back without accomodating the non smoking request. I don't know why they simply didn't tell me if things were not going to be the same. So there we were on 42nd Street. The noise level is unbelievable at night. Right across from the Manhattan South police station. The garbage trucks backup alarms will wake you right up. You can't regulate the heat/AC in any of the rooms, just the fan speed. If you open your window because of it, the noise level is phenominal. The double/double rooms have received new matresses which are the hardest I have ever slept in. I have had to bring one of those foam pads with me to soften the feel in the past. The bathrooms are nice but very small, and the last several times I was there put up with mildew on the walls, and between the shower glass sliders. The rooms are a decent size. If you take a shower between 8-9:30am when the hotel is full, there is a great chance you will get stone cold water and the front desk (what else can they say) will tell you that a boiler is out. They have told me this on three different occasions. One time when I turned on the faucet for the bath, all that came out was rusty water, and I had to debate the head housekeeper for a new room. I suppose the straw that broke a camel's back was what happened to my friends down the hall. On our last night (Sunday) the hotel had plenty of rooms available. My friends wife was feeling ill and the toilet got plugged about 2AM in the morning. When she called to ask if they would send someone up, they didn't and would not even offer her another room to use the bathroom. Very ill, awake and angry, my friend and his wife left the hotel to find another bathroom somewhere in NYC at 2AM, and decided afterwards to simply leave and drive home. Not knowing this and calling them about 9AM to see where they might be on the road, they told me they were only about 5 miles from their homes (400 mile trip). Then the story came out. I decided to tell once and for all my experiences and to share theirs, so you may not be surprised if things don't work out if you visit there. I guess the reason I used to put up with all of this is not only did they have free parking, but their rates were quite low a few years back ($109-$139). For this weekend,we averaged $165 per night as NYC hotels have been getting higher rates, especially this year. Well, even though free parking is a plus, I would rather pay the $25-$30 and have a room that is not with mildew, with concrete matresses and possibly not on 42nd Street. I suppose it was easier to overlook all of this when the price was very reasonable, but this hotel is no bargain anymore free parking or no free parking. The back of the hotel is like an old motel with a common walkway between rooms that looks kind of cool, but if you decide to leave your window open, it is right at walkway level and vulnerable to being entered. You certainly wouldn't want to leave it open when you sleep either. Right at walkway level. Many people chose to overlook this and give the hotel a higher rating, but I have been to NYC about 35 times now and will no longer use the Travel Inn and my back is grateful. Believe me, over the course of your trip, don't be afraid to spend an extra $25 for parking. Yes, you do not spend your vacation in a hotel especially in NYC, however do yourself a favor and over the course of your 2-3 day stay, spend the extra $100 for the parking and choose a hotel that allows you to set your own temperature, has cleaner mildew free bathrooms, and matresses that won't make your back ache in the morning.

He didn't even clean anything, he sprayed the bathroom with PLEDGE... a wood cleaner! and then he said, \"See? All clean.\" In my head, I was thinking oh hell no.

Hotel is inexpensive for NYC, and the parking is free, *with* in-and-out privileges (although we kept the car in the garage for the 3 days we were in NYC). This is almost unheard of in NYC, where some valet services charge $40 a day, and no in/out privilege! So, for people taking a car trip, a plus! (only be prepared to be very patient when parking your car as the spaces are quite tight and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hit a pillar or someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle!) For a \"budget\" hotel right in Manhattan not far from Times Square, this hotel was actually quite good. The rooms are compact and clean, and the lobby is small but not shabby. The staff (front desk, housekeeping, garage, etc.) were all most helpful and polite (The elevators were rather slow, but this is a minor issue.) No, this place is not the Pierre or the Ritz or the Mandarin Oriental, some things are not \"perfect\", but it is by and large good value for your money. Our teenage daughters used the swimming pool for about 30 mins one day, the pool is outdoors off the third floor in a rather quaint \"courtyard\" setting.... refreshing after a rather muggy morning visiting Central Park.... There is no restaurant officially \"in\" the hotel, but there is a \"Broadway deli\" directly across the garage entrance from the lobby, and the breakfasts there were adequate to get you started on your day walking and riding around Manhattan. There is another good breakfast diner just East on the south side of W42nd at the corner of Dyer. Hotel is on corner of W42nd Street and 10th Ave. So Times Square (Seventh and 42nd) is 3 blocks or about 10-15 minute walk depending on the crowds. There were lots of people about, so it felt fairly safe, but one should always be vigilant when strolling in NYC anyways\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The hotel has a small souvenir store and the friendly lady there was able to book the Gray Line bus tours there, so you can avoid the hucksters waving the pamphlets in your face at every street corner. So if you are going to book the Gray Line tour, go through her, and then walk over to Eighth Avenue and a little north to W47th to the Gray Line bldg to get your ticket. We found the Eighth avenue embarcation point for the Gray Line buses handier than the crowds one block over at Times Sq. Speaking of which, Times Square was cleaned up by Rudy Giuliani, it is no longer the seedy smutty dump it was 25 years ago. Our kids (and us) particularly enjoyed the Hard Rock cafe, Virgin megastore, Toys R Us, etc... plus the Gray Line tours all leave from there. (see above paragraph).

Needless to say, we were completely blown away by what we found, a true treasure for people looking to visit NYC and to be close to Times Square and the theater district. The location of the hotel is perfect. Located on West 42nd street, the hotel is central to everything New York city has to offer. We saw the Lion King (also highly recommended) and was only three blocks from the theater. We were only about 5 blocks from Times Sqaure, 2 blocks from the Circle line sightseening cruises and about 8 blocks from 34th street which houses Macy's and many other large stores. If safety is a concern for you and your family you can rest assured as there is a police substation right across the street. We constantly felt a police presence and to be honest we were out and about late during our stay and never felt uncomfortable once. The hotel itself has a nice lobby with a very accommodating staff and a gift shop/tourist information center where you can get everything from souvenirs to tour and theater tickets. The room was very large compared with most Manhattan hotel rooms. We had a king sized bed, chair, desk with chair and fridge and microwave. The room was very clean. We are very concious of hotel dirt and looked and couldn't find any. The sheets were clean and crisp and the bathroom was spotless. The bed wasnt the most comfortable in the world, but after walking around NYC all day, you won't even notice. There is pay internet access in the lobby and purchasable internet access and Nintendo 64 games in the room. (Both for about $8.00 per hour). There is room service from a restaurant down the street that is a very extensive menu and free delivery. The TV service could have been better. The reception was awful and there weren't many channels, but again, with walking around Manhattan all day, you won't notice. However, that was really the only problem. We really liked this hotel and we plan on staying here for each of our annual trips to NY from now on. It is in a great location and has a great price. We paid around 140 a night before taxes which is a great price for its quality and location. Some other recommendations is you are looking for food: BB King's lounge is right down the street 3 blocks away and has a restaurant called Lucille's grill. Absolutley fantastic food.

The manager offered no apology, no room change (he said they were completely booked), and no assistance in finding another hotel room in New York, even at one of the other hotels in the Empire Hotel Group. He did offer to \"spray\" the room and get us a nonsmoking room the next day. Since we could not stay in this room, we called other hotels and found an excellent one that understands customer service. Upon our checking out, the manager was rude and completely failed to understand why he had a disgruntled customer. He made no attempt to remedy the situation or make even a token offer to acknowledge the inconvenience the hotel had caused. He even threatened to charge us for the room if we had used the bathroom while we were searching for another place to stay.

Though I do recommend this hotel, particularly for its location just a short walk from Times Square, I would advise anyone contemplating a visit to bring a flask so they may have a hot drink in the mornings. I paid a not-inconsiderable sum for my room and was very disappointed to find it had no tea/coffee making facilities nor a refrigerator. Both of these I consider pretty essential, especially for a lengthy stay. And in the summer, how on earth can you have a hotel room with no fridge? Overall then, I consider the Travel Inn, Manhattan, to be a good, convenient, place to stay but it does have its drawbacks. Would I stay there again? Yes, but only in winter and I would bring a very large flask.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place / Great Value / Free Parking!!!\u201d", "Author": "RaZor_Edge", "ReviewID": "UR3308083", "Content": "Travel Inn is a really great deal in Manhattan!!!

Few blocks down from Times Square, tubes easy to use. All in all, the Travel Inn made our trip all the better. Also, look out for Aveline, the lady who runs the gift shop in the hotel.

A good hotel to stay in New York. Stayed for two nights before Christmas. Easy walk to Times Square and subway station.

Major advantage is the free parking, check out at 10 am, but leave the car at the hotel until we are ready to leave at 9pm. Policy station across the street, felt very safe at this location. Room was a little noisy even on the 4th floor, but that's understandable. Used the wireless internet service for under $6 per day, connection was slow and not too reliable, not recommended.

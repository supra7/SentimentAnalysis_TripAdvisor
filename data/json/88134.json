However, this hotel is by far the worst I've ever stayed in. We come to Orlando at least once a year for the past 10-12 years. I wish I had it to do over again and I would stay somewhere else for 4 nights. First off the hotel isn't Maingate it's more like 20-25 mins away from Disneyworld. It's close to alot of places to eat and a Super Target if you like that. The extra service fee's you pay there is a joke. They charge 5.64 per day service fee and an extra 2.95 a day mandatory fee for a computer in your room. The computer in the room (at least mine) did not even connect to WIFI and their is no printer. So this was useless. If you want a coffee pot you have to go to the front desk and ask for one because they are not in your room. You also have to go to the front desk every day to get coffee unless you run down the maid because they will not leave it. The free breakfast is a joke. You get the following.... Toast, some white donuts, a waffle if you make it and coffee or mango juice... That's your selection... The breakfast area is very small near the front desk and you can't even get in there. So your extra \"resort\" fee's are a joke!! Take the money you pay on resort fee's and this cheap hotel rate and do yourself a favor and get a better room closer to Disney on this same strip. As far as the actual room.... It is nasty! The walls are dirty and have like spilled juice or something all over them. The carpet is nasty and smells of musk and dog pee. The bed linens are dark to hide all the nasty stuff i'm sure is on it. The bathroom shower is full of mildew that hasn't been cleaned in awhile. Don't expect the safe to work because our's did for a bit and then had to call maintence to come and open it and then wouldnt lock back. They can get into these things afterall so I wouldnt trust leaving anything in them in this shady hotel. One night we had teenagers hanging outside our door at 3am yelling and screaming and drinking. Called front desk once... nothing happened... Called again to complain and front desk got attitude with us for reporting noise at 3am. Crazy! Oh and they have a swimming pool but, if the room is any indication of how they keep up that pool I wouldn't get into it.

(They did not book a hotel because they were origionally staying with friends in the area but decided for the advertised price it would be worth the additional cost.) Upon payment they were charged an extra $9.00 hidden fee per night, they decided the breakfast will compensate for the extra fees; don't believe it; in addition the hotel also charges an extra $10.00 for weekend days. When they settled into the room they were uneasy about the cleanlieness and even cranked up the heat so they did not use the blankets; they felt the bathroom floor was unsanitary, and found hairs on the linens. They called to tell the desk they would not be staying any more days and they were informed that they were going to be charged for an extra day reguardless of the situation. So I called the front desk to inquire about pricing and checkout policy. The MANAGER, Mike, outright lied to me about the hidden cost until I told him I had read in the review about the extra cost, then he hesentantly admitted to the fact there was a $6.00 SERVICE FEE and a $3.00 computer FEE regardless if you use it or not. The hotel was unwavering and charged the girls an extra nights fee even with them checking out at 8:00 AM. They switched to Disney All Star for very little difference in final cost.

The sign outside was flashing \"CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN\" in bright red letters, every time I saw the sign flashing I had to laugh to myself. I had originally booked this hotel for a 4 day stay as part of a hotel flight package through Expedia. I was relieved when I found out I would be spending two of those days in Naples instead. So since the room was already paid for, I went ahead and checked in when I arrived in Orlando. Check in was fine, aside from the fact that all of the lobby furniture was sitting out in the parking lot since they were having tile put down in the lobby. I went to check out the room and when I walked through the door was immediately hit in the face with a musty, moldy odor which was ineffectively masked by a strong perfume smell. It is clear they have a moisture problem in this property as there are cracks in the ceiling of the bathroom where it looks like the ceiling could fall down, specks of mold on the walls. The bathtub, shower enclosure were just not clean, and it was clear they had not been clean in a while, with more mold evident. The bath tub did not have a plug, not that anyone would want to soak in it. The bathroom door and main entry door had clearly suffered some violence. It looked as though someone had kicked them in and busted it open. The sheets on the bed had holes that looked like cigarette burns. The only nice thing in the room was the marble or granite countertop with sink which had a crack in it and appeared to be sloping downward to one side. There were always dodgy looking people loitering around the property which did not give me a feeling of security in the least. I always saw the doors to the rooms being left slighlty ajar by housekeeping even when they were not in the rooms themselves which was bothersome to me from a security standpoint. The carpet had high traffic wear and was frayed at the entry to the bathroom with loose strings sticking up. It was an all around disgusting experience and I hope this review will save someone else from a similar fate. There are plenty of safe, clean properties in this area that are reasonably priced, there's no need to settle for this one. One last thing, they claim to have a continental breakfast. If you like oatmeal pies, sugary kids cereal, white toast with margarine, the you'll be happy. Do not expect fresh fruit. They did have an old brown banana that was swooped up by some desperate soul early in the morning, but there's no bagels and cream cheese or really anything much of any redeeming nutritional value served.

We went into the lobby area which smelt rather musty but the check-in person Bobby Jo was very pleasant and attentive and gave us the key to our room. Another guest at the hotel also filled us in with some LOCAL advice which we found very helpful namely only walk if you have to especially after dark and if we did decide to walk then only go in one direction as it wasn't safe in any of the other three directions. Room was ok, pretty standard for a motel in the middle of the Bronx at least the sheets were clean or at least looked it. We didn't bother going to get anything to eat that night but if you like pot noodles the reception sell a vast choice obviously due to lack of eatery outlets after dark.

It's a place to sleep; nothing more and at $27 a night, I can't complain too much about the room. It did smell musty, but the sheets were clean and the bed comfortable and the air conditioner worked. The main things I want to make clear are the transportation issues for Disney. The bus picks up at 7:45am to go to the Ticketing and Transportation center. You stop at a LOT of hotels along the way to pick up. This is the only trip to Disney. The return bus picks up at 10:15pm at Epcot and 10:25pm at the Ticketing and transportation center. Epcot closes at about 9:15 after illuminations, so you are stuck in the parking lot for about an hour exhausted and with no place to sit. The fireworks at Magic Kingdom end at about 10:15, so there is no way to make the bus. They pick up too late at Epcot and too early at Magic Kingdom. We had to pay a $35 cab fair so my daughter could see the fireworks, one of the highlights of the trip. If you use the hotel shuttle you are basically forced to be up at 6:30am and in bed after midnight. Try that for a few days with children! The bus forgot our hotel one morning, so we gave up and took the city bus. They told me the next day the bus did make but over an hour late. Unacceptable! A good thing is the city bus stop (Lynx) right next to the hotel. Bus 56 runs to the T&T center and costs $1.75 for adults and $0.85 for children. It will get you there faster than the hotel shuttle will, though you have to wait for a bus (they come every 30 minutes). They bus stops running at 9:45pm, though. We slept in one day out of pure exhaustion and just took the city bus in. We also used it to get to the park the day we arrived (mid-day) and return the day we left (again, mid-day). If you can, stay on property for Disney. We would have, but the Value resorts were all booked up at the time and the other resorts are out of our price range.

When I arrived I saw no resturaunts and no shopping, except for the Nike outlet store, dollar tree, and the shell station next door. I asked about the resturaunts and I was told there was a wafful house a few lights down and the rest are about 1 mile or more away. After a long and painful check in I went to my room only to find probably the crappyest most out of date room I ever saw. (and this was after the website said it was renovated) but no worrys I can let things go. The thing that got got me was the lack of housekeeping and maitnence. There were hairs all over the tub, trash under the bed, and no towels. I called the front desk and asked the front desk clerk who made it sound like she was doing me a favor by taking care of these problems. I was moved to another room and it was a little better(not much mind you) there were still no towels, This time when I called I spoke to a guy and he told me I had to come down to the lobby to get the towels because there were no one else to bring them to my room, so once again I had to go to the lobby. When I got there there were about 4 other guests just screaming at him about the same problems I had( bad housekeeping) by the time I got to the counter he looked like he was ready to pull his hair out. I got my towels and went back up stairs, ever thing was great until I woke up in the middle of the night to a roach crawling on my cheek I turned on the light and saw about 10 of them running for cover. I called the desk and was told there were nothing that could be done about it tonight and he would request maitnence to take care of it first thing in the morning or I could check out. I stayed but I couldn't sleep the whole night. In the morning I went down to breakfast and was very dissapointed, bagles, honeybuns, bannanas, and coffiee. I know it was just a continental breakfast but it was nothing like it said on the internet. The cofiee was great thoe. I decided to take my room issues to the front desk and was told by the very rude blond girl \u201cwere taking care of that\u201d My family and I went to the parks and had a great day at Disney, only to come back and see the dirty towels lying on the floor where we left them, the beds not made up and the trash still in the room along with the roaches still running around the room. I called the front desk and demanded to speak with the manager. She took the phone and I told her the problem, but keeping up with the rest of the staff she did nothing.

The hotel isn't a four star hotel, but it doesn't claim to be, and if you're expecting that at the rates that are charged, you are a fool and deserve a bad experience, in my opinion. Our room was clean, had a lovely comfortable king sized bed, sofa (probably was a sofa bed, but we didn't think to check), dining table, working mini fridge/freezer and microwave, etc. The bathroom fixtures were dated (discolored from age, not from dirt). The room was cleaned every day and cleaned very well, the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful, and the location was great. The free shuttle got us to Disney before the parks opened, which allowed us to get on the best rides before any lines, and if we didn't want to wait for it to return us to the hotel (it ran later at night) we could take the bus (I believe the 56 LYNX) which ran directly from the front of the hotel to the Magic Kingdom, took no more than 30 minutes, and cost $1.75 (the public busses are great down there!). Also, the 55 takes you up and down the 192 where you can eat at any number of restaurant, buy groceries (Super Target and Publix are within an easy walk, and a Walmart Supercentre is a quick bus ride away). Down the street is an awesome teppenyaki restaurant called Kuboki (I think?) that has unbelievably good prices, and copious amounts of delicious food. We're not from the US and therefore aren't used to the staggering portion sizes that are available, so we would take our leftovers back to the room and use the handy fridge and micro to have a pretty good breakfast each day. Our only \"complaint\" would be that the breakfast was kind of lacking (two kinds of bagels, toast, and packaged honey buns along with coffee and juice, and bananas) but as I said, the fridge and microwave made up for that anyways. Considering we paid $20 a night for a free shuttle, free breakfast, and a clean, safe, quiet place to stay, I really can't complain. I wonder if a lot of the people reviewing this place brought any of their \"problems\" to the attention of the staff, or just waited until after their stay to complain? (Whether to ask for a discount after the fact, or just to write a negative review of the place). I'm almost sure that the staff I met would have been more than accomodating to any of these \"problems\". If I could give advice to a friend going, I would say, stay here, get the best of the best Disney pass available, with the water parks etc option, with the money you save, use the water parks and everything available to you at Disney and then come home to a great place to sleep and stay.

The beds were probably the worse we've ever experienced in a hotel and the room was sub standard. The continental breakfast the next morning consisted of packaged pastry and coffee or juice. There was no TV changer in room but was given one from front desk when requested. On a positive note the pool was nice and managed to get an hour of sun on the pool deck just before headin to the airport. Not recommended for a stay of more than one night. Rates are very competitive in the area and I'm sure one could fine better deals even for an overnight.

Thankfully however, it is located in what we affectionately referred to as Crack City. The Western is indeed located in a very 'average' part of town and I don't imagine most tourists would even know of it's existence as few would have reason to venture down this part of Freemont Street. In fact the only 'experience' we got around this part of town was a never ending barrage of aggressive beggars and police arrests which at first were a novelty in themselves but after the fifth time, you see one crack addict getting arrested, you've seen them all. Grunge is the first word that springs to mind when entering this casino, I have never stayed at the hotel so it would be unfair to assume that the rooms replicate the squalor of the gaming area. Despite the lack of any fan fair this is actually a great place to idle a few hours away. The penny slot machines are fairly loose so your dollars go alot further that they would in any of the other casinos. If Las Vegas has the equivialent to an elephants graveyard this is it. Almost everything appears old and dirty, like even the furniture has come here to die.In particular is it's clientel who appear to be border line homeless alcoholics, the locals will be the ones who are hitting you up for money. The cocktail waitresses (that is if you regard a 40 oz can of beer as a cocktail) all looked like they had lived very hard lives, perhaps they had once been showgirls back in the good old days because all of them looked as though they had once been very attractive at one time. As I am hardly a Greek Adonis myself, mere shallow observations such as these are trivial as the staff were generally freindly and that's what counts. We even placed a tentative bet on which of the two bums would come off best in a knife fight that was about to erupt over a slot machine. What can I say, we just got caught up in the gambling ambience of it all, it is Vegas after all. If you have an hour or so up your sleeve you should turn right instead of left at Freemont and walk a few blocks down to the Western. It is as far removed from the glitz and glamour of the new monstrosities as one could imagine which is exactly what gives it it's charm.

Because I wanted to stretch my bankroll, I probably stayed at the Western a total of 200 nights in my life. The Western used to have a fixed rate (about $25) which didnt jump up on weekends. So I often stayed here on the weekends and then 'upgraded' to The Gold Spike during the week for the same price. My first week here I couldnt believe it was the same town with the pirate shows, volcanoes and white tigers... I was so intrigued at the people and lifestyles, and was so curious as to how these people existed. And how they got into the situation they were in. These are the people who are 1 step above homeless. Some were mentally ill, and most of the others looked like they were on the verge of being mentally ill. I remember my first time playing black jack there. The chips were so worn, you could barely make out the name on them. Although most people were using the dollar slot coins, because the table minimum is only a dollar. I noticed a couple of the old guys there had their chips and coins in their hands. I asked them why dont they just stack them on the table in front of them. They looked at me like I was nuts and said, 'Well, what if someone grabs them and runs off with them?' I said, how often does that happen? The dealer told me about twice a week. The BJ tables we were on were about 15 feet from a big metal roll up door that emptied out to Freemont St. The roulette wheel has 10 cent chips. I've never seen that at any casino anywhere. The dealers dont generally deal it , and make a mistake about every other hand if anyone at the table is betting more than a few chips. Also, winning corner and street bets frequently get swept up with the losers after the dealer marks the number. Beers are a dollar, but free if you are playing. Ive never seen a casino that served cans of beer until I came here. The most dangerous area in the whole casino is the restaurant. The menu is all hand written in magic markers. I mean, its been like that for years. How much would it cost to have a regular sign? And it would look so much better. The food is so bad, I wouldnt eat there if I was starving. I disreguarded the warning bells going off in my head as I bellied up to the counter. I thought, how bad could it be? Well, I found out later that night. And the next day. The slot machines are some of the oldest you will find in Las Vegas. They actually have penny machines which spit out pennies. Can you imagine being the slot mechanic who has to constantly keep going over to get the people's jammed penny back? And they will complain and wait over a penny. The rooms are kind of clean but they have a funny smell which is a result of the disinfectant they use. Its not pleasant but I got used to it. The odds of your toilet and shower both working properly are about 50%. Better odds than the penny machines for sure. If you ever make the trip down here, be careful walking the nearby streets after dark, and keep your wallet close to you.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot in Kansas anymore Toto\u201d", "Author": "chitowngambler", "ReviewID": "UR4246173", "Content": "At the WESTERN, we are not in Kansas any more Toto, nor are we on the Fremont Street Experience and certainly not on the Strip. Did not stay there but was lured from the Experience by the impossibly bad reviews here at TRIPADVISOR and my possibly misplaced sense of adventure. I admit the large $1.00 draft beer had a hand in my return visit. I ventured there as a balance to the Strip scene, the Monte Carlo, etc. Boy, there is more than a few miles between those two. Homework Assignment: Listen to J. Tull's \"Aqualung\" and the Dead's \"Wharf Rat\" and G. Brooks \"Friends in Low Places\" maybe J. Buffet's \"Let's get Drunk\" to prep. The casino is a CICO (Coins In - Coins Out) place. No fancy paper tickets here. Remember that machine that you first played on 20 years ago, well it came to the Western to die. No carpet either, just wood plank floors, but at least they are swept and may have been cleaner than some of the carpeted places nearby. Security was active but I was not bothered by anyone there. Plenty is said here about the clients and most is true, to be kind, they were in a lower tax bracket and some may not have paid taxes at all. One step above the street but at least most have a room somewhere. Generally a friendly place, buy someone a dollar draft and learn enough to write a book or at least a good blues song. How the guys make their money, I have no idea, getting diability, day labour or some menial job? Whatever it is, it was someboby else's fault they have to work there. Generally the place and the patrons have a well worn look. How some of the ladies make their money, I can only guess, my sense of adventure has its limits. A guy told me he was drinking because he was on disability I asked what the disability was and he said he was an alcoholic. I had planned to go that far east on Fremont so I bought clothes to blend in, old jeans, a plaid shirt with a tee shirt and gymshoes are the norm. Leave the tux on the Strip. I brought a wad of singles and a few fives to spend. Big emergency bills stashed in my sock. I was not worried about the locals. They are more scavengers than predators. Not a place for a lady on her own though. Not a place to flash any bill over a five. Leave nothing at the bar when you pee because nothing wil be there when you return. Leave the area before dark before it really gets strange, or not, your choice. Also of interest is the Atomic Bar a few doors east. You have got to love a bar where you have to get buzzed in the door. The local source for vodka in small plastic bottles. If you go, be sure to ask if Michele is working at that time, she is a real hoot. The owner may even be there, he has been in Las Vegas since the atomic tests, hence the name.

There must have been 5,000 cigarette burns on the toilet paper holder. The trash was full and the sinks dirty. They even had a cheap perfume dispenser for a quarter.(can't imagine what that would smell like). As we were leaving we noticed the casino's players slot card reward's booth. I laughed so hard that I had tears running down my face. For a thousand points you could receive a paper towel holder. They even had the paper towels on it so you knew what is was. Better than that you could win a crock pot. I guess you had to see it to believe it. My son took a picture and they told us to leave. I would advise staying away from this creepy place.

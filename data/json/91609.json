You won't likely do better than here. While the rooms are typically Courtyard and the exercise room is small (though with an assortment of machines), this hotel has several things to its credit. The lobby is modern and a great social meeting place - very comfortable. The wine selection is great and the food good. I LOVED the Asian chicken salad enough to order it a second night! But what I most appreciated was the entire staff and their friendly attitude. Most notably Nick, who went out of his way to secure me a good room and Chrissy, who couldn't have been more service-oriented at the bistro. Even the shuttle driver was fun - as well as efficient.

The breakfast here in my opinion is phenomenal! All you can eat and drink and spread out on a counter so no one's in anyone else's way in the early morning! We always stay here for a night before our plane takes off to make it easier to get to the airport on-time as they have a free airport shuttle that picks up on the hour every hour.

The staff made me feel welcome the moment I set foot in the lobby. I was quickly given my room key (404) within less than 1 minute. Finding the elevator took me a bit longer as the directions was not obvious. The hallway lighting is a bit darker than I would have liked but the room brightness more than made it up. The room is clean, airy and new. The king bed is using the new Courtyard bed package which has a layer of Temturpedic-type memory foam. I was a bit hesitant at first as I like my bed a bit on the firm side but after one night on it, I felt refreshed. One brownie point for the new Courtyard bed. Rounding out the room is the usual work-desk, TV and a sofa with a coffee table, all in brand new condition. The bathroom is roomy with the separate lavatory outside of the bathroom. The amenities is also seems to be updated from the old Courtyard that I have remembered (have not been in a Courtyard for a while). The hotel is a square building with an internal courtyard in the middle which is nicely kept and would make a good place to have an afternoon tea. Yes, it is that nice. The pool occupied in the one of the wing of the building with good view out to the courtyard. The shocker came when I went to the front-desk and ask for some detergent and fabric softener for my dirty laundry. They are given free of charge. Now, I am used to be charged for an arm and a leg for these things in other hotel and so shocked I walked away without asking for some coins for the machines. Another brownie point. This Courtyard is about 3 minutes away from the airport but noise control was very good. You have more to worry from the box AC than noise from the planes outside. I had an early flight the next morning at 6:00AM and the earliest shuttle was at 5AM. I was a bit worry as the shuttle seems to be shared between other Marriott properties in the areas and I was afraid that it would be long if it was going to make the round. However, the shuttle went straight to the airport once everyone at the Courtyard was in, YMMV. All in all, I was very impressed by this Courtyard.

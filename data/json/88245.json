Rachel used to bake cookies in the evening which were delicious. One day she has to make it twice as there was so much demand. Next time when I go I will not stay any other place but here. Last day we also did our laundry as they have coin laundry facility. I felt as if I was at home. Thanks to hotel staff who made our vacation a grand success.

Orlando is one of our favourite holiday destinations and we have stayed in various areas and chosen different types of accommodation. We find International drive the best choice for location as you can park up and walk to the bars and restaurants in the evenings and you are just a short drive from the attractions. The Hampton Inn Orlando Convention Centre Hotel is perfectly positioned away from the main road but a quick 2 min stroll through a well lit car park to International drive. Nearby is Millers Ale House, Bahama Breeze and some other great restaurants in the Shopping Centre next door. This is a functional hotel and as a base, it was perfect if however you plan to spend time at the hotel I think you should consider other options. As a family, our Orlando holiday itinerary is always packed so this hotel suited our purpose. The rooms themselves were small and chintzy but very clean with a great shower. We also made use of the fridge, LCD TV, Iron & ironing board. This hotel includes breakfast, which was always a good spread, and there was always tea and coffee available all day and a gorgeous smell of cookies always wafted over from reception. The staff were a credit to this hotel, always smiling and very happy .Our favourites were the husband and wife team that looked after the breakfast area in the morning. Fantastic way to start the day! Facilities that we used were the washer/Dryers this saved me so much time when we got home. Computer/internet access that was available in Reception enabled the boys to keep in touch with friends and helped us to check in to our flights home. We did not use the pool or workout facilities. Reading all the reviews and posts helped me plan our holidays so I have decided to catch up and post some of my own experiences ..Enjoy your holiday if you choose this hotel you will be getting great value for money.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service & Accommodations\u201d", "Author": "Jeff M", "ReviewID": "UR126457512", "Content": "I stayed for 2 nights.

Staff is very friendly and the Hotel Manager is there in the morning to great people which is very nice. I would recommend this hotel to everybody staying in Orlando. Seaworld/discovery cove, but also Universal are only 15 minutes away as are the Disney parks. The convention center is around the corner which means that the hotel will be full when there's a big convention, but the pool is as good as empty for the holiday people.

As a frequent user of Hampton Inns for family trips I knew about what to expect, but this one exceeded my expectations. The location is ideal. The hotel is on Universal Drive, which is very quiet, but if you walk out the back door and through the parking lot, it's only about 100 yards to International Drive and lots of restaurants. So, it is out of the heavy tourist traffic but has easy access to all amenities. The quiet interior of the hotel reflects its off-the-beaten-track location. The only noise issue was the intermittent humming of the air conditioner in the room, which I handled by running only the fan at night. My room was standard Hampton - clean, comfortable. The breakfast room is large and pleasant with lots of tables and easily accommodated a mix of business and family guests. The pool area is very nicely isolated from it's surroundings and shaded on both ends by palm trees - a great place to sit and read a book or newspaper if you are not going for a swim. The staff are very attentive, both at the front desk and in the morning in the breakfast room. If I return to Orlando, this is where I will stay. It is interesting that this is the only time I have been asked by a front desk at checkout to send a review to TripAdvisor - perhaps an indication of their level of confidence in the good service they are providing. The only thing I would add at this hotel, if I had a magic wand, would be an in-room safe. The hotel naturally denies responsibility for loss of personal items and recommends storing valuables in a safe deposit box at the front desk - I did not use that service so I can't comment on how much that can accommodate, size-wise - e.g., laptop computers. However, considering the multitude of expensive electronic gadgets we carry with us these days, it would be much more convenient to store them in a room safe than stopping at the front desk each time we come and go to deposit and retrieve them. Most hotels that I stay at are equipped with small in-room safes large enough to hold a laptop and various other electronic accessories.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice stay\u201d", "Author": "Mike_South_Florida", "ReviewID": "UR120801247", "Content": "This is a nice hotel that is conveniently located just off International Drive.

Clean in general and kept that way with daily maid service. Location is at the better end of i-drive and a short walk through the parking lot brings you out at Bahama Breeze dominos etc Wallgreens just round the corner too. Desk staff are very helpful and there are a limited number of safety deposit boxes behind reception (which you need unfortunately). Which leads me to my main negative, theft by hotel staff/maids. We were hugely disappointed on our last day when a mobile phone was stolen from our bedside cabinet during the room being cleaned. I fear it was more than coincidence that the item was stolen on our last morning, leaving us very little time to do anything about it, we called the police but they couldn't confirm a time to meet us and we had to be at the airport. It really left a bad taste in our mouths, of what had been our favorite Orlando hotel. Desk staff were apologetic but couldn't or didn't really help in anyway, apart from investigating the matter, but again we were leaving for the airport that day. We received no apology or correspondence from the hotel with regards to any outcome.

Free paper at your door most mornings and a free breakfast every day with at least 3 cooked items and two waffle makers for guests to use. Add to this juice and fresh fruit and all day fresh coffee and its perfect. There is even a to-go breakfast bag for those in a rush. The hotel does get busy with convention people but that is to be expected with the centre being just minutes away. The hotel is just steps away from the quiet end of International Drive, and near Pointe Orlando and the I-Ride Trolly. Some of the guest rooms have fridge and microwave but problably have to ask for these well in advance. There is a little gym and also a small laundry for guest use. About $1.50 ish per machine.

It was clean enough, though it clearly wasnt big enough for 2 adults and 2 x 13 year old boys so they ended up sleeping on the floor for 7 days, something that they were happy to do, even if i wasnt so comfortable with it.

Across the road and down a bit you have Houlihans which had great food then head back towards the hotel to Dave & Busters where the kids can play all night in the arcade for $50 while the adults sit and have a few beers and drinks at reasonable prices whilst watching plenty of US Sports or music.

There was no limit on what you ate. Our room was on the fifth floor and we did not suffer from any noise problems at all.

Anyway, I had never bothered to write any review. In Apr 2011, we stayed 1 week in this hotel. I felt I own applaud to it. In general, the hostel is the most recommended hotel I every stayed. The room is clean and spacey, staffs are friendly, etc. Here is some highlight. The location is convenient. If you have car, commute won't be an issue for you. If you don't, it's very easy to take the public transaction. iRide stop is on the left of the hotel. And it only takes 3 minutes to walk to the International street. You just need to go around the building and passing the parking lot to the International street. The detail instruction is, turn left immediately after the main entry. (Don't go to Universal street.), And turn left again. Basically, you're still on the hotel's parking lot. Just go straight to the backend of the hotel and continue. You will pass another parking lot then meet the International street. There are plenty of restaurants, entertainments and supermarkets in 5 minutes walking distance, like Wonder works, Stake house, Boston Lobster, Ming Court... My room is very quite maybe because it's far away to the street. Anyway, Universal street is not a busy street at all, so it's a big plus. The biggest highlight is the complimentary hot breakfast, which is the best I ever got. And it's even better than most paid breakfast from other hotels. There are 2 hot entries and they change everyday. For value, it's pretty good in my case but my case is special. My rate is the special rate so it may not account to you. Another special event was that the hotel waived one night fee for us. On the 2nd night of our stay, a group checked in late and they stayed in the same floor as us. There were energizing kids and loud people. They talked aloud in the hallway, they shut their door heavily and they run back and forth among rooms. So we complained to the front desk on the next morning. In other hotel, we maybe moved to other room. In this hotel, they waived that night for us when we checked out. The front desk told us that's their way to keep 100% satisfaction from guests. It sure wins mine. I gave 5 for everything except the room. There is no refrigerator in my room. The hotel booklet mentioned that a handful rooms have it and we didn't bother to ask since we don't want to change room.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "greenwich", "Title": "\u201cHampton Inn Convention Center is Perfect Location Near I-Drive\u201d", "Author": "wutsnext", "ReviewID": "UR105153126", "Content": "I have stayed at many of the hotels in Orlando including Disney & Universal hotels as well as several on I-Drive.

Millers Ale House, TGIFs, Bahama Breeze, Olive Garden, Friendlys, Subway, Dennys and Pizza Hut all within 5 minutes. Then Walgreens and the Pointe Plaza Mall with shops and more restaurants Hooters, Johnny Rockets, Canyon Grill, Tommy Bahama, etc. There are 2 mini golf courses either way and the I-Trolly. The hotels uses a car service for the airport which was excellent. You can also get a taxi to Universal Studios for $10 each way. The breakfast was quite surprising with fresh cut fruit, fresh fruit, yoqurt, cereal, muffins, bagels, pastries, waffles, eggs, bacon or sausage, juices, coffee, etc. More than enough choices and served 6am - 10am. The pool was also outstanding all day sun, which a lot of hotels nearby do not have, and always lounge chairs and umbrelled tables available. It is also open until 11:00pm.

Was a very short walk to restaurants and a few shops on International Drive. 15 minutes walk would get you to the main hub of International Drive, but I personally liked the quieter atmosphere of our location. Though quieter, there was plenty of choice of restaurant and shops with Pointe Orlando Mall just 5 minutes walk. The Hotel itself was well kept and reasonably clean (there seem to be a lot of spillages in the hallways - but still acceptable). The maid comes every day and replaces towels and sheets where needed, our room was always left looking really nice. There are ice machines and drink vending machines on every floor, a launderette and a small gym. Reception also sell essentials as well as crisps and snacks. The pool is quire small but we quite enjoyed our time sitting around it having a swim - they provide pool towels too. Anything we asked for at reception was attended to in a courteous and friendly way. It was a ten minute drive to Universal and about 20 minutes to Disney. Sea World is just down the road. The car park at the hotel is ample and there are a few trees to park under to prevent the extra hot steering wheel problem. In July it is very hot with temperature reaching 90+ F every day. We did have a few spots of rain here and there - but nothing to stop us enjoying ourselves.

We were a family travelling from the UK. Bad points:- We arrived at the Hampton Inn relieved we had actually made it as the whole trip looked to be in jeopardy due to the ash cloud air traffic closures which were being forcasted as we departed that weekend. I presented our documents to the duty manager, Alex. After reading the documents he started to say, hmmmm, we have a problem, \"we havent got a room for you for the first three nights of your stay\"! I asked why and was told that they had a lot of convention attendees booked in. I pointed out that my booking had been made in February, I had emailed the hotel twice to confirm different things, in fact the last email communication was on the 11th May and no problem was notified to me then. He apologised and said we were booked in at the Wyndham and they would be picking up the bill, how generous. I pointed out that the Hampton rate included breakfast and free wifi, did the Wyndham include this? A quick phone call and the answer was no! No offer was made to include for these important to us items. I again said this just wasn't good enough but it was a catch 22, they said they had no rooms so what could we do? As a gesture of goodwill Alex said we could choose something from the sweet shop when we booked in, we were insulted by this and finally headed off to the Wyndham very angry and frustrated. It appears that the Hampton Inn is happy to move a family to accomodate convention attendees. The next day I emailed the hotel managers to complain. When I managed to log on again there was a reply and an apology with the offer of two interconnecting rooms when we booked in. There was also the offer to pick up the cost of breakfast and internet access at the Wyndham, but due to the lack of internet access we were unable to take advantage of this as we received it too late. A message to us at the Wyndham would have been far more sensible, it's not like they didn't know where we were. On the 27th May we received an email from a Guest Assistance Specialist of the Hilton Hotels Corporation with the following \"Please allow us three business days to review and resolve this matter\" I'm typing this on 16th June and still haven't received any response. Good points:- When we finally checked in we were given two interconnecting rooms, one with a fridge. The rooms were lovely, nicely furnished and very comfortable. The air conditioning is a bit noisy but no worse than lots of places we've stayed ( the best air con we had was at the Royal Pacific Resort which has a centralised system so no noise). Housekeeping kept our rooms nice and provided clean towels when necessary. The wifi in the room was perfectly adequate. In general the hotel is very nice, the lobby and common areas are all of a good quality and nicely maintained. Breakfast consisted of cereals, fruit, bread, rolls etc, and had two hot items per day ie eggs and sausage/burger. This was fine for us and we used it all the days we were there. Coffee etc is available 24 hours a day. The swimming pool is small but nice, and was never crowded all the time we were there. It also gets the sun for the best part of the day as there are no other hotels or buildings in front of it. If you want a hotel rather than a motel then the Hampton should be considered, and this was one of the reasons we chose to stay there, its in a great location, quieter than internation drive and only a minute away from it.

Noting that we were on the top (7th) floor, it was a very quiet stay which was great. We were able to sleep without interruption, making for easier days touring around Orlando. There's no fee for parking, so we had our own vehicle and were able to drive to multiple areas within 15 minutes, including Prime Outlets, Florida Premium Outlets, Millenia Mall, as well as some Disney side attractions (such as Winter Summerland golf). Most guests appeared to be there for the Convention Center (about a mile away) or the Theme Parks. Both are fairly easy from this location, and a sub-$100 price is hard to beat. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions, including getting a refrigerator brought to our room. The breakfast in the morning is complimentary and very good.

On arrival we checked in and went to our room, to find it was a double, however after asking reception for a king room they moved us once a king became available which was only after 2 nights. Reception staff are friendly and very helpful. The room itself was ideal with one huge bed, flat screen telly, and shower and bath, the shower is excellent. Tea and coffe making facilities are available in the room, however we found it quicker to pop to reception and get one from there as they are ready to pour.

Breakfast is included, and you have the choice of ceral, pastries, juices, waffles, a selection of 2 hot dishes which change every day or fruit. We stayed at the hotel to do Disney and Universal. There ae no free shuttles from the hotel, we found out that for a round trip to Disney it was $16 each and for Universal and Sea World I think it was around $9 each, which if you were going a few tmes would add up. We decided to get tickets for the I Trolley, for two weeks for the pair of us it came to $32 which is about \u00c2\u00a324, and is ideal, use it as many times as you want in that fortnight, and it saved us loads. There are plenty of stops outside the hotel, and the I Trolley will take you directly to Sea World and Aquatica. For Universal it will drop you off outside and its a 10 minute walk into the parks. For Disney you will have to transfer to a Lynx bus, that is $2 per person for where ever you want to go, and you get free transfers, so is ideal. The bus service is very punctual and usually pretty quiet. The hotel itself is located between International Drive and Universal Boulivard, it is quiet and a short walk to loads of restaurants and clubs on the I Drive, but at night there is no noise from any of these places. USA today is left outside the door every week day morning, if you need a safe there are none in the rooms, they will allocate you one in a room behind reception free of charge.

The hotel itself is more aimed at adult holiday makers and even though we had ordered a cot they were unable to provide one. They recitified this by making a small bed on the floor for our 2 year old and it was great how they did this. It made him feel very special. The room was big enough for our needs on the holiday as we found that the rooms were only used for a base. The hotel is not in I-Drive but it's location is better because it is close enough to the hustle and bustle of I-Drive (several mini-golf courses as well as restaurants, pubs and shops).

We were offered another hotel up I-Drive but turned it down and were offered this one whose location appealed to us much more and thus avoiding the tourist traffic I-Drive brings so we picked it not knowing what it was like. After checking here we were pleasantly surprised at its rating and having returned from our hols can confirm we had a delightful stay there. Its not the Ritz or Savoy but its more than adequate for a couple of weeks visiting the parks especially for the money. We found it's location perfect, near Universal and Seaworld, not too far from Disney and provided there were no big conventions at the centre (happened just once while we were there and getting past was a bit of a nightmare) then there was no traffic until you reached the I-4. Our original hotel did offer a fridge but only some rooms here have them, we did request one with the travel agent but the request wasn't passed on and our room didn't have one (it was a decent sized room and didn't look bad btw if you do get one). Unusually for us we returned to reception and asked if we could have another room, they weren't sure if they could accommodate us but the manager had a look and did find us a room and switched us without any extra charge. It was a bigger room overlooking the pool with a nice bright bathroom and big mirror as well as a decent size fridge and a microwave. The bathroom also had a small coffee maker with tea bags and coffee inserts but we found taking a couple of hot choc sachets from downstairs handy! There was also a hairdryer and iron. USA Today was delivered to your room Mon-Fri and maid service was fine. If you manage to get a room overlooking the pool then you have an added bonus of being able to see the Seaworld fireworks in the distance every night! Breakfast ran from 6am til 10am and for once there were enough chairs and tables to go round no matter what time we got there! There was always plenty available even if you came down later on and for days when you just want to get going they had bags with water, muffin, cereal bar and an apple ready to go on reception. Staff were friendly and always said hello. Breakfast selection was plentiful but a bit more of a variety wouldn't have gone amiss with the hot food. There are two hot items on offer but one was almost always an egg and usually sausage or sometimes ham. There was always bread (and toaster), biscuits, muffins, danish, bagels, cereal and fruit but it we missed the waffle maker we had in a previous hotel (although it was a hot item one day). In addition there was coffee (regular and decaf), tea, water, fruit juice and milk. If you found yourself in the hotel in the afternoon then cookies could sometimes be found on the front desk. The hot drinks were available for free in the breakfast area all day but sometimes did run out (they keep extra stock in the cupboard underneath if you're desperate!). We didn't use the pool or gym so can't comment. Overall it was the best hotel we've stayed in for an Orlando holiday and doubt we would go to another provided we had a room with fridge although if you are only staying a few days then this probably wouldn't bother you.

The walls seemed to be very thin and we could hear the pipes creaking. The hotel does not offer free shuttles to any of the parks.

We were very disappointed. It was trouble right from checking in. We had booked a non-smoking room and when we entered our room it reeked of smoke. We immediately returned to the front desk and requested to move. The front desk attendant turned to one of the housekeepers and rudely exclaimed - they say (room #) smells of smoke (the tone obviously implied that we were lying or crazy) . Then my friend and I both got stuck in the elevator for at least 10 minutes (2 separate times). But the worst part was that they had decided to have all the rooms carpets steam-cleaned on the second day of our stay. We were informed of this by a letter being pushed under our door - basically saying we needed to be out of our rooms all day. When I inquired if we would be getting a discount on our rooms as we had paid for access to them all day we were tired and wanted to just lounge around) the girl at the desk replied absolutely not - no discount. The letter did say if you had a problem with the steamcleaning to make them aware of that - which we did (along with at least 10 other guests I heard complaining at the same time).I also asked if they would be safeguarding all of our effects as we didn't want to have to move things our into our car. The front desk agent said - \"Well someone from housekeeping should be in there. This did not reassure me as it did not sound convincing or reliable. Additonally, We had asked for a quiet room - no such luck - we had kids running and yelling in the hallway for a good part of the first night. We also found out that the free shuttle (advertised when we booked) to Universal was not free at all but $9.00 per person each way and donly ran a few times a day.Then the next morning I asked for a tea bag at breakfast - they had none. ( I don't think that was out of line. We had just come from a marvellous stay at the Hampton in West Palm Beach and were expecting something along the same lines. Instead we found this Hampton hotel to be a little worn and shabby, front desk staff condescending and not very helpful, and overcrowded. The only good thing was that they did honour the Hampton satisfaction guarantee and refund our first night due to all the problems. We moved 2 doors down to the Amerisuites which was being changed over to the Hyatt Park Place and what a difference - it was amazing and more of what we expected of the Hampton.

The maintenance person was friendly, cheerful and efficient and I appreciated that. After that, the light bulb on the desk burned out the first time I turned on the lamp, and then the lamp didn't work at all with a bulb from another place - I said to myself, I must be having a bit of bad luck, but no, I think they just don't have a regular maintenance check of items in the room.

The location of the hotel was perfect...just off I-drive so very quiet, yet within 2-3 minute walk of Bahama Breeze, TGIs, Cafe Tu Tu Tango and loads of other restaurants on I-drive...also 5 minute drive from Universal studios and Seaworld and maybe 10-15 from Disneyworld. And if you want to shop, it's a short drive to two great malls, the Florida Mall and the Mall at Millenia. The room we had was spacious, had a really comfortable bed, and was spotlessly clean...it was near the ice machine which was quite noisy when in use, but never disturbed us at night. The maid service was fantastic, keeping the room spotless all week. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, saying hi whenever we walked past the desk and giving great advice on local restaurants, entertainment etc. when asked. The hotel also has a small gym on the ground floor (which we didn't use), and an outdoor pool that was very clean and bigger than it looked on the website. The rate includes a buffet breakfast which is fairly basic, but has bread/toast, bagles, muffins, pastries, yogurts, fruit salad (mix of grapefruit and orange), as well as fruit juice, tea and coffee (coffee and tea available on every floor, 24/7 - coffee was drinkable but not fantastic, but then again it was free). There is also a hot item offered (rotates daily...on different days we saw french toast, waffles, eggs and bacon, breakfast sausage etc) but this never looked that appetising and we skipped it. When we fancied a full hot breakfast, we drove up the road to First Watch on Sand Lake Rd, which does great breakfast...\u00c2\u00a328 a night left us some spare change!

Have been to Orlando a number of times & have stayed in a few the budget type hotels (IMHO you spend so little time in your room in Orlando splashing out on an expensive hotel would be a waste of money), e.g Quality Inns International & Plaza, Best Western Plaza etc, and although I had no major issues with these, the one thing that always drove me mad were the cheap flowery bedspreads. So when I arrived at the Hampton Inn to be greeted by Crisp White Bed linens I was already in love. Bed linen aside, I found the room very comfortable & extremely quiet (one tip I will give though is to make sure you get a room away from the Ice Machines as they appear to be very noisy). The hotel was full while we were there but yet it never appeared crowded eg... every evening we went for a swim in the pool & it was like having our own private swimming pool.... even during the day it was never busy. Breakfast was a bonus as normally in the past we've had to pay for it. The location was excellent... just off International drive (2 min walk) & perfect for some of my favourite restaurants like Olive Garden & Bahama Breeze. Just some other Tips... although the Hampton Inn doesn't offer free shuttles to Universal & Seaworld like some other hotels..... the secret is that the hotels themselves don't actually provide these free shuttles but the flex tickets do.... so just find the nearest hotel with a free shuttle, ask them for the pick-up timetable (don't tell them that you are from another hotel) & just go there in the mornings. And finally.... the I Ride.... although it is a novelty at first.... I find it very time consuming & tedious after a while. In actual fact the Lynx buses travel the same routes & you get to your destination a lot quicker & alot less crowded (If you go to the Lynx website you can print off a timetable & they are normally very punctual). One particular issue that I have is that alot of guide books etc tell you that when going to Disney to get the I-Ride to Sea Harbour Drive & then from there get the Lynx 50 to Disney, when in actual fact you can get the Lynx 8 from International Drive & with that ticket you get a free transfer to the Lynx 50 (so instead of paying the I ride fare & the Lynx fare all you have to pay is the one lynx fare).

There is a small gym in the hotel and the pool is lovely and hardly anyone uses it. The only downside to the hotel is that there is no bar, however there is a little shop and TGI'S offer room service. We tried this once but the food wasn't very nice but most of the food places near the hotel will deliver to your room. For example Dominos is great and so cheap! The location is great aswel, you just walk through the car park and you are on international drive. Try Tony Romas for the best ribs and Magianos Italian is lovely. They do a lunch special which is soup and a pasta for $10!!! Ponderosa is also great for breakfast, especially if u have a family, it costs around $4 for all you can eat and the food isnt that bad. The shuttles from the hotel can be quite expensive if you are using them everyday but you can get the i-ride to most places for a dollar. There is loads more that I could write as the hotel really is a little gem.

There is also a free internet site by the reception area, which was always available. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The pool is small but clean, and complimentary towels are provided which was useful.

The only negative thing I can say is it wasn't very suiting for our rambunctious 10 yr old. He was wanting to be loud at the pool, in the halls and in the room and we were constantly saying shhh because it seemed the other guest were all business oriented or just older and more conservative. Meaning, for kids wanting to run around and just be kids, they will have to be a little more disciplined here. All and all though it was fantastic.

They were also knowledgable about restaurants in the area. Breakfast - The breakfast area is just off the lobby and nicely arranged. Even with the hotel full all three nights, we and other guests had no problem finding a table. The breakfast selections were good, like we have come to expect at other nice Hampton Inns, and included two hot items every day. These hot items were different each day of our stay, which was very thoughtful of management. The breakfast area had 2-3 staff people on duty every day keeping everything replenished and clean.

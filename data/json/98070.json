The lobby area is amazing - it is very spacious and has a unique feel. The service was very friendly. The room that I was in had been remodeled as well and seems impressive at first, but the longer you spend in the room the more it becomes apparent that this was an older room with fancy finishings. The bed was comfortable and the carpet was not sticky. The air conditioner was very noisy, but that turned out to be a benefit in my situation because it drowned out the smokers talking loudly outside the window. I had the A/C on full blast and it never got super cold, which wasn't a problem for my Feburary trip but may be an issue in a warmer month. The internet connection was slow everytime I tried it from around 5pm to 10pm. I was disappointed to see that breakfast was not complementary as it is with most choice hotel properties (it is in the onsite restaurant, for a charge of $5.99), but that was my fault for not noticing that when I booked the hotel. There is a gas station practically next door and it is near the airport, so this hotel suited my needs. Overall, I would probably stay here again if it was convienient to where I needed to be, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return to this property and would definately try other options in the area.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mobile, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff Great Rooms\u201d", "Author": "Funguy11", "ReviewID": "UR124526171", "Content": "I have seen this place change and them change some more....all for the good!

Although they may have renovated the check in area the rooms were tired and filthy. Upon check in which they couldn't get a room key to work we had to wait in a disgusting hallway for 45 minutes. The front desk said it was my fault until the security guard had the same issue. Once we got in the room with a master key the room was filthy. There were spots in the carpet, furniture and bed. No black light needed here. Also soap from previous guest was left in shower including their hair.

I have read many reviews of this hotel, most of them are not favorable when I first started checking into the possiblity of booking there. I have stayed twice and both times luck gave me the same room so I can't claim every room is perfect but both times this one was great. Many of the complaints were about not feeling safe here. I never was uncomfortable here. There was a security guard walking in the parking lot or at the door everytime I returned. As with anywhere even the Peabody you have to watch where you go and be alert in your surroundings, yes this neighborhood is not bright and busy but it was close to where I wanted to be. One of the trips was to spend time at Graceland during Elvis Week, It is maybe 5 mins from there in good traffic. During this week this hotel was hopping, there were shows there most of the day, there was also an exhibition conference of Elvis Memorbilia. It was not unsual to return at night to find a couple Elvis Tribute Artist in the Lobby waiting for their show and visiting with the fans. The hotel was going thru remodeling and I did see changes from the first trip this year to the second time but during my visits there wasn't any inconviences I experienced. It wasn't important to my comfort that some areas were being reorganized or painted and not yet finished. The price that I paid was excellent and I could overlook things that did not effect my safety or comfort directly. I have heard complaints about people who might have less that family oriented values and making money with them, at any hotel you never know what the next room is doing and or plotting behind their doors, I never saw anything like that on either time I stayed there. My room was next to the elevator so I wasn't having to walk down long hallways so my encounters might have been less than others. The staff was very friendly and I saw them go beyond just yes ma'am, no sir, if they could they tried to help you. Check in was quick, and when we asked if there was a fridge or microwave in the room, she wasn't sure and didn't know if there were any available to put in the room, it was a very busy week, but after sending someone to check and make sure the room was ready when they came back and spoke to her she was very happy to tell us there are those items in your room and it is ready. The staff were friendly with the guests if they saw them in the hallway. They offered a very affordable breakfast and lunch - I think they were buffets but I didn't eat at any of them but did not hear of any complaints. Yes there are things that need some work and from what I have heard there will be lots of upgrades coming soon, I hope that it doesn't put it out of the reach of the average person. I had a great week and enjoyed the stay. The room was big and spacious, the king size bed had good walking space around it, a sitting area with nice chair and ottoman, a large table/desk for laptop or other work space. The restroom also spacious and the hanging clothes area had an iron and ironing board and lots of room and there were plenty drawers for storage. I couldn't have asked for a better place to live for a week. We did not ask for room service during the week and because many of the people seemed to sleep later, the cleaning staff would be in the hall looking for the available rooms and once asked us as we left which room we were in and we told them we didn't need anything, we were told if we needed new towels to bring the old ones to the lobby or give to the cleaning staff for fresh ones. I did not see the pool but I know several people did use it and did not have a problem. The lounge in the lobby and a facility inside of Dad's Place which was being used for the shows were not open for service but there were plans after the remodeling to again open these. From my experience yes I would recommend this to anyone and if I can get a room and a good rate I will be back.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Clarion Hotel Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d98070-Reviews-Clarion_Hotel_Airport-Memphis_Tennessee.html", "Price": "$91 - $108*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1471 East Brooks Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Memphis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">38116</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "98070", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3f/f2/3ff23c2aedeb111bef78232f4e327e715large.jpg"}}

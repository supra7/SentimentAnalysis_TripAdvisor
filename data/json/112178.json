We found it relaxing, enjoyable, and definetly worth the trip. *Resort- The resort itself is large and easy to get around (once inside.... parking is a little difficult) There are many attractions within. You can tell rennovations have been made in certain parts of the buildings. Be aware, since it is such a large facility, a large ammount of walking is required! *Rooms- The rooms were comfortable, and had old charm. I hadn't noticed many of the blemishes pointed out by other on this site, considering we spent most of our day at the water park and once we returned, passed out due to exhaustion! Televions needed exchanging, orand a slightly bigger bathroom would have been nice. Overall, good rooms. Bed's comfortable, pillows AMAZING. *Oasis Water Park- Fun for all ages! We came around 10:45 unaware of the need to arrive early. However, a couple under a cabana had left for breakfast and we were able to snath the shaded area. The kids ran off, and we spent the entire day there. The water is excellent, and the lazy river's exceptional. Tip: If unable to find a lounging chair due to hortage, ask a staff member! *Food- Considering we were on a budget, we did not eat at all around the resort. Instead, for dinner we drove up the hill to a fun, western restaurant called Rustler's Roost. The slide into the dining area welcomes you, and the saw dust on the floor added to the effect. Don't be afraid to try Rattlesnake... tastes like chicken!:) *Extras- If you are on a lower level or have a bad view, some portions of the buildings have stairways to the roof. At the fall of dusk we went up one of the stairways and found not only a fabulous phoenix view, but lounging chairs! We ended up laying out for a while and enjoying the night temp and the scenic view of phoenix lights. -I have fabulous memories here, so don't be scared by some of the grumpy reviewers:) Hope you enjoy this resort as much as I did-", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort McMurray, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect For Small Groups\u201d", "Author": "EvanPorter", "ReviewID": "UR128194961", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Arizona Grand Resort for four nights. The friendliness and service was quite good, and most people were very approachable. Front desk service was very good as well. The good: there was something for everyone there. There are multiple pools and hot tubs on the resort, and the adult pool offers an area away from the hustle and bustle of the water park. The spa is great for relaxation as well. The entire resort was very safe feeling and very comfortable wherever I went. The not so good: The key cards for your room REALLY need to be updated. I had nothing but trouble with mine, and ended up making 4 or 5 trips back to the front desk just to get into my room. The housekeeping staff are on the job quite early, and in some cases were knocking on doors before 9 in the morning (I found this disturbing). I also had housekeeping just walk into my room without knocking at all. The resort offers a few different choices of restaurants, but I spent the most time in the \"lobby grill\". The food itself was great, but I found the staff had some \"weak\" servers. Sometimes I would be taken care of better than ever before, and other times I would have lengthy waits for any attention at all. I found this frustrating at times, and can even single out who was good and who was slacking. In addition, the room doors and outside walls do not offer much silence. I was awoken a few times by screaming children or even the sound of a suitcase being pulled across the stone walkways. Overall: It was a good experience. The atmosphere here is perfect for families or couples, but I wouldn't recommend it to singles, as there were virtually no other people here that were like me. 90% of the time, service is fantastic but there were one or two servers in the kitchen that need to be helped. Room quality was good, but the key cards desperately need to be updated to something a little more reliable. If you are going somewhere with the kids or your significant other, I highly recommend it.

The place is huge and has big pools, a big lazy river and water slides, stage and constant music on one side of the property. However, when a friend and I were in town on business, we decided to go to a small pool in a enclave near our room, and we were there no more than 15 minutes when a family of 4 kids jumped in the tiny pool splashing us and using water guns like they thought is was the water park area. There was another \"older\" couple there (like in their 30's) and the four of us couldn't believe the parents would allow this, being that we were there first. I think, even in Disneyland, adults (anyone over 30) needs a small haven, other than the hotel bar where we had to go after that incident. Why should we be holed up in the tiny, but nice ok enough room? After a few drinks, poured by one great bartender, we went down both of the 8-story drop water slides. If ya can't beat 'em join 'em!

After I booked a non-refundable reservation two months in advance, several negative reviews started popping up and I was beginning to panic. I figured there's no way out of it, so I may as well make the best of the situation. The moment we arrived, we were greeted at our car by the concierge who welcomed us and pointed us to the check-in desk. After our check-in, the concierge drove a golf cart leading us to a parking spot close to our room. He took in our bags and helped us get oriented to everything offered at the resort, so customer service was extraordinary upon check-in. Perhaps we were there during a slow week, but we had no trouble finding chairs after the waterpark had opened. Eating at the Oasis Restaurant was way expensive though - I paid $44 for a cheeseburger, hot dog, chicken wrap, fries, and three small drinks. Ouch. My kids enjoyed the dive-in movie, although it was the same movie each night we went. The food overall at the resort was pricy. We ate off the property for the majority of our meals. There's a Waffle House just on the other side of I-10 and an In 'n' Out Burger south of the resort on the Ray Road exit in Chandler just a short drive away. We stocked up on breakfast items and snacks from a grocery store to help save money. Our room was in the Sedona building, room 255. It had a king size bed and a pull out sofa bed which my son used. He had no complaints about it. The bathroom was very big. Housekeeping did a great job of tidying up and changing our towels each day. Our stay was overall very quiet with the exception of several people congregating in front of our door late one night. As a single mom, I felt safe at the resort and my kids felt that there was plenty to do and hold their attention (ages 13 and 9.) We enjoyed walking around the beautiful grounds and exploring the area. As many have mentioned in their reviews, the tv's are dated but my kids never once complained. We weren't on vacation to watch tv, but I understand that a flat screen is a nice touch. The $40/day resort fee was a tough pill to swallow when you don't use the services each day. I was disheartened to read another reviewer say that locals got in by claiming they lost their wrist bands. There definitely needs to be better attention to detail with that because the rest of us staying there paid our dues to take advantage of the facilities. Lastly, I would like to see more cleaning throughout the day at the waterpark. By late afternoon there was garbage scattered around and the wind would blow dead tree leaves and blossoms into the pools and lazy river making it yucky. And the stairwell where you had to wait to go down the waterslide pooled up with murky yellow/brown water that you had to stand in because there wasn't a drain. Gross.

We travelled with our 3 kids (ages 11,11 and 13). The reason we picked this hotel was because of the Oasis Waterpark. The resort is nicely located, easy access to restraunts and shopping. When we arrived the employee at the check-in desk wasn't as friendly as we expected and was not clear to where our room was located. We ended up finding it on our own. We booked the Resort Queen Suite which was big enough for our family. The only down side about the room is that the bathroom sink is located on the outside of the bathroom that is adjoined to the bedroom. The bathroom itself was a bit small but our family of 5 managed pretty well. Housekeeping did a pretty good job cleaning the room everyday. Now one thing I have to point out is that some room are actually adjoined by a door. When we arrived the door that adjoined our room with the one next door was actually unlocked. Thankfully the next door room was empty and we locked the door. For some families this may be a safety concern so if you stay at this hotel double check that the door that adjoins your room with the room next door is locked. Overall our stay was pleasent the concierge staff were espescially friendly and the waterpark is a nice addition. If you're family is looking for a cheap affordable place to stay in Phoenix this in not the hotel for you. For our stay of 4 nights we ended up spending about $1000 just to book this hotel not including meals. There are lots of other hotels that offer a great rate plus breakfast.

AAA missed the mark on this one...\u201d", "Author": "wendypel", "ReviewID": "UR127822317", "Content": "In a continual quest for the resort that can meet our 11 twin boys' expectation of fun and our need for comfort with a splash of luxury, we selected the Arizona Grand Resort because of it's water park and 4 diamond rating. It turned out to be a disappointment for all. Here are my few pros and many cons: The Room: Pro: We stayed in a Deluxe Queen Suite and had paid to be in a building near the waterpark. The room was large enough for the 4 of us. The beds were comfortable and the amenities were nice. Con: The carpet was wet...we are hoping it was just cleaned? I guess we can take comfort in the fact that they do clean the carpets, but it gave the room a really musty smell and a general sense of unease. The bathroom door was warped and required a contortionist move to close it. The bathroom was extremely small and dark. The TVs were from last century and very small. The sofa bed could hardly be called a bed - the mattress was so thin - and squeaked all night. The Water Park & Pools: Pro: They have a water park and they have lots of pools. Cons: Our boys were bored with the waterpark in under an hour - and my kids love water parks. Maybe if you have younger kids - and/or less adventurous kids - it might work for you? You have to wear a bracelet to get into the park...it's a little annoying as an adult. All the reviews are right that there are not enough chairs. And we found that was more the case at the pools away from the park. For a 4 diamond resort, the pool towels are small, thin and simply awful. Food & Beverage: Pros: N/A Cons: Other than an order of fries, we never ate at the hotel...not for lack of trying. The wait staff at the park walked by us no less than a dozen times and never once asked if we wanted anything. The ice cream machine at the park was broken. The restaurants at the hotel were so far away from our room (and 4 Diamond expensive) that we would have needed to take our car anyway, so we went out for dinner. We did attempt to catch lunch before our flight at the Lobby Grill - at 11:00 when they said they were open for lunch - but were told we had to wait until all the breakfast guests had finished before she could even seat us. We left. Other annoyances: 1) The hotel staff uses loud gas-powered golf carts to get around. They beep when in reverse. The staff drives them on the paths in front of the guest rooms - until late at night. 2) A plus for some, but an annoyance for us, they have a kiddie DJ in the waterpark that goes from 6 - 8 and the volume is loud. If you have pre-tween or tween girls, this is probably a big hit, but it was a primary reason we fled the hotel for several hours. 3) The whole place just seemed tired. My husband commented that the place needs a good pressure wash. 4) There always seemed to be housekeeping staff in the halls (who had a fabulous knack for leaving their carts blocking passage), but there also seemed to always be dirty dishes and linens in the halls. 5) It is right off the freeway - which is convenient, I guess, but it really doesn't give you the sense that you are \"getting away from it all.\" So, our quest for the ideal vacation resort continues. I guess I am most baffled by how this place has a 4 diamond rating.

We were surprised that the package only came with four water park bracelets and that there would be an additional charge for the fifth bracelet. Thankfully, one of the front desk staff took care of us and simply gave us the fifth bracelet for the water park. I think that if the resort allows you took book rooms with five, you should expect the same number of bracelets for the water park. Our room could have used a tv upgrade.

The park opens at 10:00 and by 10:15 there is not a single chair available. People begin lining up at 8:30 am.

We ended up sitting on the bar chairs until something cleared up. We asked for more chairs and they said they did not have any. The water park is fun, although the wave pool had very weak waves in it. Fun lazy river, could use better cleaning as there was a lot of debris from the trees in it. The room was spacious. They had the only old school TV's left in the country and ours kept turning itself off. Not to mention they are small. The beds were comfortable, but the pillows were the worst I have slept on. They fold over on themselves. The phone keys looked like they had not been cleaned for a couple years, yuck. Despite all that, the kids did have fun. I don't think we'd go back.

The suite was very tastefully decorated in a modern, fresh taupe and cream palette with wicker accents. It was very clean with the exception of a couple grease marks on the carpet from a previous occupant's wheeled suitcase. The suite contained a bedroom with two queen beds, a built-in closet, a TV, and the bathroom. The bathroom was TINY (the door barely cleared the toilet) with the sink and granite make-up counter/mirror out in the bedroom area. I personally dislike this design due to lack of privacy for the person getting ready. Plus, turning on the lights above the make-up counter to see wakes up anyone still sleeping. The beds were comfy with pretty white linens encasing a feather comforter. We had four pillows per bed although they were tiny (about 1/2 the size of a normal bed pillow). The bath towels were thick and fluffy. There is a french door in the bedroom, with very nice \"black out\" drapes, leading out to a small balcony that is handy for hanging wet swimsuits to dry. The bedroom was separated with a door from a living room that contained a sleeper sofa desk/table with chairs, another TV, and a mirrored wet bar area with a second small sink and refrigerator (no microwave). The set-up was perfect for our two kids to stay up watching TV without disturbing us while we slept. There was a game controller with the TV, but renting the GameCube and the games were extra $$$. The suite was very quiet -- we didn't hear any other hotel guests during our stay. Without fail, the maid service came to spread up the beds and replace the towels no later than 4:00pm each day (remember to leave them a tip when you check out!) Our suite overlooked one of the two \"family\" pools with a jacuzzi that were open from 10-10. These pools were rarely full/loud since The Oasis water park was only a 2 minute walk through the building. Guests enter water park through the gift shop, instead of the large iron gates, which I found kind of odd. The gift shop is also where you switch out your broken wrist band from the day before for a new one (unless you can tolerate leaving it on from one day to the next). As other reviewers mentioned, there is a long line that starts queing outside the gift shop a good half hour before the park opens. The Oasis contains a lazy river and the two 8-story water slides plus a large sun-bathing lounge area (plus two canopies for shade lovers). This area is called the \"island\" and is open from 10-6. The rest of the waterpark contained the zero-depth entry wave pool, jacuzzi, a kid pool (with basketball hoop), a toddler pool, a splash pad, the DJ stage, the food service station, and a large \"tiki\" style bar plus plenty of loungers. This area is open from 10-8. The DJ begins his kid-oriented schtick each night at 6:00. I understand there are movies shown at dusk, although we didn't participate. During our visit to The Oasis, we were always able to get enough pool towels and lounge chairs, although the loungers were due to be pressure-washed. The roving servers for food/drink orders and people to bus the cups/plates get stretched a bit thin at certain times of day depending on the size of the crowd. We ate at the pool-side buffet (near the wave pool) for dinner one night. The food was plentiful and good ($17 adult; $10 per child), although the one-trip rule bothered a few guests in our party. Tips: 1) The resort lobby is the third exit around the traffic circle; the signage needs improving. The resort also has Villas (privately owned condos), a conference center, and a golf course, so it's easy to get lost when trying to find where to check in. 2) The Marketplace off the hotel lobby serves Starbucks and pastries for breakfast if you don't want to go to the hotel restaurant. 3) The lobby is gorgeous with outdoor seating around firepits -- perfect for an evening glass of wine. 4) The front door staff are happy to drive guests to various parts of the resort, including to the Rustler's Roost restaurant (a must see). Also consider visiting Aunt Chilupa's for margarita's -- it's a short walk on a lighted path from the hotel. 5) The Tempe Mills mall is about 5 minutes away -- kind of teen place with GameWorks (huge video arcade) and stores that appeal to the younger set, but it also is where the Sea Life Aquarium is located.

The main reason I looked at this hotel was the Oasis Water Park. Had heard good reviews. I booked several weeks ahead and was confirmed for a room with 2 queens beds (1 bed rm, 1 bath, with living rm area). At check-in I was told we were to be up-graded to a suite at no extra cost, but there was only 1 king bed, but also a fold out couch in the living room. This was because they were full and had run out of the type of room I had reserved. I took the up-grade and it worked, but I really booked this for the 2 queen beds, and was not too happy about the condition of the fold out couch. Felt bad for my grandson sleeping on the thin excuse for a mattress, and moving furniture and folding out the couch each night was not what I wanted. The hotel also has an extra fee for wifi and use of the water park, which is $40 a day on top of the room cost, and then taxes on top of it all. The wifi, at least in our room was very poor, with the connection fading in and out every few minutes (or seconds). The water park was filled with people and it was a race to just get a chair to sit in, much less two chairs together. The water temp was colder then I would have liked, but it is a fun park for kids. The hotel is pretty, with well keep grounds and the rooms are nice. King bed was soft, bathroom was modern and huge. All the employees were super nice and helpful and they get an A++.

The rooms were outdated, but not unclean. However I had issues with general room maintenance. E.g. Toilet handle was broken. A call to front desk resolved that. Shower did not drain.

It's in Tempe, but we found easy 20-minute access to everywhere we wanted to go (restaurants, baseball, etc.). The Rooms: we had a Deluxe Suite in the Camelback building. The room was fine. As reported by others, the TVs are old, but ours worked fine. It was clean. The pullout couch bed was incredibly uncomfortable. The regular beds were comfortable. We removed the mini-bar items and used the refrigerator to keep drinks, etc. that we bought cold. Our coffee supplies were never refilled after used the first time. There were never enough towels or bath amenities, but we just took towels from the pool area and found a housekeeping cart to get more shampoo, etc. We did want an extra blanket one night and were told they were out of blankets. Housekeeping came one day after 5, one day at 9 am and late afternoon the other days. That's unacceptably erratic in my mind, but didn't cause us any problems.

We lined up the first day about 30 minutes prior to opening and were able to get chairs. After the first day though we decided we preferred it at the pool at our building (which is near the waterpark). So we would get chairs there and run over to the waterpark when we wanted to slide or ride the river or grab some food. The waterpark was crowded (of course), but nothing unexpected. I was always able to get a tube when I wanted one and the wait staff is nice. The food: we only grabbed muffins and coffee in the morning at the marketplace and lunch at the waterpark (we got dinner elsewhere based on prior reviews here). The coffee is Starbuck's. The marketplace cafe does not seem to have a good system, but the coffee and muffins were fine. The lunches in the waterpark were good, but expensive. About what you would expect for resort pricing (lunch for five, including one alcholic drink and 4 Icees) was around $75. I don't find it obscene, but it's not cheap.

The waitress who took my order only offered me green or black tea, and never showed up with it until I was half way done with my meal, and after I had flagged down another worker who showed me a variety of teas, and immediately got me a cup. The exercise facility was huge, but the individual ellipticals and bikes did not have their own tv. There were three huge tv's that you could watch--old fashion style. There was no where to plug in your head phones. You had to bring your own portable ipod or radio or something. The resort sent me a list of activities so I could plan my visit prior to arrival. I showed up for a 6am Total Body workout only to find out that they didn't offer that class anymore. Why was it on the schedule sent to me?

The water park was the primary reason we chose the resort. Overall, we very much enjoyed the trip, but I'm not sure that we'd stay here again the next time we are in Phoenix. The Good: It was nice to have a little extra room with a suite. My kids enjoyed the small pool and hot tub near our room. The food options were acceptable & convenient. Grounds were well maintained and pretty. Housekeeping was very helpful in bringing us a lot of extra towels one day when my son had the flu. Our room seemed clean and fairly well maintained. Plenty of pool towels available. The Not so Good: The rooms were dated. The TVs were not only old, but the reception was terrible. We watched part of a basketball one evening and couldn't see the score from the beds. The water park was nice, but small and very crowded. The lazy river often became wall to wall intertubes. My kids thought the wave pool was lame compared to Disney and Great Wolf Lodge. My youngest son was upset because he was an inch too short for the waterslides. Also, the park didn't open until 10AM, so my early-riser kids spent more time at the small pool area near our room since we were attending baseball games most afternoons. The food and drink is very expensive and there is no refrigerator or microwave in the room to bring your own. There is only one espresso machine in the coffee shop, so lines for coffee in the morning were crazy long. I think it is deceptive to not include large mandatory resort fee in the room rate. The amount wasn't the problem as much as the principle of it. Lastly, most of the staff were cordial, but not friendly. I would expect a short hello when walking by, but was largely ignored.

We arrived on 3/29 and knowing check-in was at 4, we contacted the front des and asked what accommodations could be made. The accommodation worked okay, not great, but fine. We were sent to one end of the resort to change, we then had to move our car t another area to access the water park. Again okay. Check-in is to be no later than 4 but alas it was 5:15 and still no room. Nothing they could do was what we were told, they were full. I called the reservation line from the lobby and was told they were not full. I went back to the desk and said they were not full, i wanted a room. None was provided. Kid in melt down mode, no room and no idea of when a room would be available. The concession offered was $50 in gift card to the Oasis bar. Interesting. Once you figure mark-up, the value provided was probably $15-20. Pathetic. We finally got a room around 5:30 the staff gave us terrible directions and we didn't find the room until nearly 6. It amazes me how hospitality mises the mark on the sole purpose. What would they do if their attorney or doctor showed up 2 hours late to a hearing or surgery? Would all be okay? The second, and bigger, issue we had related to allergies. This place is NOT going to work with you. My wife and daughter have Celiacs (gluten allergy). Nothing on the pool menu was something they could eat yet our snacks were confiscated when we came in. We had to then leave the pool area to eat which would not be a big deal if there were sufficient chairs. So we leave, lose our seats and by the time we return, there is no place to sit. We end up back in our room not being able to enjoy what we have paid for because of discrimination based on America condition. Thought we would bake it better for my daughter by getting her a nice bowl of ice cream for dessert. Nope. Only have sundaes and they wil not serve only ice cream. They could however charge $9 plus a $3 delivery charge plus a 23% gratuity for a scope of vanilla. I was told Paul Gray, the GM (his form responses to complaints are readily accessible) set the policy on allergies and the resort's decision on not accommodating same. Seems to be a problem that I will be happy to research once I get back home. Finally (well at least 1.5 days into a 5 days stay), I would warn families about what appears to be an reasonably priced resort. The actual cost is fine, the way you arrive there via the nickel and dime route is not. I would have rather paid more up front for another resort and been more confident in the product offered and the accomodations extended. A great example was breakfast. We ordered breakfast to our room. 2 omelette, 2 eggs scrambled, side of bacon and fruit was $74. I would invite Mr. Gray to directly address the specific issues raised in this review rather than offering one of his canned responses.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cThis Time Was Even Better Than The Last!\u201d", "Author": "mom2maddie", "ReviewID": "UR126883800", "Content": "LOVE THIS RESORT!

We had a riot on the slides! Families join each other for fun games of water volleyball! And, the \"Dive-In\" movies at night are so much fun! My 15 year old daughter and I were just exploring the resort after dinner and ended up at the pool for the evening. Great bonding time! Moving on to the golf course, our daughter and my husband LOVED playing it! Reasonably priced and beautifully maintained (our daughter beat her dad:) I'm a fitness fanatic. I was VERY impressed with the health club! Equipment, classes, spa...it's all there! Again, our daughter and my husband LOVED playing basketball on the indoor court! You can rent bikes and bike South Mountain or you can just lace up your shoes and hike it. We did (right from the hotel) and the view was magnificent! But, lots of resorts have beautiful suites and great amenities. What sets the Arizona Grand apart from the others for me (and I've traveled extensively) are the people.

We decided that wanted to get away a little late in the game. Last year we did an all inclusive in Cancun and it was perfect for what we needed in a vacation. I began searching Cabo & Cancun and I just couldn't get good flight times at a reasonable rate, as well as Florida. We just about pitched the idea of Spring break when I received and email from a family vacation website listing their top 10 family resorts. Arizona Grand made the list. I was intrigued by the one bedroom suites and the water park. I checked Southwest vacations and the Grand was available with great flight times, I knew these flights weren't going to last so I checked a couple of reviews and booked it. Had it been December and I had more time to do my homework, I probably would have ended up at the Hyatt Scottsdale (they were not available during our dates, March 20-27) or more likely, Mexico. Upon arrival to the Grand (which is only about 10 minutes from the airport), the drive looks lovely. You approach a huge fountain that is in the middle of round-about and proceed down a orange tree lined street, in full bloom. The lobby is nice enough, as well as the outdoor lobby area with fire pits and seating to overlook the golf course. I was hopeful. The bellman escorted us to our room, showed us were to park. Parking is sparse. We were in the Camelback section and our room was an \"upgrade\" bc my husband signed up for the preferred guest program to get free wifi. We were told the rooms were newly renovated and that we were close to the water park for easy access. The rooms are small. We like suites bc the kids sleep in the pull out sofa and we can sleep in a king bed. At first I thought the size of the room was going to be a problem but it ended up working out. The decor was fine, nothing special and the TVs old. My main concern were the halls - they were so dark and old feeling. I didn't like the feeling. Since we had two suites, we compared notes with my inlaws and there were a lot of inconsistency. That drove me crazy - especially since they are charging a $40 resort fee per day. You had to request robes (I think at a 4 star resort that should be standard practice). I also found housekeeping service to be terrible. Amenities & towels weren't getting replenished - and when I call they never answered. I always got bounced back to the operator. It was annoying. Again not to harp, but get your largest department together, especially when charging such a hefty resort fee. It was a long a day and the girls we were fried, so we sucked it up and ordered room service pizza. Not good but we expected that. The food in general, was bad except for the club sandwich I had a the lobby restaurant. The food at pool park was not edible. Rustlers Roost on the top of the hill is a tourist trap but does have good views. I have to say my kids enjoyed themselves but I found it chaotic. They have a real bull, live music, balloon guy, slide for the kids and \"free\" cotton candy for the kids. I guess its hard not to try it, but the food was not good. Aunt Chilada's is horrible - stay away. Both myself and my father inlaw got sick that night and we think it was from there. The pool park occupied my 7 year old. They have slides, wave pools and and a lazy river. The hot tub in the pool park has too many chemicals. We actually witnessed a little boy puke bc he was overcome by the smell. Both my daughters developed a rash and I am sure it was from the harsh chemicals. More harsh than other public / resort pools I have experienced. The service was lacking for cocktails and foodservice. (as previously mentioned, the food was horrible). They did have a kiddy pool. Even though the bathrooms always smelled of pinesol, they were old and dated and dirty feeling. A lot of lifeguards on duty and towels were always available. I thought the pool chairs were old and dated and way too close together. It felt cheap. They do offer evening movies that the kids can watch \"in\" the pool and a dj and dinner buffet (didn't try). The \"regular\" pool is just that and is a nice reprieve from the over crowded wave pool. Plus it opens at 6am and closes at 10pm. There is a hot tub in that area as well and it doesn't smell over bleached. THINGS I LIKED: The kids liked the pools. My husband golfed and thought is was fine. The fitness facility is impressive and offers a private adult pool for laps and lounging. The trails behind the resort are great. My older daughter loved them, my husband had to carry my 3 yr old. We would have loved to explore that area more. WOULD I RETURN: No. The price isn't hat reasonable and I know I could find something comparable for around the same price. Especially when you factor the resort fee into it. I didn't like the location at all (except for the foothills). The food is bad. The service, which really makes or breaks a hotel fell terribly short.

We (my wife and two girls 7&3 along with my parents) stayed for a week from 3/20 to 3/27. We stayed in room 528 of the Camelback section. Our room was facing out over the water park, which was nice. Very easy access to the water park and our own more quiet pool and hot tub in that section. With the patio door closed the noise from the water park is minimal. Check-in was a breeze and the bell man led us to our area in the parking lot with his golf cart. We parked and he brought all of our luggage up to the room and was very helpful and would not leave our room until he had answered every question that we had. Unfortunately, this was the high point of the service at the resort. We arrived around 11:00 AM so we were lucky that 1 of our 2 rooms was ready. After dropping off our bags we headed back to the lobby restaurant for lunch. We wanted to eat outside and as a party of 6 this required the hostess sliding two tables together to accommodate us. She was very put out by this request and didn't hesitate to make this very obvious to us. Lunch was actually pretty good and the view of the golf course from the patio is very nice. Unfortunately this was the best meal we would eat at any of the resort restaurants. More on the rooms. Think Embassy Suites for the typical room type at the Arizona Grand. Separate living room and bedroom with one bathroom. The girls slept on the pullout sofa bed in the living room. As many other reviews have stated, the TV's are the old picture tube monsters, not a huge deal but not 4 diamonds. The carpet in our room was stained and looked old and tired. A fridge would have been very nice, but instead we had lots of wasted space with a mini-bar area under the sink in the living room. The bed was fine, but nothing special. The balcony was very small and became the place we put wet swimming suites to dry rather than a nice place to have coffee in the morning. Speaking of coffee our room was not restocked with coffee when we arrived nor did it have a cork screw (my parent\u2019s room had both). We had to call down to get blankets for the sofa bed and the room did not have robes hanging in the armoire closet. Again, not 4 stars. After our first night, housekeeping failed to replenish the soaps, shampoo and toilet paper. We had to call to get it and even that required two phone calls. Food Lobby restaurant was fine, but rather expensive for what you got. Lunch for 5 (youngest daughter wasn't hungry) with 1 beer for each of the four adults was $120. Lobby gift shop/proshop/coffee shop was nice; they served Starbucks coffee at a modest markup from the original. Look at the food prices before purchasing, picked up a yogurt parfait for my daughters one morning but put it back when the cashier told me it was $8.50, are you kidding me? Another peeve of mine is the lack of queue management in the coffee shop. Regardless of what you order you wait in a very linear line based on when you ordered. So if you ordered two cups of coffee like me, you wait in line behind the 7 espresso based drinks that were ordering in front of you. I fail to see any logic in that at all. Aunt Chiladas, simply stated, DO NOT GO. Worst Mexican food I have every eaten, not to mention all the ducks that are wandering from table to table begging for food. Yes you just read that correctly, ducks wandering around the outside seating. To make it worse my wife and father in law were both puking in the 12 hours that followed that meal. Rustlers Rooste, tourist trap with great views. The views of Phoenix from the patio are outstanding. The slide and balloon guy for the kids are a nice touch. The food was average at best. Had a bone in rib eye that was maybe 1/2 thick and riddled with fat, not marbling just big areas of fat. Better cuts of meat can be found at the local grocery store for certain. Water Park Kids really enjoyed it but I question the maintenance. I believe they are a bit too heavy handed with the chemicals in the pools. Both of our kids had reactions to the pool chemicals. Aside from that I had to pull them both out of the 25 person hot tub as I was being overcome by the smell of what seemed like chlorine but smelled more like ammonia. Right after we got out I saw another kid get out of the tub and puke in the bushes, several others were rubbing their eyes. I reported this to the staff in the water park gift shop/gate house and they really didn't seem to care. The pools are heated which was nice and the lazy river was pretty enjoyable. The nightly movies on the big screen in the pool was also pretty cool, the kids or adults for that matter can float around in the pool in tubes and watch the movie. Golf Front nine is completely forgettable. The back nine is much better and the final 5-6 holes are really good and very scenic. Probably overpriced at $102 (resort guest rate) but it was onsite and a 2 minute walk from our room. Hiking The hiking onsite in the South Mountain trails is very fun. Not that difficult, as our 7 year old loved it and wanted to do more but it was too much for our 3 year old, she spent most of the timing riding on my shoulders, which made it a nice workout for me. General This place has potential but the rooms need a makeover, the service needs to be much better and they need to keep the place in better shape. The hall ways are very dark at night and I actually saw some dirty room service trays sit in the outdoor corridors for 12-18 hours, which unfortunately allows the birds and other critters to get at them and really make a mess of things.

Our confirmation stated paid in full. No where in our reservation documentation did it state that we would have to pay an additional $203.88 resort fee upon arrival at the resort. This hidden fee was very disheartening to us. After arriving at the hotel and being made aware of this fee we tried to discuss this matter with several mangers and came up with nothing but arrogance by some managers we were told that we had to pay the fee. One manager stated that he would look into it and would get back to us, when my husband spoke with him again he stated that he was waiting for a phone call back from the booking agent from the resort we never heard back from him again. We spoke to another manager and she stated that it was a resort fee and we just had to pay it. We travel frequently and have never encountered hidden resort fees. Most 4 star resorts will include the resort fee in the price of the room. When a reservation states paid in full that is what the consumer expects. It seems that you must always read the fine print. A lesson learned. After we returned home we contacted the resort by e-mail we spoke with a person named Nathen who explained where we should have looked on the web site to see the fee's . I then sent the following email to Mr. nathen;\"I did find this fee after following your directions how ever it states ( Resort fee is $25 plus tax per night, except during the season when the Waterpark is open (see below for Waterpark schedule and fee, subject to change). so help me understand why I was charged $30.00 a night plus tax when the water park was not open\". He replied; \" Good Morning Ms. Becker, The resort fee pricing had just changed as of February 17th however we did honor the resort fee amount that previously existed for anyone that made their reservations prior to our changeover. I do realize that in your case it was not a benefit in doing so.

I will not be re visiting the Arazona grand again. Which is to bad. because I really enjoyed the golf course and the grounds were beautiful. You know the 200 dollars was not the issue if i would have known there was a fee I would have paided it if i really wanted to stay a place. the problem is I don't like when I feel taken advantage of. we travel to phoenix every year in Feb to golf .", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Modesto, California", "Title": "\u201cVery fun stay at the Arizona Grand Resort\u201d", "Author": "ontheroaddave", "ReviewID": "UR125187595", "Content": "It is a great place for a family of 5.

We try and take our boys once a year and they absolutely love the waterpark. My husband and I like the resort and the Phoenix weather. This trip was also great - we had requested a hospitality suite (for a second bathroom) and that wasn't available, so they upgraded us to a one bedroom villa suite for a nominal upgrade fee. The suite was large, clean, luxurious and very close to the water park. Overall our stay was great, with very good service and meals. Our only complaint was the increase in the resort fee. When we booked (about a month ago), our reservation referenced a $30 resort fee, which we had paid on previous visits. However, when we checked out, our bill included a $40 per night resort fee. When I inquired, I was told that the fee had recently increased (to include wi-fi internet they said). This wasn't mentioned when we checked in (although I'll assume it was on the paperwork I initialed when checking in). In response to pointing out that our reservation quoted the $30 per night resort fee, we were told that the fine print on the reservation gave them the ability to change the fee any time they wished. This was a huge let down after our great stay. Based on the considerable amount we had spent at the resort, the $10 increase was insignificant, but a slap in the face. We'll probably end up going back next year, but right now I feel that the $40 per night resort fee is out of control and the manner in which it was increased was not up to the standards we have come to expect from this resort.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Carlos, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Arizona Grand\u201d", "Author": "Janethallwong", "ReviewID": "UR125090624", "Content": "We had a fabulous 3 night getaway at the Arizona Grand over President's Weekend.

We had one of the standard suites with 2 queen beds and pullout sofa bed. Location: Really easy to get to from the airport (less than 10 mins) and pretty quick drive to Mill Avenue in Tempe (15 min). The Mills outlet mall was just down the road. If you're in town for a Cardinals game or the Fiesta bowl it takes about 30 minutes to get to Glendale. We took a towncar from the hotel and it was $84. Scottsdale is about 20 minutes away. Service: Bell service was fantastic. The lobby was very crowded on NYE and we went down for a cab and it didn't take long at all. The resort has SUVs and cars on hand so when the cabs weren't coming fast enough they brought those out to transport guests to their New Year destination (we went to the block party in Tempe).

The tvs in the room were small and outdated. The remote didn't work and when I called to get it replaced, they were prompt to respond. However, the replacement remote only worked part of the time. The bathtub was clearly not cleaned well because there was hair on the walls of the shower and on the floor of the tub. It also appeared that the room hadn't been swept well because I found stuff on the floor while walking around the room. Gross! The room itself was tired and outdated. The refrigerator in the room couldn't keep our food cold enough and I was thoroughly annoyed that we had to empty it in order to use it. They would have charged to empty it for me. $35, I believe. There was no microwave and that is always an issue while traveling with children. I expect a suite to have the minimum essentials! Overall, the service staff were excellent and I had no complaints there. However, the amenities were an issue. I brought my family with me and the resort is clearly not meant for young kids. My child is 3 and we had issues keeping him entertained because the waterpark was closed during the week and there is nothing else to do for him on property. In Arizona, it's usually still 90-100 degrees in October. (I'm a native Arizonan.) There are other pools scattered about the property but some of the pools were locked before they were supposed to be closed. They also charge an outrageous resort fee whether you plan to use the amenities or not. The conference center itself was also tired in appearance and some of the breakout rooms were located in sections of the conference center that badly needed work. The snacks provided for the conference were often short by a lot and some of the meals did not have enough options for those with allergies. However, the chocolate flourless torte that was served Monday evening was the best I have had since going gluten-free. Even better than Disney! The food overall was very good. The wireless internet, that wasn't free, was down a lot. The instructions in the notebook were not exactly clear either as to how to logon the first time. Thankfully I was able to figure it out. There isn't a soda machine or a vending machine that we could find on the property, so plan to bring your own \"supplies\" if you do go to this resort. Because this was off-season, the little food stands were closed and the only way to get a drink was to go to one of their restaurants or order room service. I wasn't about to do that for just a soda or even a glass of water. Again, the staff was wonderful and I can't complain. It's more of a resort for adults than even teenagers and as someone who lives here, I can't even justify paying a reduced rate to stay there during the summer.

It was a fun weekend, but there were some highly dissapointing points. Honestly... it might have been a total bust as a location if it weren't for the water park. But even then, for the price, I'm not sure it was worth it. This trip began with said family member booking the rooms, which he understood as being 2 bedrooms (they were not, they were two beds in a room), which led to having to get an extra room. We all dealt fine, but you could see it was a bit of a dissapointment and embarrasment to them to have to find another room at the literal last minute to make everyone comfy. Well.. comfy if you have a bed, anyway. Some of the kids in different rooms used the sleeper sofa. After one night, a few of them begged for other family's couch cushions, so they could just sleep on the floor. Upon inspection of our sleeper after the complaint of the beds leaving spring marks, I was horrified to find that they were pretty much just thin mats. No wonder they were uncomfortable! So, if you're planning on using the sleeper sofas, bring an airmattress. The rooms, overall, are okay. Which is fine, if you're paying okay prices. But for 200+ a night, plus resort fees? Dirty carpets, a minifridge that does not get cold, old furnishings and tv? I've stayed at better Best Westerns for far, far less. It was very dissapointing, and we kept our socks on alot (see photos, if TripAdvisor allows them). At least the linens and bathroom were clean. Which was a suprise, because the maid service was, well, deplorable. Several of us had to call and wait several hours to get our rooms serviced (just trash) or towels, after returning and finding nothing had been touched all day! I mean, I know it's a busy weekend, but at least one room never got any service, let alone late service. NOT cool. About the only time they actually did come in force was very early on the day we were to check out. Made us feel real welcome. :( Also of note: bring a cooler with water and food. The one thing \"resort\" like at this place are the prices. Absurdly high prices for just about everything. Plan ahead. And watch your credit card. One family member's room was charged for someone else's (unrelated) rather large room service bill, along with another billing issue they had. As I said before.. probably the best thing about this place is the water park, which is pleasant and seemed pretty clean. Oh, and the amenities were Gilchrist and Soames (sp?), which were nice.

We arrived at 4pm to check-in to find that the hotel was behind and it would be at least an hour before our room was ready. They sent us to the Water park and told us to try back later. We drove to the water park to find there are no changing rooms at the park so we drug our kids back up the hill with all Our bags to change at the fitness center. Beautiful building but not family friendly. Had to explain to my 3 year old why we were changing with other naked women Walking around and trying to keep my one year old out of lockers! So we store all our belongings in several small lockers and head back down the hill to the water Park. An hour goes by and our room still isn\u2019t ready. At 6:00pm my children are getting hungry. We had a $50 resort credit and wanted to use it towards the dinner Buffet being served poolside. However we are informed that\u2019s not possible because we still are not checked into the hotel and our room STILL isn\u2019t ready at 6:00pm An night. The girls working at the pool were very kind and spoke to someone who said to go ahead and go through the buffet and they would make sure the charges Were applied to our room folio. Buffet was great for adults however, not very kid friendly. Hard as a rock chicken tenders and tatter tots were the only option for Children. No drink options other than soda. 7pm we have the pool attendees call again and our room is finally ready. I had to leave my husband and kids at the pool and Go to the other side of the property to check-in, but first go to the fitness center to get my credit card and ID out of the fitness center. After checking in and getting keys the Valet gives instructions to get to our room. It\u2019s now dark and there are no numbers on the buildings. The directions he gave were completely wrong. He told us we were on The first floor but we were on the second. The building had elevators that didn\u2019t go to the first floor and room numbers that do go in order!! It\u2019s crazy. Pay the valet to take you To your room! It\u2019s worth it. Get to the room and the tub is wet and has many black hairs on the side and bottom of it. Coffee cups are dirty and stained with lipstick. How can this room not be completely clean after waiting so long? At this point I\u2019m ready to go home and ask for a refund. Next day was much better. Restaurant breakfast was a little pricy but very good and the pool activities kept the kids entertained. Upon check-out there are additional charges to my bill. Front desk attendee tells me he had no access to the charges, doesn\u2019t even know what they are for and that I have to call the accounting department the next business day. 3 days later, the accounting department still can\u2019t figure it out but hasn\u2019t credited my credit card either. All in all, the hotel is beautiful and perfect for adults. I\u2019ve traveled a lot with my kids but have never had such a challenging trip.

We stayed on the 5th floor in the Sedona Bldg. Yes, it is true, the property is older . . . there seems to be several areas/rooms, etc. that aren't being used as intended, but that didn't bother us much. The hallways and exterior is where most of the wear n tear shows, but again, not a biggy. The rooms were nicely kept, painted, and CLEAN (which matters most to me) and I do think our tub was also newer and slightly oversized. The TV on the other hand, was an old 19\" TV from the 90's and THAT could indeed use an update! We weren't there to watch TV, but it would've been nice to have a bigger, clearer television to watch as we laid in bed at the end of the day. The property seems to have a lot of smaller pools throughout the property where its easy to escape the crowds and wind down at the end of the day -- or in the AM before Oasis opens. We liked that. The fitness center was great -- nice and spacious! The spa was amazing -- had a wonderful 50 minute massage by Francine!! The tea and fresh fruit was a nice, added extra as well! The water park was a ton of fun -- yes, crowded, but it was Labor Day Weekend. There were lines for the lazy river, but we did find tubes in the wave pool that we brought over with us and skipped the lines doing so. You must be holding on or in a tube (at least on 2 of 3 days we were there) which did reduce some of the bobbing heads in the river which was nice (and a tad safer)! There was also a line for the slides, but it moved fairly well, maybe a 15 minute wait for the tallest slide. Service was excellent both at the bar (where we ordered our lunch (food) and skipped the snack shack line) and poolside, despite the crowds and the HEAT! There was a lot of water coolers on in the park with COLD water which I thought was a nice added touch. The bartenders were very generous with large cups of ice that we used at the water coolers as well. My girls LOVED the kids activities throughout the day, maybe more than the water park itself! They participated in balloon tosses, whipped cream games, lots of arts n crafts, guessing contests, etc. They loved floating in a tube and watching the movie on Sunday night as well. And the AZ Grand Dancers were great too! We didn't do the buffets at the water park -- but the breakfast buffet was pretty good.

Also be advised the water is highly chlorinated - so much so that my 5-year-old complained of blurry vision after an hour in the wave pool!

The front desk was accommodating and assured me I could use our meal credit later in the day. Food at the Lobby Grill was tasty and arrived in timely fashion. As with most restaurants, the kids menu could use some work; my daughters, dissatisfied with the selections, ordered off the adult menu and were happy with what they received. Dinner prices were reasonable for a resort restaurant (much more so than breakfast, actually). The one glaring down side was that the restaurant was full of flies. We were initially seated at a table near the view doors but, after being dive-bombed by at least 25 flies, requested to move. Our server apologized; he said they have not found a way to control the flies that come in off the golf course in the morning when they open the doors at breakfast.

We stayed here for 1 night(Saturday) over father's day weekend. It was very nice--the rooms were remodeled, but it still has that 'old' feeling to it(the resort was built in the 80's). All the rooms are suites--a separate small front sitting room with a small sink and refrigerator. Very similar to the Embassy suites. Each room also had a small patio. We were lucky enough to over look the golf course. We ate at the Rustler's Roost for dinner and the Lobby grill for breakfast. Both places were fine--nothing spectacular. Rustler Roost is a fun place to take out of town visitors with all the cowboy, wild west decorations. The Good: 1)Water park-- Main attraction for the resort. 3 large water slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool. There's also a splash pad area that is shallower for the 'younger' crowd. We were allowed into the water park prior to checking into our room on Saturday. The water park was very full and busy--hard to find spots to sit. There were no lounge chairs available, so we put our things under a tree. It was frustrating since it appeared that people were just putting their towel on the chairs and just left them there even after they left the resort. The lazy river was so crowded that there was a shortage of inner tubes. There was up to a 45 minute wait for the water slides. Apparently, the water park allows large groups to purchase passes without staying in the resort. Things were much nicer on Sunday. We got in as soon as the water park opened at 9 and grabbed a couple of lounge chairs. No problems with inner tubes and no long lines for the slides. Food and bar service is available in the water park since you're not allowed to bring in food or beverages(except for 1 bottle of unopened water)--they actually will look at your bags when you enter. 2)The staff-- Everyone was very nice and pleasant. The bar staff in the water park was very attentive. 3)The grounds-- Well kept older property with lots of mature trees. There were several other pools within the resort if you didn't want to go to the water park. The Bad-- 1)Crowds--this is a very popular place to be during the summer. Which is good for the hotel since it had filed bankruptcy. Waiting in line is never fun. Not finding a place to sit is also no fun. 2)Movies in the pool-- Touted as a big attraction. Well, that Saturday night we were there, it was too 'windy' to keep the screen up, so they just let people play in the wave pool until 9:30pm. We didn't notice any wind when we were there. I spoke to some other people and they've been to the resort several times over the past couple of years and they said they have never seen a movie because there's always a problem with the screen. 3)Parking-- Very few spaces around the area between the resort and water park. There is a large parking area in front of the water park, but that is not convient when you're staying at the resort. There is valet parking and there is a daily charge--still not convient since the lobby is not close to your room or the water park. 4)Elevators-- All were very old and stuffy. We actually got stuck in one since our room was on the 3rd floor. 5)Front entrance-- The lobby for the hotel has been moved and can be very crowded and chaotic. Signage isn't very good. Overall, a great resort for a staycation.

For one price, the resort stay plus resort fees were included, with other discounts on dining and spa. I preface my review with this information because I'm uncertain if the Grand was prepared for the response to this offer. We checked in Saturday and departed Sunday. We arrived early and were able to enjoy the waterpark. The waterslides were lots of fun, especially the Serpentine (twisty) slide. The only challenge is, if you sit up the entire way down, there is a branch to a pine tree about half way that you have to duck, or risk hitting your head (I'm 5'9\"). The lazy river was crowded, yet we were able to get a tube without too much of a wait. I qualify this statement with the following: if lifeguards were present, then getting a tube was orderly. If no lifeguard was available, it was a bit chaotic, with the guests jockeying for position, and snatching tubes from other guests. We kept calling in, as advised, to check on the status of our room. The four o'clock check-in time came and went . . . our room wasn't ready 'til 5:15!!!!! That was inconvenient, and a hassle to say the least. The front desk person said the resort was \"overbooked\". Not my problem, and should not be shared with guests as an \"excuse\". Once we did get to the room, it was comfortable for our group of four. It was disappointing to see an empty, discarded water bottle on our balcony and hair that wasn't ours on the mini-bar sink. Waiting an extra hour and fifteen minutes, the room should have been spotless!!! Regarding room layout, the bathroom is in the bedroom section of the \"suites\" which is a tad inconvenient. I used the spa services and was disappointed with one of the spa technicians talking about custody arrangements with another employee. I'm sorry for the situation, but a spa visit should be a relaxing treat for those enjoying the services. We much prefer the scale and setting of the Pointe Squaw Peak in Phoenix to this property.

A friend told me that the Oasis Pool was a great place to lounge and let our kids run around. She was right. The pool was nice. Small, but nice. The boys loved the water slides, I liked the lazy river. Plenty of floats, plenty of towels. Pricey food and drinks by the pool though, so be prepared to overspend on lunch and snacks for hungry children. Also, bring cheap flops for the pool. The deck/pavement is way too hot to walk (or run, yelling \"hot feet, hot feet\") without shoes. You can leave them wherever you jump into the water, but be prepared to have others use them or take them. My friend's son kept finding his flops in different spots all over the pool. A woman sunning near me said that hers had been stolen the previous day. Now, for the hotel part of this review.... Eh...it was okay. The room was clean and it wasn't too outdated. Its the outside of the place that needs some attention. The lobby is beautiful, but beyond the lobby, the place just reminds me of an aging movie star, like you can tell it used to be attractive, but now its just tired and old, and maybe staying in business beyond its prime, and the little cosmetic improvements they've done just don't hide that fact. Our rooms were on sort of an alley, a long walk from the pool. It looked like the stucco on the buildings needed to be power sprayed to get the dirt out or maybe just repainted. The building across from ours had a big gathering of pigeons on a few of the balconies, like maybe the place isn't being used. On the whole, the hotel is okay, not great. The restaurant off the lobby was good. We went there for breakfast. Again, I thought it was pricey for a has-been hotel, but the kids were happy. Now, Aunt Chilada's on the other hand, I'd heard great things about, and was looking forward to trying. Ummm... we thought the kitchen closed at 10PM on a week night, but I learned that they closed up at 9PM. We walked in at 8:57. I know this because the hostess told us that. Before \"hello\". Before \"Welcome to Aunt Chilada's\". The first thing she said was \"The kitchen closes at 9. Its 8:57.\" We asked if we should go elsewhere. She had to ask the kitchen if we could be seated, and then she begrudgingly sat us and told us that we'd have to order quickly\". Wow. Talk about uncomfortable. The food was good. Our server was great. I probably will never go back though, after that. Rustler's Roost... You will spend some money on mediocre food. The kids enjoyed ordering the rattlesnake appetizer though and it'll be something they'll remember. But, with the amount of money we spent there, that was one expensive rattlesnake memory. So, it sounds like I'm tearing up the \"resort\" in this review, and I sort of am. I'm disappointed that it really felt more like an apartment complex than a resort. I almost feel silly calling such a place a resort. I'm feeling a bit gouged by the food prices. I guess I'd be less resentful if we were treated like welcome guests and not irritating wallets. So, my advice: bring cheap flops for the pool, order pizza to eat in the room or go out beyond the resort for meals, make sure you room isn't all the way across the \"resort\" from the pool if that's where you'll be running back and forth from, bring a cooler if you need to keep things cold because the room refrigerator is stuffed with things you can purchase.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStayed previously and would stay again.\u201d", "Author": "Sdavenport06", "ReviewID": "UR116175601", "Content": "Property, service and location were great.

I have to say most reviews were dead on. The waterpark is fine. Not very big, but didnt think it was anyway. The lazy river was decent in length with many extra water sprayers to get you wet. At times there were too many empty rafts in the river and other times it was fine. We only went on the curvy slide. My 10 year old liked it. As I get older (44) I like slides less and less. The other 2 slides were straight down pretty much. the wave pool was small but sufficient and they had a larger area to swim in with volleyball and basketball in the water. Overall the water experience was good! Of course the food prices were outrageous. Dont get the icecream. It is ice milk and too expensive. I think where this review turns bad is the room. I was warned that the rooms were older and outdated. The hallways seemed dirty, like a good power washing was needed. The carpet was not good at all. Stains and all. I made sure we all had socks on walking around the room. The bathroom was really really small. Like it was an afterthought or something. I dont understand how they could make it that small. The building name we stayed in was the Camelback. Overall, if you ask me if I would stay again, which i believe is a good way to measure, I would have to say no. This stay is very fresh in my mind because we are still here and checking out tomorrow morning. Oh yea, we did golf today, $19 unlimited golf is good, but who wants to play golf in 105 degree weather, more than 18 holes. It did cost $30 to rent clubs which is terrible. The course is nice. The first 5 holes is open and close to the interstate. The next 4-5 is threaded thru condos and such. It was nice. The back nine is all desert golf. I liked it the most.

When we arrived the room location we booked was not available so we were upgraded to a room that faced the water park.

The room had two televisions but they were old 19\" tube type. The room would have been perfect if it had modern flat screens. Yeah I didn't go to this resort to watch TV but do it right or don't do it at all.

I did hear a group of people complain about the prices but the portions are huge and enough food to share. We had a few taco salads and a chicken sandwich and that was more than enough food for the 3 of us. As the day progressed the park was very crowded with tons of families with very young children. There were only a few teen/tweens so our daughter was bored and ended up going back to the room to talk on her cell phone. Things sure have changed since our daughters were small and I'm shocked how parents just let their children wander without supervision in a water park of all places. I lost count of the number of time I got hit in the head with a football or water tube while in the pool. I know it was a Saturday but I have never seen it that packed. Rustler's Roost: We went here for dinner and the place is a bit loud but we had a great view of the valley. We were told that the food here was the bomb and I assumed it was because it was so crowded and there was at least an hour wait for a table (we had reservations). The food was not all that, we tried the fried rattle snake and all we tasted was old cooking oil. I ordered the rib eye with the bone medium rare. It looked great but was tough and hard to eat. It was the worst steak I have every had so I just ate my green beans. Our daughter had the fried shrimp which she loved but the sides were gross. Our friends had the burger, the mixed grill and the chicken. My partner had the prime rib and he liked it. It was a fun experience but on my next visit to this resort I will not be going to the Roost to eat. All in all this is a great family resort that still needs a little work but I didn't stay here to watch TV and I know kids will be kids I just raised my daughters differently. One last word: At 6:00 pm on Friday and Saturday they have a dance show with young girls and one young boy from local schools to get the crowd into a party mood. It seemed like a good idea but putting teens in adult type costumes and makeup was creepy. There was a group of guys that spent all day in the pool drinking but once the show started they got out of the water and just started acting like they were in a strip club. A few said a few in appropriate comments on what they would do if they could tap that. As a father I that is was gross and we ended up leavinng. I felt bad for the dancers because they were good but the old guys just made it pervey.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!

I understand what other reviewers mean about the televisions, but are you really there to watch tv?? I hope not because the Oasis water park is great. We loved the wave pool and the lazy river. My husband and 8 year old son used the water slides and enjoyed those as well. There was never a lack of tubes to use for the pool or river, and plenty of chairs around the water park to lay out during the day. We ordered lunch on the second day there from the Oasis grill, it was just ok, maybe we didn't get the right thing we ordered fries and shared a club wrap. Everyone we encountered was friendly, service was excellent. Our free breakfast with the deal was actually a credit for 26.78 per morning which can add up fast considering a cup of coffe is 4.95, but it's totally doable if you watch what you order. The lobby grill has a nice outdoor seating area and the food was great. We didn't use the spa. You can charge everything back to your room if you put a credit card down for incedentals. We paid cash.

We were shuttled to our room, to the Rustler's Roost restaurant at the top of the hill (highly recommend by the way) and our luggage was shuttled back to the lobby when we checked out. They really try to take care of every detail. Our room was spacious and clean. Yes, they have old style tv's but with so much to do outside - why sit there and watch tv? The only complaint about the room is the pullout bed was uncomfortable. Also, they only gave us one pillow and a sheet for it when they knew we had two children. I didn't realize they didn't have a blanket until the next morning when they complained about how cold they got. Not good. We found the entire resort easy to navigate and signs everywhere telling you which was to go. The waterpark was so much fun - there is no way anyone got \"bored after 45 minutes.\" We saw people lined up an hour before it even opened so they could claim a good seat - that's how much fun it is. There are people who take the rafts and they think they own them for the day - there aren't enough for everyone to do this and it leads to lines at the lazy river and the wave pool as people are hoping to score on a raft. Meanwhile, there are rafts all over the park laying beside people's chairs as they claim them for the day (and then don't use them - running off to go down a slide,etc.). We just took those rafts off the empty chairs and used them and then left them in the water for others and I would like to see the park staff implement rules about that kind of thing. Just annoying and I shouldn't have to risk confrontation to get a park raft. There was an incident between two guests with one threatening the other. She was crazed and using profane language and the staff was quick to respond. She took off to hide but somehow they found her and as I was walking to my spa appointment - I saw her being evicted from the park. Good to know they take security seriously - especially with so many children there. The spa staff were professional and my massage appointment was on time and sooo relaxing. My husband played golf and also had a great time - said the course was perfect! We ate at the Vista buffet on Sunday and oh - was it ever good! Even the kids had so much fun ordering omelettes and trying new food. There's lots of food and something to keep everyone happy.

Included in the deal was a night stay, 2 free breakfasts at the Lobby Grill, the $30 resort fee, and $50 voucher towards any service at the spa. However, what they left out of the \"fine print\" on living social was that the $50 credit towards the spa can only be used on massage and facial type of services. The least expensive service in that area is $95. They also do not allow you to use both vouchers at once. Since I had purchased 2 deals to extend my stay to 2 nights, I had 2 $50 vouchers. I was only allowed to use 1 per day.They wont allow you to use the Living Social voucher on manicures, pedicures, etc. Therefore, if you use the vouchers you are forced to purchase a $95 service. Which your voucher can be applied to. They also claimed that you were getting 2 free meals at breakfast. They are actually giving you $23.50 towards your breakfast. The average cost of a breakfast plate is $16. The water park is a joke. It was over crowded and boring. When we arrived at the waterpark, we walked around the water park for 45 minutes never to find a single chair to place our belongings. It was impossible to get a tube to ride the lazy river as well. The resort was alot older than I expected. Apparently its the old Point at South Mountain. Even though our $30/night resort fee was included in the deal, I am terribly disappointed that they even charge this fee. Apparently, its an automatic fee charge per night to get into the water park and to receive the so called \"complimentary\" newspaper and in room coffee. So, technically their room rates are $30 higher than they indicate. No free wifi either! $14.95/day. And on our second night our ac was not keeping our room cool.

I am used to Disney resorts, where if you sneeze, some one pops out from behind some secret wall to say \u2018Bless you\u201d. Was this a Disney Resort? No. But was it hell on earth? No. Do they have beautiful pictures? Yes. It is what we all do in this market when we are trying to sell our house. We arrived at 8 AM. They were more than gracious to hold our clubs for us. They offered to go ahead and check them into the system for the golfing there, so the next day all we had to do was present the claim check and our clubs would be there in just a minute or two. The lobby was empty of people that early but the Grille was busy, and it smelled good. The front desk clerks were pleasant and helpful. They got us checked in, gave us maps for the resort and some of the area. They were also helpful when I pointed out that we reserved the resort when the kids camp was free and now it wasn\u2019t. I asked for an internet credit in return and got it. We were able to get into our room at the proper check in time. We did notice that the places weren\u2019t ice cold. But we saw this at a lot of places we went to in AZ. When we brought this up to a local at the pool he told us that with the heat wave, all of the AC\u2019s were working over time. Face it, AZ is a desert. Things will be hot. Since we had two rooms, we were able to get connecting ones in the Mountainside areas. They were nice rooms, but not luxurious by any means. There was a stain on the carpet when you walked right in the door, and the fridge was a little dirty, but that was the biggest complaint about it. The coffee maker was missing, but we don\u2019t drink coffee so it really didn\u2019t affect us. The beds were soft, the pillows were nice and the bathroom was clean. The patio over looked the golf but we never really used it. We were barely in our rooms. The views were of the golf course. The water park was always busy. When we checked in we asked about the park and she told us to take advantage of it on the weekdays because the weekend would be packed. On one hand, I get that. On the other, don\u2019t sell so many extra passes to people who are not staying in the resort. We did the park on the weekdays. On Saturday we tried a different pool, the one in the building we were in. It was nice \u2013 perfect temp, clean, quiet, etc. The adult pool was also visited and same thing. I think that it would be hard to keep it perfectly spotless with all the trees around. For what they are dealing with, there were no cleanliness complaints from us. I think that for the amount of people that are there the wear and tear is inevitable, but there can be more work done. The landscape was nice, and taking a beating with the heat wave they were having. The gift shop/caf\u00e9 was ample and had the basics. I saw that it was Starbucks and asked about the pastries and was told it was Starbucks. The buffet for breakfast was amazing. The price for it was not unreasonable, seeing what all they were serving. Yes, the pool food prices were high, but that is to be expected. It is like that anywhere you go. We brought some stuff and used the \u2018cooler\u2019 in the room. But the guy at the front desk told us it was just a cooler and not a fridge. I would have been surprised to have a real fridge and a microwave since they are trying to make money on the people, but these two things might have given the resort a better vibe. There were things to do around the resort, but it was mostly golf and swimming. One member of the party tried the spa for a massage and liked it, but didn't think it was worth the price. We did the hiking in South Mountain a few mornings, but it would get hot quickly. There was a ton of things to do in the area. We took advantage of the shuttle to Rustlers Rooste, but not to the mall. We rented a car so we used that to get around. Overall, I did give the resort 4 stars. I didn\u2019t feel that it was five, but I didn\u2019t think it was three either. My thoughts would be just to clean it up a tad more in the \u2018living areas\u2019, like the hallways in the buildings, the ice areas, laundry, etc. Maybe even add the small fridge and micro. It was a perfect place for us to go with a grandchild and a grandparent, not to mention some other family that was coming in.

We live in Carlsbad, California and make the 7 hour drive several times a year. The kids were bugging me to go to the local water park for the day. When I checked the prices for 5 people for the day it made more sense financially to take a side trip(I had heard about the resort previously). We stayed at the Arizona Grand Resort on June 22, for one night. It was my 4 kids and myself(16, 14, 12, & 9). We had a fabulous time! Our room or I should say room's, were in the Villa's across from the water park. I don't know if our room was the status quo or we were upgraded due to the number people. Nevertheless, the room was beautiful! Full kitchen, dining/family room( with sofa bed), seperate master bedroom with walk in closet, and oversized bathroom( shower could fit 5 comfortably!!!). The entire unit was beautifully decorated as well as quality materils used throughout (granite counter tops. oil rubbed bronze fixtures, stainless steel appliances). We were on the first floor facing the lake with fountains. There was a french door from the family room as well as a slider in the master to the patio. We spent most of out time there at the waterpark. The kids loved it. They ordered lunch from the grill which was pricey( where isn't it?) that was good. I asked the bartender for a reccomendation for a kid friendly, no dress code, not too pricey dinner place. He suggessted the \"Rooster\" which is up the hill from the hotel. It is independent from the hotel, although you can charge your meal to your room. I called the front desk to ask if we could walk there. The reply was yes, and it would take about 10 minutes or they would send a car that would take and pick us up. We opted for the latter!( tipped the driver both ways). The Rooster was a real highlight for the kids (and me). At the entrance was a live Bull. The ambience was saw dust all over the floors, a country band with dancing, a indoor slide for the klds, and a beautiful view of the city lights and skyline. The food was excellent and well priced. The adult entree sides are served family style. The kids menu(which turns into a hat with bull horns) had a 5 or 8 0z sirloin steak, with a side and soda for $5.95. The kids loved everything about it! As did I. They bring WONDERFUL bread at the beggining of your meal and instead of a mint with the check, they bring freshly made Cotton Candy! Overall we just had a great time. The front desk people were really nice. The gal who checked us in as well as out(Tanvi) was very nice and articulate. I will also add, some how or another I got off the hotels website and booked the room from a company. I didn't notice til I pushed confirm. In my experience when you don't book direct with hotels (i.e. Priceline, expedia,etc) you don't always get the nicest rooms. Well, there was not biasedness here! It was an amazeing room as well as location within the resort Free parking****** Beautiful lobby with nice gift shop and a Starbucks***************** Great night away from our house in Scottsdale!

We stayed at the Arizona Grand when it was first built as The Pointe at South Mountain and several times since then (through the Hilton ownership years). I have to say I was a little disappointed this time and will probably look at other resorts for future visits. First of all, our room rate was not all that great, and then we were hit with the $30 per night \"resort fee\" at check in. And surprise....it doesn't even include internet! The Oasis water park was nice, but crowded and over encumbered with rules and lacking more than one or two places to get in and out. This is especially a problem since the resort failed to used a walkway surface that did not absorb the 114 degree heat! Ouch! Food service was very slow and expensive. Outside food or beverages are not allowed (remember the $30 resort fee?). Our room was one of the smallest on the property, but sufficient for the three of us. However, our 19 year old daughter opted to use the pull-out sofa in the living room, and we were very surprised that housekeeping did not fold the bed up during the day but simply pulled the covers up and left it open to consume the room. Our iron did not work so we called housekeeping and asked for a replacement. It took 30 minutes to receive another iron that also did not work. A third iron was brought in about 15 minutes with the assurance it had been tested. It did heat, but when I put water in it, the water immediately drained out the crack in the bottom. We decided not to waste any more time on irons (maybe a good decision for vacation anyway, ha ha). There was a girls volleyball tournament going on in the area and several of the girls were staying at the Grand. I was very surprised that they were allowed to write cheer/spirit signs on their room windows, hang signs and crepe paper on doors etc. Sorry, I'm all for teen athletics, but I was paying for a relaxing resort experience, not a high school spirit week. We did eat at Rustler's Rooste and it was as good as ever. I highly recommend the ribeye steak and our daughter \"checked in\" at foursquare.com and she received a free ice cream sundae! I would recommend the Grand for families traveling with younger children and teenagers who need the space of a suite and desire the activities that the Oasis waterpark offers.

First impression is that the hotel looks old and outdated. The exterior completely needs an overhaul. We checked in and the lobby was hot. I mentioned this to the desk clerk and he said it's always hot. Not good, in AZ the AC should be cold! The rooms were redone and looked nice. However, there were a few problems in the room. In a resort suite, there should be a full size mini fridge. There was only a \"cooler\" is what it was called by the clerk. Barely enough room to shove about 4 waters into because it was loaded with other items. The pillows were not even standard sized pillows, let alone oversized. They were mini pillows! I called down and asked for at least standard sized pillows, and housekeeping was less than helpful and almost irritated at my call. They said they only allow for two extra pillows per room. They did find two standard sized pillows and sent them up though. The TV's were small, around 15 inch or so. TV's nowadays should be large in a resort like this! The water park is fun for the kids, I will say that. However, the grounds were poorly maintained. There were weeds everywhere around the lazy river as well as trash all over. There was dirt caked on all the the entrances to the lazy river and walkways. It looked dirty and unkempt. There were large patches of gravel and dirt, where landscaping should have been. For a resort like this, it should be pristine. The lounge chairs were dirty and looked old as well. The food was good, but overpriced. Overall, the kids had fun, but if you're an adult used to nice resorts, this doesn't even compete. There is no feeling of luxury here, just a fun waterpark with a resort is trying to compete with nice resorts in AZ, but doesn't even come close.

This time we went to the Arizona Grand for our daughter's birthday. She brought one of her friends with her. When we checked in ,everyone was very nice. Then the bellman took us to our room which turned out to be an upgrade to a large one-bedroom suite that overlooked the first tee (used to be the 18th green) of the golf course. It was huge and had a fireplace and two bathrooms. The Oasis Water Park at the Grand is what we go there for. They have a large pool, that is half wave pool and half regular pool. They have a long lazy river that moves fast enough to not be boring and three slides. Two of the slides are about four stories tall and go almost straight down. The other is a long twisty one. We didn't eat in the hotel as it is expensive and there are lots of good restaurants in the neraby areas. The only negatives were that the minibar fridge didn't work when we got there, the ac didn't work and there was a giant hairball under one of the chairs. The fridge and the ac were attended to very quickly. Also, even with a $30 resort fee, wifi is an extra $15 a day which we considered a rip-off.

I will be basing my review on stay at JW Marriott Desert Ridge (JW), La Quinta Resort and Spa (LQ), and Beaches Turks and Caicos (Beaches). All in all, I am giving it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Hotel: Like previous reviews mention, this hotel is located right next to the 10 freeway. This makes it convenient to access, but also poor in terms of scenery. The hotel itself is geared towards family and conferences. If you don't fit one of those, you really shouldn't stay here. The property is large and in relatively decent condition. We went right after the long weekend and it was perfect timing. The resort was full (mainly for a conference) but felt empty. This was perfect, so my review will reflect that. Check-in was a breeze, no lines, and everyone very friendly. Room: Due to our family situation, we looked for a resort that had suites. This one was perfect. If you have a large family (>3) you need to book one of their villa suites. We shared a 2 bedroom suite with a family of 3 (ours is 5) and it was perfect. The prev reviews that stated that furnishings were out of date must have stayed in a regular rooms. These suites had updated modern furnishings (ie: new fridge, nice countertops, flat screen tv, etc). The bath room in the master suite was huge. Shower can accommodate a small army of kids. There was a walkin closet (where the baby slept in the pack and play). We patio overlooked the 1st tee box. The room was on the 4th floor but the elevators were quick to come. The JW did not have a room accommodation like this one. So my vote for best room would have to go to the Grand. Pool/Waterpark- This was a big draw for us due to our kids. From the website, you couldn't really tell much of what to expect. There are 3 slides (all have to be 48\" to ride) which none of our kids could ride. There was a nice lazy river, but had way too many empty tubes floating in it. I can't even begin to imagine the congestion if the park was at capacity. There was also a wave pool, sports pool, small kiddie pool, and jacuzzi, and that was it. There were plenty of lounge chairs and even cabanas (can not be reserved) available. Food service was decent and prices were avg. You can only bring in water. Cons- not enough things for kids <48\" to participate in. The water rides and pools will be unbearably crowded if the hotel was at capacity. There were 25 life guards (I asked) but none seemed ready to blow his whistle at obnoxious teenagers who were running around. There is only an adult pool next to the villas and we did not go to any other pools. Compared to the JW, the pools were inferior (JW had a better kiddie area) but had better sitting area. Beaches Turks and Caicos still has the best water park Spa- According to my wife (spa expert), the facilities could not even come close to the nicer high-end resorts (including: JW, Montage, Ritz, La Quinta, etc). The massage itself was nice, but the waiting area, steam room, and shower, were not. This may be because the spa shares its facility with the community gym. The locker rooms were more \"gym/workout\" type facility. Golf- The layout was nice but the course was in avg condition. We teed off at 6:30am and was able to finish in a little over 4 hrs. The carts have GPS but no coolers. We played one day at Raven South Mountain (about 5 mins away) and paid the same amount but got a totally better experience. Golf at JW and La Quinta was better. Restaurants- This was also a little bit disappointing. We had dinner at the Lobby Grill which was avg. I heard that the rib-eye was bland. We also had dinner at Aunt Chilada which was a disappointment for a mexican restaurant. The pool side snack bar was decently priced ($7 for corn dogs, $5 for fries). Value- We paid approx $720 per night for the 2 bedroom villa. This included 2 x 50min massage/facial, 2 rounds of golf, and $100 food/bev credit per day. The resort fee was also included. Not sure if all of it was suppose to be included, but it was. This was a great value for us. One of the main reasons we chose this place. Conclusion- I loved the room set up and the convenience of playing golf and having a water park all in the same area. However, I would probably only return if I can get the same or better value than what I got. I don't like the surrounding sceneries and would prefer the JW over this.

If you want luxury, you may want to look elsewhere. Accommodations: We stayed in the Camelback building closest to the water park. The convenience was fantastic, but the clientele definitely \"family\". If you're traveling with kids, you want to pay for the rooms closest to the waterpark b/c it's worth it. Traveling for business or as a couple? Maybe opt for something in the main resort or near golf. Our building was noisy with all the kids, but we had our own child so we understood. The room layout was not ideal with a child sleeping in the room, as the sink was so close to the beds. You may consider putting kids in the living room area. Service: Service was lacking - we needed a fridge, and they wanted to charge $25 just to empty the mini-bar! I emptied it myself and put everything back at the end of our stay. They charge $15/day for internet access, which really bothered us given the already high $30 per day resort fee. Upon arrival, our room had no bar soap. We called housekeeping and had to leave a message. Eventually, someone arrived with bars of soap. Why they weren't in our room to begin with? A mystery to us! Cleanliness: Cleanliness was mediocre. Our bed & bathroom were clean, but our feet turned black after walking on the carpet. Our room felt a bit damp & had a slight mildew smell, probably from all the wet people coming in and out over the years. We set our A/C on 67 degrees to try to make it more comfortable (that worked). Someone tossed a pizza box with two slices in it by the ice machine on our floor, and it stayed there for at least TWO DAYS. Upon our departure, the pizza was still there - the birds were enjoying it. Surely they have a janitorial staff who should have picked up that trash?!? Parking: Self-parking near your room/building may be difficult to find, but luckily (unlike internet)valet parking IS included in the resort fee. But you should remember to have tips available when picking up your vehicle. The Pros: Don't get me wrong... there were PROS. The waterpark is a lot of fun! A great ammenity to have. We played all day on the slides, lazy river, and in the wave pool. We had a snack at the waterpark bar - expensive, but convenient. In the evenings on weekends, they have AZ Grand Dancers to pump up the crowd and provide a fun beach party atmosphere. AZ Grand also offers plenty of family programs including movie night (they were showing Tangled while we were there). The restaurant where we dined was very good. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. So, if you know what to expect (family resort with fun water activities), you'll do fine here.

The rooms looked exactly like they did in the pictures. yes the TV we very out dated but really the kids did not care and were so wiped out by the end of the day they did not care what was on TV. They were very quick with checking us in and even though we got there are 1pm and check in was not until 4pm they gave us our wrist bands to the Water Park and let us change in the bathrooms in the hotel lobby instead of making us go to the water park to change. They said they would partially check us in at 1pm and gave us a number to call to check to see if our room was ready. we called at about 3:45pm and they were all ready for us. The resort is large and the signs are not very clear on where to go and where to park. We spent about a half hour trying to figure out were to park for our room and where our room was! Once in our room it was great. a little living room with a couch that folds out for a bed and little mini bar with nothing exciting in it. a separate bed room with the king bed bathroom and a nice size closet and a tiny balcony, which was great for putting the wet bathing suits on to dry! they only problem the couch pulls out into a bed, but the pull out is not comfortable and was missing springs at the foot of the bed so it caved in. luckily they are small and don't weight much but if an adult had to sleep on it, it would not be a good night sleep. We did not eat at the resort the 1st night but opted to Claim Jumper down the street. We also took this time to go to Fry's Grocery Store to get water and snacks and sodas. We were in the Sedona Suites and in the center was a pool, of course we understand that people and kids are on vacation and living it up but people were parting in the pool way late. our living room window was on the inside over looking the pool and we could hear them laughing and screaming and thank goodness our kids were so wiped out they were not disturbed and our room was on the outside of the building and with the door closed we could not hear all the screaming and laughing. The breakfast at the lobby Lounge we very nice and since the kids were so excited and woke up at 5:30am when we got down there for breakfast at about 7;30am they were not to busy yet. We got two breakfast buffet and 2 kids meals which cam to about $50. with the Living Social Deal you get a $26 credit for breakfast, so not truly 2 free breakfast. after the credit breakfast was about $24 not including the tip. People line up for the water park very early so we decided to stay at our pool at the Sedona Suites until later in the after noon. The water park is a lot of fun and very packed. the kiddie pool is great only 1'6\" and has a splash pad area also. the Wave pool was a lot of fun and the lazy river the kids also enjoined. finding a spot to put your stuff down was hard. We did eat dinner at Rustlers Roost and choice to walk up the hill, yes it was a walk but we figured we would just burn of all the eating out we were doing. this place is so family friendly. a slide to get into the place was awesome and view was great and the food was amazing! With your check come cotton candy and kids eat free with a paid adult all summer long! on our last day our youngest son tripped and fell and got a huge bump on his head, our room phone did not work so we had to call the front desk with our cell phone, but when i explained our son fell and had a huge bummed they said they have EMTs on site and they can come have a look at him. they were very quick to come and where very nice about checking him out. luckily our son was fine just a bump.

They still have tube TVs ~25\" in the living room and ~19\" in the bedroom which make the rooms seem very dated. The overall style and furnishings were a bit dated in the rooms, but tolerable. The resort footprint is rather large which can make for a very taxing walk in the heat - especially when dressed in business attire for a conference (as was the case for me). The hotel must have been going through a very slow period because I saw staff patching sidewalks, brickwork, etc. which made it seem that there was a recent influx in cash (from our conference, perhaps?). It's good to see repairs in progress, but makes me wonder if this is not the usual state of affairs. I mean, how often can masonry break down in the hot dry climate of Phoenix? This was later confirmed when a waitress mentioned that she was working 18 hour days to take advantage of the work before it became dead again the following week. The resort has a lobby bar/restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a steakhouse on site - though the latter two are far enough away that calling them offsite would be just as appropriate. Without a car there isn't much in walking distance so I never left the property in 5 days (which is probably fine by the hotel). The Mexican restaurant's food wasn't bad, but I was surprised to not see a single Hispanic worker in sight. Some suggested this had to do with recent laws, but all of the cleaning staff were Hispanic. Their standard margarita's are nothing special and I'd recommend upgrading to one of the many other choices. The steakhouse was great and would be excellent for kids: there is a live longhorn steer outside, an optional slide to enter the dining room, live country music, balloon animals during dinner, and cotton candy with the check. I found out later that this was in fact a favorite place for some family friends that used to live in the area. And even though my colleagues and I had no children with us, the food was so excellent that we were not turned off by the family atmosphere. However, it's a bit loud and not recommended for a business dinner for sure. The lobby bar/restaurant has excellent food, though the late night bar service was a bit slow. Again, the staff were a bit overwhelmed by a full resort (long lines at the check-in/out counter as well). There is a golf course on site, which I didn't have a chance to utilize. Hole #1 which was visible from my room was half brown - honestly it doesn't seem right to have natural grass golf courses in the desert considering the water problems there. Lastly, there is an onsite water park (in addition to pools dotted around the resort).

We booked through a Living Social deal which was great value at $169 per night incl breakfast and $50 spa credit.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, California", "Title": "\u201cMake sure your child is much taller than 48\"...\u201d", "Author": "LuckyLady77027", "ReviewID": "UR106109863", "Content": "I bought a 2-day trip to the Arizona Grand Resort as a Living Social Escape. From their website I knew that children had to be at least 48\" tall to ride the waterslides. I specifically measured my son, and he was 48.75\" tall. I was not going to buy the Escape if my son could not ride the waterslides (he loves them). That was my whole reason for purchasing the getaway. When we got to the waterpark, he was much shorter than any of the signs. (I would say the signs are at 50\".) Needless to say, he was very disappointed, and so were we. When we checked out, I mentioned this and was told that next time I should go to the lifeguard office inside the waterproof, and there they have \"an accurate measure\" that I could use - and they would initial his wristband. All signs in the park should be accurate! Of course, we were checking out and could not try it out, so he never did get to use the waterpark. I sent management an email the next day, but I have still not heard back. We were very disappointed as the waterslides were our main reason for visiting the resort, and disappointed that I haven't heard anything back from them. The waterpark was fine. It only has 3 waterslides (with a 48\" minimum height), a lazy river, and a wave pool (not big waves). I think there was a baby pool too. It was crowded, but we were there Easter weekend. We ended up on very slanted grass. I ordered food at the main bar, and the food came very quickly both times. As for the resort itself, it's nice, but not 5 stars. The rooms were clean. The TVs are pretty old. Not that I care, but they are pretty grainy. I couldn't find a channel listing anywhere in the room. And in case you are looking for the remote control, it is the game controller that is hooked to the back of the TV (although I couldn't figure out how to do the volume on it.) You are supposed to get a newspaper every day as part of the daily resort fee, but we did not receive one at all. You were supposed to get coffee, and there were some packages in the room when we checked in, but no coffee maker, so we could not make any. Our Escape included breakfast in their restaurant. They have a very nice breakfast buffet that we were happy with. (For those with the Escape, they credit you $26 per day for 2 breakfasts. You can choose whatever food you'd like.) We visited Rustler's Rooste for dinner one night. I had made reservations through the resort before we arrived, and the confirmation email did say \"because of the size of your party, you will be given priority seating, to be seated before any walk-in guests.\" And that is what happened. We didn't wait long though. That place was very crowded and we were there at 6:00! Live music and a beautiful sunset and view. The food was fine, but not extraordinary. The kids will love it. The live music, there's a big slide they can slide on in the restaurant, and a live long horn bull outside the restaurant. Plus, they get a fuzzy pink special dessert. Our room was in Mountainside and you did have a little walk to the waterpark, but that was fine - we didn't mind. We also had an older room, not the ones pictured on the website. But it was fine. I wouldn't recommend trying to walk to Rustler's Rooste. It's quite a hike. And if you decide to drive, you need to drive through the resort to get to it.

We were a little nervous based on some of the reviews we read regarding noise, cleanliness, etc. I have to say this was a fabulous vacation. We checked in around 11am and our rooms were ready. We stayed in the Camelback section overlooking the Oasis water park. We were in very close walking distance to the waterpark and lobby. The rooms were very clean, spacious and comfortable. The only issue I had was the bathroom sink is located outside of the shower/toilet area. If you are an early riser and want to brush your teeth you will disturb anyone still sleeping. Other than that minor issue, the room was beautiful. We had no issue with noise; in fact it was very quiet at night and in the morning. The rooms closest to the highway will be noisy, you're overlooking a highway! The waterpark opened at 10am each day and the line to get in was quite long, especially closer to the weekend. If you are particular about where you want to sit; plan on getting on line by 9:30am. We preferred the seats by the wave pool; you can be in the shade or the sun. Our kids had a great time at the waterpark. There are plenty of lifeguards at every attraction to ensure safety. Someone did write a review about children \"running amok\". It's a waterpark geared towards families; children will run amok! If you don't want to hear children laughing and having a good time; don't stay at a resort with a waterpark! Food service was outstanding. The back of the lounge chair had a \"flag\" that you raise when you want wait service for drinks or food. Very convenient and staff just appears when your flag is raised! The cost of food was very reasonable, some people thought it was expensive. The average cost for a meal was in the $7 - $10 range. I'm from the east coast; food here is expensive. I had no issue with food cost and everything was great. The fish tacos were the best! Breakfast and dinner in the lobby restaurant was very good. We had a prime rib buffet that included everything from drinks to appetizers and dessert for around $24 for adults. The dinner menu was nice and offered other dinner items that were very good also. The breakfast buffet was very good as well as a la carte menu items. The omelet station line was sometimes long but moved along quickly. The gym was huge and had plenty of cardio equipment and free weights. Our children loved the indoor basketball court. The spa was excellent and relaxing. A 50 minute massage was $95; very reasonable. They have beautiful trails to go for long walks along the mountains and golf course. We did see two coyotes on the golf course in the early morning and we ran in the other direction! The locals thought we were crazy; but better safe than sorry. There is a Starbucks off the lobby that offered great snacks and ice cream. The gift shop has nice knick knacks and souvenirs. Again, I thought very reasonably priced. In the evening they would show a childrens movie by the pool in the waterpark. Our kids didn't go but what a great offering. We did rent a car and drove to the Grand Canyon - a long day but worth the trip. We stopped at Red Rock state park along the way and drove through Sedona. Sedona was absolutely beautiful. It took about 3 1/2 hours to drive back to the resort from the Grand Canyon. Again, it was a long day but it was worth it. Overall, it was a wonderful vacation.

My party was 2 adults and 3 kids, ages 10-12, and we spent 2 nights here. How did I find this place? I googled \"Best Pools in Arizona\" and this place came up on a list with others. Because of the extent of the waterpark facilities, I thought it would wow the kids. They have always wanted to stay at a hotel with a great pool, and \"wow\" is what they got. The main attraction at this resort is the Oasis Waterpark and it doesn't disappoint. We checked in early on a Thursday and the kids had half a day to check out the pools and slides. They couldn't wait to get back to it the next day. My wife got to the waterpark at 9:15 AM the next morning, but she found out it didn't open until 10 AM. Lucky for her, because there was already a line assembled. By the time the gates opened, the place was flooded with guests determined to get their chairs in the shade. I must say that there was ample seating in the facility and a surprising amount of shade to be had. My kids proceeded to spend the next 6 hours going from pool to pool, floating down the lazy river, and going down the water slides. There are lots of life guards around. There were also a couple of places to get food and drinks and the lines were never too long. College-age kids go around taking orders at your chair if desired. We stayed in a premier suite, which guarantees a golf course view. I chose this location because I wanted to be a little distance from the waterpark and didn't want to be close to the freeway. From the looks of it, I think that if you're in one of the \"M\" buildings close to the freeway you could be in for some noise. We had none. The room was large and accommodated our party well. The minibar has room enough to place a couple of items of your own if needed. A coffee maker was also provided. There was also a nice balcony with 2 chairs and a small table overlooking the golf course. Because of the great location in Phoenix, we took a short drive to Scottsdale on the second night and had a great time strolling Old Town and checking out the Friday night scene. Downsides? Well, the TVs are smaller CRTs and the channels are not as plentiful as you'd expect. I think a resort that claims 4 stars should have flat screens in all rooms. Even Holiday Inn Express has these now. Also, I noticed that the closet mirror and the French door panes had finger prints and smudges on them. Our sofabed was missing the pillow and blankets, and my wife called the desk twice to bring the items up but no one came. On the third try, she had to call the manager, and he brought the items up in minutes. Lastly, we didn't hear any voices from the neighboring rooms, but we could clearly hear their plumbing! Despite the minor negatives, this resort is a powerful draw, especially if you get a good deal. We got a nice package that included a nightly resort credit. We used it at the Lobby Grill, Aunt Chilada's, and the Market Cafe. We were pleased with each of these. I can also say that, unlike other resorts, I never felt nickel-and-dimed here. For instance, you are only entitled to 4 waterpark passes per suite but they gave me the fifth without me even asking. I also found the staff to be friendly and helpful. For families like us, who always seem to have a hard time finding a resort with rooms large enough to accommodate us comfortably, the Arizona Grand is hard to beat. You can keep the kids (and parents) very busy here, have an enjoyable resort experience, and still be close to the amenities of a major city, all at a fairly digestible cost.

Although our room was not ready, they checked us partway in, gave us the wristbands necessary to access the park, and then directed us to the spa and let us use the locker rooms to change into swim suits. The food at the park is a tad expensive, but the service is great.

The AGR exceeded our expectations in many ways despite the overlap with the expected Spring Break traffic. As with any hotel, there are strengths and weaknesses however, there were several aspects that are undeniably EXCEPTIONAL for a resort of this size, quality, and price point. Located within a short drive to Sky Harbor airport, the resort is off the beaten path of the typical Scottsdale 'name' resorts. What you get for that is a lack of pretentiousness, more attention to the guest, and very good value for your dollar. A car is necessary to explore Phoenix and the vicinity. The hotel staff was all so very helpful, polite, and willing to go out their way to assist guests. Having stayed at the Arizona Biltmore, just 3 weeks earlier, I said that the level of attention between the two was equivalent but without the \"white glove\" service. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at the prompt nightly turn-down service with towel exchange that was M.I.A. at the Biltmore where I paid twice the nightly rate (do you hear that Biltmore?) Also, reasonable room rates plus the Grand Experience which gives you $100 per room per night credit toward virtually any expense on property. How's that for a deal. The water park was a welcomed haven for the kids, with attentive lifeguards at the wave pool, lazy river, and 3 waterslides. Can't say that I didn't catch just a few adults indulging themselves at the water park. After several strenuous laps in the Lazy River, I was ready for poolside service from the friendly waitstaff. The traditional pools adjacent to the rooms were more than adequate, quieter, and offered a nice change of pace from the water park. Admission to the park is included in the price of the room and is not open to the public ...another plus. So if the food and drinks are a little pricier...it still doesn't come close to Disney prices. The 18 hole golf course was very playable and well maintained. The hole design was varied with sweeping changes in the mountainside terrain making it very scenic and challenging. Rates were very reasonable especially with the additional 20% discount offered to hotel guests. My 9 year old son loved it and begged for more playing time. The driving range was adequate and free to use with lots of kids taking advantage of the kid friendly range. And best yet, children 12 and under play golf for free! Yet another pleasant surprise! We signed up for a twilight round at 3:26pm and were given the green light to go off at 2:30pm for the same price. The rooms are typical suite design with a bedroom with king or 2 queen plus a living area with a pull out queen. This was a former Hilton property. A mini bar refrigerator and wet bar was useful. The rooms are nice and more than adequate, but who comes to Phoenix to stay indoors? The mattresses on the sofa beds could use an update. TV's are not flat screen but with 2 per suite, they do the job. Finally, as a self-proclaimed foodie I was pleasantly surprised by the menu items at the resort restaurants. During our trip they offered not only children's menu items but had priced fixed specials such as Prime Rib Night. Honestly, possibly the BEST, tastiest, and enjoyable prime rib I have ever eaten. Though the portions are not huge like one would find at an upscale steak house, they were more than enough for my hungry appetite (come on America do we really need to super-size?). Dinner included a buffet of iceberg lettuce wedge, creamed spinach, potatoes, vegggies and dessert all for $ 21.95 . Outdoor dining and coctails by 2 fire pits and with beautiful views of the golf course. Food service during the Spring break holiday was slow but the maitre d' informed all the guests up front that the kitchen was swamped and that they would not be seated until the kitchen caught up. Although the hunger was upset I appreciated the honest candor up front. Bravo again ! The spa and gym were very modern in a beautiful building and the parking was free all over the resort. This resort is a virtual 'diamond in the rough'. And believe me, I spent 5 days in the rough during my golf tournament... I know rough :-) ! Apparently with the new management making renovations like the new central lobby, restaurant, Starbuck's and golf shop I'm sure that as the economy improves, so will the updated amenities. If my three world travelers ages 9, 9 , and 7 give the AGR a big thumbs up for a return trip and momma reluctantly left the resort to go home with a big smile on her face, you know that they are doing alot of things right . We will certainly consider a return visit. Although a paradise for children, the Arizona Grand Resort has plenty for adults without children too!

While we were there, kid friendly movies were shown in the evenings out by the pool for some handy free family entertainment. We've eaten at the main hotel restaurant several times and the food has been quite good. Prices are fairly typical for this caliber of a resort. Do yourself a favor on a hot day and stop in the marketplace for their homemade gelato...delicious! The resort also has a fitness center, golf course, and additional pools and hot tubs spread throughout the resort property in addition to the Water Park.

Kudos to the resort for keeping this amenity off limits to the general public. There is also excellent hiking and golf basically outside your door, so the location can't be beat. Unfortunately, the hotel itself is a disappointment and is generally headed downhill. This is our third time staying there and most definitely or last. My main complaint is that the otherwise outstanding courtyard areas (complete with nice pools, hot tubs, and ping pong tables) turn into a major party area after sunset. Fine if you're into that scene, but not a good environment for the kids. People are smoking and drinking everywhere, including in the hot tubs, beer bottles and other litter are strewn about, there is abundant profane language, and during our 6 night stay we saw no attempts by hotel staff to address these issues. The only good news is that the 10 PM quiet time seemed to be enforced. Basically we rarely saw staff making any attempt to keep the place clean like one would expect from a so-called \"Grand Resort.\" Even the room service trays left outside the doors tended to remain there for 12 hours or more.

We were told the hotel was renovated about 2 years ago, but the rooms still looked a little dated to me (carpeting and bathroom wallpaper showing signs of wear). While the suites are a decent size with a separate living room, there is a major problem with the layout. The vanity area (which is outside of the bathroom) is right at the foot of the bed in the bedroom with no divider. Therefore if one person wants to get ready without waking the others, it would be darn near impossible. The vanity lights shine right on the bed, never mind the sound of running water right in the bedroom. I've never seen this layout in a hotel before. Also, the bathroom was very small. You had to open the door all the way, walk in, and then get out of the way (due to toilet placement) before you could close it. Yes, the televisions were also small and older, but I didn't really care about tv when I\u2019m on vacation. The grounds are scenic with the mountains in the background. There are lots of gas firepits burning around the property. The staff was very responsive. You can request a golf cart ride (response time was great) to any part of the property you wish to visit, although it\u2019s easily manageable on foot as well. The waterpark was very clean and the perfect size. It is certainly a nice amenity to have with children and teens.

We intended to have lunch there and I just wanted something to tide the kids over until then. We did have lunch from the Oasis Grill and the food was good. The waitresses were very responsive. Put the flag up on your chair and they are there. The next day they must have had my name \"tagged\" in their book and asked me if I remembered their outside food policy?

While I have noticed a slip in service levels over the last year, this most recent experience was noticeably worse and worthy of not returning. The staff appear to be very junior and not properly trained. The resort was busy and the staff did not seem equipped to handle the large # of guests. When we arrived in our car and pulled up to the front lobby, no one greeted us -- there were employees walking past us with no recognition. I finally stopped someone and told them we were checking in and asked if we could leave our car. He said \"ya, just give me your keys\" The lady that checked us in barely cracked a smile. I tried to make pleasant conversation with her to no avail and she eventually told me she had already been \"beat up quite a bit that day.\" We told her we were travelling with another family who had already checked in and requested a room close to or connecting to them. She told us that the room our friends checked into did not offer a connecting room (of which we confirmed later that was false), she then offered to place us in a room in the same building and confirmed that it would have a ground floor patio that opened to the waterpark (we agreed to take this room rather than have our friends check-out and wait for two connecting rooms to become available because we decided this patio option would be nice for all of us to enjoy). When we arrived to our room, we found that our \"patio\" opened to the parking lot and had no more than standing room. At the waterpark, we found the pricing of food & drinks to be downright ridiculous-- Example: $7 for chicken fingers, we had to pay extra for a side of BBQ sauce + another $4 for fries, all of which show up in a plastic basket.. My friend and I went to the spa for pedicures ($70) and I will tell you the service and atmosphere did not warrant more than $20. The pedicure area was stuck in the back of the salon, the \"massage\" chairs barely rumbled. The actual pedicure was very, very basic. We spent most of the time listening to the two nail technicians discuss their personal lives. When my pedicure was completed, my technician stood up, left and never even acknowledged that the pedicure was completed. My friend and I were told by someone else that we'd have to move because the chairs were needed \"like right now\" - we proceeded to walk barefoot across the salon to an empty chair. My technician returned to the salon room with supplies for the next service and noticed I was still there and said \"oh sorry, I was busy, I'll be right there to help you with your shoes.\" Very disappointing! At the breakfast buffet, there were no labels on food items, the oatmeal was ice cold, and all staff seemed too busy to stop and offer assistance or even smile. Finally, we requested on two separate occasions to receive transportation to Rustler's Rooste. We stood outside both times for 10+ minutes and no one arrived. At one time I eventually walked to the front lobby. A bellman was standing outside with a ear piece on. As I stood directly in front of him, he did not acknowledge me but continued to speak into this earpiece. The man that finally drove me up to Rustler's Rooste also spoke on his ear piece non-stop to his other bellman buddies, cracking jokes. It was downright rude. I could go on with several additional examples. But, my final comment is that of warning. When booking a rate at this resort, ALWAYS take into consideration the additional $30 resort services fee. I saw several guests very upset about this at check in. Also, we booked a rate that included a $50 resort credit. Read the fine print on this as well. There are limitations as to where this can be spent. This resort is tricky in how it markets its rates and it does not clearly identify this rate during the reservation process. I am very sad, as this has been my favorite Stay-cation resort for a number of years\u2026 but it might be time to find a new home-away-from-home. I am one that will spend money for a good vacation experience and enjoys splurging on spa expereinces., but, the Oasis Waterpark is no longer enough to overlook the poor service and lack of value you receive.

Easy access to the highways, restaurants, shopping, gas stations, etc... Also close to Sky Harbor airport (10 min drive). Check in was a breeze, stayed in the Mountain Side units, king size suite with a 2nd bedroom with pullout queen bed for our 2 young boys. Room was decent size, very clean. Only negative thing I have to say about the rooms is the small, tube TVs. Very outdated and TV reception was bad. The resort has the Oasis water park for the kids (I have to admit, I had fun too.....those slides were CRAZY!!!). The resort charges $30 a day resort fee which covers your fee into the water park.

The main one being that no outside food/bev is allowed in the water park. They actually checked my bag upon entering and confiscated my sunflower seeds. I could understand if I were bringing in a picnic lunch, but that was ridiculous. Drinks were $9 at least and the food was high priced with small servings.

The next morning, in the daylight, we thought that the resort was showing its age a bit. We also noticed a chicken bone on a ledge outside our room. We had a good laugh about it. Four days later, upon departure, that chicken bone was still there. So we wondered if there were and maintenance/grounds keepers around. (well there must have been, since the grounds around the hotel were beautiful, just not immediately outside the rooms) Housekeeping was as expected. Golf course was definitely challenging, but fun. Nice views. Practice/Putting greens were adequate. Not sure what's up with the driving range though. Don't know how expensive range balls are for golf courses, but those puff balls we hit seemed pretty useless. Didn't feel like golf balls and I split three of them. Never used the range again.

The courtyards and pools in each of the buildings are not to be missed. Every evening we would go out on the lobby patio and warm ourselves by the giant outdoor firepit and admire the stars.

We were on a package that provided a $100/resort credit a day which was really convenient; especially because the food and beverage at the water park were a bit overpriced (about $15 for a burger and fries) and they won't let you bring your own food/drink into the park. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and modern. We really appreciated having 2 queens in a bedroom with the sofa sleeper in the living room. Worked great for my 10 and 7 year olds because they didn't have to share a bed and we could close off part of the unit for anyone that was sleeping late. The mini bar was nice since we had a refrig. but it would be a great addition to include a microwave in the room. We enjoyed some lazy days by the resort pool outside or room and also enjoyed lots of time at the waterpark. The pool outside our room was nice because we coulde easily access our room for food or beverage that we bought at the grocery store about 1/2 mile away (it is walk-able). As a bonus, since we went in Feb, the pools and waterparks were empty! Although it was cool outside, the pools were heated nicely and the hot tub was a life saver! I only have a few complaints about the water park. First, I'm told the 2 big slides hurt! I love water parks but not once did I go on the big slides because in watching people go down, rarely did anyone go a second time. My kids usually live on water slides but they only enjoyed the 2 big ones a handful during the whole week. They loved the lazy river and wave pool. My second complaint is the lifeguards are so strict. If my son even goofed around at all in the lazy river, he was in trouble. You couldn't take a beverage in the tube and couldn't \"slip in\" just anywhere, even if a tube was floating by. Plus, you had to be in a tube at all times. Desipte this, we had an outstanding time and we'd definitely return. We loved the pizza in the lobby bar and had fun at the Roost cowboy bar/restaurant. The fitness center was also very nice. I also loved that the facility backed up to the Pima National Reserve. After breakfast each day, I could take a run in the reserve to burn off my meal and enjoy the outdoors.

We picked a beautiful looking resort, located in southern Phoenix, close to golf courses and restaurants. It looked great in the pictures and the room descriptions promised bright, sunny rooms over looking pools and the resort golf course. We arrived late at night for an 8 night stay - not the longest stay they've had, I'm sure, but not a quick weekend, either. We were led by golf cart to our building - Camelback- and we were pleased with the 2 room aspect of the suite, but then I opened the curtains! We were level with ( and could have reached out and touched from the tiny, unusable balcony) a car in the carpark and our view was a huge back door and garbage cans. I had spent weeks dreaming of sitting out on the balcony enjoying our morning cup of tea and soaking in sunshine and the surrounding vista. Not from this room! I did cry myself to sleep that night, I was so disappointed. The next morning I went to the front desk and told them this room was not at all as expected. They replied that they could give me a room higher up in the same building that overlooked the water park -for an additional $20 per day. This on top of the $30 resort fee plus extra taxes on both meant the hotel cost us more than $400 over what we had already prepaid expedia. The room was nice and clean but when families started arriving the next weekend to use the water park the noise was incredible. The televisions were old and small and there was just nothing special about the room at all. I guess after staying at the Pacific Terrace Hotel in San Diego, the Bellagio in Las Vegas and even the Peppermill in Reno - this resort just didn't impress us.

We arrived at the resort a few hours ahead of the check-in time, but we were able to get a room upon our arrival. That room had some issues and we were immediately upgraded to a villa room, which was greatly appreciated! I would have been disappointed if we weren't provided with an upgrade given the issues -- the upgrade shows that the resort cares about the guests. Our villa room had an amazing view of the golf course and waterfall area (slept with our balcony door open every night to hear the water) -- it was also very nicely decorated, had a refrigerator and microwave, and a very comfortable bed. I recommend buying some groceries at the Fry's less than .5 miles away on Baseline (not the one across from the resort as that is a Fry's Electronic store). We heard about some issues others had with \"standard\" rooms, but again, the villa room was exceptional! We liked the villa room so much that I researched the cost of purchasing one -- about 70% of them are already sold including, unfortunately, the one we stayed at. The early check-in provided us with an opportunity to use the waterpark -- we certainly enjoyed it!! It was only open for that day (Saturday) during our stay. I don't understand why it couldn't have been opened on Sunday too, but we weren't expecting it to be opened at all so at least we had a few nice hours there. The water park was a very nice amenity for the resort guests -- we are already thinking about returning when it is open more. I like the fact that it is only open for resort guests! The other amazing aspect of this resort was the fitness facility -- the best I have ever seen at a resort. It easily compares to any private workout facility out there. Shooting baskets was a nice break. I wanted to use other aspects, but decided to be lazy instead. We didn't use the spa so I cannot comment on that area. We also enjoyed the fire pit areas outside of the main lobby -- very nice section to relax at. We have stayed at some other resorts in the Phoenix area (e.g., Camelback Inn) and the Arizona Grand Resort, with a villa room, certainly compares favorably to the others.

Thirdly, while I was there they had the national Cheerleadling competition there so at 7 in the morning there were kids practicing outside of my room which obviously woke me up. The rooms themselves are all suites and have been refurbished recently. But the lighting was awful and the rooms very small. Also the sink was in my bedroom which seemed really odd. I worked at night and when I got back to my room I wanted to get some ice. But, the ice machine near my room was by a swimming pool which was locked up so I couldn't get any. When I called the front desk, they told me I could get ice somewhere else, but it was a long walk and the grounds were very dark. Creepy, actually. As if all of this weren't enough, upon checking out I was charged a $30 per day faciliy fee. I was there on business, I didn't use any of there facilities at all. So, maybe if you and your family are traveling for pleasure, consider this hotel. But, if you're going to Phoenix on business, you're better off at a Holiday Inn.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cVery memorable 13th Birthday for my daugher\u201d", "Author": "FionnD", "ReviewID": "UR79425997", "Content": "We booked the great summer rates of $99 for my daughter and her friends to stay at the Resort.

First I desided to use a pre-paid debit card instaedof travelers checks for obvious reasons. And since the hotel charges an additional $30.00 plus a day that they tell you about after your check in for the use of the pool ??? plus $50.00 a day for incidentals you need to be flush when you arrive. So i used the pre-paid card and a security feature required the hotel to enter a validation code which they had the entire time they thought they were not getting paid so every morning i spent 2-3 hours on the phone being told I needed to pay my bill. mind you they had my card and were ppaid if they simply validated the purchases. Then they screwed up several activities like horse back riding which they failed to get us to and later had a cab driver drop us off at an empty parking garage miles from nowhere at the \"wild horse casino\", apparently if there is a horse on the sign you can ride it. Then when we called to complain about the missed activities all they would discuss is payment which they ....of corse...already had saying quote\" all we are concerned about is payment\". never refunded a dollar or even comped a taxi ride to make it up. so we moved to a hotel in scottsdale. Now did i mention even after we were paid in full and were no longer staying there the hotel charged our card 2 more tomes for $150.00 each. i have a pre-paid debit card that is negative $110.00. They had so much trouble using them and getting their money they managed to exceed the limit after we left. Stay away from this resort if you are away to destrees. rooms are dated, $6 dollares for bottled water, Pool was filthy and packed, service was the worst I have experienced in my life, $19.95 a day for internet ??? a very poor resort who's main focus is to grab every dollar they can and try to sell you a dated unit, not to mention commiting fraud with you cash. pay cash there or run.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Expereince on a Holiday Weekend\u201d", "Author": "Phxgrl", "ReviewID": "UR78560601", "Content": "We were excited to stay here Sept. 5, 2010.

We went for the Oasis Water Park but my husband summed it up best that is was so crowded it was like being at a public pool. Tubes were hard to get for the lazy river (which was the only way you could go on it). River and slide shut down for 30 minutes to chlorinate because there was clearly an overload of people. Wave pool very tame. We thought the Island Buffet sounded like a good value for $15/adults, $9 kid. Not a good value when you can only go through the line once and you're trying to decide what to fit on your plate not knowing what will taste good and what won't. Our room ended up being in the mountainside cluster and was right next to the freeway and had no view of anything. The pool for that cluster was tinier than our play pool at home and again, way too crowded even at 9 pm at night. This resort was a huge disappointment.

My wife and I are both 29, my daughter is 3, so my view is from that perspective. Nightly Rate / Resort Fees: When planning the trip, we got a priceline rate of $100 per night. What is not blatantly disclosed, but I knew from online research is that the nightly rate does NOT include the resort fee of $30 plus tax. This was also not discussed by the front desk agent on checkin, so I kept my mouth shut to see what would happen, but as expected, $30 per night additional tacked on for the resort fee. The only place this was disclosed in my experience with the hotel was in the little folder they gave me my room keys in - it has a printed card labeled \"resort fees\" and lists the things the fee is meant to cover. Now, dont get me wrong, I am not by any means disputing the resort fee because I know it is an \"across the board\" charge to all guestrooms, but if you are going to go to the trouble to list in print what the fee covers - I would be making real sure all the amenities listed are provided. In our case, the daily newspaper made it one time during our 4 night stay, and the in room coffee was provided as often as I was willing to call and ask for it. I'm really not that disappointed about either of these things, and it certainly didnt negatively impact our trip, but I'm just pointing out that 2 of the things \"covered\" by the resort fee, in our experience, weren't handled well. Checkin: We arrived on Thursday at about 12:30pm and checked in with no problem. We were \"upsold\" for $20 per night additional to be closer to the water park and pool areas. I agreed - so that is a self inflicted problem. I probably should have just requested to be close and see what they gave me because we had another party join us on saturday, and they simply asked to close to our room and were accommodated without any nightly \"upgrade charge\". Again - I agreed to it and we truly did enjoy our room location, so it really isn't conversation worthy aside from possibly pointing out that the front desk really may have more flexibility for location than my check in agent led me to believe. One other thing, we agreed to the \"green\" program in exchange for $30 of dining credit for our 4 night stay. This meant that we would not receive daily maid service, but still had access to additional linens, etc upon request. No complaints with this program or implementation (just dont forget to use them - they are physical coupons) - great idea though - wish more places would do it. Our Room: We were in suite C231 (Camelback). We found our room very adequate and entirely clean. Other posters have commented the rooms seem \"old\" - I disagree with that - the rooms have clearly been remodeled, and ours had modern, comfortable furniture. The TVs are still traditional tube televisions, but they do work, and I certainly dont dock the hotel points for not having flatscreens everywhere. Now, in some other posters defense, the TVs do certainly make the room feel \"older\", but they are completely functional. Oasis: The oasis is a really cool park, but I can certainly see that older children & teenagers might run out of things to do somewhat quickly. The water park doesnt really have that many different attractions - 1 basic water slide, 2 thrill ride water slides, the lazy river, the zero entry wave pool, the sports pool, the hot tub, and the childrens area - \"wildcat springs\". Now, for us with a 3 year old - everything was perfect. We got there right when they opened every day at 9:30, stayed through lunch, then went for nap during heat of the day. Thursday and Friday the park was empty. There was one point where we were literally the only people in the wave pool, but Saturday and Sunday were PACKED. People on those 2 days lined up starting at 8:00 outside the gates to get a spot. The food at Oasis was good (not great), and fairly pricey. I'm not going to beat them up too much about the their prices as their prices aren't out of line from other resorts Ive stayed at, but their food could stand some improvement. Some things were great - others were mediocre at best. Everything is A-La-Carte. $8.00 Sandwich comes with nothing. $9.00 Burger comes with nothing. Fries are $4.50 extra. Salad was great, burger was thin and just OK - it was fine though. Food was certainly not a high spot for Oasis, but it wasnt bad either and is in line with the food quality foudn throughout the rest of the resort. As far as the weekend crowd - hotel seemed to handle crowd control pretty well. Sure, everything was busy, but that's not really the hotels fault. In addition to being busy - there were some partiers in the central courtyard pool until about 10 - 10:30 every night. Doesnt bother me, but if you go to bed early - it was pretty noisy. Other food: We ate at the \"marquee\" restaurants - The steakhouse called the Rusters Roost has really cool atmosphere. Our server, Brian, was very friendly and made for a great time. The food was great EXCEPT for the steak (unfortunate since it is a steakhouse). The bread, salad, corn, beans, green beans, apple pie, cotton candy, etc were all excellent, but the steak just really was somewhat bland. The place is really cool, has great atmosphere, and has a band playing - we all enjoyed it, but 5 people at our table got steak and all agreed the steak was the weak link of the meal. Aunt Chiladas is a total flop. Our server was dry, unhelpful, the food was mushy, bland, and just generally not good. We had some drinks - they were OK I suppose, but this resort serves drinks everywhere - go somewhere else. We were one of only a few tables in the entire restaurant eating - now I see why. This place has disaster written all over it - dont waste a vacation night on this place. Room service was good and as described - as others have posted, be aware that there is a 23% gratuity plus $3.00 fee added for room service. Breakfast is the hit of this hotel - the lobby grill has the most perfect breakfast patio ever. We ate there every morning. The servers are friendly and the food was good, both off the menu and the buffet. Our 3 year old buffet was free with an adult buffet, so morning they offered the buffet we opted for that. All in all, we really did have a great time. The food is certainly not for people who travel to experience the great eats of the world, but for our family of three, we had a wonderful time and everything was more than adequate for our needs. The staff was very friendly and always made us feel welcome. I think we would go again, but not so sure it would be our pick once our kids were older, or if it was just the 2 of us having a romantic weekend. Hope this helps and/or offered some insight for anyone considering this place.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gilbert, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cI left the resort relaxed and in a great mood and ready to attack my Monday.\u201d", "Author": "robnikkki", "ReviewID": "UR77753096", "Content": "August 21, 2010-It has been a little over a week since we have been home from our Stay-cation at the Arizona Grand Resort. This was not our first time staying at the resort, we try to make it there for a family weekend at least once a year. We are still talking about our visit. We have some dear friends that also like the Arizona Grand, yet we are never able to go at the same time. This year we made a pact that we were going together. \u00a0We both have daughters about the same age so we were looking forward to a great time.\u00a0 When we got there we were greeted by very friendly staff, we waited in line to get our rooms and the relaxation was starting to already set in. We were all ready for a fun time. \u00a0When we got to our adjoining rooms we realized that there was a maintenance issue in our room. I do not consider this the fault of the resort, things do break. The only reason that I would be an unhappy guest is the way that that the situation was being handled. In this case I was not an unhappy guest. \u00a0 I called the front desk and in a few minutes someone was at our door working on the issue. It was determined that this was not going to be a quick fix. I contacted the front desk and spoke to the Manager, Ryan Moyer and explained the situation. He was all about making sure that we were taken care of. \u00a0 I explained to him that we had our best friends in the next room and that we would need to move together as this was a group trip. \u00a0He asked if he could call me back after he had a solution for us. A few minutes later, Ryan called and said that he was going to be moving us and that a bell-person would be coming up to move all of our luggage. A few minutes later a friendly staff member came with our new room keys and we were off. Ryan apologized for the problem in our room and said we would be happy where we were being moved to. We were, the rooms are great and we actually were a bit closer to the park. Ryan got us rooms that were attached which really made for a fun time.\u00a0 \u00a0The service was outstanding! You can tell that the staff really cares about the guests. I am surprised by some of the reviews that said the staff was rude because we experienced nothing but hospitable, friendly and over-the-top service throughout the entire complex. \u00a0We all enjoyed our breakfast in the restaurant. The majority of our group are all \"Bacon Freaks\" the bacon that was served with our breakfast was delicious! It was not your typical thin as paper bacon, it was thick, crisp bacon. The price for the breakfast was very reasonable. The fresh squeezed orange juice was not served in a 4 ounce glass, which I appreciated. The small loaf of bread served with my breakfast was a nice touch. The water slides are so much fun, this time we decided that this was going to be a very relaxing \"lazy River\" adventure. \u00a0I will say that as a parent, I appreciated and noticed the park's attention to safety. They had plenty of people working around the slides, the pools and the beach and the lazy river. . Also, this is a very clean water park,\u00a0usually I am not a fan of water parks because they don't seem very clean to me.\u00a0 The water was so clean and clear, it was great. This was a fun and relaxing Stay-cation. I left the resort relaxed and in a great mood and ready to attack my Monday. The Arizona Grand Resort was a great experience!

No innertubes were available, and you can't ride the Lazy River without one. So we hiked over to the Wave Pool which was Wall to Wall People standing in slighly choppy water.

I sought out the general manager who was not on site, but, did speak to the acting manager who apologized. not sure what their big security problems are, but, unfortunately its not a very nice way to treat a paying guest with his family. i've stayed in hotels around the world & have not been treated as though I was a criminal.

I have two wonderful daughters, 6 and 4. We traveled to the Arizona Grand in mid-July. After many hours of scouring the internet for a nice hotel, this seemed to be the place to go. Let me give you some practical, honest input on this resort: 1. The heat. I am from San Diego. I hadn't read too many reviews that detailed whether small kids could take Phoenix's stifling heat. Rest assured, your kids will be fine. My kids, surprisingly, almost made no fuss about the heat. In a way, it was kind of fun trying to avoid the heat. The cool thing (no pun intended) about Phoenix is that it's always warm. We made sure to swim in the early morning or early evening, around 6, to avoid the suns direct rays (and to avoid getting sunburned). It you go out to the pool at 9 a.m, it's already 95 degrees. However, the sun isn't high in the sky, so you don't get scorched by its direct rays. By the same token, we hit up the water park late in the day, when the suns direct rays weren't real bad. All pools and the waterpark had bathwater, warm water (ahhh!!!). 2. How was the water park? It looks fabulous on the internet, but kids under 7 will be too scared to ride the slides. There are only three slides, with two of them being 7-story dropouts (fun for adults!). This was disappointing, as I was hoping for more slides for the kids. There is one tame slide that kids might be able to go down, but they don't let kids slide down with their parents. That's too bad. My daughters would have gone if they could have slid with me, but they were too scared to go alone. I get tired of hotels and water parks assuming that a catastrophe will occur if an adult slides down with their children. It won't. If the resort reads this, I highly recommend that you change this policy. Otherwise, your small children will not be able to use any slides. My daughters would have likely spent hours going down this one slide with their mom and dad if this rule wasn't in place. To be honest, I thought that they would at least have one or two slides for smaller kids. Nope. Kind of hard to believe. Aside from the slide, they have a wave pool. This was cool. Both of my daughters enjoyed it. The wave pool was about half the size of any wave pool that you'd find at a Knotts Soak City or any other wave park. It was fun. They also have a lazy river. It's your typical lazy river. There is also a separate pool for general frolicking or volley ball playing. It was about 5 feet deep. Nothing great, nothing bad. The water was pleasantly warm. They have a VERY nice toddler pool. My kids aren't toddlers, but, if you have a child that is just walking, or maybe up to 2 years old, the toddler pool is fantastic! It is about the size of a large, backyard pool. Not huge, but a fairly decent size, and get this: The deepest part is 1 1/2 feet deep! Totally safe! On top of that, they let parents put the poolside chairs into this toddler pool, so they can actually sit in the pool while their toddler plays. If you have toddlers, this pool, alone, would probably make the trip worth it. You don't ever find 1 1/2 pools at hotels. All-in-all, I would give the waterpark a 6 1/2 on scale of 10, but don't be dismayed. The pools within the hotel make the visit worth it, even if the waterpark is only pretty good. If they would let the parents slide with the kids, it would bump it up to 7 1/2. They actually need to put a few slides in for kids. I wish they had a few slides similar to what the Great Wolf Lodges have for kids (If you haven't been to a Great Wolf Lodge, then you have TOTALLY missed out on the best place to take kids 10-and-under). 3. Redemption for the waterpark. The waterpark TOTALLY redeems itself on weekend nights. Starting at 6, they have a DJ and dancing. Some people have complained (What???). The music made for a VERY festive atmosphere. My wife and daughter got out to dance, while me and my other daughter lounged in the wave pool. It got better at 8 p.m., when a giant screen came down and they played a Disney movie. IT WAS FANTASTIC! Everybody sat on rafts in the big pool and watched. It was wonderful. It was the perfect night. 4. The interior pools saved the day! We spent more time swimming in the pool in our hotel courtyard area, than in the water park. It was a very large pool and the water temperature was bathwater warm (ahhhhh!). We usually waited until after 7 p.m. to swim. At this time of day, the sun was behind the building, so you weren't in direct sun light. My daughters would usually swim for about 2 hours. The deepest part was only 5 feet, and this was in the very middle of the pool. Yes, they do allow floaties. 5. The rooms were very nice and very large. I was actually impressed with them. I have stayed at a lot of hotels. It was nice. The beds were very comfortable! The air conditioner was in fine form. We usually kept our room in the high 60s! 6. Other. The hotel is about 1/2 a mile from the Arizona Mills mall. We spent several afternoons at the mall, to avoid the mid-day heat. We had a lot of fun. The food court was large and pretty cool, and had a large merry-go-round. Also, there's a movie theater next to the food court. Also, they have the Sea Life Aquarium at the mall. The Sea Life Aquarium isn't an all-day activity (more like 1 1/2 hours). It's NOT Sea World, or anything close to it, but it's not bad. It's a little pricey ($17 adults, $9 for kids), but it's not a bad place to go. As for the mall, they have tons of actual outlet stores where you can actually get real bargains. Something unheard of in San Diego. Very nicely decorated mall. It sounds kind of pathetic to suggest that hanging out at a mall is part of a vacation itinerary, but, when you are trying to avoid the heat, it's oddly kind of fun! 7. Other ideas. I would recommend the Museum of Natural History for one afternoon. I am not much of a museum guy, but this one was fantastic! My daughters LOVED it. It completely outclassed any museum in San Diego. 8. Bummers. There weren't too many negatives about the hotel, but there were a few. First, there is no free internet service (it's $14.95 a day). But that's not bad, as it keeps you off the internet. Also, they don't have any luggage carts! What? I was too cheap to pay the clerk to take my luggage to the room. When I got to my hotel courtyard, I found out that there are no luggage carts. The hotel needs to supply luggage carts. Next, there are no microwave ovens in the room, but we called the desk and they brought us one! All-in-all, this was a very nice place to stay.

Friendly reception from canopy man/ info man, valet, front desk, and an awesome golf cart man / bellman that led us to our room and took our luggage up a flight of stairs.I regret forgetting his name so we could give him his due credit. Room was not as nice as I would expect for the price, and like I mentioned before, there was no elevator. T.V's were 20+ years old and I'm not exaggerating at all. I looked at the back of them for the manufacture date because I couldn't believe how old and terrible they looked. The bedroom T.V. was blurry and unwatchable.We wanted to order a movie for the bedroom T.V. but could not because the picture was terrible. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone out to look at / fix the T.V. 45 minutes later nobody had showed up, I called again and they said they would radio someone and get them there fast. 15 minutes later no one had showed up so I called the front desk again and told them to forget about it now because we were exhausted and ready for bed by then. It was definitely nothing but lip service. I don't think the T.V. was fixable, it just needed to be replaced with a model that isn't 20 years old. The $30 per night motels have nicer T.V's than this RESORT!! They charge you $15 per day for internet access so we didn't use it, a $30 resort fee which I assume is for the water park. Water Park was massively crowded with limited pool loungers. The water park grounds are not nearly as spacious as they look in the pictures, there are a lot of things left out in the pictures so it looks more open and inviting. Good luck finding a place to sit and relax if you are not there first thing in the morning when they open. There was a 15 minute line in the morning to get into the water park because they are so busy rifling through everyones bags to make sure nobodys bringing ANY outside food or beverage. We are obviously not the only people unaware of this. Every time I came in or left the park they were scolding and confiscating items from some other unfortunate/clueless person about the same thing.They absolutely gouge you in every way possible. They don't tell you when you book the room that you can't bring in any snacks, water, or other outside food and beverage to the water park. It makes for very expensive days with the kids.There were lines for the slides and even lines to get a tube to get on the lazy river, it was rediculous. Upon checkout we were not asked how our stay was, were not offered an apology, and were not offered any concessions/credits for the trouble we experienced. We have stayed at a few Scottsdale Resorts in the summer like Westin Kierland / JW Marriot that are much nicer and a much better overall value, places that genuinely seemed concerned about your happiness.

We stayed 2 nights and the whole idea of staying here was to simply relax and end the vacation at a place where the kids could just play at the water park all day. We stayed 2 nights in a Mountainside Suite, and the property itself was fantastic. The walk to Oasis is not long at all, so don\u2019t feel like you need to pay extra to stay in a Sedona or Camelback Suite because they are closer. It\u2019s really not an issue. The rooms were very nice and well kept. The grounds were kept tidy. And Oasis was very fun for the kids. They didn\u2019t get out of the water for 2 days. But I do think the lazy river could be kept a bit more clean of floating debris. Our overall stay was very enjoyable, but there a couple things I need to mention. First, who still charges $14.95 a day for wireless internet service? Are you kidding me! I had just come from 2 less expensive hotels in Arizona where it was free and worked well. I don\u2019t understand the logic of a 4 star resort having the rates they do and then still trying to squeeze out extra from their guests for internet service. Needless to say I didn\u2019t pay for it. Secondly, I was a bit unhappy with some off-duty lifeguards at Oasis who I overheard mentioning amongst themselves \u201cwe have to check the water levels\u201d and \u201cit works every time\u201d cutting to the front of the line of children, making their announcement, and then going down the slide head first in front of all of them, which is against the rules. As you can guess every child that witnessed this wanted to go down head first when their turn came, but were told they couldn\u2019t. My take on this is rules are rules for EVERYONE, and at no time should off-duty lifeguards be cutting in front of paying guests. Other than the things mentioned above, the resort is a great place to stay.

I ended up walking to the (empty) lobby where outside the golf carts were lined up. The hotel itself was fine but for a business traveler who got in around 9 at night and left at 7:30 in the morning to pay a $30 resort fee on top of the hotel rate is not worthwhile.

We live 30 minutes away from the Resort, so we get the amazing opportunity to stay there every few weeks or so. It is so affordable, and the customer service is the best I have ever received. They remember us all the time, and even those who don't, act like they do. We love the feeling of being spoiled while we are on a mini vacation. We feel like we have spent thousands of dollars and have only spent a couple hundred if you can believe it! We love it there, and we have fould a family vacation spot that comes first on our list! That is how highly we reguard this Resort! Do yourself a favor and pamper yourself.

From there the expierence kept getting better and better! When we first checked in the front desk was super fast and extreamly courteous` for all our needs and requests.

I was impressed by the number of pools that were within 100 feet from my room there was one on the 2nd (ground floor ) and one on the 1st floor ( sunken basement style ) not to mention the arcade! The Oasis water park is bar none the best resort water park we have ever visited; there was so much to do for all our kids that it made it a relaxing time for us adults as it kept them entertained. From the dedicated kiddie\u2019s pool with large splash pad to the bigger pool with volleyball, basketball and swimming to really cool wave pool, to the waterslides and the Lazy river there was never a dull moment. You should check it out over the summer when they have their entertainment with Grand Jam Dancers, fun and games, contests, Dj and a dive in movie. The best part was to see the little kids get up on stage and dace for about 3 hours with everyone. The Water Park was very well run, very clean, great food & buffet, friendly service, and entertainment.

ANY other hotel would have had a guy there in the middle of the night fixing the elevator. Not the Arizona Grand. Next, the hair dryer in the room started smoking and sparking and almost blew up right in my wife's hand. Nice. We ordered room service, the empty tray remained outside our door for over 24 hours. Our balcony had a pigeon that had set up it's nest directly on the ledge on our balcony - with its corresponding bird droppings which had never been cleaned up for months.

We had a wonderful time as a family but I can't give the hotel all the credit. The rooms were ok. Two room suites. TVs were old/small and there weren't a lot of frills. For us it was still ok. Small pools by each of the buildings was nice. The water park was a shock because of the crowds. Standing room only on Sunday. Felt like everything was dirty and crowded and not very relaxing. The next day was better. We got down to the water park at 9:00 am and there was a long line waiting to open at 9:30. However, we did get a nice spot and it made a big difference. Employee told me they have an average of 6000 people on a summer holiday. The food in the water park was WAY over priced and you can't bring anything in. Drinks almost $10- a corn dog was $6. I generally don't complain about the cost of hotel food but since it was a Stay-cation it bothered me more. The hotel has a well known restaurant at the top of the hill (hotel is at the bottom) called Rustler's Roost. I don't think I have ever had a good meal here but the atmosphere is amazing. Especially for you out of towners...you can see all of the valley and it is a spectacular view. The grandkids danced to the live band and went down the big slide. Kids ate free and our bill was cheaper than the pool grill. The cotton candy bouquet after dinner was all of our favorites. Entrees were just so-so. This is defintely an experience and not just a meal. Food was MUCH better at the mexican restaurant in front of the hotel \"Aunt Chiladas\".

The couch folded out to a queen size bed, where the kids ended up sleeping. Flat screen TVs, beautiful decor and very very CLEAN. The Oasis Water Park was a BLAST!

The primary reason for our trip to Arizona was the warm weather and sightseeing-not necessarily to use the facilities at the resort including the large water park. I chose it for the location of the resort; reasonable room rates and the reviews on TripAdvisor/Frommer's. We have previously travelled as a family to Iberostar and Beaches Resorts and to Atlantis among others. My wife and I have travelled to Sandals Resorts, Dreams Resorts, Sunscapes Resorts, etc. and I have reviewed most of these locations. This appears to be an older resort that has been extensively renovated. It is relatively large and does require some walking to the pools and restaurants. The buildings and grounds are well maintained and attractive. We rented a one bedroom suite that had a view of the mountains; golf course and ponds. The room had two queen beds in one room; a living room area with a pull out couch; one bathroom and a balcony for our family of five. The room was nicely appointed and had ample storage for our family. The balcony was a nice place to have a cup of coffee and read the paper in the morning. The carpeting and furnishing were upscale and appeared to be newer. The beds and bedding were very comfortable and the A/C was easy to use and effective. We were very pleased with the room and amenities considering the reasonable price we paid even when the $30/day resort fee was included. We had very few meals on site at the resort except one breakfast; morning coffee and two late night meals in the bar. We did not eat any of the many buffet meals that were offered. The service that we received in the bar and for breakfast was very good. It appears that most of the wait staff are college kids who were very friendly. The food and beverages were pricey but you are at a resort and the rooms were reasonably priced. The large gift shop area had a Starbucks that served coffee and snacks. However, the line was a little long in the morning. The water park would have great apeal for families with kids from age 5 to 15. We are a little past the top end of that range so we used the area mostly for laying in the sun. It was very crowded as it was Easter week during our visit. The water park is completely fenced in. Wrist bands are used for entry. The gates are opened to this area at either 9 AM or 10 AM based upon the day of the week. If you arrived around opening time you could go in; grab some towels and save chairs for your family. The fence around the water park and defined opening time may seem annoying to some one who hasn't travelled much but it is actually a good system. At least 9-10 AM is a reasonable time. At some resorts we have been at, you had to go out at 6 AM to reserve chairs or you were out of luck The water park was well laid out; had lots of chairs and pretty good food service. The water park included three slides; a lazy river and a few other pools. There was also some organized activities going on. You could actually have food and beverages served at your chair which is highly unusual for this type of set up. Again, the food and beverages in this area are pricey but were pretty good and the young college kids were the servers. We did not utilize the golf course or exercise areas during our trip. The resort is located about 10 minutes from the airport which was handy. Another, positive is that their is a large park with mountains adjacent to the property called South Mountain Park. The mountains are nice to look at and we did a little hiking in this area. However, the resort is located in a very urban area with busy roads; fast food joints and shopping areas...some which were not all that upscale. We stopped at a couple of these fast food places on our way out to an activity and they were a little scuzzy. Although you are in an urban area, you will not hear any road noises in the actual resort due to it's large size. There are lots of cool things to do with teenagers in the area (within an hour or two away) and include- 1) Horse Back Riding-Ponderosa Stables-we took the night time ride and dinner combo. This is very nearby the resort. Slow ride for beginners but a nice view of Phoenix after eating at a family type steakhouse. 2) Rafting down a river. Not exactly whitewater rafting but it was only 45 minutes away. Nice guides and nice scenery. Desert Voyages Guided Rafting. 3) ATVing in a national park. This was alot of fun. Again a very nice guide and beautiful scenery. Teenage boys will love this activity. Stellar Adventures. 4) Sedona. This area of red rocks is about two to two and a half hours north. Beautiful scenery especially if you take the drive (about 15 miles) north of Sedona up Oak Creek which has an elevation of 7,000 feet. We took the Pink Jeep Tour and did some hiking in the area. The town of Sedona is not very appealing. It is basically a collection of Tee Shirt shops. This area probably has some of the nicest scenery that I have ever seen and shouldn't be missed. 5) We also took a drive up to the Superstition Mountains and Apache Canyon Drive. This was a beautiful drive. I would highly recommend this resort and the excursions that we took. The rooms in the hotel are very comfortable; room price was reasonable; the staff was above average. Food prices were a little high (10-20%) but you aren't eating at McDonald's or Pizza Hut here. Also, the $30 resort fee is mandatory but not that big a deal when you consider the reasonable room rates.

Water Park was packed daily due to Spring Break - Lazy River ride was full of leaves and did not seem very clean on several of the days. Returned to room one afternoon and was \"locked out\" due to an error made by the front desk on my charge card for the daily resort fee. Staff seemed very \"put out\" to give us a ride back to our room once we spent 1/2 hr. waiting in line to clear up their mistake. Called the front desk one day to see where the Villa's Buffet resturaunt was located...walked all the way over to the resturaunt to find it closed. Walked back and called the front desk again ..only to be told it was only open for Spring Break which ended the day before. Pool hrs. also got shortened once Spring break ended...I didn't think that was fair to all families that stayed beyond Sunday and could have enjoyed the piece and quiet of the uncramped waterpark in the evening. Extra fee for Internet was another inconvience...Most Hotels offer it free..as well as the ECO Laundry Mat located on Rural Rd./Scottsdale Rd. You would think that the $30.00 daily fee would also cover the Internet.

Everyone pretty much liked the place. On the plus side - the food was very good and there are enough choices that you could eat exclusively at the hotel if necessary. The water park is great and was one of the main reasons we stayed here since I need to make sure my kids can be entertained. The Service is very professional at all times and very good, from the bellman to the waitresses at the pool or the restaurants. The rooms are decent, the beds are new. The resort is close to the highway so getting in/out is easy. There is a nature preserve next to the hotel which has nice hiking. This was a real bonus cause it made it easy for my family and I to take our first ever hike together. On the negative side - these are not really suites. There's only one bathroom, and it is accessed via the master bedroom. Also, the sofa bed was very uncomfortable for sleeping, so my kids had to split the week and if you need three beds, then you need to have two queens in the master, so there goes the parent's privacy. There's no kitchennete. The resort is in a pretty seedy neighborhood. Skip Rustler's Roost. It's a tourist trap. Also, we went Spring Break and there was a line forming an hour before the water park opened at 10AM so people could get chairs. There were not enough chairs, and a lot of people were layingon towels in the grass. THis is probably not a problem except two weeks out of the year, but you should know this. And oh yeah, taxes, tip, and delivery charges on room service add up to about 30%-40% on already high room service prices. All in all, I would/could recommend this hotel for the value, the food, the water park, the gym/spa, the nature preserve next door, and the service, but it is not a super premium resort and they are not true suites.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort to visit with your Family\u201d", "Author": "Sagnam", "ReviewID": "UR61094082", "Content": "We stayed here for the final 3 nights of our Spring Break in Phoenix.

Also, our room was typically not cleaned until very late in the afternoon each day which was sometimes an inconvenience. I did play golf at the Resort Course and was disappointed in it. There were no balls on the Tees at the Range. We had to go pick up balls ourselves to hit. Even when they sent someone over to pick up balls, he just continued to run up and down the range without immediately getting us some balls to use while he finished. The Course is short and had very slow, shaggy greens. Many of the holes on the front nine wind through a housing development. The back nine is a bit better with holes out in the desert. I played Whirlwind, about a day later for the same price, and it was much more scenic and enjoyable. We did enjoy some late nights in the Courtyard, next to the fireplaces, under 50ft Palm Trees.

My kids and I had a wonderful time here. They both enjoyed the Oasis Water Park, but as another reviewer mentioned, we needed to get there early to get chairs. On our first day, we weren't able to get to the water park until about 11:45, and we were barely able to find room enough to put our towels on a grassy area. Again it was spring break, so I imagine it would not be like this year round. The staff was very friendly and helpful! At one point I had read that there was a basketball court there, but when I asked one of the bellmen, he said it wasn't there any longer. When I asked for the location of a nearby park with hoops, he drove us to the main lobby in his golf cart, looked up the nearest location, and printed directions! That was very helpful, as we went to that park at least 3 or 4 evenings to play basketball. A couple of things that I found annoying were: 1) Although we were charged a $30 per day resort fee for amenities, this did not include wireless internet access. That was an additional $15 per day, but this was waived for me when I complained about it. 2) Housekeeping did not come at a consistent time each day. We drove to Sedona (a 2.5 hour drive) stayed there for a couple of hours, drove back, went to the pool, and still no housekeeping. They came anywhere from 11am through about 4:30pm. Although, the Oasis water park did not open until 10 am, the smaller pools near the rooms are open at 6 am, in case you have any early risers that want to get an earlier start.

The rooms are ok, but the views of the parking lot and no balcony's with chairs make you want to spend very little time in or around your room. The resort was not a terrible experience by any means but there were just several things that we'd change. One of the main issues is that the Oasis Water Park is open to the public. Imagine spring break time, a resort full to capacity and then everyone and their neighbor coming for the day to the pool. The water park opens at 10:00 am, people start lining up outside the gate at 9:00. The line goes for a mile. If you are not in line you will not find one chair in the entire water park to sit in. It was so frustrating for us, and very sad to see the families wandering around and around and having to either leave or sit on the cement ground for the day because they couldn't find a chair. For the money you pay to stay at this resort you should at least expect a chair to sit on. This is also true for the pools that are seperate from the water park. There was never enough chairs for even half the people. As far as cleanliness, I never saw anyone ever clean any of the pool areas. The water park was never hosed down and the chairs and tables were filthy. the side pools by the rooms were always filthy with leftover cups and food on the ground. I wouldn't be suprised if people got sick. The restaurants were clean though. As for positives, the food was good, there were plenty of things for kids to do, and the resort was not too loud at night and disruptive. The king bed was very comfortable and the pillows.

The terrasse has firepits. So it is a nice place to hang around with a coffee or a glass of wine. Except for the rooms, the resort looks tired and in need of refurbishments. It offers very little activities. The staff was at most ok, but certainly not what is expected in such a resort. The concept of resort fee seemed like a good idea to good a few basic things like the tips to everyone. In this case, it is $42 per day. That's is way too much. Sure it covers parking (I didn't have a car), internet access (good), access to the water park (ok), tips for the room maid, but no other tips.

No one ever answered the guest service line in less than 2 minutes. Lines for check in and out were pretty long. Wait at Lobby Grill was always long despite only half of the tables being occupied (tells me they don't have enough staff) -The golf course. The first nine was palatable, the back nine a joke. Most players don't even need to bother with woods on the back, it's so short. Seems like they didn't have enough room for a regular 18, so they crammed the holes in. Even at the $49 twilight rate, it isn't worth playing again. I wanted to say it might be good for kids and the elderly, but I don't see how they would enjoy it much, given how impossibly tight some holes are. -Parking.

My steak was OK- a little under med-rare for my taste and not seasoned that well, it needed salt at the very least. The corn was mushy but it was so busy that I didn't want to complain. The rest was good. We had a great time watching all the action, from the slide to the dancing, to all the people having birthdays. It was very loud and I would not reccomend this place for people hard of hearing or small kids who dont like loud places. But all in all, we are coming back to The Grand again for spring break. Be ready to spend some extra money for things, and tipping, but I think it was all well worth it. My kids didn't want to leave and neither did my husband nor I.

At first I was worried because the resort is right off of the highway, but we never had a problem with highway noise or view. Last year we stayed at the Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and although that place is nice, the Grand was just a better experience for us. Just behind the resort is a park where you can hike, \"trail jog,\" or mountain bike. The kids even found a beehive in one of the caves on the hike, much to their excitement. We paid $20 extra per night for an upgrade and stayed in the mountainside rooms, which I recommend. We did have to walk a short ways to get to the pool, but we didn't mind, as it seemed that our room was much quieter and more secluded. We had a great view of the golf course. With a family of five, having the extra living room area, with hideaway bed is a definate bonus. The kids loved the water park and we are somewhat of waterpark conoisseurs (sp?). It was better than we have experienced yet. There was a huge water slide, lazy river, and wave pool. There were lots of lifeguards on staff. The food at the pool is overpriced, so plan accordingly. The resort restaurant has great food. The best part are the fireplaces on the patio that overlooks the golf course. The staff were attentive and friendly. Definately a thumbs up. We will be back!!

We looked at a number of hotels within a pricerange of $300/night, but since we did not have many expecations other than getting a nice quiet room, we thought that the Arizona Grand offered a reasonably priced alternative. Unfortunately, the only welcoming thing about the hotel is the lobby. There is a nice seating area outside with gas-lit firepits which seemed very warm and welcoming. Also, the villas which are visible from the lobby area seemed very open and had a nice view away from all the concrete that surrounds the hotel, so we had great expecations. To our surprise, the first room we were offered within the Sedona complex was facing a parking lot and the noise from the hotel traffic was audible from the bedroom. All rooms were described as quiet by the reception staff, but the room that was offered to us certainly wasn't. We called the hotel front desk again, described what we wanted, and were moved to a different room in the same complex which still faced a lot of concrete walls, but at least was quiet. Both rooms in the Sedona complex had low ceilings, and it was difficult to get there. There are no elevators, so the only access is through stairs. The courtyard view is not really a view; all rooms essentially face the many stairs and walkways and people who are walking by essentially can look into the living room. For that reason, the blinds need to be closed when you want privacy, which also means that you need artificial lighting all day. However, the bedrooms were nicely done and the bathrooms were very clean. The biggest issue we have with the hotel which we complained about was in the end price. We have stayed and are able to afford higher prices, but then our expecations are much greater. In this case, the hotel was offered to us on the phone for $130 plus a $100 credit to be spend at the local restaurants. My wife called twice to make sure that we really understood what was offered to us. We thought this to be an adequate price for a hotel of that quality and location. However, in the end we were presented with a hotel bill of $610 for two nights. It turned out that the rooms were actually $199 plus tax plus $30/day resort access fee, which came out to close to $250. Even worse, when we ordered room service for breakfast, it was expensive to begin with, but when a 23% service charge is added automatically plus a $3 delivery charge, a generous breakfast for two people ends up costing $60. I don't think I ever paid as much for a roomservice breakfast, not even in the nicest downtown hotels in San Francisco or Boston. Since we originally thought the $130/night was very reasonable, I did not have a problem paying overpriced hotel restaurant food. A $14 Tuna tartare would - if generously portioned - not be a reason for a complaint at all, but when it essentially is a tiny amount in a plate that is only crushed ice, it gets a little ridiculous. All in all, I would not recommend this hotel, mainly from a perspective of price/value and the outragously high hidden charges. At a lower pricepoint, I think this place could be a good alternative.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver, co", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay at The Arizona Grand!\u201d", "Author": "Kara77", "ReviewID": "UR52081922", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at The Arizona Grand at the beginning of December and all I can say is \"wow what a fabulous resort\"!

Overall, it was a very nice place. Staff were very friendly without being overbearing. The resort itself was rather spread out so location is important. If you are attending a conference make sure you are located near the conference center. If you are here for the waterpark, stay near the water park. The rooms were nice, but I wouldn't call them 5 star. other posters are correct in describing them as Embassy Suite-like. They are functional but not plush. Bathrooms are very small, and having the sink outside the bathroom itself, placed it right in the middle of your bedroom, which entailed waking up anyone if you had to wash your hands at night. The water park is closed too early in the season. Despite being in the 90's, the park was closed. Although there were quite a few pools scattered about the property itself, the water being tolerable (as they were somewhat heated) and had jacuzzis attached to each pool. The lobby itself is very impressive, opening up right on the golf course, and at nice, with fires lit at each table, offered a nice ambience. The bartenders were great too. Prices were a tad high for food /drink. Food was nothing special, but we only ate once here. Plenty to do in the Phoenix area for kids. My biggest gripe (like many others posting here) is the resort fee. $30 plus tax is alot to charge. I laugh as you could tell the poor front desk clerks must get abused daily w/ questions. They give the scripted response\" we offer many amenities that are included in the fee\" Let's see: Water Park--closed Kid's Club: closed World Class Gym: Could not enter as they did not allow kids (Kid's club closed) Free Paper: USA TODAY wow big deal- plus no paper on Sat+Sun Free Internet: Cheap hotels down the street offer free internet plus a free breakfast. I'm sure when the waterpark is open that the fee is worth it, however, during the offseason, management should have a little common sense and reduce the fee. So overall, not a bad place, but go only if you are able to use the vast amount of activities offered at the resort. A word of caution to those unfamiliar with the area. If renting an auto, make sure you are very careful in inspecting your car and filling out the inspection form prior to taking the car. The Phoenix area is notorious for very narrow parking spots (the resort has very tight spaces) and most cars have a few side dings/scratches. Also check the windshield for any chips as it is very common to sustain windshield damage driving in the southwest.

Two months haven't gone by for years where I haven't gone somewhere for a weekend or more. I have written a few good reviews over the years, but I have NEVER written a scathing review as I am usually pretty tolerant of rules, but the rules here are inconsistent and silly. Let me also say I work in Law Enforcement, so I am not normally a rule breaker kind of person, and rules don't normally bother me, but if you can't be consistent then don't have them. Words can't describe how unpleasant this 3 day vacation was. Let's start with check-in. I was greeted at the desk by Anthony. Since it was 3 PM I was able to check in, but I was told instead of the room I booked which was to have two double beds and a pull out couch, they had a room with a king and a pull out couch. This didn't really work for me since I had my 3 teenagers, but I thought no big deal we will just get a rollaway. I was told by Anthony the resort doesn't have rollaways. I told him that wouldn't work because none of us wanted to go on vacation and sleep on the floor. Instead of apologizing he condescendingly said, \"Well, that's what you booked.\" I corrected him because my original booking I had requested a king as one of the teenagers wasn't going. However, two weeks prior I called the resort itself and changed it. Nonetheless I was informed I was stuck. Even though it would be expensive I requested to pay for an additional room, so there wouldn't be an argument over who was a floor sleeper, but they were sold out. Anthony told me I could get an additional room the following day. Finally, the one positive I have is the golf cart operators were wonderful and we tipped them handsomely as anyone who gives good customer service should get. Once I was through with the check-in process he handed me a small map. I asked him where my room was located and rather than point it out on the map he told me to go out front and ask the bellmen. I informed him my family wasn't out front, so I wasn't going that way and would he please tell me where the M building is. He once again replied that the bellmen were more familiar with the resort and they could help me. (It was 114 degrees and I wasn't going that way, so I wasn't too keen on this idea. Personally, I believe it is a ploy to get you to go outside where they would give you directions and then you have to tip them for it). I asked Anthony point blank, \"Do you personally know where the M building is?\" He once again directed me out front. Not wanting this young man to get my blood pressure up any higher I walked out front to ask the proverbial question of the bellman. However, I looked to the right as I exited the lobby door and WOW, there was the ever so hard to find M building. When we arrived at the door to our room, I noticed ants all over the outside of the doorway. This will come in to play later. We immediately went to the waterpark and had a good time. The lifeguards constantly told people to not enter the lazy river unless they were on the steps and not to jump in the tubes. This will also come into play later. My son and I went to the gym. It was a large facility for a hotel. The treadmills were a bit antiquated, but adequate nonthess and there was lots of other equipment to choose from. We ate dinner the first night at the Rustlers Roost on the property. Quite possibly one of the worst meals I have eaten in years. Virtually everthing on the menu is $20.00. Pretty standard for a steak, but my Fiance ordered a top sirloin that I kid you not we could barely cut in to. When he took a bite (he is a meat lover from the south) it was so chewy he couldn't even swallow. In 7 years I have never seen him turn away a steak. IN any case I have no problem paying $20 for a meal, but when you add 3 teenagers into the mix and the food is horrible, you don't generally feel good about spending over $100.00 for a horrible meal. Nobody at the table finished their meal, it was that bad. On the second day about midway through the day I went to go down one of the waterslides for about the tenth time when the girl working it said I had to take my necklace off. Considering I went down the slides the entire first day and numerous hours this day, this was a surprise to me. Not feeling comfortable holding a chain in my hand with a diamond on it while going down a gushing waterslide I told her now that I knew the rule I would not come up again with my necklace on gain, but I didn't want to lose it by taking it off. I was told I couldn't go down unless I took it off. So, I took it off. Funny thing is after telling me no jewelry on the slide, she let me go down with my rings on, my earrings and my watch on. Go figure. At the end of the day at the waterpark two of the lifeguards who had been around the lazy river all day were given a break. What is the first thing they did? You guessed it they JUMPED into the lazy river through the tubes AND they entered into the river in an area not designated for entry. They then rode down the river next to me splashing each other and flirting. Both of these individuals I had heard numerous times throughout the day yelling at various people they could only enter the pool from the stairs. I noticed there were no kids meals on the pool menu (not that my kids would eat them, but I don't think I have ever seen a resort not have kids meals). When I inquired, I was told they only offer kids meals on the weekends. So, if you have young kids watch out you will be paying full price for a meal your kid will never finish. We ordered room service and tipped the delivery person handsomely, only to discover they brought the wrong pizza and pasta. We were so hungry and it had taken 1 1/2 hours to deliver that I felt we couldn't turn it back. Besides, he had zipped out of the room before we could even check the meal. On day two after being in the river all day, we went to go check into the extra room. I made sure to steer clear of Anthony. Being in my bathing suit and cover-up I didn't have my wallet with me. I was told I couldn't check in without a credit card. Normally, this would make all the sense in the world, except they already had my credit card on file. Once again not good enough, that would be breaking the rules. My man gave them his crecit card. We travlel a lot and share expenses, but it had already been discussed previously that I would pay for this trip. Not wanting him to foot the bill I asked the clerk if I could pay for both rooms in the end on mine and he assured me that would be find. Okay this is long an drawn out, but the last item is that my kids woke up in the middle of the night to find the floor, nightstand and bedroom they were in COVERED in ANTS! This was the original room we checked into that had ants around the door they never did anything about. Additionally, this wasn't the room we had the room service delivered to, so it wasn't a matter of the ants trying to come in for food left around. When I went to check out I was lucky enough that there were only two clerks and one of them was Anthony. I told Anthony about the horrendous ant problem and he said, \"Thank you for informing us.\" Not, would you like to speak to a manager, would you like a free drink coupon, here is 50 cents for your trouble. He didn't say a word, just kept his fake smile on and continued the check out process. Not wanting to lose my composure I let the horrendous ant issue go. I told him although we had originally put a different credit card on the second room, I wanted to pay with min. I then handed said credit card to him. It shouldn't have shocked me, but the second room was charged to my fiance. Oh, one other thing. On the second day my teenage son and I went to the gym in the morning. Keith or Kevin (can't remember his exact name) greeted my son and asked him how old he is. My son is a few months shy of 16 which is the gym age, so he was informed he couldn't go in. I told the clerk that he had already used the gym. I also said I completely understand why they have an age rule as they don't want a bunch of teenagers running around or using the equipment incorrectly or possibly breaking it, but my son is in football and he is required to lift every day. I also informed him I would stand next to him and watch him forgoing my workout if I had to and that he was a mature young man. Nope, Kevin or Keith siad no way. I know this may shock people by now, but knowing how inconsistent the rules are enforced at the resort, my son went later that day and wasn't asked his age. He was able to go twice more without the RULE being enforced. I plan on sending this review to the General Manager of the hotel I will supplement the review with what response if any I get from him/her.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place for the whole family!\u201d", "Author": "enjoylifenow47", "ReviewID": "UR36804745", "Content": "We had a great time, we had children with us from age 5 to 15, eveybody had a great time even the parents!

After some initial problem with check-in when we were told the room we booked was not available (I paid extra $$ or an upgrade at the point of reservation) the clerk finally found us the room type we booked. We had requested (and paid for ) a room nearer our conference ballrooms as this hotel is very spread out and you could walk a very long time in the 110 heat or have to call a golf cart. In a nutshell we really enjoyed our stay and would return! The room was what I like: quiet, good natural light if the curtains are open, and pitch dark at night when the curtains are drawn. The beds were very comfortable, and the sheets and pillow cases were soft. There was a television in the sitting area and in the bedroom, even if they were a bit on the small size. The room was decorated in cheerful colors. We were in the Camelback section. The big plus is the fabulous lazy river pool where we circulated for well over an hour. There were more than enough bartenders at the bar by the pool, instead of the long wait at some hotels. All staff were accomodating. The lobby restaurant had terrific fresh food, especially the Ahi Tuna salad which I ate for a couple of meals and the club sandwich that my teenage daughter ate at two meals. The gals in the gift shop are gracious and since we have been to this hotel 4 times over several years I can say I think they are the same ladies who have always been there. There is a \"can do\" attitude among the staff, very appreciated. The only complaint is when I called to the desk ahead of checking out to tell them I would like to get a taxi to go to the airport and inquired if I needed to book in advance I was told just to come down to the lobby, that there are always taxis around. When we checked out and I asked for a taxi a limo was told to pull up and the bellman put our luggage in. When I asked if this was the taxi I was told it was the limo and it would take 20 minutes to get a taxi. If they had just told me my choices when I called the front desk I would have felt better about paying the extra $10 for the limo, or called a taxi 20 min in advance (which is why I called the front desk in the first place). I don't like being tricked. I even wonder if it would have taken 20 minutes to get the taxi as the airport is only 7 miles our about 10 minutes away.

We really liked the waterpark on the grounds. My favorite part was floating around in the lazy river. The girls liked the slides, but also liked hanging around in the pools at our building. On Friday and Saturday, the water park was very crowded, and it was hard to get a lounge chair or any shade. The rules prohibit any outside food or drink from coming in, but we found a way around that. We took cups from the bar, mixed our own drinks in our room, and walked right in with them. Sometimes they change cups, so you have to watch for that. My only complaint is that on the weekends, the river becomes really dirty from people tromping in and out with leaves and dirt on their feet. Overall, it was a good experience. However, the girls, at 17, are a bit old for the waterpark. Next time we will just stay in a nice resort with a regular pool. The $30 per day resort fee on top of the room drove the price up pretty high. We ate dinner at Rustler's Rooste, one of the restaurants on the property.

The suite was beautiful & much to my eight year old's delight, there was a Nintendo Game Cube system so he really did feel like he was at home!! The beds were the most comfortable we had ever slept in, just like sleeping on a cloud!! Everything from check-in to check-out was just exceptional, we would not change a thing!! There is one staff member that I have to mention by name, ADRIAN OLIVARES. When checking out I commented that we really enjoyed our stay & that we wished that the rooms weren't all booked so we could stay another night. The staff member that was helping me, Adrian Olivares, then went to speak to his manager & they were able to get us another night!! That was so wonderful of him to even ask for that to be done for us!! The fact that the manager was able to accomodate the request was just awesome!! Adrian definitely deserves praise for his exceptional customer service skills. His bright smile & warm demeanor was so great to see. It was greatly appreciated & we will DEFINITELY be returning for subsequent visits!!! KEEP UP THE EXCEPTIONAL WORK ARIZONA GRAND - WE APPRECIATED ALL YOU DID TO MAKE OUR STAY SO WONDERFUL!!! Thanks again for making our 4th of July weekend a very memorable & fun experience for our family!!!

The staff will take you around in a golf cart -- but that takes time to arrange and the bell staff may be busy. Some have commented negatively about the location in South Phoenix.

I have a 3 year old and an 11 year old, so to find a place that entertains them both is rare....but the Arizona Grand did it! The Oasis water park was WONDERFUL!! It was completely gated with plenty of lifeguards, so I felt 100% comfortable letting my 11 year old go off on his own with the friends he met while I splashed with my 3 year old in the wave pool. The people at the Grand were incredibly friendly and helpful. We stayed in the Sedona section, and besides the water park being a very short walk, there were two other pools, one out the front door and one we could see from our balcony!! There were always plenty of clean towels and the place was spotless. Only a few cons, which I just thought I'd mention, so my post is not dismissed as being completely biased. The food on the resort is EXPENSIVE!! Over $40 for lunch!! There was once or twice when the room was still not cleaned by 2:30, and for anyone with a tired 3 year old badly in need of a nap, that could be an issue. Also, we had a slight mix up on check in. We arrived late at night and were given a room with one king bed...there were 4 of us!! I called the front desk and we were immediately moved to a room with two double beds. They were VERY accomodating, but after hours of travle with a tired toddler, it would have been nice to have been given the correct room from the start.

We ate at the Rooster, Sports Bar and the Mexican Restaurant. Service and food was fantastic at all 3. The shuttle service to the restaurants and around the resort was a great addition, especially on the night it turned cool while we were at dinner and we did not want to walk from the restaurant back to our room. The room was perfect and clean with the right number of towels without us having to request. This is something you do not find most places today. Parking was never a problem, and we were able to park near our room. The pools were clean. We really enjoyed the adult only pool and hot tub in the evening. It gave us a place to go as a family and not disturb the other families with young children using the regular pools. My daughter used the exercise room and took classes every morning. My husband and daughter also enjoyed the walking trail. The location was great and centrally located to the spring training ball parks we went to. Our only regret was that we did not stay longer.

My parents meet us there and stayed a few rooms down. Overall I thought the resort was very nice and we all enjoyed ourselves. I probably don't have much new to add but will provide my two cents. The resort is big and spread out but I didn't consider it a big deal. The weather is great and I personally enjoyed walking around and what's wrong with a little exercise. The resort is right in the middle of town but I never noticed it while in the resort and when we ventered out is was nice to be close to things. The resturant situation on the resort is very limited. We had a car so we didn't eat at the resort for any meals. If you didn't have a car and had to eat here every meal I could see that being an issue. The waterpark was great. We would spend most of the day there then go back to the quite pool by our room. This is definetly a great place for kids. My dad an I played golf at the resort twice and finished in 3 1/2 hours both times. We found the course to be challenging with great views. A hint on this. You can book your tee times online at one of the discount golf sites for half what they will charge you if you book through the pro shop. I think it was like $100 a round through the pro shop and we paid $59. Construction was going on right outside our room which was pretty annoying but it looked to be about done so it shouldn't be an issue much longer. They waived our $30 facility fee due to being woken up early each morning. The resort was pretty empty so I'm not sure why they didn't just put us somewhere else. Anyway, it wasn't that big a deal. The new Villas looked really nice and when we go back we will probably look to book one of those. The access to South Mountain park was very cool and we went hiking each morning. One other suggestion. You can rent a car from Enteprise (I think it may have been National) at the resort and its much cheaper this way as you don't pay all the airport fees. They will bring it to you and you drop it off there so you never have to leave the resort to get it.

Shoe print on the bedroom wall, large dead bug on the wall behind the door. The bedroom \"patio\" was laughable. It was basically just a small walkout balcony with no seating. Our room was on the second floor at the end of a corridor near the service elevator, with the stairway right outside. At the bottom of the stairway, was where the linen service truck picked up the carts of dirty linens. The view from our bedroom \"patio\" consisted of a parking lot along a busy road, with carts filled with dirty linens, and an occasional visit from the linen service truck for 10-15 minutes or so while they loaded the carts. The resort seemed understaffed and the staff was not overly friendly. Cleaning carts were in the corridors from morning til night. The first night when we went to dinner, there was a towel on the ground outside our room. It was still there in the morning. We had coffee by our pool in the morning and there was a table next to us where someone had eaten breakfast and the tray of dishes and food was left on the table. It was still there when we went to dinner at 5:00 and when we returned we saw someone finally going to clean it up. I chose this resort partly for the waterpark, but my 12 year old son was unimpressed. There was inadequate seating available. We finally found seats only to have a group of older teenage boys come over and tell us that they had left towels on them earlier to reserve them. Once we found new seats, we actually enjoyed sunbathing there. After waiting unsuccessfully for food service at our seats, I went to the bar to order lunch for my son. The french fries were cold when we got them. At 6 am the morning we left, I went down to the parking lot to load our suitcases in the back of the vehicle. I discovered that someone had bent the rental car license plate up completely over the top bolts, and there was some type of a service bin lying in the middle of the parking lot behind the vehicle next to ours.

I was familiar with the property when it was the Pointe at South Mountain, although my memory was very dated and vague (15+ years). We tried to get our pre-paid money back but were unsuccessful. My husband spoke with the Manager, several times, who assured us he would look out for us. When we arrived we were cheerfully greeted by everyone- the bell hops/car valets, the front desk and the Manager on Duty. We were given a room that was in the recently completed Villas. It was marvelous (and my standards are high). Brand new, spacious, beautiful kitchen, HUGE bathroom, lovely bedroom, patio overlooking the water park, and living area with sleeping couch for my son. Everything was in mint condition. Even new flat screen TVs. The water park is marvelous and our 11 year old son was happy to be there most of the day. Adults can get aways from the craziness at the water park (I mean, people running for pool chairs? Come on!) by hanging out at the Spa pool and I saw another Adults Only pool in a seperate location. The location right next to South Mountain park made me happy because I was able to get my morning hikes in on a very different terrain. The Gym/Spa were large and had plenty of equipment. Only ate breakfast on property twice - both times the food was only adequate. Otherwise we did not eat on property. The golf seemed OK - the golf staff was marvelous. There were no tennis courts which was disappointing because the website listed 10 tennis courts. I had a massage which was done quite well and reasonably priced. I agree with other reviewers that the property is large - if you are staying away from the water park entrance or the Phantom Horse Grill and Gym/Spa area then you do have a walk. We were conveniently and centrally located in front of the park and beside the gym. In terms of managing expectations - the overall property location is lousy (except for aforementioned South Mountain Park). It is right on the I-10 highway, and in the middle of strip mall heaven. Its about a 20+ minute drive to Scottsdale. On the upside, it's 2 miles from Tempe Diablo Stadium, and we did have Angels Spring Training tix!. Also, there is not much \"plush\" or luxurious about the property. The spa is adequate but not luxurious. What little spa amenities there are, are cheesy (e.g., generic brand baby powder, no shower gel in the showers, no lotion....). The food we had was sub-average, the landscaping is so-so, and the overall ambience is very \"mall-like\". But, again, we had a great room at a good value. Having the kitchen helped a lot with saving money on breakfast and snacks. There was construction still going on. It looked like they were putting the finishing touches on the new lobby/restaurant/golf club. It should be very nice when completed. It looked close to being done when we were there in late March 2009. Finally, the staff was very cheerful and friendly. Every last one of the people I interacted with was helpful and seemed to be pleased to be serving the Guests. I even saw the maid inside the shower stall spraying it to make sure it was totally clean.

I've used Trip Advisor in the past and want to give back so I hope you find this review helpful. This course is pretty tough - bring a lot of balls if you're anything more than a 20 handicap. The greens were ridiculously slow and really took away from our enjoyment of the course. I paid $200 for my 13 year old and myself which is steep. The course offers good variety and blends between links and desert style. It's also very close to the freeway on a few holes which is a bit distracting and noisy. We started our round and did not see a single beverage cart until the 17th hole which was a real bummer. Go figure! Prices are standard for Resorts where you are pretty captive. You really need a car to get to anything off resort unless you want to dare the 6 lane higways and massive intersections to get to 'Claim Jumper' or 'Joes Crab Shack' down Baseline. The service was very spotty. Most servers were fairly content just doing what they were told and nothing more. The rooms were very clean and spacious with balconies. One drawback for us was proximity to construction of the new lobby which is 'supposed' to be complete on 4/9/2009. We never tried to change rooms because it wasn't really a distraction except when going to the main lobby through some of the construction area which was a bit of a hassle and not something you want to endure on vacation at a resort. The construction workers were exceptionally cordial as you passed by which made the inconvenience less unpleasant. The gym was outstanding - probably the best part was the many classes offered throughout the day. There's also a great lap pool at the gym. Each complex also has its own pool and jacuzzi which gives you the chance to really get away if you want some quiet. The Oasis Water Park was great and offers all sorts of activities from the lazy river to basketball/volleyball to dive in movies during the evening. 'The biggest drawback here was the service (it was just about impossible to get anyone to help us and worked best to just get it yourself) and most of the 'lifeguards' who are predominantly Asian transplants and exceptionally subdued. At one point, I went down one of the waterslides and lost my magnetic bracelet (a personal item). I asked the lifeguard if he saw a bracelet come down - he said 'there's nothing check the front desk'. It was bizarre to say the least. When I tried to engage him, it was clear he had little grasp of english and even less interest in helping me so I gave up. The lifeguards appear to be on duty to police the activity in the lazy river making sure everyone has an inner tube as required by lazy river law. This seemed to be their mission and they were quite dour with a few exceptions. Blech! I would say the service at the Oasis water park was the worst part of the trip but the water park itself was exceptional! We stayed 4 nights. Per night we paid $239 + $30 taxes + $30 'Resort Fee' which is for the wi-fi cloud hanging over the resort (very very slow and sometimes hard to use), the USA Today paper, the water park and minor amenities.

I would definitely recommend the resort and I think it deserves 4 stars. ATMOSPHERE: The grounds are beautiful with lots of flowers, greenery and fountains everywhere, also outdoor fireplaces & chimineas (sp?). The buildings are laid out nicely around courtyards and each area has its own smaller pool & hot tub in addition to the water park (we stayed in the \"Camelback\" rooms which are right by the water park, which makes it easy if you have small children). OUR ROOM: The room was very nicely decorated (they have graciously resisted the ubiquitous turquoise & mauve \"desert southwest/pueblo\" decor in favor of soft beiges, golds & whites). All the furnishings, finishes & fixtures (paint, wallpaper, carpet, plumbing, etc.) looked new and fresh and updated. The bed was very comfortable and the towels were nice and thick. There was a nice patio on the back with french doors where my son could run around and play. The soundproofing seems good, we did not ever hear our neighbors. You park fairly close to your room which is convenient. All rooms open to the outside, but don't let that make you think it is not a nice place, it is. WATER PARK: Good-sized with a large wade-in wave pool, volleyball/basketball pool, kiddie pool with fountain play area, very large hot tub, lazy river and 3 water slides. STAFF: In every encounter we had w/staff , they were friendly and helpful, from the bellhops to the concierge to the wait staff and housekeeping. FOOD: A little overpriced, but that is expected at a resort property. The water park food I would say was \"OK\", as was Aunt Chilada's (but I live in Dallas where there is an abundance of outstanding tex-mex). The Phantom Horse Grill was excellent every time with a very nice atmosphere inside and out, including a nice roomy deck with torches & firepits. Rustler's Rooste had probably the best steak we've ever had and fabulous sunset views of the mountains surrounding Phoenix. There is a small coffee bar in the lobby which has muffins, cold cereal, and sometimes salads & sandwiches for lunch, but it is only open until 1:00 p.m. They should expand this into a more full-service cafe to provide families with a better option for quick take-away food vs. a sit-down restaurant and also a place to get hot chocolate or maybe an ice cream in the evenings. The resort is right in the City of Phoenix, so it is possible to go off-property for food fairly easily if you have a car. FOR FAMILIES: I think it's a good resort for families, even w/very young children. It would be nice if there were some kind of playground onsite, however there is a nice city park w/playground a couple of miles down the road, but we were not told about it when we called to ask if the resort had a playground. In lieu of a playground, there is lots of space on the grounds for leisurely strolls with toddlers. They do have a nanny/babysitting service for a fee, but we did not try it.

I terms of in-suite amenities it seemed to be lacking to me, for example, no shower gel, no bathrobes, cotton wool or shower cap, all things one would expect from a 4-star hotel, or even from a run-of-the-mill B&B. For a single traveller or a couple it is really not necessary to have a suite, though I can see the appeal if you have kids. All this serves to do is make all the rooms very expensive for the sake of a sofa, coffee table and extra TV that I didn't use at all. I am British, and I found the service levels a bit OTT. I do not require a golf cart to transport me to the bar, when it is all of a 3 minute walk away. I resent being forced to use a high-end sedan car rather than a regular cab, and then pay through the nose for it because the bellman takes a cut of the fare. I would advise against travelling to DownTown Phoenix for a night out, it is miles away and costs a fortune in taxi fares, and there is really nothing there. According to the taxi driver on the way home, it is better in Tempe (which is also a bit closer) but we didn't try this. The hotel restaurant is pleasant, but overpriced. Aunt Chilada's is pretty good, and cheaper. We also went to the Rustler's Rooste which is the only other place within walking distance of the hotel, but I don't think it is part of the resort itself.

The location of the resort on the egde of South Mountain Park is good for outdoor activities - we did some hiking and horseriding, which was very nice, and there is also a golf course (though note this is not as nice as the photos on the website would have you believe). Everything here is expensive. I know the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is not favourable right now, but even when it was, I would say this place is on the pricey side and I can only assume this is because it is a resort and people tend to stay put so they have a captive market.

So when you talk about the hotel 'pool' you have to specify which of the six or seven you are talking about. They have lots of hottubs and even a very large waterpark attached on the south side of the property. They are true suites. So they have a living room with a sofa that converts to a pull out bed AND a separate bedroom. The rooms have a bit of a Southwest feel to them but its not overpowering. The rooms are well appointed and have very nice soft beds. There are kids activities and even a special kids room where during the high season you can drop off the kids for an adventure of their own without their parents while the parents can take a little time off to be with each other. There are lots of lobbies, seating areas and gathering spaces all over the resort so there is plenty of room to stretch out and not feel cramped.

What a surprise to find a beautiful well maintianed resort with a professional and very accomodating staff. We arrived before check in time, with no problem they gave us our room. A valet drove us to our room and helped us with our bags. We then went to the Oasis Water Park which was a fantstic attraction for both my 3 year old and my 11 month old. We spent both Saturday and Sunday at the waterpark. The lazy river was the hi-light for both children. With Seasonal hours the Oasis was closed the rest of the week so my husband golfed the resorts' course on Monday. He is a pretty avid golfer, golfing at least 3 times a month, and he was pleasantly surprised with this challenging course. It had recently been reseeded so the entire course was flawless. Very impressive course! We were at the resort during their off season, so there were very little crowds anywhere we ventured in the resort. The restaurants were great as well. The Rustlers Roost was a hit with my 3 year old since it is decked out with cowboys, a live bull in the front of the restaurant, and a tin slide in which you can enter the dining area. The Rainforest Cafe is down the street from the Resort, and the Resorts Aunt Chiladas Mexican restaurant had wonderful service and great Mexican food.

This is one of those megaresorts that has everything: wave pool, water slides, lazy river, movie by pool side at night, etc. They also offer kids tattoos, animal balloons, and caricature drawings during the day. This resort is ideal for families who want activity, over service. Service was lacking for us. For example, the balloonist at the pool was extremely unfriendly and decided to cut the line in front of my daughter, twenty minutes before the time he said they were closed! This happened to us two days in a row. Hmmm... The bell desk also kept giving away our transportation to someone else, despite the fact that we called each time and made reservations for specific pick up times. The guests who were given our rides told us that they did not. One time, we had to wait 20 minutes for the next car and almost missed our reservations. For the price, this resort was a good deal (our toddler loved it) but I guess for those who want better service, smaller boutique-styled resorts that are more service-oriented are the way to go. If you do give this resort a try, stay in the Camelot or Sedona buildings since they are closest to the water park. Camelot is closer to the spa and Phantom Horse Grill (best restaurant on site, IMO, with a view of the city). Each building has its own adult-only pool and family pool. This was especially nice during those times when the water park was so packed, we couldn\u2019t find any empty chairs. The food at the Phantom Horse Grill was better than the other restaurants we tried -- nice way to end the evening by enjoying a meal by the firepit with city views. We also tried Aunt Chilada\u2019s, which was pretty good, especially the tacos and chips/salsa. The food at the pool side Oasis was horrible (philly steak sandwich, hotdogs with dried out hard buns, and wings), but I didn\u2019t expect much since it was convenient and quick. Ruslter\u2019s Roose offers cowboy-style fare, like fried chicken, ribs, steaks, etc. The food was pretty good there and the dining experience great for families (indoor slide and balloonist, who was extremely friendly and attentive, who made balloons for the kids while you ate). We also ordered room service for breakfast. It was average and really pricey but service was quick. I just wish they offered more options for breakfast at this resort. Also, the resort offers horseback riding if your children are 6 yrs old and up.

The best part of the whole stay and definitely worth the stay was the water park. Being able to relax poolside with a few drinks and know your kid is having a blast made this weekend getaway great. We will definitely be going back despite the negative things I listed. The things listed didn't make me not want to be there or make me not go back. They were just things that a 4* hotel would have.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Valley, NJ", "Title": "\u201cFun in the Phoenix Sun\u201d", "Author": "WRC6", "ReviewID": "UR16116093", "Content": "This huge and really nice resort is located just south of Downtown Phoenix, off I10 at the Baseline Road exit. With its large on site waterpark, it\u2019s obvious that the place is a big draw for families with kids. It\u2019s also a business friendly place with lots of conference facilities, etc. To management\u2019s credit, this is one place that does an excellent job of balancing the somewhat disparate needs of families with kids with those of visitors seeking grown-up style comfort, relaxation and elegance. WHAT WAS GOOD: The Oasis waterpark was absolutely awesome. It was clean, well staffed, well managed and a ton of fun for our whole family....Rooms in the Camelback Suites building were newly renovated, nicely decorated and very comfortable....The pool areas inside the courtyard were beautifully decorated, meticulously maintained and very comfortable. The grounds throughout the resort, in fact, were beautifully landscaped and nicely maintained, with many elegant touches like fountains, lush desert southwestern style plantings, etc....The staff seemed genuinely friendly and was very helpful....We were able to secure an early check-in time, which was particularly important since our stay was limited to just one night, and we wanted our school age boys to get the most out of the waterpark. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER: We had a slight glitch with the check-in process. Although one of the two rooms we reserved was available for early check-in, the second room didn\u2019t become available until nearly dinner time. Though this didn\u2019t spoil our afternoon or alter our plans, it was hard to fathom how the staff could\u2019ve dropped the ball so badly on this one....Service at the Phantom Horse Grill was friendly but very slow....I had some strange happenings with the resort\u2019s online reservations system: first it took several days to receive a confirmation, prompting a phone call on my part; then I received a bizarre e-mail following our stay stating that my room cancellation request had been successfully processed (no harm, just plain weird). THINGS TO KNOW: This is a huge and sprawling resort that has over 600 rooms and covers a great deal of space. Expect to do some serious walking or even take the car in some cases to reach certain parts of the property....The location is very convenient \u2013 we booked this place, in part, due to its proximity to the airport. Don\u2019t worry about airport noise, however - despite that proximity, you\u2019d never know you\u2019re just ten minutes away by car....As other reviewers have mentioned there are a ton of kids here so expect plenty of company from the Nickelodeon set....When the waterpark shuts down (6:00 pm during our stay; later during the summer months), the otherwise quiet pool areas get barraged, at least temporarily....Pools are open until something like midnight, taking advantage of Phoenix\u2019 alluring evening temperatures. Though noise was never an issue during our stay, I could see where a loud gathering around the pool could be an annoyance, especially for rooms on the lower levels....There was a ton of construction going on during our stay due to the addition of several new villas. It wasn\u2019t disruptive in any way, just kind of unsightly at times. BOTTOM LINE: This is a great place to spend a day or two, especially if waterslides, lazy tubing rivers and wave pools are your thing. Its proximity to the airport makes it an excellent starting or finishing point for any trip to Arizona passing through Sky Harbor. Not surprisingly, my kids labeled it the greatest hotel stay ever, causing me to look the other way at any minor shortcomings. Pure and simple \u2013 grown-up enough and lots of fun for all.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cSome issues,yes.

The room was very clean and had all the items you would want. The actual mattress...extremely comfortable!!! Aunt Chilada's Mexican Restaurant....Muy Bueno! Everything we had there was great and our waiter, Thomas, was fantastic. The Oasis Water Park is clean, well staffed and a fun way to spend the day. There are flags on the back of the lounge chairs that when you want something to drink or eat...you just raise the flag and they'll come running. They were very quick to arrive and very polite. Bring some $$$ though, It can get pricey quick. Think movie concession prices. Caring and helpful staff. I had several complaints, and they addressed them the best they could and were always professional and sympathetic. Now the bad...(in my opinion) There are a lot of kids at this resort. A lot. Noise is a HUGE factor. This may sound weird...but they have the worlds most crunchiest sheets I've ever felt. It was like sleeping under a newspaper. Thank goodness, the bed itself was so comfortable. the pillows are down and they look so nice and fluffy on the bed, but after a minute, its like wearing feather ear-muffs, with the feathers disbursed to each side of your head and your neck on a pancake thin layer of feathers. If you can...bring your pillow from home. The Phantom Horse breakfast buffet...runny eggs and barely cooked sausage...however, in fairness, you can order alacart off the menu and the people who I saw did that, their food looked pretty good. The restuarant has nice atmosphere and great views. The patio would be a great place to eat at sunset. Did i mention how many kids there are at his resort? How they like to run up and down the corridors? Oh, i did? Ok...sorry. Needless to say, my initial stay at the resort was anything but peaceful and restful. It would be nice if the resort had at least one of their buildings designated as \"adults only\" for those who are looking for a more relaxed atmosphere. I contacted the General Manager, Paul Gray after my stay to discuss my disappointing weekend at the Grand. He not only listened to my concerns and disappointments. He was very quick to offer a solution and sincerely sounded like he wanted to make right anything that didn't go right the first time. I think that type of personal customer service is rare and because of his follow-up, I'd even give the Grand another chance to impress. Anyone who cares enough to follow-up and try to make things better, is probably someone who cares that you were there in the first place! So, my first stay...not so good, but I'm encouraged, the next time will be better. I'll keep you posted. :O) KW", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cyou call this a resort?!?!\u201d", "Author": "nauticaevr", "ReviewID": "UR15411174", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel about 3 weeks ago and it was the worst time I have ever had at a hotel before.

The resort is kid friendly, with a large water park with slides, river pool and wave pool. As a result, expect a lot of families with kids. The room was a suite as I think all the rooms are. Bathroom is a little small. We were in the Sedona Building, room 433. Had a view of an interior courtyard even though I requested a pool view. Room was in good condition, but maid service was sketchy. The maid finally showed uo the second day at almost 5pm, so we opted for clean towels only as we had just come back from the pool and wanted to get cleaned up. For some reason the hotel doesn't supply \"do not disturb\" signs for the doors. There is construction going on at the property to add buildings. It didn't really bother us. Most room had balconies which are basically un-usable because there is no furniture on them and they are small. Over all, the resort was ok.

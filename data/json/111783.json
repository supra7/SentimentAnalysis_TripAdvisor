We ate breakfast 3 times at the hotel's restaurant and got prompt, pleasant service each time. Our children loved the open air restaurant and the daring birds that would wait to be feed scraps. The breakfast prices were a bit high, but we got a discount for staying at the hotel so it evened out. The location of the hotel was the best part! We were right along the water and we got front row seats for watching the fireworks out over the water. We could walk next door to the artist's market. One morning, I got up early and went for a walk in the downtown area. It was peaceful to watch the small town waking up.

It is situated right in front of the harbour, giving easy access to water activities including whale watching(the boat docks right across the street!). The hotel also has a great restaurant with the most friendliest staff I have met! They are all smiles and are always ready to help! The hotel is also situated smack in the middle of the main street making it very convenient to just walk out to shops and restaurants. This also does mean that it gets slightly noisy at night. I had trouble falling asleep some nights due to the noise from the bars and restaurants around the hotel. But, unless you're on a trip for pure relaxation away from all the noise, you just can't beat the location! Another important point is that there is no elevator going up, which means that you will need to lug your stuff up some steep stairs.

We chose it as we were doing two of the cruises offered by the Pacific Whale foundation, and were able to walk out of the front of the hotel, and almost right on to the boat. The Inn sits beside a huge banyan tree and park. You are at one end of the main drag, Front Street, so everything is within walking distance. We were able to get from the airport to here by the (highly recommended!) bus system for just $2/person! From the bus stop behind the Wharf building it is just a 3 minute walk to the hotel. Check-in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very smooth. We were politely greeted by the desk clerk who had our reservation at hand. She gave us the lay of the land, explained how to charge to the room, gave us the 15% off dining coupon which we could get more of, and answered our questions, all in a welcoming manner. We also were told that we could get a 15% discount at Hula Cookies and Ice Cream, just around the corner (highly recommended!). Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect hi-tech or chic! This building is over 100 years old (also no elevator, but just one flight of stairs), and that does show in places. We booked a harbor view (the other view being the hotel courtyard), but this would more accurately be described as a park view. You can see the harbor quite well, but the majority of your view is the park across the street. However, there is a very nice sized lanai with table and chairs, which is a nice place to sit of an evening. Just be sure to keep your balcony door locked, as the lanai are all joined, divided only by low wooden railings. A safe in the room would also be a welcome addition. The room is pretty plain, and could probably do with a makeover, but is serviceable. Old fashioned TV, but it worked and had a decent basic cable lineup. As other reviewers have said, the AC can be loud, but it never woke me up, and the fan was fine for most of the time. The other loud noise for those with a room overlooking the park is the birds that gather at dawn/dusk. Not too bad at dusk, but may wake you at dawn if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the A/C on (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wake me). Bathroom, as with bedroom, is fine but nothing special. Toiletries were provided but were run of the mill Best Western. Restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We ate breakfast here a couple times and enjoyed it. The service was good; the waitress was quick with the coffee refills. The food was a little over priced, but then you are in Hawaii and you are paying for more than the cost of your food. The views are great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coffee and excellent pancakes while watching the harbor can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. The only downside was the rather loud parrot in a cage in the bar! We also partook of the Happy Hour here which is excellent! Really good value and the bartender is super friendly. They have a good selection of draft beers (the Big Wave is recommended), and for the cocktails, he does not hold back on the alcohol! Nothing can beat having a good drink whilst watching the sunset over the harbor right from your barstool. Amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Not many! But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather have the antique plantation charm of the building as is than a characterless nondescript concrete monolith just to have an Olympic pool or fitness center. If that is your bag, go up the coast to the resorts. There is a pool, but it is small. There is WiFi in the rooms. The courtyard is nice, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compete with the views of the harbor or the shade of the Banyan tree in the park. Checkout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Accurate, polite fast and efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what else could you want? Overall, I loved staying here.

Trying to compare it to that style of Kaanapali type hotel, as many reviewers have done, is really not fair because in truth, no, it is not as nice. But it will also run you half the price. So as long as you consider what you are paying, you will not be unhappy with your choice. The room was smallish, but comfortable for three, very clean and recently remodeled. There is a little bit of street noise, but it dies down in the evening. Actually being right in the middle of Lahaina town is the fun part. Front Street is an awesome experience, and you will be minutes walk to restaurants, shops, grocery stores, etc. AC cools the room down just fine and does not turn off and on by motion sensor as some one previously stated. It does make some noise being a wall unit, but no more then any other wall unit type of air conditioning employed by many a chain hotel. We actually felt the noise a bonus. If you are being bothered by outside sound like music from the restaurants, early morning harbor traffic, or the birds in the Banyon Tree, just close the door and turn on the AC to drown it out, and sleep like a champ.

On the northwest side, Kaanapali is where all the resorts or most of the resorts are located while Lahaina is the historic town where shops, art galleries and restaurants are situated. To the north of Lahina and Kaanapili is Napili, where developments occurred earlier and where condos are situated but where one can also have excellent views, beaches and where that good restaurant The Gazebo is located . On the south is Kihei where most condos are as well and further south is Wailea where some luxury resorts are. We've already spent a week or so in Honolulu and on the North Beach when we decided to explore Maui. Pioneer Inn is a centrally located and offered good value ($119 per night) and I heeded the advice of one of the Trip Advisors to stay either in Kaanapali or Lahaina. We also realized that we would not be staying most of the time at the hotel to explore Maui.The truths - it's true that the airconditioner feels like there is a loud person in the room. It is also equally true that the walls seem to be thin enough to hear the people next door. Room 30 was our room and we have to tell you that it does not have a refrigerator. Good thing that we have a huge cooler from Costco (it is within the airport area so Costco members note this because you can get your supplies from here)! It is also true that Pioneer Inn is by the wharf where you can watch the sunset and that it overlooks a centuries old gorgeous banyan tree. It is also close by art galleries, grocery stores and restaurants. In short, it is conveniently located. It maybe a bit of a drive from Haleakala and Hana as compared to Kihei and Wailea but as I've said I agree with the other Trip Advisor who suggested to stay on the Northwestern side (Kaanapali and Lahaina). If you're looking for resort type accomodations, please don't expect it at Pioneer Inn. Also, if you're flying straight from the mainland and looking for a great beach that is steps from the hotel, this is not the place for you.

However, if you've ever been to Lahaina, you realize quickly that it gets very hot. Being located in the heart of the city doesn't make this location cooler. So you will use the window unit. That's would be ok, except that it works by cooling for about 3-5 minutes then clanking off extremely loudly. Kept us awake most of the night. Also, like a reviewer wrote a while back, it has a motion detector feature where it gets very hot in the room while you are asleep (at least it stops clanking), so you wake up sweating, get up and move around, and then the cooling, clanking begins again. In the room next to ours, they moved a roll-away bed out to the lanai and slept there. We thought maybe the hotel didn't know about it...no, the next morning we sat out on our lanai, the rollaway bed sitting unmade next to our lanai.

We were sad to see that the sailing ship, The Carthaginian (see photo taken July 2005), had been removed permanently from its mooring in front of the hotel and scuttled as an artificial reef, but it still can be found on the hotel's T-shirt photo. The combination of the historic light tower, wharf, the Carthaginian, and the century-old giant banyan tree and red-and-white hotel building protected by palm trees and a tall green volcanic ridge appear in many paintings and on postcards.

We tried the discount coupon at the hotel's popular restaurant for breakfast, but we got a reluctant server, and they were out of English muffins. A minor quibble: macadamia nut pancakes cost $2.50+ more than regular ones, but tourists wanting to try a \"local dish\" will find just one or two crushed macadamia nuts on top of a regular pancake, which seemed a bit much considering you could make your own and have lots left over from a small tetrapak of macadamia nuts that sells everywhere for 69 cents.

Since I was going to Maui on my latest trip alone I decided to be a bit more economical and stayed at the Pioneer Inn. I'd noticed it on previous visits and a co-worker who had stayed here recommended it. The rates are comparatively very good and the location is great since I'm a big fan of Lahaina. I stayed here for 5 nights in Sept. '06 when I was on Maui for the marathon weekend races. The race starts were just a short drive up the coast...maybe 10 mins. tops which wasn't a problem at all. Not having a beach right outside my door wasn't a problem either in my case especially since I love putting the windows down on my rental car and turning up some local tunes on the radio and enjoying the drive. I went to several different spectacular beaches all up and down the coast which I think is the best way to see Maui anyway. I'd do this even if I were at one of the higher end resorts. While at the Pioneer Inn I really enjoyed getting up for sunrise in the mornings and sitting on the seawall which was right outside my door and watching Lanai light up as the sun hit it. I also enjoyed watching the local kids surfing right in front of the hotel before they went off to school in the mornings and again in the evenings. I liked the idea that the locals seemed to congregate at a small park right outside the hotel by the seawall. This spot is one of the most relaxing I have ever experienced. I enjoyed walking the streets of Lahaina in the evenings also and meeting some of the local characters...and they have their share...and you will meet them unless you make an effort not to. All of this was right there surrounding the hotel, so I loved it. As for the hotel itself, being a history fan, I enjoyed the character of the place and the old feel of it. My room was fairly large and clean if not overly plush. It's not the Westin or the Grand Wailea, but it is perfectly functional and I didn't spend much time there anyway other than to sleep. The balcony was a bit public, but that was charming to me. My room overlooked the banyan tree and I actually enjoyed hearing the birds when I sat outside. I wasn't bothered by them at all when the door was closed and I was sleeping. The a/c in my room was fine and not loud at all as a previous reviewer noted. I liked the interior window shutters that actually worked rather than being for decoration. They do help keep out the noise and light also. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. I had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant and it was very good. I recommend it. Sitting out on the lanai watching the town come alive in the morning was very nice. Parking was a couple of blocks away which you may want to know ahead of time, but it was free and walking through the streets of Lahaina is fun anyway.

We stayed in a Queen room (46) overlooking the plantation style courtyard. The room was small, but we expected that in an historic inn. It was furnished in a style suited to the age of the building and unlike a recent reviewer we had no complaints about cleanliness. Our only regret was that we had not paid extra to have a room with a refrigerator, but there was an ice machine just down the hall. As the room faced the courtyard it was very quiet, the only time we were disturbed was when a fellow guest spent an age loudly trying to book a Lu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122au on his cell phone on an adjoining balcony. One of the nicest aspects of this hotel is if you eat breakfast (15% reduction for residents) in the hotel restaurant you are only a few feet from where the passengers from the cruise ships disembark for excursions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a great place to people watch! It did however strike us as rather sad that some people coming ashore to an island with as much to see as Maui seem to choose just to spend their day playing golf.

The food was reasonably priced, with a varied selection.

We have stayed at the Plantation Inn twice (for two nights each time) and adore that hotel, but for a longer stay the rooms are just too small unless you are prepared to upgrade to one of the suites. We were also more than happy with Lahaina Shores (we stayed for 10 nights) which despite its historic facade has all the amenities of a modern condominium but it is quite a dark walk back at night from the main attractions in Front Street.

It was so noisy you couldn't sleep. Be warned - all AC units here are window units and, at least in our case, it didn't work at all. 3) Location - as far as beach access, there isn't any.

The details made all the difference, from the genuine, unforced smiles from every staff member to the personal greeting at any time of day, to the valentines day heart cookies waiting for us all day on february 14th, we were well looked after at this hotel. And nothing fancy? I beg to differ - the minute you walk into this impeccably restored historic building you feel as though you're transported back to a time when shutters on the windows were commonplace, as were verandas, high ceilings with beautiful moldings and the most comfortable mattress I experienced anywhere on Maui. It was more intimate, clean, and welcoming (and yet quiet and cool in the middle of evening rush hour chaos), than any resort you could stay at. And all this with the convenience of the most central location in all of Lahaina. I could not get over how quiet our room was, how charming and spacious it was, and how friendly the staff were. They took the time to learn our names for our brief two-night stay! And although you may be in a historic building, you can access a multitude of channels on the television - we even found Canadian coverage of the Olympics during our stay, which I could not find at any other hotel in Hawaii! Everything is so impeccably restored, and decorated in a subtle, classy way so as to remain warm and hawaiian, while not looking tawdry or stark. The next time I come to Maui, I will not be staying anywhere else.

They will go the extra mile, or 10 if necessary to make your stay a winner. It is not fancy, it is not luxurious but it is home. While you are there, it is like you are a long lost cousin and have found your way home. All of Maui is like that to me for the most part, however it is over the top at the Pioneer Inn. I don't stay there for an entire 2 week stay, but I love to stay for 3 or 4 nights on the front end and at the end of a stay. It is part of the Ambience of Maui. I think it is also the oldest hotel west of the Rockies. And has a heck of a history. I get up early in the morning and take a walk along the coast. There is no place better for this on the planet. The Restaurant and bar are good too and have good prices. If you want fine dining there are several with in walking distance.I liked Lahina Seafood Company just a block or 2 down the street. Go about 9PM. get a table by the water, it is unbeatable. I recommend it highly.

The location is great - right across from the harbour and Banyan Square. Our room was clean and comfortable.

The staff were relaxed and friendly (they found and held onto my lost coat) and the adjoining restaurant is great for breakfast. If you want to do any boat journeys or enjoy any of Lahaina's bars and restaurants then do these while staying in Lahaina and avoid the traffic and taxi fares. Food tips, the cheapest meal we had in Maui was a tasty taco from a late night taco stand off the main shopping road. Making me a bit hungry thinking about it now in fact.

I hadn't been to Maui in 20 years; the Pioneer was perfect and as far away from the over built Kaanapali as possible.

Others might be bothered by them. The Front street noise didn't bother me at all, the only disturbance was my neighbor on his cell phone at 4 in the morning. Maybe they need to post a notice that the lanai is not a private phone booth?

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smack in the middle of Lahaina. I stayed there with my wife and 3 boys (ages 11, 9, and 5). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a place I would want to spend a week at, but for a night or two it has a great location while capturing the feel of Lahaina and its kooky, touristy fun. The Pioneer Inn was built in 1901 and was the only hotel in western Maui until 1964. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now under the Best Western banner. There is a plaque at the registration desk citing them as one of the top Best Westerns in the country. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not surprised\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was definitely the best Best Western I have ever stayed at. They had a set of rules posted by the desk from when the hotel first opened.

Fortunately, the boys remained sober and enjoyed climbing the banyan tree next door for nearly an hour. We had a great lunch at Aloha Mixed Plate and the boys satisfied their pizza jones at B.J.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that night. You will not lack for dining choices in Lahaina. Our room was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although there was no separate sitting room. It was very spacious, however. We had a king bed and a queen pull-down Murphy bed.

You have no privacy on the lanai\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a motel-like internal open hallway with the lanais separated by open wooden fences. Our room overlooking the garden was very peaceful, however. A number of rooms overlook the main drag, Front Street. I would imagine they could be pretty noisy and/or excellent vantage points for first-class people watching, depending on your mood. The room was very clean and everything was in working order. Reception staff was gracious and friendly. All-in-all, this is no fancy resort, but is a very good value. I would definitely stay again. The morning we checked out we had excellent, plate-covering macadamia nut pancakes in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant. A nice cap to a nice stay.

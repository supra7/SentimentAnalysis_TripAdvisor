It is an historic hotel (has always been a Travelodge since being built in the 1940\u2019s) and its 4 public faces (Taylor, Raymond, Bruce and Nikki) are courteous and welcoming. From the beginning of our communications with them, we were impressed by their readiness to help us in any way a hotel could. The accommodations are humble, clean, of good size (many hotels in SF have very small rooms) and offer what anyone would need to have a good sleep and be ready for a day in town. If you come to SF to look for a luxurious accommodation, look elsewhere and be ready to spend much more. This is intended to show respect to the establishment, as when we travel, we are going to there to experience the culture of the location, not wallow in luxury and spend all of our time in the room. If you are expecting a big breakfast with designer coffee, you\u2019ll need to find a local establishment, several of which are only a few blocks away. We requested a dark room, which translates to a corner room that has no window to the front walkway/balcony. We could have asked for another room- possibly because of a slight feeling of claustrophobia, but we dismissed that almost as quickly as we thought of it. There is a circuit that will trip if you have the bathroom fan, three floor lamps and the television on when using a hairdryer, but we don\u2019t \u201cthrow the baby out with the bathwater\u201d- we mentioned it, they reset the breaker and we worked with it. Then we met Raymond. One would not expect the wealth of information that this Midwest transplant readily and enthusiastically offers. Almost anybody we encountered in SF was engaging, pleasant and ready to offer their TIME (unlike where we are from), but Raymond has this in abundance. As much as the other 3 had the aforementioned SF qualities, Raymond brings the \u201cdesireability\u201d of this location to another level. In his few years living in SF, Raymond has gathered enough knowledge about how to get around town, where to go and what is available to you- according to YOUR desires and to any level of expense. The Travelodge\u2019s location was optimal for accessing transit buses and a major road into SF. For those who want to leave their car at the hotel, Raymond showed us 4 bus routes that can get you to all major locations in the city. Once you get the hang of the buses and know what places to avoid (3 or 4 areas, more so at night), you can really find your traveling groove. Parking at the hotel may get competitive, but they will help you. Depending on your reason for going to SF, we recommend the Travelodge at the Presidio. If you research as much as we did and find something comparable, you are fortunate and even the staff at the Travelodge would be happy for you (!). If you\u2019d rather not do a lot of researching, then decide on this place- you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chobham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSecond time staying here, just as impressed\u201d", "Author": "DR7301", "ReviewID": "UR127171659", "Content": "We're from the UK and this was the second time my wife and I have stayed at this hotel.

Seeing as the hotel isn't as expensive as many in the area, I found myself with fairly low expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a very nice, spacious hotel with a great mattress, TV and bathroom. The location couldn't be better. I walked all over the Marina and Presidio without even needing my car. I found the complaints about lack of parking space to be somewhat unfounded. Every night I managed to get a spot, even after returning as late as 11 PM two nights. There's a little bit of neighborhood noise at night from a bar around the corner and a preschool next door means children yelling at 8 in the morning, but those are minor complaints. Also, I found the neighborhood to be exceptionally safe, even late at night. That can always be somewhat of a concern when staying in a city. It's very residential around the hotel. It would have been nice to have a mini-fridge and an iron in the room. Another highlight of the stay was the very helpful and friendly staff. Bruce (I think) checked me in by name and was very welcoming when I arrived. The concierge, Raymond Archer, also was exceptionally knowledgable and helpful every morning. I'm fairly discerning about where I stay and while there are definitely cheaper options in the area, but I can confidently say in terms of \"value\" i.e. what you get for the price, this hotel can be considered a smart choice.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, nice location and very helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "MightyTree", "ReviewID": "UR126311825", "Content": "We stayed here for a 4 night stay in February. It was not overpriced so good value compared to most other hotels in San Francisco, but had everything we needed and more so an ideal choice.

Has a in-room safe big enough for a laptop too, but at an extra charge of $1.50 a day. Breakfast was great to have thrown in and Wi-Fi was fast. The general manager, Tyler, was fantastic throughout our stay and made us feel more than welcome, giving us plenty of great advice on eateries, bus routes and places to go, so thank you Tyler! More than enough maps and things at the front desk too. Location is close to Golden Gate bridge and nice quiet residential part of town. About 5 mins walk to the bus stop to get the bus into town, which takes about 20 - 25 mins. Ok so you could stay somewhere nearer in town, but it'd be noisy, you'd pay a lot more and probably get less for your money - bus service is perfectly good if you don't have a car, which you don't really need in this city but would be useful if you're short on time. Definitely recommend and can't wait to come back to San Francisco, which is a fantastic city!

We had the bad luck that there was a group with motorcycles who left in the middle of nights (two nights) which was extremely loud. You can easily take a bus to the center, just 1,5 block away.

He is so passionate about his city! He is willing to explain every detail to you. Took a map and drew out al the different bus and cable care lines, with different colored markers. Dotted in the numbers of the buses. That was great and very convenient. We did not have to worry if we were going in the right direction. And thus able to see and do everything we wanted. Raymond gave such great tips on what not to miss, after listening to our preferences! Also on dining options. He told us he tried more that 350 restaurants. There is a street within walking distance called Chestnut, and there are a ton of good restaurants and coffeeplace (like a Starbucks). We liked that street and the atmosphere a lot.

My husband, five year old son and I stayed here at the tail end of a four day car trip. We are relatively familiar with the area and were only planning a single day of sightseeing in SF. We had a car with us. The Travelodge provided the perfect location. After a long day of driving we were able to cross the Golden Gate Bridge and check in shortly after 3 pm without having to slog through rush hour traffic. We appreciated being able to park for free off the road and in sight of our room. We had a room on the third floor with two queen sized beds. With tax, our cost was about ~$150. We felt this to be an extremely good value. The room was small, but clean and well appointed. There was a desk, arm chair, small refrigerator, vanity, and TV all squeezed into the space with our beds. The bathroom counter and cabinets, light fixture, and mirror all appeared to be relatively new. Our refrigerator door was broken and missing the lower rack, but this did not interfere with our use of it. We neglected to report this to the management. The heating/cooling system for the room was oddly complicated for me. I'm sure the front desk would have been happy to help had we requested it. We also didn't contact them about this. Considering we aren't used to sleeping in an urban area, we were amazed at how quiet our room was. We left the bathroom window open and could hear fog horns in the distance, but that was about it. The hotel is immediately across the street from the Presidio which has lovely walking paths. We enjoyed walking to the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts. We also enjoyed walking to the Wave Organ. George Lucas' studios are also within walking distance, as are many restaurant choices. As mentioned by other reviewers, Raymond was tremendously helpful and friendly. He was able to suggest activities that might interest our five year old and restaurants that were child friendly and not too far away.

The room decor was very nice and update, complete with a flat screen TV (not that you watch that much TV while in San Francisco). The room was extremely clean, in fact, immaculate. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially Nicolette and Raymond, who are experts at helping with public transportation planning (they actually use the public transportation so they really do know the system and routes). Raymond helped us plan out a route, on the day of the Bay to Breakers race, that would get us to California Academy of Sciences. Nicolette was great at showing us the routes to downtown at rush hour. A bonus is that you can buy transit passes right at the hotel, I believe the only hotel in the city who offers all the transit pass options. We used public transportation for our entire stay and never encountered any problems. Both Nicolette and Raymond were always smiling (as was housekeeping, but unfortunately, I didn't get any names), and they truly wanted to make our stay comfortable and cared about us as guests. The location of the hotel is great. It is in a quiet part of the city, just outside the Presidio. Yet just two blocks down, the city thrives, with so many restaurant options we couldn't count them. The hotel is also close to many public transit stops. We never walked more than 3 blocks to or from any stop. A great bonus of the hotel location is that you can both hear and see the famous wild parrots of Telegraph Hill. The birds seem to like the trees at the Presidio. We really enjoyed watching them and hearing they as the flew over. I even managed to snap a couple of pictures while two of the birds chatted on power lines right next to the hotel.

After scouring the web for a place to stay, what drew me to this hotel was the mention of free parking. Having never been to San Francisco before, I didn't know parking was such a limited commodity. The free parking turned out to be a huge benefit. It is admittedly a tight fit (I think I counted eight spaces), but I never had an issue finding a spot. I was there three nights and the farthest away I had to park was half a block away. This was thanks in part to the great staff. The woman at the desk (sorry, I don't remember her name now!) was able to do a quick glance at a monitor to tell me there was a space around the corner. She was the same attendant when I checked in and she was very friendly and helpful, even asking for my preference of room. I ended up with a room with no direct neighbors and it was extra quiet. I mentioned the cameras before. It's nice that an eye is kept on the extra parking, but it did not seem I had to worry about the area. The neighborhood itself is beautiful, with many tourist spots within walking distance. My last morning there, I was able to cross the street and wander through the Letterman complex on the Presidio and then stroll over to the Exploratorium. While other hotels just down the road were right on the busy Lombard St., this stretch is just off the main highway and it's surprising how quiet it was. I was there during the World Series and I was even able to walk half a block to a bar full of Giants fans and watch the game. That same helpful attendant told me the bar was recently used for a movie, something that myself as a movie nut appreciated. I can't think of any real complaints.

It is an older place, but I have to say, it really is kept very clean. The old building and the old d\u00c3\u00a9cor account for the cheaper priced rooms which is without a doubt a bargain. Free parking and wireless thrown in the mix and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost a steal.

The room is small, but we could live with that. The bathroom was very much in need of work with the shower door wobbly, but functional. The window in the bathroom (a bonus to us to have fresh air) would not stay open so we propped the ice bucket under it to hold it open.

We stayed again this past week and the room we got this time was much better. Still same old d\u00c3\u00a9cor and small, but the bathroom was remodeled with the shower stall new, granite tops and a vanity with some room to store toiletries. We had a problem with noise just as we were turning in for the night and this time we did report it. It ended up being the plumbing in the room above us. They came immediately, but because of the hour they were not able to do anything about the problem. They discounted our room and the toilet upstairs was fixed the next day and we had no more problems. On our third visit we were back in room 306 with the old bathroom.

About 4 blocks from the hotel on Chestnut Street there are a lot of restaurants and shops to check out. There is a MUNI bus stop right across from the hotel, and one just a few blocks away for a different line. They have free parking (BONUS!) but the spots are really tight! Luckily we were in a Bug. Free continental breakfast was enough for us. I usually skip breakfast anyway. The front desk guy in the mornings always asked how our day was and would tell us about any festivals or cool events going on. He is by far one of the best frontline personnel I've seen (and I work in the hospitality industry!). After shopping for a long time I found the specials on their website were the best prices. There was a discrepancy between what I had reserved (price) and what I was charged. Turns out there is a small fee for use of the safe that you can decline at check-in (I didn't notice it on the check-in sheet I signed) but I emailed the hotel and they refunded the money since we didn't use the safe. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff\u201d", "Author": "green_beam", "ReviewID": "UR64300390", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights as we'd found it recommended on this website.

One night we took a cab from fishermans wharf (too much happy hour) and it was only 8.00! Our room was old, bed linens were comfortable but exceptionally clean. New AC/heating had just been installed. Bathroom fan was extremely noisy so we just used the heating light most of the time. Not enough vanity space so I utilized the coffee area for hair/make up. People at the desk were extremely helpful. Continental breakfast was packaged rolls, cereal, milk, juice and coffee. Low water pressure, lots of hot water. Area felt safe even at night. Got a great package deal via travelocity. Well what can I say-definitely not a ritz carlton but I am sure it saved us a lot in transportation.

Since living in SF for 3 years, we knew how difficult it would be to place the whole family and make sure there were things to do in a relatively safe neighborhood. We picked the Presidio area because there was the Exploratorium and Golden Gate Bridge for the kids, Chestnut street for food, and the hotel had free parking. The price was decent for SF ~$100/nt. I booked 2 rooms off their website and 2 directly through the staff. Be cautious because if you book thru the website, you can't claim the AAA discount since they are sold thru a 3rd party. The first room we got was in the process of a remodel and smelled like heavy paint. They told us they weren't going to give us that room over the phone in the AM but stuck us with that room anyway...the bathroom was semi-moldy and not done yet. After the first night, we asked and finally got a completed remodeled room which was very nice and comfortable. (2nd floor middle corner room). They have free parking, but only a limited number of spaces so you had to stake your claim early. Breakfast was nothing special, cold cereal, OJ, coffee, cocoa, danishes. At least it was free. I thought the area was safe since it was off the Lombard main drag, but apparently, the hotel was held up the second night we were there. Otherwise, it was very quiet, and comfortable (if you get the right room), but the staff needs to communicate better.

It is very near to the Golden Gate Bridge and is convenient to the attractions in and around the Presidio and the 'Marina' area of San Francisco. The hotel itself looks to be a renovated motel, but it's located in an area off the busy portion of Lombard St. so it was fairly quiet. I spent 3 nights there and slept well each night. I would recommend the rooms toward the back of the complex. The room itself was nothing exceptional but everything was comfortable, clean and functional. The beds were very comfortable with attractive bedding, a microwave and refrigerator were provided and the room (#301) was a corner unit with windows on 3 sides. The bathroom was very small, similar to european B & B bathrooms with no tub just a shower, but everything was clean and in working order. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, the housekeeping staff did a good job. A very skimpy continental breakfast is offered at the front desk; juice, coffee and some breakfast rolls which you have to eat in your room or elsewhere. There is no breakfast room but there are many great places to have breakfast. The location offers many unique eateries nearby, and Chestnut St. has a wide selection of cafes, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants with every kind of dining and grocery stores selling exceptional produce. There are many boutiques and shopping establishments as well. The area had only 2 franchise restaurants that I saw, an IHOP and a Johnny Rockets, everything else is a one of a kind. Parking is available but limited onsite and an overflow lot is around the corner. Street parking and public parking is expensive if you're not from a big city with similar rates. I paid about $100 a night for the room a double/double but found a $74 rate from the Roomsaver magazine.

I was looking for a cheap place that wasn't in the noisy downtown area and that didn't have postage-stamp sized rooms - and I got it! If you're frugal and don't mind not having an elevator, a lobby, or fancy furniture I think you'll be very happy with this hotel. The downside: our room could have used better ventilation. There was no way to open the windows and get the air moving without sacrificing our privacy. The bathroom window desperately needed a curtain as it actually faced into the hallway/balcony. Since the bathroom had no fan(!) opening the window was the only way to keep the steam down while showering so I had to hang a t-shirt in front of the window. Kinda silly. The result was that the room was a bit muggy. Also, as I mentioned, there is no elevator in this kind of hotel so don't stay here if you have trouble carrying your luggage up a flight of stairs. This hotel also does not offer much of a view and as you might imagine -- the furniture, carpeting, etc is not exactly brand new. Also also, HBO is supposed to be included but we didn't seem to have it (But, so what? We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to San Francisco to watch TV.) The upside: the price was shockingly low. This made it possible for me and my co-traveler to spend our money on more important things (like eating out and shopping). I booked the flight and hotel together through Orbitz rather than through the hotel itself so I would recommend doing that to get the best deal. Our room had 2 queen beds, a microwave, a refrigerator, dresser, vanity, and table -- and plenty of room for 2 people to move around. The location is EXCELLENT. A quiet part of Lombard right next to the Presidio.

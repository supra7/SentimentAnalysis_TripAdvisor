This is a resort located approx 20-25 minutes from the Airport and you can have Shared Cab from mears transportation.costing 35-40 USD return ,Seems ok b. Its a resort , so no Hotel Services , you would surely need your own vehicle for transportation . c. Check In was fairly simple . Teressa helped me quickly to get into . But issue was that with all Luggage if you need to walk another 120 meters it becomes difficult as they are apartments upto 3 floors spreaded in blocks . So if your floor is 3rd Floor you need to carry all your luggage . d. Fortunately my One BHK was downstairs . And I found Bed , room decent , but lighting was very dull color was dark blue which was little irritating . e. Good thing you had Microwave , fridge and lot of things kitchen Cutleries to prepare food. You can find things to prepare from Canteen at the Back side near pool f. You have flat TV in Both rooms , but of No Use , not much international Channels g. Wifi is useless , it doenst come at all in rooms though its complimentary , but works fine in Lobby . h. Celebrity Spa and Fitness Centre have decent collection of fitness equipment , Being Fitness freak I love to find these places. Since a lot of greenery around and artificial beach volley wall , natural place to sit around and spend a lot of time with nature. i . You would find mosquito outside incase you decide to do a workout in open or just a peaceful sitting k. Bathtub had hairs which was not cleaned and jacuzzi was for name sake l. Pool Side areas are good , they have DJ and COmplete family fun But I would not like to use this incase I have to go to Theme Parks , they are far off and without your own vehicle costly affair They charge Resort Fees ..

To top it all off, the timeshare units here are also sold on a nightly basis by the resort itself as well as other discount websites. Added to that, some units have been updated several years ago, some a few years ago and some last year. Some units (seen from photos) seem like a 1990s Tuscan brothel, while the later ones are nicely updated with sort of a retro-early 1960s Floridian style. The Wynham upgrades are not nearly as nice as the other upgraded units. Some overzealous decorator decided to overreach and remove the mirrors and columns, while keeping the tacky wannabe classical prints intact. The result is rather plane and incomplete. The upgraded interiors for the non-Wyndham units nicely incorporate the columns and mirrors into a more unique modern decor. Also some of the master-bedroom jacuzzi tubs have a built-in step, appallingly lacking in other suites. The absence of any steps in other suites, including the guest-bath jacuzzi, should be considered a safety violation. I got scrapes and bumps trying to use the thing, and our guests using the other bather just gave up altogether and used the shower in the master suite. So the point is, you never really know what your getting until you got it. Well, there is one thing for sure: If your look down the reviews on this site, invariably, the negative comments come from people staying the lock-out unit, while the positive comments come from he guests staying at the full one- and two-bedroom units. It amazes me that people will grab the units in the cheapest category and then start complaining as if they thought they were entitled to the penthouse at Trump Tower or something. Even the cheapest units, which I\u2019ve seen advertised between $80 and $90, would be considered a genuine suite in a standard hotel -- with a wet-bar style kitchen, two flat-screen TVs and a fold-out couch in the living room in addition to a small bedroom. By the way, a \u201c lock-out unit,\u201d a term we timeshare owners are supposed know (except I just found out), means a smaller part of a double-unit that can be expanded or closed off for separate rentals. It should be no surprise their proximity to their bigger counterpart units would be \u201csusceptible to the decibel\u201d -- hence, all the previous comments about \u201cpaper-thin walls.\u201d Our closed-off two-bedroom unit -- with balcony, full kitchen, a great second bedroom and jacuzzi guest bathroom -- were pretty much sound proof, and I don\u2019t think anyone outside could even hear the screams and moans from us scraping our knees and shins on those infernal jacuzzi tubs. But I must say, it\u2019s hard to do better -- using timeshare points or paying fare like a hotel -- than this resort -- immaculate, expansive grounds, full work-out room, a small lake and water sports, a small beach, tons of tennis courts, a genuine spa (with great deals) two true resort-style pools with special water features, great pool-side bar service, a wonderful gift-shop and grill and nightly entertainment at the open-air bar above the main building. The staff was friendly and efficient, quickly complying for requests for extra towels, pillows and coffee. Being technically a time-share resort, maid service is not included, not even the complimentary mid-week clean-up that comes with virtually all Wyndham/RCI weeklong stays. There is separate Wyndham/RCI desk \u2014 not for checking in, but to arrange timeshare sales. We took our maid-service complaint to the staff, but they, alas, are not there for existing clients but for future clients. Well, they were charming, so we took up their time-share sales offer (just to hear their pitch, not to buy) in order to get their promised reward of a $125 American Express card. Lo and behold, the time-share sales pitch went smoothly (with a gracious, lovely femle agent), with limited sales pressure, and it was well within the promised 90-minute time allotment. We used our \u201cprize\u201d money on a budget spruce-up service ($22), which included making up the beds and replacing towels, and, later, $40 total room-clean up, which brought the unit back to its pristine first impression.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chandler, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice grounds and plenty of activities to choose from\u201d", "Author": "KevandKaren", "ReviewID": "UR126472145", "Content": "My ratings start with 4 stars and go up or down from there. For a 5th star it has to have something that really sets itself apart. My experience: We booked a 1BR at the Star Island Resort through Interval International a few months before our visit to Orlando and Spring Break. We came for the Universal Studios and Disneyland type of trip with our 9-yr old daughter. The confirmation came for our unit (2144 A) and described the unit as only having a bar sized microwave and fridge with no kitchen. We were prepared for the smaller size as it was our only available choice. When we arrived we were surprised to find a full-size fridge, dishwasher, 2-burner stove, utensils and a microwave that doubles as an oven. We realized that the description was for the lockout side of 2144 (B). So lesson here is to understand if you are really on the lockout side of the unit or not, and call if you have to in order to verify the amenities. I would have cancelled based on the description, but since I had no other choice, I was ready. Check-in was fast and friendly. The grounds were beautiful. The unit was not oversized but just right for a 1BR. Yes, some of the units had a walkway in front of the living room (as did ours), but privacy was not an issue as the shades would not allow a view into your room anyway. The resort had 2 full size pools which were well used and a hot-tub. The on-site / poolside gift shop also doubles as a short order kitchen and has just about everything you may have forgotten. My only regret is that we only used the resort to stage our Theme Park vacation and did not allow a day to just relax at the resort. Pros: Friendly staff and activities every day for both the kids (Pizza night) and adults (Drink specials). Close to the Theme Parks (15 minutes) Numerous restaurants close by Nice pools and Tennis courts Game room for the kids Cons Pricey - 2 Margaritas were $18 at the pool bar.

We had a timeshare that was listed as a (1) bedroom, but we got an \"efficiency unit\" as is known to the regulars there. Not sure what happened there but I didn't push it, it was only my husband and I. It was very small, holiday inn size with separate bedroom, kitchenette that included a dorm size fridge, 2 stove top burners (only one worked), coffe pot with no supplies and a toaster. No oven. The kitchenette is part of the small living room. The bathroom had a pedestal (???) sink, very! limited counter and storage space. But it was very clean. We were originally assigned a ground floor room in an older building, but because we arrived early (10 a.m., check-in is at 4), we were able to switch to a newer renovated top floor corner room. And thank God because you can hear all conversations, not even yelling, but regular conversations! though the walls. I brought ear plugs in case and used them so I got some sleep. The bedroom had 2 twin beds, fairly comfortable, but again very clean. The staff were all very nice, but they absolutely! refuse to do any room change requests over the phone.....I tried several times before we got there to no avail. So I called when I landed and I must say they were very nice about early check-in which was great once we got to the resort. There is only one pool for the entire complex, and it gets very crowded. Need to grab a chair early. They have many tennis courts, but they were usually being used by a local school or club, saw only one court that renters could use at most times. The complex itself is small in comparison to other resorts I have stayed at, the \"lake\" is very small with no swimming, the gym gets filled but has decent equipment. I did like seeing the same people at the pool day after day, it was easy to make friends and converse. Overall it was a good experience, I would stay here again, but I think the location of the room has alot to do with whether or not you enjoy your experience based on noise, size, and amenities. The location cannot be beat, near everything including a Publix nearly right across the street (two lane double road, difficult to cross safely), main boulevard street with lots of stores including Dunkin' Donuts (yea!), but you still need a car to access most safely.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGood overall.

We were happy with the resort overall, although we didn't participate in any of the on-site activities. We thought that the pool area was very nice and the grounds appeared to be very well kept. The unit was nice, but perhaps not what I would expect from a gold rated resort since there was obvious staining (including something a little clumpy like candle wax) on the carpet and the appliances were on the older side. We were in what they label a 3-bedroom, which was actually both sides of a lockoff unit, and the third bedroom was really a den with a sleeper sofa, so that might be unfortunate for some if they were expecting 3 standard bedrooms. Fortunately, we knew this ahead of time since their site indicates it. We did like that there was a washer and dryer in the unit. For people going to the theme parks, this resort was very well situated. Our drive time from resort to parking area was nearly the same for both Disney and Universal, and both were only about 15 or 20 minutes. Not bad at all. Two other big things that I liked about this resort. 1. They didn't pressure us to attend their timeshare presentation - I only had to say no thanks once and that was the end of it. 2.

We had a 1 bedroom suite with a small kitchen/livingroom. It had 2 small double beds, a saggy couch in the livingroom, a microwave that didn't work very well, small fridge, 2 burner hot plate, a makeshift kitchen counter unit. We had 2 windows but had to keep the blinds closed at all times as they faced out to the well used walkway that everyone used to access the elevators. The bathroom fan was incredibly noisy. The walls were paper thin. We could hear everything our neighbours said including their dryer which they ran until midnight when the cycle finished with a buzzer. We smelled everything they cooked. There was no coffee table in the livingroom so we fashioned one out of a shelf and the luggage rack. There really wasn't anything to do other than look at the four walls and TV. We spent all of our days outside of the unit. We tried to upgrade to a unit with a larger bed and balcony and were told that the resort was fully booked although we saw several dark units at night and unused balconies during the day. At one time the resort may have been nice but it is definitely tired. It may be ok for families trying to save money on food. We left and ended up spending 3 days of our vacation at a nice spot I found on Pompano Beach. We only returned to the unit to sleep the last night before our flight out of Orlando. The area is surrounded by chain restaurants where you can get a lot of cheap food quickly. The resort staff were not helpful with the upgrade. We checked in late at night and the attendant was quite grumpy as the booking had been doubled (not by us!) and for some reason we had 2 units booked. Our unit was in bldg. 21 on the 5 floor at the end of the complex away from the pool, bar and noisy karaoke. The complex is huge and a car is a must. It is not a classy resort by any means. A C+ rating given by another review would be accurate. Perhaps a larger unit with a balcony would be better. We were told that we had to come down and register with Wyndham so that they knew everyone staying at the resort. A ploy to get you to their 90 minute time share talk.

The bathroom is a normal size, but when using the shower the water all spills out. Also if you try to shower at any busy time there is no hot water. Even when there is hot water it is only luke warm. Also they give you 4 towels for the whole week. You can have the towels exchanged once during your one week stay for free, but otherwise if you want more towels you have to pay for them or steal them from the pool.

There were 11 people in our group (ranging from ages 23-60) and we had 4 units. My parents have owned at Star Island (a 3-bedroom and a 1-bedroom) since 1999 and we exchanged the other units through Interval. Some things about this resort are OUTSTANDING and I want to highlight those first: -The activities by the pool are awesome for families and there is happy hour every single day. At the upstairs bar, there is Bingo each day at 4pm - our group walked away with quite a bit of cash! There was live music and karaoke each night and the bartenders (especially George) were fantastic. -The pool is beautiful and was never too crowded that you couldn't get a chair. -There is a cool outdoor gym facility with a small \"track\" and a bunch of exercise equipment. This was new since the last time we were there. -Wifi was free and worked everywhere, but it does kick you off and you need a different password for each device. -Every unit we had was extremely clean and updated with granite, flat panel TVs and new furniture. -There is a store on the property that has tons of items if you need anything in a pinch. This resort is in a great location - Publix at the next corner and minutes from the parks. Now, for the disappointing aspects of our trip. -The unit we stayed in was advertised on the Interval site as a 2-bedroom that slept 6. Upon entering, we walked into a dark, small space with a teeny-tiny kitchen area. This would be something I would think is a \"limited kitchen\" and nothing like what we have had anywhere else. (We are timeshare people - rarely ever staying in anything but since we enjoy the larger spaces and kitchens.) There were 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, but no king sized bed in either and hardly any closet space. There were 3 of us in this unit and it was the most depressing and dark place - no balcony, windows looking out to another wall. My dad spent over an hour on the phone with Interval trying to change rooms but no such luck. The problem is that we were on the \"Star Island\" side of the resort and not the part owned by Wyndham. The front desk was not helpful at all for this reason. The issue is that Star Island needs to communicate with Interval their floor plans so people know what to expect. There wasn't even enough seating in the living area for 6 people - we hardly had enough room with 3 of us. Thank goodness the place was updated otherwise it would have been really awful. We spent very little time in our room - it was building 24 and we got units A and C - the B area is the larger unit with the big kitchen and king sized bed and jacuzzi tub along with a balcony. The entrance and laundry are shared so we had neighbors right there. So my word of advice is if you exchange, make sure you are not getting this type of unit!!! Beware!!! -One of our units on the second floor had many palmetto bugs that were giant - not a friendly surprise when they are in your shower or shoe! No good! -WARNING: Do not do the sales pitch!!!!! My parents were told that it would take 45 minutes and you would get a $125 amex card. Nice, right? WRONG! They were there for - you won't believe it - 4 HOURS! 4! We also were going to do the pitch that would take 90 minutes for non-owners - we cancelled since who knows how long we would be there! -Like another reviewer said, the kitchens have bare essentials. We managed to cook a full Thanksgiving dinner but combined items from all our units. There are other things that are just basic - our unit had not a single hook to hang wet clothes on, and only a shelf in the bathroom to put toiletries. Overall, we had the best trip. The biggest problem was that 2-bedroom unit that was misrepresented through Interval.

Having read all the excellent and terrible reviews we certainly were aware of its mixed reviews. Some of the negative issues are not apparent ie there are plenty of paper towels, there is no odd smell and the front desk staff were all very pleasant, A/C works fine. However, we decided to take both the A and B side (although we are just 1 couple) and that helps a lot. The walls are paper thin but we are protected from that having both sides of the unit. The A side is very cramped and dark. Don't take the limited kitchen unless you absolutely have to. In asking for the full kitchen you get the B side which is larger and brighter. The facility is very dated and needs major upgrading. There are so many buildings we can't imagine what the pool area would be like in summer season. Now it is just OK and the resort is at the best half full. The pool towels are a joke - like a dishcloth in thickness and small. We take 6 for the 2 of us and that helps somewhat. My wife says the kitchen is poorly equipped - bare essentials - not even a rubber spatula. BBQs are charcoal only. Who travels with charcoal anymore? The property looks very nice on entry but is just average in our opinion - at best a C+. We haven't noticed any bugs and the unit was very clean on entry. The WIFI is a pain - it kicks out very quickly - just not appropriate for today's world. The air conditioners are right outside the bedroom window making sleeping difficult.

This was a very pleasant surprise for us because we booked this a few months before after doing research just to ensure it was a safe hotel and a good location with high reviews but didn't really know anything about the resort or our rooms. When we arrived we were excited just by pulling in the entrance to the resort, it's beautiful and secluded, almost like it's out in the country instead of in the middle of a busy town. The resort is gated and guarded by security guards, of whom we saw all over the resort the entire duration of our stay, which is always very reassuring to see. The lobby was very nice and the staff helpful, and the area around the lobby is very beautiful with a big fountain out front. We were assigned to a room in the fourth building down from the office, and when we got in the room we were absolutely floored by the room! It's actually a one bedroom condo with a kitchenette, a large dining room table, a sectional couch with console and large flat screen TV in the living room, and a large master-suite with a huge jetted tub a few feet down from the king sized bed and a TV console/dresser with another large flat screen TV. There is also another separate bath area with a vanity, toilet, and large shower built in the wall. The tub was fabulous, we used it both nights we were here :) There was also a patio off the bedroom and the living room, but we never used it. The bed was very comfortable, I think they may use euro-top mattresses which are always very nice if not too soft. The pool complex is large and the pools heated. I didn't see a hot tub, so not sure if they have one or not but we only used the pools once in the morning for a few minutes before we left. They also have a pool side bar and a large tennis complex too, although we didn't use either while we were here. The complex was very quiet and had a private feel to it, something that is often missing in resort destinations, even the Disney hotels. I really can't think of one complaint that I had for either day of our stay here.

We have traveled to Orlando/Kissimmee over 10 times and have stayed in over 7 different timeshare condominiums, and our 3-bedroom at Star Island was a very good experience. Not the best we've had, but very good. The unit: we had the 3-bedroom, which had a unique set-up. The side with the master bedroom had two full bathrooms, but only one bedroom (the master). I guess if anyone was staying on the sofa in the living room the other bathroom would be for them. On the other side of the lock-off had one bedroom with two double beds, a full bathroom, and a den-type area with a small kitchen (fridge, dishwasher, stovetop, utensils) and a pull-out sofa. So this side was essentially a one-bedroom with a closed-off den. Since we have 3 kids, I'm not sure if I would book here with only the 2-bedroom, for there's no real master bedroom on the 2-bedroom side we had. However, everything in the units was very clean. In fact, they had just shampooed the carpets before our arrival. The thermostat was very temperamental, and was difficult to peg at a single temperature. Also, we were in the \"old\" building, and did not have a washer/dryer in the unit. With 3 kids, this was an inconvenience. There was free use of washers/dryers on the 1st level, but this kind of stuck you in the laundromat world where you had to \"hang around\" to wait for your clothes to be washed. Not appealing when you're on vacation. The resort: We really enjoyed the pool area. And while the resort was full, the pools were never overcrowded. There was a lot of activity, organized events, and music throughout the day, and the Chili Hillie's bar had some nice deals throughout the day. It was a good way to endure the mid-summer heat. Everything in the common areas was impeccably kept, and very convenient to most units. We didn't have a chance to take advantage of the free bucket of golf range balls at 8:30am every morning, but this is a nice treat for those just looking for a quick activity. The location: We were a bit further west on Highway 192 than we traditionally prefer to stay, but since the resort is tucked back from the highway, it feels a world apart from the congestion of that road. Obviously, if you're out in this area, you need a rental car. Then, you need a good local map that shows you how to get to Osceola Parkway. I believe a GPS system would likely guide you to Disney World via highway 192. Depending on the time of day, this would be a huge mistake. Just make sure you've got a couple dollars of change and small bills for the tolls, and you can be on Disney property in less than 10 minutes. Far better than dropping 30+ minutes in traffic. I live in D.C., so I'll pay $2 to save a lot of time in traffic; you may feel different. Once you know the roads, it's easy to get around. Just as a note, when you exit the resort you can only go East on highway 192. To go toward Disney you have to make a u-turn. Also, just about 1/4 to 1/2 mile East on 192 is a Super Target, where you can pretty much stock up on food and supplies for your vacation. All in all, we enjoyed Star Island, and would visit again if we could book another 3-bedroom unit.

The resort offered free bucket of balls in the morning. We probably hit balls 2 times out of the week as it was too warm to even attempt to do this in the morning in August. The driving range does not have a roof, so you are exposed directly to the sun. The villa has a DJ by the pool during the day. The drinks and food are a bit expensive for our taste but we were close enough to many supermarkets and bought food and drinks in advance. I even saw people using the nearby grills and having a picnic close enough to the pool area. The villas are located very close to Old Town on I-192, about 5-6 minutes from Disney and Sea World. It is very conveniently located in the center of everything. The facilities are very well kept and the villa was very clean. My only complaint was that we had to share the washer and dryer with the adjacent villa. There are some activities for kids during the day and in the evening. They offered many of the activities mentioned on their website but most of them you have to pay. In addition, we hardly ever participated in any of the nightly activities because we came in late from the parks. The pool closed at around 10 PM.

They let us check in early (nice) and it was reasonably close to Disney (10-15 minutes). The lobby of the hotel was nice. I suppose part of my disappointment comes from not being accustomed to staying in a timeshare. We were given 4 towels for the 4 of us to use for 5 days. If we wanted more towels we had to call and request them for a fee. There was no maid service, trash removal, etc. Our shower floor was filthy after a few days of walking all over Disney property and stayed that way. We had a kitchenette which was nice. We ate breakfast in our room daily before heading off to Disney which saved us money. The hotel is very old and outdated. Decor in the room was poor and the room was very dark (not much lamp light and if we opened the blinds everyone could look in at us as they walked by). Old fashioned TVs - no flat screens. Beds were small and uncomfortable. Air in the bedroom was good (cool) but the front room would get warm. The walls were extremely thin as evident by the obnoxiously loud family that yelled and made noises at 11pm. The water pressure was poor and the toilet didn't flush well - luckily they leave you a plunger in the bathroom (yuck!). The shower itself was difficult to get in and out of (jacuzzi style - very deep) for a 42 year old in fairly good health. I'm not sure how anyone with physical limitations would get clean. The pool was so far from our room in the back of the complex that we never went so I can't speak to it. They want you to attend a timeshare presentation but I didn't go. I can't imagine why they think anyone would want to buy a Wyndham timeshare after staying at this location. However - it was free to me and I appreciate the gift my family gave me.

The also need to update their picture wall in the lobby with some of the famous folks that have either stayed or owned there..it is mostly sports personalities from the 70s and 80s that young folks would barely know today.

I had read previous reviews about the paper thin walls. Let me say the walls are definitely PAPER THIN. In the room next to me were several small kids who ripped and romped until 2:30 every morning ... plus what must have been a small baby. It was absolutely a miserable sleeping situation. There is very, very little handicapped parking ... a few in front of one of the Wyndham buildings ... none to be found in front of my building. The kitchen is very sparsely furnished. This was the only 'suite' I've ever stayed in that did not provide paper towels. I found this odd since the room rate would suggest basic furnishings included.

We went there on an exchange thru RCI. When we first arrived we checked and in and the desk clerk was very friendly. She advised us that we would have to go to desk next to the elevators to get our parking pass and we just did that. However, this is where they get you to sign up for their 90 min TIME SHARE presentation for the next day. Basically, the lady, which her initials were LW, was like just meet at the lobby where the front desk is and you will have a 90 minute presentation you will have to attend and you will receive $85 and 3day/2night stay on us. So I was like its only 90 minutes it can't hurt. WRONG!!! Our presentation was over 4 hours long and they take you away from your resort to a actually Wyndham resort so they can show you \"how special it is\". I am filing a formal complaint with Wyndham because of the circumstances and how we asked them to take us back to our resort at the 90 min mark and they did not. Needless to say they sent us to another building down the road to collect on the $85. The 3/2 deal the hotels are not even around where we live and the closes one is approx 4 hours away. Would I do this again. ABSOLUTELY NOT! The Resort itself was nice. The unit was very big for 2 people. It had a full kitchen, except bring trash bags because they only give you two for the whole week. The decor was ok it could probably be updated a little bit. I did notice our t.v. was not flat screen and other units on the property had flat screens and were updated a little bit better. But who watches tv on vacation?? The bathroom space had a jacuzzi, which was very nice and a shower as well. It did have a double vanity for his/hers! The towel service is not great at all. If you are there a week you get 1 change of towels in the middle of the week and if you need more towels they charge you. The good thing is that you do have a washer/dryer combo to wash towels if needed as we did to save some $$$. The resort has 2 pools and a hot tub. The pools are pretty nice sizes. The DJ at the pool side during the day isn't that great. He mainly played older music and every once in a while played new. There is a pool bar as well. The gym is good, which is located near the game room in the main lobby. They do have basketball and tennis courts at the location. They also have water activities like paddle boats and they have their own little beach where people can fish. We didn't use the beach area, but from what we show it was a little small but ok for the guests I suppose. There is a play ground too for smaller kids. I wish there was more activities for younger adults tho. The only thing for younger adults to do at night is there is a outside bar on the second floor of the main building where they either have a DJ or karaoke going on. This is nicer then the pool bar during the day. The only issue we had while we stayed at Star Island was that our air conditioning stopped working one night and it got 81 degrees in our unit. We couldn't sleep at all this night. I called the front desk at 2am to ask them if they could send someone out to fix the problem. They advised that the maintenance people wouldn't be in til 7:30 the next morning (this was a lie because I was told correctly they don't come in til 8:30a.m.) and basically THEY COULDN'T HELP US. I called back at 8am to tell the front desk that it came on but for them to send someone so they could look at it. We left for the day and when we returned they left a message stating the air conditioning unit was set to go off at a certain time and then to come back on but they had fixed the problem. I would suggest having maintenance on 24/7 because of issues like this because what if it was in the middle of the summer?? Overall the stay at Star Island was good besides the few incidents we had. I would recommend this resort to Family's that have children because there are more activities for children to do than younger adults. There are nice restaurants (Bahama Breeze, etc.) about a 10 min ride from Star Island. Disney/Universal/Sea World are like 10-15 mins away for families that plan on going to them. The place was very relaxing and it was a nice getaway for me and my wife but we won't be going back.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI would definitely stay here again!!!\u201d", "Author": "lnaiou1", "ReviewID": "UR104572737", "Content": "The resort had lots of fun things to do for children and adults.

But the real action is when you enter the bedroom--the decor is green marbled laminate furniture! Yes, that is right--furniture as well as the bathroom vanity cabinet.In addition to being extremely tacky, the doors in the lovely plastic beside tables didn't open which limited storage.

On the good side, the pool is nice and well staffed with a bar and hot dog stand.There is a nice workout room too.Staff was fairly unattentive at the desk however.

This was basically my interaction with the reception area, since we had NO problems during our stay. There were activities at night close to the Registration Area, I can't comment because I didn't go to any of the activities, it sounded fun!

We had wi-fi in the room and the speed was descent. The living room as very comfortable had a flat panel TV and a smaller one in the bedroom. The bedroom was very spacious with a king size bed and had a Jacuzzi inside. The bathroom was very comfortable and a separate closed section for the toilet. The shower was very comfortable My favorite part of the apartment was the washer & dryer. Imagine coming home after vacation with clean clothes. It as great! What I liked the best was the cleanliness, spaciousness and the ability to feel comfortable away from home. There were places to eat all around, it was centrally located, although not that close Downtown Disney (we got lost getting there). What I liked the least was the parking. Although there appears to be a lot of parking in front of the buildings, we had a difficult time finding a parking space close to our building. We were in Building 18 and also the sliding door on the living room of the apartment was dull, although we did have a small patio with a table and chairs, it would have been nice to have the room's view to the pool or to a nice garden. But back to the parking, what made the parking situation worse was that the carts used by the maintenance staff would take up parking spaces close to the building instead of parking in the parking zones that would not eliminate parking spaces close to the building. I would definitely ask about the occupancy and how full your building is. Building 18 appeared to be pretty full and the building in front of ours also seemed pretty full which didn't help the parking situation. Another thing I didn't care for was that we had to drive like 10 minutes to get to Disney (not too far but has a lot of traffic).

We went there on an exchange thru RCI. It seems to be well run, as I have found at all Wyndham resorts. Buildings seemed to range from 2 stories to 6. The tall buildings had at least one elevator. We had a nice one bedroom unit in building 18. Here the larger units are the \"B\" side. It looks just like the pictures on their website. It was roomy & great for a couple. It even has a stacked washer/dryer & 2 small boxes of soap powder. The smaller \"A\" side (which I didn't see) probably doesn't have a balcony. The unit was well equipped with nice furnishings. It had 2 wall mounted flat screen TV's-one in living room & the other in the bedroom. Unfortunately, the only bathroom is located in the master bedroom. Not a problem when you are only a couple but a big problem if someone is on the sleeper sofa (other than one's own small children maybe). The toilet is in its own little closet (which helps the privacy issue) next to the double sink area. There is a large standup shower and a large whirlpool tub (you can see it in the pictures surrounded by columns). Inside the unit we had no problem with noise from other units-maybe we were just lucky. The balcony is quite small-perhaps 7'x8'-with a dining table & 4 chairs. It is very close to the neighbor balcony-no privacy, plus the ones directly below/above you are easy to see & hear. We had a lot of noise from loud talking cell phone users & just plain loudmouthed talkers. Smoking is excluded from the units, so it is done on the balconies. That means that the neighbors\u2019 smoke comes right to your balcony. A solid privacy wall would help--at least with the next door unit which is very close (as in \u201creach out and touch\u201d close). I think parking is a problem. I doubt that they have enough spaces for one car per unit, much less 2 per unit. If you come in late, prepare to park well away from your building's entry area. The location is good, with several chain restaurants nearby and a supermarket within about a mile. We didn\u2019t take part in any of the activities that the resort offered but they seemed to have a lot going on. The pool area was lovely and didn\u2019t seem crowded. There were many tennis courts with lessons ongoing. The check-in was simple but they need to do something about the process to obtain a parking pass. You have to go to a small area (with a low ceiling) that has 4-5 agents who want you to sign up for the welcome breakfast/activities info meeting. They have to communicate with 8-10 new patrons and it ends up being horribly loud and one can\u2019t hear anything. They really need to find a new place for this part of check-in.

Had a den with a sofa bed, but it was too cold and drafty for someone to sleep there. So be warned! Elevator also broke down during our stay so it was an arduous and noisy trek lugging our luggage down stairs. Staff that were there did not offer any help. One of my friends actually felt sick one day, but we knew she would be comfortable and safe. We were able to buy food from the onsite restaurant/cafe for her. They had decent fast food type selections. She felt better after good night's rest. We also took advantage of the outdoor jacuzzi and pool. Clean and relaxing. Tennis courts were located nearby. Another plus was the spa. Luckily, was able to reserve appointment same day and experience was simply heaven. They served you champagne or water before and after. Definitely worth it! Since I'm a Wyndham owner, my friend and I were wrangled into a 3 hour sales pitch. These representatives are aggressive and very rude!

There were two families sharing both suites. First I would say that the rooms had been recently remodeled and were very, very nice, especially the suite with the king bed and jacuzzi tub. The 'B' side - which they list as the 'mini-suite' - was just adequate for my sister and her husband and teenager. They would have been cramped it they didn't have our side to come over and hang out in. Although our rooms looked nice, they seemed to be poor shape. The washing machine knob was broken (took me 15 minutes to figure out a way to make it turn without it), the sheets for the pullout couched were the wrong size. When we called housekeeping to get them exchanged it took them until the next day! The pullouts were so uncomfortable anyway that the boys just slept on top of the couch. Our coffee maker was broken, drawers would not shut once pulled out and the units were understocked with things like toilet paper. I understand that a vacation rental isn't supposed to supply you with much, but some windex for the glass table would have been nice. Okay, essential. The resort itself was just okay. I understand that Windham had taken it over and started refurbishing. It looks like a resort that started off nice, went into disrepair and they then slapped a coat of paint on it. For a four-star hotel it seemed like it was trying but not quite making the mark. I've been to other resorts in this class and it doesn't measure up. My family went to the $7/person barbeque and it was just a pulled pork sandwich. Hardly something to put on your flyer as an event. The boys used the pools and they were nice. Being December it was good that they were heated. The fitness center was large and clean and wished we could have used it more than once. The vacation center personnel were very nice and pushed us to go to a timeshare presentation. When we canceled they were fine with it. Bottom line: I would have rated it higher if it weren't supposed to be a 4-star resort. It is great if you have a family and need the room. I would probably stay again if I got a great deal and not used up the valuable points. It IS a nice but more of a 3 star resort. I wanted to give it 3.5 but had to choose. It's also just a little too far from Disney. Not too bad, but far enough away that we couldn't get back to take an afternoon break and go back easily. It was good to have the two suites. We used my parents Marriott trade in (they have the best plan available) and this was nowhere near as nice the other places we've stayed for a trade in. They called it a three bedroom and it's NOT. It's two bedrooms with some pullout couches. That's fine if it's for the kids but no way an adult could sleep on one of those. Even my 14 yo nephew was too big. The one bedroom suite was much, much better and the jacuzzi tub was a nice bonus.

The master suite was huge, with a very comfortable king size bed, a huge jacuzzi tub and double sinks.

The resort was a little farther away from the other resorts, but only about 5 miles so if you rented a car the Premium outlets, universal and disney were only 10-15 min away. We ate at Smoky Bones and Girbaldis Mexican and really loved both restaurants (definitely recommend renting a car if you stay here). It was a little chilly (around 40-55 degrees) so we didn't get to enjoy the pool, golf, volleyball court, or other amenities they offer. However, the fitness center was well stocked with lots of equipment and weights (although a little outdated it still did the job) and we used it every day. The locker room also had a full hot tub, steam room, and sauna which was really nice. Unfortunately my spouse and I had to use separate locker rooms so we couldn't enjoy them together.

At the pool, there is also a poolside bar and hotdog stand. Within the same area is a conveinent store, spa, and an upstairs bar/club. Transportation to Disney was not free, but for two dollars per adult you could catch the city bus all the way to Disney and back.

We were staying for 10 days, so we asked if we could book two honeymoon packages. The reservations clerk said she could do that, and then she would book the rest of the time at a reduced rate. Because of that, she gave us two confirmation numbers and then quoted a price. A week before our wedding, we called to make sure everything was ok, and the weekend clerk couldn't find our 2nd confirmation number. We had to wait until Monday to call back, and that clerk confirmed our numbers and made a note in the record. On arrival at the resort after our wedding, the clerk said there were no notes in our record and could not find our second confirmation number. She had us checking out after 3 days. We argued with them about 10 minutes, then they suddenly found the 2nd confirmation, but had us changing rooms. We argued some more until she finally agreed to keep us in the honeymoon suite, and said she would put a note in the record. We had 4 suitcases with us, and found out our room was on the 3rd floor, with no elevator. We went back to ask if we could have someone help us with our luggage. We waited 20 minutes and no one ever showed up. By that time,it had started to rain. We had to haul our luggage up 3 flights of open stairs in the rain. (Anyone who has seen Florida rains knows that when it rains, it pours). That was Sunday night. That Tuesday, I decided to go down to the desk to make sure everything was ok. The clerk asked if we were checking out. I told her no, we had booked for 10 days. The clerk said no one had put any notes on the reservations. She had to issue us new card keys to get us back in the room. She also had the price different than what was quoted us, so I got to argue about that some more. That afternoon we went to use the safe in the room, and it was locked. We had to have someone from security to come open it for us. Wednesday, we expected to receive our second honeymoon package, which included a TGIF gift card. When it didn't come, I went back down to the desk, and the woman again said there were no notes in our record about that. I asked for the manager, and only the assistant manager was present. While he apologized for the error, all he would give us was $25 room credit. I asked for the managers name and number, which was supplied, but was told it was her day off. I had also inquired about the free internet service in the room, which was listed in the AAA book, but was told I would have to pay for it. Only after I complained did the assistant manager say he would give it to me. Thursday, while we were at Disney World, another manager called,and I told him we expected a day free for not getting our second honeymoon package and all the trouble we went through. He agreed to that. Friday, I went to the front desk, and found that the manager had given us credit for the cheapest day we had stayed. I told the clerk we expected one-tenth off our 10 day stay. We ended up having to call another manager in order to have that done. Tuesday night, we rented a dvd from Blockbuster to watch in the room. The dvd player wouldn't play it. We called maintenance, and the guy told us that sometimes these players wouldn't play dvds from Blockbuster or Walmart, but the newer players in some of the rooms would. He couldn't/wouldn't get us one of those players. So we paid for a rental we didn't even get to see. We had problems almost everyday we were there, and it basically ruined any chance we had to relax. We couldn't wait to check out and get back home. The only good time we had was the massages we got with the first package, and swimming in the pool. I would not recommend this resort to anyone. We had actually signed up for one of their timeshares. They lured us with a free continental breakfast, which consisted of packaged pastries. The juice machine didn't even work, so they had to go find juice for us to drink with our 'breakfast'.

The grounds were very well kept. The pools were great and a snack bar/bar area right by the pool. Our internet service worked fine. At times was a little slow but usually no problem. The hotel allows you to print out boarding passes for free on their computers. When booking, I did request an updated room. They say almost all rooms are updated anyway. I would not request a room right by the pool since they have nightlife going on there until 11:00 p.m. or so. The noise from pool is the onlly reason I gave 4 stars to sleep quality.

The wireless provider at this property (Hot Air) does not have sufficient bandwitdh to support stable connections from the guest rooms. The technical support from the vendor is tried to be helpful at first, trying to reconfigure Internet Explorer, etc., but eventually gave up, saying that their service was for \"casual users.\" The technical support staff never called back to assist with problems, despite promises to so so. By the fifth or sixth call the technical support staff became rude and confrontational, insisting that it was a problem with my computer rather than their service. On the few occasions when I was able to establish a connection from my room, the speeds were slower than dial-up and the connection would frequently drop unexpectedly. The front desk will refer to you to the \"business center;\" a desk outside the video game room (which is loud and is not deparated from the \"business center\" by a door. The connection at the \"business center\" works well, but is incredibly inconvenient due to the noise, foot traffic and distance from the comforts of the guest rooms (it is located in a building that was a considerable distance from our room in this large complex). I met a number of other guests at the \"business center\" who also reported significant problems with maintaining a stable connection through this service in their rooms. As a result, I will use caution in returning to this resort and would never do so if there were to be a remote possiblity of needing to connect to my office or otherwise needing the internet.

When we got there and got to the room I was extremely disappointed. We were at the building farthest away from the entrance and the room was not at all like what I had seen. The kitchen was not a full kitchen but more of a kitchenette. The kitchen is a big deal for me because I like to be able to cook my meals in the room. The sink was so small that it was nearly impossible to wash anything in it. We had to actually go and buy some cooking utensils because the room did not come with them. The living room area was also small with a very small TV. The rooms were very noisy and my room faced the walkway outside and was directly across from the elevator. It is a good thing I always travel with earplugs and a face mask for sleeping. The second bathroom had a jacuzzi tub but in order to get into it you had to step over a 2 foot wall to get in. Not very convienient for my handicapped Mom. Although the resort is very nice and everything is clean, I would not stay here again but will stay at my home resort just because of the advantage of the full kitchen, easy access jacuzzi tub, 42\" plasma TV, two bedrooms and three bathrooms.

That seemed great until we checked into our 3br unit at Kissimmee Star Island Resort. There were 2 br and one sitting room with a sleepsofa. I called the desk at 11pm(late arrival) and was told that I.I. considers that to be a legitimate 3br. \"your mistake was booking through I.I.\" was exactly what the night auditor said on March 6th. It turns out this place doesn't have 3br at all. Every unit is the same with the only option being to rent a unit A & B and separate unit A if you really want \"3 br\". My mother (retired grandma) booked the getaway and didn't look closely at the confirmation that arrives via email NEXT DAY AFTER you confirm payment. Why would she need to inspect page 3 to see for sure if there is a BED in the 3rd BEDROOM. We called I.I. and explained that we had 6 people on this weeklong stay and paid for and expected 3 BEDS to sleep on. Not a pull-out couch for a week. Their position was that \"technically\" we have 3 bedrooms. They said the confirmation \"explained\" there was a pull-out couch and therefore we were \"told\" When I asked for a supervisor, he said\" all getaways are final and I have Supervisory authority, you were told that there was a couch in the bedroom and technically you got what asked for.\" he refused to connect me to a Supervisor and stated nobody could do anything. When I asked if there was another resort nearby, he said \"we're all sold out everywhere\" without even a pause to check. I believe that was a direct lie. He then continued to throw it back in my face that I should have read the confirmation and seen that this wasn't an actual 3 bedroom unit. This phone conversation took place in the lobby of the Star Island Resort. I continually refused to accept the type of fraud tactic that was used and repeatedly stated that a pull-out couch does not make a room a bedroom. As I raised my voice in protest, other guests heard what our problem was. The Generall manager was called to the front desk and she approached me in the lobby. Her name was Blair. She unapologetically repeated what the I.I. person kept throwing in my face. \"The confirmation said it was a pull-out couch and therefore that makes it a bedroom. doesn't matter what you expected the bedroom to be. Doesn't matter how many people you're traveling with or what your sleeping needs are. This is what you get when you stay here. Your problem is with I.I. for not telling you more clearly what our rooms are like and for not booking you in a resort with 3 actual bedrooms\". I stated that I.I. is committing fraud and she said that since the rooms have a door, a closet and a pull-out couch, \"legally\" I.I. considers it a bedroom. She then stated that if I didn't leave the lobby, she would call security and have me removed from the property because she can't \"build me a building with 3 bedrooms\". I asked if she could at least have a bed put in place of the pull-out couch for the week. Immediately refused. Star Island and I.I. would rather deceive people and take their money, kick them off their property and force them into uncomfortable stays. It pretty much ruined my vacation and left the rest of my family feeling like we have to make due. We would never book a 3 bedroom 7night stay knowing that someone will be on a sleep-sofa. We could have saved money and booked 2br instead since most already have sleeper in the living room. We feel we were deceived and then told TOO BAD by I.I. and we never would have gone to Star Island if I.I. didn't sell it as a 3br. There are plenty of 3br resorts that I.I. has to choose from in and around Orlando and they shouldn't be deceiving people the way they did.

It is about a 5 minute drive straight into the parks - easy enough access - and in Orlando since we're out the door by 8 and not back until the parks close we didn't need much more than easy access and a great room.

It wasn't spectacular but it had a lot of character. The receptionists were very friendly and helpful and when i fist got there I actually a mini 1 bedroom with a small kitchen and no whirlpool. But JP, which I believe was a manager helped me to get an upgraded room. It was very booked that day but a room happened to be available. I really appreciated that from him. Once we entered the room, it was very nice, clean, nice whirlpool jacuzzi, the showers were nice and clean and I was pretty much happy about the room overall. I didn't really stay in the room too much though because we was out and about. However, on the last day of our trip we decided to relax at the resort and go to the pool there. It was really nice with the little waterfall in the middle. The grounds have free laundry or in your unit but we didn't have one inside of our unit. It was pretty quiet as well. The only thing was that the cable tv was a little staticy for some reason, not really clear. The decoration of the unit was a little old fashion or island type vibe but it was still clean and not rundown or anything. The tv was not updated like some of the other resorts but it wasn't really a problem. If you wanted to cook a full meal, you could do so since they provide you with everything you need other than the groceries. Overall I was pretty satisfied with my stay, had no problems at all, and there are a lot of activities and watersports on grounds but we were out painting the town :). Would I stay there again?

Whirlpool tub in the room was not functional. My husband and I search specifically for resorts with rooms with jetted tubs. The jets we had barely had any pressure coming out if at all, and the motor sounded like it was going to die. Staff phone calls. I understand the need to do timeshare updates, but I don't think it's fair to call our room every 15 minutes beginning at 7AM to schedule one. (I'm not exaggerating either) Then, when we agreed to do one at Star Island, we got up early to do it, only to be called 15 minutes before our schedule time because the staff needed to reschedule. To stop the phone calls after that, we had to unplug the phone from the wall. The hot water took 15 minutes to get warm. Water pressure in one of the bathroom sinks was terrible, barely dripping out of the sink. The resort information booklet left on the coffee table had inappropriate sexual language written all over the inside of it. The comforters were extremely dirty to the point where I had to remove it completely from the bed. Our room was too far away for the \"free\" wireless internet access.

Lauderdale, as well as one in Williamsburg. I have NEVER been so disappointed in myself for buying timeshare as I was during this past visit to Star Island. I will say the pool area was nicely cared for, but it was very obvious that was the only area that was being maintained well. Again, I am not trying to say Wyndham is terrible. I just am very disappointed that for my 1 vacation a year I got much less than what I would have expected. We did pay a lot of money for this ownership and I would like to think it gets me something a little better than what we received. Honestly, I would have rather stayed at a Holiday Inn Express. I did send my concerns to the resort staff and they replied, denying the problems with the water and the hot tub and even placed blame on us that we started the jets before the water reached the top. Believe me, we did NOT do this, we have friends who own a bed and breakfast with these same style tubs and we have always been instructed NEVER to do that, why would we start now?

Some of the employees that congregated their after their work shift were having a conversation using the F word, something I shouldn't have to listen to with their profanity. The dj has no separated monifor, you have to share his laptop screen to sing. When someone wants to sign up, they have to wait for the singer to finish their song to key you in, and that's only if he happens to see your hand raised to sing up... he doesnt' use sign up sheets. Small song selection. The book lists artists by first name and last name, which means you have to look in both places. He has no wireless microphones and one time there was a duet singing and the dj was standing on both of the microphone cords. One woman thought it was her turn to sing and when she went up to the stage, the dj told her it wasn't her turn and then he selected his next song for the dj to sing!!!

(also at westgate, our villa was a lockoff, and we didnt have the other side. when you first entered the villa, there was a huge hallway, and the people next door-and i think their visitors-made a lot of noise in this shared area. at star island, you walk right into your villa-there is no hallway.) this side had the largest bathroom, cause it included the tub. as bathrooms can go, its still small. all villas are nonsmoking (important criteria for me-i have asthma.) smoking is allowed 20 or more feet from the villas.) having two 12 yo girls wth me, i was especially concerned about this. i wanted to be somewhere i could feel comfortable with their walking in the resort alone. and i did. now for the problems. i made my reservations online. i got a discounted price in return for sitting through a timeshare presentation. i am not sure how the price compares without the timeshare. we paid $100 a night. ok this is not a problem, however it may have lead to problems. i called ahead to confirm my reservation. i spoke to two employees and neither could find my reservation. (can you imagine my panic? plus, it wasnt just my family, we had my daughters friend. if we had to, my family and i could hang our hats any old place for just one night. however i wouldnt feel right doing that with someone elses child.) then i called the friends dad, he accessed my email and confirmed my reservation with star island. i called the resort again, and this time they found it. what relief. except, when i physically arrived at the resort, again they couldnt find it. and they had no idea who the person was who had. and they didnt recognize the confirmation number she had given me. (i felt like i was in the twilight zone.) they offered us the 3 bedroom villa i said we were reserved for. and suggested that we wait till the morning to straighten out the reservation. i was a little concerned about this, but remembered the person to who had confirmed my reservation. so i figured i belonged there and wasnt going to be charged the regular nighly rate. as i said above the rooms were beautiful. i quickly accessed my email, and saw what created the problem. they had mispelled our surname, using an \"M\" instead of an \"N\".i called the front desk and told them that, and lo and behold, they found our reservation. altho i was speaking to the same person i had checked in with, i received no apology. if not actually rude, the front desk employees werent the most pleasant. perhaps i was a bit remiss in not bringing a copy of the confirmation, or at least noticing the misspelling of my name. but am i wrong in thinking they should have looked it up under a different letter. and i believe the only ways to search for a reservation, was through its number or the first name. not by address or telephone number or company you made the reservation with.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MICHIGAN", "Title": "\u201cBest Retreat of the Year!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "SOCCERJEWLS2006", "ReviewID": "UR28353511", "Content": "This is our families 10th year vacationing at star island, we are so lucky to have found this vacation spot.

The resort is very well maintained and as you drive in, you are welcomed by fountain and flowers bed all around the drop off area. Very pretty. Lobby is spacious and check in was quick. We had a small issue with the unit assigned to us and Matt, the front desk rep along with PJ the manager on duty were quick to assist us and provided us a unit that truly made us happy. We were in building 18, which is not located by the pool - but this is what we wanted, as it is a very quiet area. We had unit AB, which is the largest one available, comprising of 2 full bedroom (one with king size bed and double jacuzzin and walk-in shower). Full kitchen with lots of space all the ustensile, cookware and pots that you might need. Appliances are full size and include washer-dryer (stack type) and worked perfectly. I made many many margaritas with the blender supplied. The unit also had another full bathroom and another smaller room like a den and had a total of 3 TV and a balcony. Very very beautiful and extremely quiet. The only bad thing, not a resort fault, but the last 2 nights we had very very noisy neighbors who played loud music at 1:00pm. But we called security and the matter was very quickly addressed and resolved. The resort is a 'gated' community which add to the security of the guests. The pool is wonderful and there is a lot of space to sit and there is a DJ to entertain. The gym is beautiful, with TV and excellent machine, although the ventilation was very poor and it became very hot very fast as you workout. The main change room has a dry sauna and a steam sauna et also include a big hot tub. It is very beautiful and spacious, with lots of towels and space to keep your stuff. Check out was great, although I was a bit surprise that we were not given a final statement at check out to show that we owed nothing. In retrospect, I think that I would probably insist next time that something be given to me, to ensure that no amount will be charged without my consent.

The sofabed was so delapitated and dirty that it was not an option when it came to sleeping. Then there was the lovely cockroach we found in the kitchen sink! That was a pleasant treat! Don't be fooled by the photos of the grounds. The pool area, the lobby and the grounds are beautiful, but when you get to the buildings and see the dark, dirty corridors you are in for a completely different experience. As a person who has stayed at many condo resorts in the Disney area, take my advice and spend your money elsewhere. There are many beautiful resorts with 1,2, and 3 bedroom units and full kitchens which are far superior to Star Island. Wyndham's Cypress Palms, Summer Bay Resort, Polynesian Isles Resort and Wyndham's Bonnet Creek are far better places to spend your valuable vacation time.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pa", "Title": "\u201cNO way!\u201d", "Author": "kpandtpinpa", "ReviewID": "UR14247398", "Content": "We planned a quick weekend getaway and were so excited to find a place that had loads to do for kids since we have a 6yo and 16 month old. I called the day before to confirm our reservation and to ensure that we would have a crib in our room. Our flight was delayed so we did not arrive to the hotel until 2 AM...Finding the hotel was easy, a short drive from the airport. Check in went smooth and I thought this was too easy! Off we went to our room... NO parking.....had to park pretty far away from the entrance to the building which houses a lot of rooms considering it is 6 or 7 floors. 5th floor was our destination...we got off the elavator and immediately entered the concrete coves! Everything is concrete, there is no view of anything! We found our room down the concrete hall. Entering the room was interesting, we entered into the hallway where to the right was a room with two double beds and to the left was a small room with a couch like piece of furniture, more like an outdoor piece of furniture with cushions, a small table for two and a very small sink and frige. It is now 3:15 in the morning and we are exhusted...there was no crib so we had to call to the front desk and ask again for it. 20 minutes later it arrived. We got settled at about 3:30 and we just closed our eyes when our \"neighbor\" came home. We suspected that our room was a \"lockout\" due to the extra door in the hallway, but never could we have imagined the noise that would radiate into the bedroom. The walls were paper thin and we heard every word that was being said. I think we finally just passed out from pure exhaustion...the last I looked at the clock it was 4:30...6:00am rise and shine!!!!!!! seems everyone was up at this time and because there is concrete EVERYWHERE it echos like crazy. The window int he bedroom looks out to the concrete stairs and hallways so you heard people up and down the steps and halls, the window in the couch room sits along the hallway so your head is sleeping inches from people walking by with a paperthin wall between. we were up and off to breakfast....At 9:00 we were back, packed and checked out we were not going to be in a prison for four days!!!!

We were hoping to see some renovations and/or new activities. Needless to say, not much has changed in the past five years. We requested one of their newest units, which we received; however, our room still looked outdated with pink walls, carpet, and furnishings. We booked a three bedroom/ 3 bathroom deluxe villa. We were expecting a pretty large unit, but discovered a series of lock-offs that were extremely small. The villa included a king bed with its own bathroom, an adjoining room with 2 double bed and a separate bathroom, and a lock-off that had an efficiency room with a pullout small sleeper sofa, and another small queen bedroom that shared a bathroom. This floor plan was not viewable on their website, so we did not realize how small the set up was going to be. Luckily, we had our own washer/dryer because we had the entire villa, sides A and B. If you only have one side, you must share with the other unit. Fortunately, all the rooms were clean. We did have to have housekeeping vacuum all the floors when we first arrived, but they were quick to correct the problem. There were a few hairs in the shower, but I just made my husband get rid of them. Our room smelled like smoke, so I am assuming the last guests did not heed the nonsmoking room policy. The linens and towels were worn, but at least they were clean. The kitchen was nicely stocked, but we only used the kitchen a few times. Aside from issues with the villa, the staff was great. Whenever we needed something, they were very accommodating and friendly. We received no sales calls and were never pressured to attend a time share presentation. We did not use the pool, but it looked clean and well maintained. The location is extremely convenient to Disney, shopping, and restaurants. Overall, our stay at the Star Island was fine. We usually stay at Marriott properties, so my standards are a little high. If the unit was bigger and the villas were updated I would have rated this resort higher. If you have read other horrible reviews and are hesitant about staying at this resort, I would recommend giving Star Island a shot.

Weunderstand that the Star Island Resort was recently taken over by a new company and is in the process of having a \u201cfacelift\u201d.

What surprised and disappointed us at Fairfield was the fact that towels were only exchanged one time in the middle of the week. The villa was equipped with an apartment size washer and dryer, but the maximum amount of towels it would hold was four (and the dryer initially did not work until we placed a service call). With a family of seven, we would be spending most of our vacation doing laundry, which to me is not a vacation at all. Daily fresh towels were offered but at a cost of $7.00 per exchange. Even the most inexpensive hotel/motel offers fresh towels on a daily basis. Maid service was also offered, but at a cost of $25.00 per visit! We find this to be unusual and exorbitant. Again, this type of service is included in almost every hotel/motel I\u2019ve ever encountered. Also, complimentary coffee and tea are typically available in the lobbies of any facility I\u2019ve ever stayed at. Fairfield Star Island was charging $1.50 per cup in their lobby. Maintenance and upkeep of the facility was mediocre at best. Plus the staff strongly pushed us to go to a presentation to attempt to \"sell\" us more time at a new facility near Epcot with the understanding that if we went for 30 minutes, we would get discount tickets to Disney World. We had to stay two hours before we were given our discount coupons. Needless to say, we were not happy. Again, I say I realize that we\u2019ve become somewhat accustomed to the type of service and accommodations we have in Cancun. But the examples I\u2019ve listed above are not outside the normal level of expectations, even at a three or four star facility. At best, Fairfield Star Island Resort should be rated as a 3 star resort. I now understand why the other owners at the Royal Resorts very rarely exchange their weeks.

The resort is located off of route 192 which is a honky tonk strip of crazy gift shops and chain restaurants.

It is very quiet, little to no highway sounds. You feel like you are in a \"resort\" community. Our room was huge. It was a 3 bedroom suite. If we brought 2 families it would have been perfect since there were lockout doors for 2 bedrooms and 2nd bath. The room was very clean and well decorated but it had a strange design which left a lot of open spaces here and there. We were told by other guests that there is a new section with even larger rooms. I can't believe anyone would want anything larger. The kids thought it funny to have 4 televisions (like we go to Orlando to watch TV?). Every night there is a dinner served at the bar/pool area. Most were buffet style. Italian night hosted by Olive Garden was served to our table. Not bad for $6 each. One complaint would be the front desk check-in girl when we first checked in on Sunday. There were no lines we just walked up and she acted like we were not even there. I was standing 2 feet in front of her and she just did not care about us. Bad first impression but it did not ruin our day. To their credit the front desk was very helpful later on in the week taking care of our needs and questions. The guys in the pool cabana (where you get towels, rent tennis, etc) were the best ! They acted so happy to be able to serve us. They are the ones that we tipped the most. My only real complaint is that they schedule all the family activities i.e. clowns, balloons, jugglers, kareoke, bingo etc at the bar. The bar environment is not bad but I would not want my 10 year old to attend some of the activities due to drinking, VERY LOUD music and the yelling and screaming of some of the bar patrons. I understand they want to sell alcohol but not everyone drinks. Some daytime kids games were down by the pool but everything else is at the bar. Interestingly, the resort called my home one week prior to our arrival leaving a message that there was something wrong with out reservation. So of course, with some alarm, we called and come to find out it was the timeshare staff trying to get us to set up a tour. I was very upset and asked what was supposesdly wrong with our reservation. She put me on hold and then told me that they did not have the name of our host resort that we traded from (through Interval International). A likely story. I told her as forcefully as I could that we did not want to go on the tour and we did not want to be contacted while at the resort. I added that is she contacted us (for tour or promotion) that we would consider it harassment. According to our wishes...they did not. By the way the tour gift is $75 Star Island Dollars.

Being a young couple, the main point of this vacation was to enjoy the parks & just relax. Pros: Early check-in. Check-in is usually 4pm & we got to check in around 1:30pm, it was also very quickly. They invited us to a timeshare meeting (lasted 30 minutes for us) which saves you a lot of money on the parks, & dinner shows. You choose which savings options out of many. The rooms were very Florida welcoming, which was nice since our vacation spot was Florida. Basically the whole resort was very nice. We stayed in a 1 bedroom \"B\" lock-off suite. An amazing jacuzzi with columns next to the bed, that was great to relax & watch tv in. The main street (highway) was close by with countless amounts of restaurants. The shuttles to the parks were very fair in prices. $10 per person round trip to Disney & $14 p/p r/t to Universal. Also, there are great savings in the front Concierge desk. Cons: The suite was for up to 4 people. There was only one toliet, which was in the bedroom. The jacuzzi obviously wasn't closed off, but the shower was glass doors so it was see-through. This we didn't mind, but if we had other people with us, that would have been a problem. Now i'm not too sure about the food topic, but when I asked earlier today if there was anything besides hot dogs, the lady said no, that's all for tonight. It was only 6:00 & the hot-dog stand next to the pool was closed for the night (when the pool stays open til 11pm.) There should always be food on site for people to eat when they get hungry. Even the hot dog price was ridiculous, from being born & raised in New York I don't expect to pay any more then $1.50 for a hot dog from a cart & they charge $3.50 (that's bananas). The prices for everything is ridiculous. I guess that's what you get for staying at a \"FiVE STAR HOTEL\". The game room for kids is pretty boring with no more then 7, 8 different games, nothing special AT ALL. The pool is nothing special either, it's pretty small in size & doesn't go past 5 feet. There isn't a shuttle from your villa to the main part of the resort. We had a good 10-15 minute walk each way, which was not enjoyable.

To make things easier I will post my pros and cons. Pros: Pools were great. Kids programs were made fun. We took advantage of the driving range and tennis courts and they were very good. The support staff was great. We had a tv remote that did not work and rather than sluff it off, the maintenance person brought over a brand new tv! We called for fresh towels;no problem; even sheets and yellow pages;no problem. All reports were followed up by a call from a supervisor to see if everything was done right. The gym is good, for a resort. Nice to see some security. Cons: Rooms could use a little refurbishing, the couches and carpets seemed a little worn. No snack bar,unless you wanted chips.

The resort was in a great location only 6 miles from the entrance to Disney World and on the same road (Highway 192) so there was no way to get lost getting in or out of the parks. Highway 192 was just filled with every type of restaurant you could imagine which made meal choices very easy and quick to get to. We arrived at the resort at 2pm and walked right up to the front desk and got our room keys without any delay at all. 4pm is the usual check-in time but that did not matter at all as we were right on our way to the unit. We had a second floor 2 Bedroom Deluxe Unit sides A&B which was located just two buildings from the clubhouse and on a pond. We were two families (4 Adults and 3 children) and the unit was HUGE! The Master bedroom was very large with a great Jacuzzi Tub in it. The second bedroom had two double beds in it and the bonus room (which is really a 3rd bedroom) had a pullout couch as well as did the main family room. The rooms all had large tv's (4 in all). The air conditioning worked great - which is a good thing in the 90 degree heat of the day. The kitchen was spacious and as well as was the 2nd full bathroom. Finally, the deck was also huge and was great to relax on in the evenings. The resort itself was beautifully landscaped and the clubhouse had the day spa, huge gym, arcade and behind it were two pools. The pools were warm and gorgeous. The kids loved the zeor entry pool which they could just run in and out of as often as they liked. It was also shallow (0 to about 5 ft.) so kids could easily navigate through. The other pool was a little deaper and tended to have more older kids and adults. There was dj at poolside each day and he really did a great job and also got the kids engaged in many poolside activities. The pool was also open from 7am to 11pm so we found ourselves spending an hour here and there throughout the day as we were inbetween park hopping.

The one bedroom was spacious for the most part (kitchen a little cramped, but we didn't need a big kitchen here) and was very clean. The spa tub was the best, once we got it to work. My husband is very handy and mechanically inclined and was able to get it working without having to call the front desk - but, it should have been working to begin with. Also, the sound system had some wires disconnected so that the only speakers that were working were in the dining area - the speakers in the living room and the bedroom did not work. My husband fixed those as well - we should have charged Star Island for the maintenance repairs my husband did in our room. Saturday morning there was no sleeping in, as we had to be at a presentation at 8:00 in the morning - ouch! No sleeping in that morning! But it worked out okay, this way at least we got a decent start on the day and Universal. Easter Sunday morning - finally a day we can sleep in, even though we were checking out that day. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!! 7:00 in the morning someone was outside our patio doors with an extremely loud leaf blower! Who in their right mind does landscaping, or leaf blowing, that time of day at a \"resort\" where people are PAYING for comfort and relaxation; did I mention it was 7:00 in the morning on Sunday - Easter Sunday???? Needless to say, there was no going back to sleep at that point - so we're up. Check out time is not for 3 hours yet, so we can relax for a while; right? NO!! 9:00 a.m. a guy is literally pounding on the front door, ringing the door bell, and pounding some more - only to ask when we would be leaving!! Duh........checkout is 10:00 - we'll be leaving then. Not 15 minutes later, there's another knock on the door, this time a female, with the same question. 15 minutes after that, my husband is carrying the first item to the car, and the guy that had pounded on the door at 9:00 was right there, asking if we were out now. Of course not - we told you 10:00, it's only 9:30!! One last thing.............you know the coupon you get in the brochure they give you when you check in - \"buy one drink get one free\"???? You better like something other than beer or wine............the coupon is only good for the \"expensive\" drinks!! What's up with that??? Oh, and I almost forgot - does the Mariott or Gaylord expect you to strip your own beds before leaving? I've never heard of such a thing!! Gather all the linens and towels, place them in the tub, load the dishwasher and start it before leaving - come on!! Where's the service? It's bad enough they don't automatically come in and clean every day - I could have done without fresh towels every day - but having the bed made for us would have been nice - what were we paying for again?

I thought I had reserved the 1 bedroom with spa and balcony since it indicated 1=4+4. Additionally, the room Interval International reserved for us as room number 2433A was a handicapped unit although not noted as such on the Confirmation Certificate. We did not request a handicapped room. Our trip through Interval International and Star Island was not an enjoyable vacation accommodation, did not meet my expectations and created a great deal of anxiety for us as detailed below. We went to check-in at 7:00 p.m. Saturday February 11, 2006, no mention of the handicapped facilities were mentioned as we checked in. We went to the room, discovered it was a handicapped room. We returned to the front desk and requested a non-handicapped room. I specifically asked if this new room had a spa and balcony was told yes to the spa and no to the balcony. At this point I called Interval International and spoke with a representative regarding the room that was reserved for us. She understood but told us this was the only type of room she had available for us at this resort and asked if I had reviewed my confirmation certificate. I explained I had research on-line and had thought we reserved another type of unit. We went to the second room 2453 given to us and found no spa, and it was a lock-off room. The neighboring room occupants opened the lockoff door to peer in at us and then quickly closed the door. Additionally this resort only suggested non-smoking and this second room given to us was so filled with cigaratte smoke from the adjoining lockoff 2-bdrm unit that we could not stay in this unit either. I called the front desk explained the circumstances and asked if another room was available and they said they would check and give me a call back. I received no call after waiting 30 minutes and returned with luggage in tow for a second time to the front desk. At this point the front desk staff checked to see if another room was available. I was told that this type of unit was only in building 24 and one last room was available room 2413 on the first floor. This room finally checked out for us and we finally had a room at 10:30 p.m. One other occurrence I\u2019d like to note is that we returned to our room late Monday evening to find that our keycards did not work. We returned to the front desk, explained the situation and they were surprised to find that we were in room 2413. However, they rekeyed our cards and we returned to the room to find it had been cleaned and our starter supplies for the unit removed. I called maintenance during hours and new starter supplies were promptly delivered. So this although we received a free room-cleaning, it was another inconvenience for us and a note to us that the Resort had poor record keeping. While the room itself was good as a lockoff room, I felt like we were in a hole without a view. The two windows in the unit faced the back parking lot. The kitchen viewed a walkway and wall. The bedroom window viewed the parking lot. We stayed out of the room away from the resort as much as we could. This is not our norm; we usually like to enjoy the resort as well as the area attractions. This is our second trip to the area with Interval International and I will not be reserving a 1 bedroom on-line in the future since not enough information is included; it is misleading and deceiving.

Star Island makes a great first impression, with beautiful grounds and buildings, but the experience doesn't live up to the appearance. My family owns a timeshare, has for years, and because of the cost of plane tickets to St. Maarten we swapped our week there for Thanksgiving week at Star Island. It was not a comparable experience. First, the \"villa\" we were given was really just the A and B sides of a lock-out. It was billed as a three-bedroom; this was not really the case. The \"A\" side contains one bedroom with two full-size beds, and one bedroom with a queen-sized pull-out couch, plus a decent-sized bath with a 1-person jacuzzi tub. The tub was so deep I couldn't imagine anyone with limited mobility getting in and out of there! The pull-out was well-used, to say the least, and not very comfortable. The \"B\" side had one bedroom with a king-sized bed, the double jacuzzi tub in the bedroom, a full kitchen, living room and patio. The decorations were a few years old, or at least looked that way, but things were reasonably clean and well-kept. The problems began almost immediately. That night when we tried to give my 10-month-old son a bath, we got no hot water in the bathroom on the \"B\" side. We called maintenance immediately, and it took over 2 hours to call us back -- and say that they would take a look the next morning. OK, now we have a grimy baby and 6 people taking a shower in one bathroom! To their credit they did come by the next morning (10 a.m.) and corrected the problem, but that put a crimp in our plans for the day. The next problem was a malfunctioning window -- no screen (essential in Florida!) and wouldn't stay open. Two guys worked on it for an hour and then told me, sorry, you can't open the window. The longer we were there, the more we noticed details that didn't make sense. First, the lovely marble tile in the bathrooms was horribly slippery when it was wet! Since the tub and shower both were surrounded by this marble tile, it made getting in and out of the bath delicate. Also, there are marble tile stairs into the jacuzzi that have very sharp edges. This caused us a lot of nervous moments with my son, toddler that he is, would go near them (remember, there is no wall between the bedroom and the jacuzzi)! The mid-week cleaning that we expected didn't happen. They will come and exchange your towels, might make a few passes with a vacuum in the living room, but that's it. Considering the number of people showing two bathrooms, they were getting disgusting, and the floor was littered with cookie and chip pieces mostly courtesy of my son. In desperation, I went down to housekeeping and paid $55 cash to have the room \"thoroughly cleaned\". I guess \"thoroughly\" means different things to me than to housekeeping. Only one toilet got wiped down, they didn't touch the sinks or tubs; the kitchen cleaning consisted of the vacuum being run three sweeps through it (I was standing there making dinner for my son); the living room cleaning was another half dozen stabs into the center of the room with the vacuum; and only the linens in one room got changed. While I was feeding my son housekeeping called to ask if the maids had been there to clean -- I said yes, and then she thanked me and hung up. After the baby went down for a nap I walked around and realized all that hadn't been done, and had to make the decision not to waste any more of my vacation twisting the arm of someone to do their job properly. Writing this review and not visiting their resort again would have to do. As for the rest of the resort, it was lovely to look at but the details were sloppy. Only half the fountains worked properly; the \"adult\" pool was closed for repairs the whole visit (and surrounded by more of that treacherous marble tile, a warning sign was even up); the spa looked lovely but the services were overpriced so I can't comment on them. The exercise room looked OK, I never had a minute to visit. If you are one who has a room facing the clubhouse and bar, plan on keeping your windows shut in the evenings -- the every-night karaoke is noisy and painfully talent-free. On the plus side there was plenty of parking, my son really enjoyed the \"beach\" and splash pool, and it looked like they had some nice programs for kids. The staff was very pleasant, but weirdly powerless to correct problems like bad housekeeping and nonfunctioning windows. The icing on the cake was when we checked out - they tried to charge us AGAIN for the cleaning I had already paid for, and had a reciept to prove it! After a shouting match they \"cancelled\" the charge, with an attitude, but we were all steaming when we left there. This resort is very much caveat emptor. If you have minimal needs and don't spend much time in the rooms, it's quite adequate. If you have to spend a lot of time there, as we did with the baby, it gets annoying.", "Date": "November 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWorst stay at a resort in my life!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4107849", "Content": "Where to begin!

We stayed at Star Island in Kissimmee, Fl and from the moment we arrived, there was nothing but trouble. Our room was supposed to be ready at 1:00pm but the clerk at the front desk said \"unfortunately the people in your room didnt check out yet.\" He told us we could leave our luggage at the front desk and when the room is available, they will put the luggage in the room for us. Being a New Yorker, I asked how safe it was to leave the luggage in the lobby. The clerk replied \"we have security camaras as well as we do not allow people near the luggage.\" Sounded good at the time. We left the luggage and went to Disney World for a little bit. When we arrived back at the hotel, the luggage was still in the lobby with all the zippers openned. I looked in my bag first to notice someone went through everything and stole some clothes as well as other items from my bag. My mother and sister then checked their bags and sure enough, items were stolen from their bags as well. I immediately blew up at the manager (the clerk that originally helped us left for the day) and told him I needed a police officer immediately. He told me it is not smart to have the police involved, the hotel will handle everything. Again, being from NY, I called B.S. and said get the police here now. He gave me an attitude and the phone number and told me to call myself if I wanted them there. We filled out a police report and called it an evening. The next morning I went down to the lobby to find the original clerk but was told he was off and will be in tomorrow. Tomorrow never came because our entire 7 day stay he did not show up once. I as well as the police officer that helped us out think it was the clerk that went through the bags. The stay became worse each day we were there but I will not go into that because this should be enough to make you not want to stay there. Anyway, it is now 5-13-05 and we still havent recieved a dollar from Star Islands Insurance company. As a matter of fact, I call twice a week only to realize my phone calls are still being ignored by the Insurance company as well as Star Island. I also found out Star Island is only insured for a maximum of $1000.00 per theft and being my family and I filled out 1 police report for all our items stolen, it counts for one incident so we only get the max $1000.00 payment if and when they send it to us. We had between $2000.00 and $3000.00 stolen. The insurance company Star Island uses is Wausau Insurance Companies. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESORT TO ANYONE!!!!

I have been to a few 5 star spas and this wasn't.The pools were both nice,very warm and the Jacuzzi was hot.It was crowded around the pool but being spring break what wasn't.The little area with the water spouts coming up from the ground was a great thing to keep my 18mo.old busy.The play ground and Jumpy house were nice too.We did have to go for the sales presentation as we were on an owner referal special rate($995.00) for the week.( A lot cheaper than most 3bd.condo's in Kissimme in March)They were not too pushy with us.I would say that overall Star Island was a good experience.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "WAXHAW NC", "Title": "\u201cCanceled reservation Poor customer service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3321392", "Content": "Star Island Resort canceled our confirmed reservation less than one week from our arrivial date without providing alt. accomadations.

I do agree though, that they're claiming to be a five star resort is a tad off base. Perhaps it's not for those folks who can afford the higher end suites, but for us, it was a nice stay, but not five star. First off, the staff was wonderful to our every need. We had a small problem with the toilet on about our third day and they came and fixed it immediately as well as getting us fresh towels and making sure we had them by another phone call, which I thought was nice. There was just the two of us, so we didn't need a spacious suite...those of you with four or more in your familys, do NOT stay in one of the mini-suites. Yes, they are tiny, but were fine for the two of us. My only serious conplaints were with the bathroom. No shelf space to put anything. The tiny glass shelf under our mirror was barely hanging on by a thread, so we didn't dare put anything heavier than a toothbrush on it. And the controls for the whirlpool tub are clear across the room and I thought the tub was broken until I found them. The pools were great, especially since we had some real warm days in mid-February. We sat down by the pool and enjoyed it very much. I do wish it were a tad larger to accommodate all the people and the deck chairs. It go quite crowded and hard to move a chair around when it go busy. Other than that, I thought it was a wonderful place. Clean and no bugs. We were on the fourth floor of building #22. Parking was a pain on one or two nights, but for the most part we were able to park near the building and the elevator took us right to our room. No problem. The grounds were nicely done and were beautiful to walk through. I didn't take advantage of the spa or the exercise room...far too busy, but they looked nice. The staff was always willing to answer any questions we had. AND...we were NEVER bothered about going to any meetings to \"buy\" one of the condos are told to go to another desk when checking in. Not one person or phone regarding that. Probably because we were in one of the cheapest suites and they didn't feel we were worthy...who knows!", "Date": "March 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "bennington,vt", "Title": "\u201cnot a five star !!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3267381", "Content": "our stay at star island was not the best.

We booked it thru Interval, and the reason we chose Star Island was that it was listed as a 5 star and we could book it a year in advance. Well it wasn't a five star as far as I'm concerned. We stayed in the A & B unit with 2 bedrooms, a room with a pull out, and a pull out in the living room. The Cons My biggest beef was our third floor balcony. Our 18 month old couldn't even go out on it. The railings were spaced so far apart she could slip her head and body thru. So needless to say, none of us went out there much. An easy solution would be chicken wire around the balcony if requested. I wouldn't care how it looked if she were safe to wander freely. Our toilet kept overflowing, and even after maintence looked at it, the back end of the condo unit smelled like sewage for the entire time we were there. I went to have a soak in the smaller jacuzzi tub one night, and luckily I had to turn on the jets before I got in, cause one jet cover came off and blasted black gunk into the tub. It was pretty gross. The pools were freezing. The kids pool was uninhabitable so my 18 month old couldn't even walk around in it, nor my three year old. The big pool was slightly warmer but not much, and the hot tub was heated to about the temperature the big pool should have been. In two weeks we went swimming twice. We only saw one cockroach in our room, and one gecko who ran in when we opened the door. He was pretty cute. The gecko, not the cockroach. The Pros Any calls for maintenace and cleaning service were dealt with promptly, like high chairs, cribs, linen and fixing the bathroom appliances. They had great fun nights for the kids. One night it was all you can eat tacos followed by a juggler. Another, it was hot dogs and hamburgers with a magician. The people hired were great to include the kids from the audience. Star Island is 15 minutes from Walt Disney World parks. Close to shopping like Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Target, plus all the big outlet malls. It wasn't all bad. Star Island would not be my first choice if we ever go to Orlando again, but you could do a lot worse. This was our first big family trip, and I'd been planning it for over a year and a half. I guess I was a little disappointed. I had read the reviews posted here and thought that people were being too picky, but I will definately take a bit more stock in peoples reviews from now on.", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "north shirley, new york", "Title": "\u201c0 stars never 5 stars\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3014419", "Content": "i have stayed at 5 star resorts and belive me star island is no 5 star resort the rooms are dirty and not well kept they don't provide any kind of service we stayed there for 4 nights and they never picked up the garbage that was outside my door we asked for clean towels and never got them we asked for extra pillows the first night and didn't get them until the second night we were on the third floor and there was no elevator. i would never stay at this place again nor would i ever recommend this place to anybody, they should be ashamed to call themself a 5 star resort,zero in my book. if anyone wants to buy a timeshare in this place you better think twice this place is a dump.", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Northport, NY", "Title": "\u201cNice place to hang your hat...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3007781", "Content": "We stayed there December 25 - January 1, 2005 in building 18 on the second floor. It was an Interval trade and we occupied both A and B units. The B unit was huge and nicely decorated with a full kitchen, washer and dryer, living room with pull-out couch and master suite with an in room jacuzzi and a walk-in shower. They supplied a some laundry detergent, dishwashing soap, sponges and dishwasher powder. There was also a terrace. The entertainment unit in the living room had a CD player and a VCR - nice touch! The A unit consisted of a bathroom with a small jacuzzi tub, bedroom with two double beds and a living room with a kitchenette, TV and pull-out couch. All the bedrooms had TVs as well. The \"tech\" staff was very helpful in assisting my son in setting up his Play Station and in helping us set up our laptop for internet access via the phone line. The charge for using the phone line was $.75 each time as it was a local call. Not a bad deal. They also have computers with internet access set up in the main building for a charge if you don't want to bring your own computer. Room service was provided by TGI Fridays. We ordered one night and they took about an hour and a half to deliver...then they forgot part of our order. We called to complain and they apologized and gave us our meal for free. The next time we ordered was much better! (I have to cut them a break..it was a crazy busy week in Orlando!) Grounds are nice, pools nice and if you like tennis you'll be happy here. Not much action at the lake, but it was a bit on the cool side. The gym is excellent - plenty of cardio machines to go around- elipticals, treadmills, steppers and bicycles. There are also weight machines and an area for stretching and sit-ups. My only complaint about the resort was the lack of knowledge and hours of the concierge. She often left as early as 3:00, leaving us to ask the front desk for suggestions on eateries.

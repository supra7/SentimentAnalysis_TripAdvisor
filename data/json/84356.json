For those looking for grand rooms or 5 star service, plan to pay 4 times as much as The Plaza. The rooms are more than enough, clean, and housekeeping is more than willing to accommodate you, just be polite. This is a beach resort and even though the room is big, the bathrooms are not; but you don't spend most of your time in the bathroom I hope. The room was large enough to host guests and the location and resort grounds were great for exploring, so if you plan to stay in the room, go elsewhere. During my stay I noticed a diligent effort in maintenance and remodeling. The management and Lobby staff was extremely helpful, pleasant, and made you feel like a welcomed guest. For those on a budget and not willing to pay resort prices, of course you will be shocked, but The Plaza offers activities, leisure's, and extras the same as other resorts and better prices. My stay was a quiet one and allowed me to relax. The building itself is well manicures and actually looks better than the surrounding hotels, you almost forget you are in a city.

Not so... and there is a door coming in from the garage, into the hallway that has no guard or person watching. The garage needed painting really bad and a good cleaning. 4) The bathroom has no cabinets or counter to use for personal items.

However, the rooms weren't nearly as classy as you'd expect based on that lobby.

There was a small stain of who knows what on the bottom sheet of one of our beds. The top sheet to that same set was ripped. I specifically asked that the sheets on both beds be replaced by house keeping. And, while the beds were made, the sheets were NOT replaced. Also, we had to make repeated calls to the front desk to ask for items such as extra towels and toilet paper. Generally these things were accomplished by the 3 request. Also, the pool was so dirty.

First, I'll state the positives I noticed...There was a DJ Saturday outside by the pool and at night they were playing a movie on a huge screen by the pool. The outside bar area looked nice with lots of shade if you wanted to stay out of the sun and there was a cool mister which was nice because it was extremely hot. BUT........We had a room on the 2nd fl near the parking garage. As soon as you walked in from the parking garage, it smells like poop and did the entire stay. I assume it is because the building is so old, and there are restrooms immediately inside the parking garage entrance. The hallways ALL had a bad odor though, and our room did too. Parking is not plentiful and when we went to leave on Sunday morning, some idiot had parked behind our car because there was nowhere else to park. Luckily the 2 spots next to us had emptied and my husband was able to maneuver the car out or we would've had a long wait to leave while they towed the car. As other reviews have said, the bathroom is small and has a pedastal sink, so nowhere to put your stuff. No central air condition (too old I guess) so you have a very noisy air conditioning unit to cool your room. Also, it's true as others have said, the room is noisy, you can hear everything in the hallways and other rooms. The beds were clean and no bugs in the room, but the pillows were the worst I have ever had at a hotel (miniature size & lumpy). Our room had a little fridge, microwave & coffee maker but they were not on any granite counter top as others have said. Ours were stacked on top of each other next to the air conditioning unit. We ate breakfast at the restaurant one morning - all you can eat buffett for $11. The food was OK, but the tables in the restaurant are old and the tops are made out of something that leaves them sticky all the time which was gross. I could of dealt with all of these things if it wasn't for the smell of the place so if you are sensitive to smells, I'd skip this place. Our friends were at the Regency down the road and for the same price per night. Their rooms were immaculate, large, had kitchens with full size fridge, oven, microwave, and dishwasher.

First of all the hotel manager needs to get more staff on the property and train them better. For instance, at the pool, the garbage cans were overflowing until around 1130am, pool guy finally showed up around 11am, pool area was not cleaned up from previous night (i.e.. towels, lounge chairs not straightened up, they have a towel check out place and it was not ready until around 11 (i was told to go to basement and get a towel if i want one though). In advance, i asked for an early check in (before 4pm) and was told if one is available we could get it. Beginning around 11am i checked at the desk to see if one is available and by 330 i asked and was told again it was not available, luckily another front desk person had arrived, saw my frustration and called housekeeping to see if room is available and of course it was. From walking around the property for 3 days, the employees were just not trained well as they were talking about going out partying, working too much, playing their mp3 player for everyone to hear it etc, just an overall lack of professionalism (manager not doing his job). The grounds for most part looked pretty good, the beach side of hotel had a large piece blown off i assume by a storm that needed repair (no storms lately though), the lobby had a big water leak and left large water bubbles on the ceiling tiles and one had fallen through, the restaurant had several chairs with holes in the seats, our hotel room had a shelf missing in the shower that showed the old glue and mold. The small gym was very nicely painted but the equipment looked bought from a garage sale as a few pieces were rusted and broken. Outside there were more rusted railing than there were clean fresh painted railings. A few other little things that i will remember later. On the positive side, entrance way had new flower beds, bellman (one of them, as the other one was flirting with a housekeeping girl) was very polite, one of the front desk guys was professional, the room was clean, not perfect but better than the budget hotels, some parts of the hotel, looked very well kept with fresh paint. The parking garage appeared safe and well lit and they had valet parking. Food at the restaurant was pretty good and breakfast buffet for $11.00 was not too bad. Overall i will stay again if the price is in low $100's but paying $309.00 night, it was very very disappointing.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful facility but not well maintained!\u201d", "Author": "1murphyisbest", "ReviewID": "UR133120700", "Content": "Our family stayed at this hotel for a couple of days.

There was one clerk checking in/out guest and also answering phones, taking reservations and communicating with housekeeping staff. She was very rushed and flustered. We had requested rooms close to another family that we were traveling with. She could not accommodate even though the request was made when the reservation was made weeks earlier. My second observation was that there was a musky smell within the hallways of the hotel. Not so much within the room itself but when you open the door to step out into the hallway on the 12th floor it would take your breath.

Upon check in, the front desk had no idea what a groupon was, and assumed he was to charge me for a full 3 day price in addition to what I had already payed. The first afternoon myself and my group wanted to hang out by the pool area and have some drinks. While walking out to find a spot the hotel bartender (Duane) ran out from behind the bar yelling at us rudely about having glass in the pool. He ripped the drink out of our friends hand assuming she was underage. She and another member of our group left, to take the beer back to the room. After finding a spot the bartender continued to further harass us, asking for the names and room number for the people in our group. We told him to leave us alone and he called hotel security on us. This is NO way for any service employee to treat paying guests. Another issue, our toilet was running the whole time we were there and ended up clogging on us late the 3rd night of our stay. The toilet ended up having to be pulled for maintenance and we were moved into a different room with flickering lights and a dead bug in the closet. Upon notifying the hotel staff, we were directed to a man who claimed to be a manager (who we later found out was not) He just laughed about the situation and told us he \"did not know what he could do to remedy the situation\". However, upon checkout we were able to speak with another manager who was very courteous and helpful, and said she would notify her boss of the issue. In addition to the rate given by the hotel there is also a $15 daily hotel services fee along with state tax and federal tax so i ended up paying an additional $72 dollars.

I use Priceline all the time for business and was pleased to win a 3.5 star bid on the beach for $60 a night. After I learned it was the Plaza, I researched the reviews of the property and became concerned that they had received many negative reviews about the quality and service provided on the posters visits. I have a very high opinion for Priceline's star ratings. And I found it very suprising that a property that they have rated 3.5 stars would not be of high quality and service. So I arrived there for my business trip with an open mind, but also with open eyes for any of the concerns of the reviewers. From the moment I arrived the staff treated me with the upmost courtesy. Julie at the front desk and Pat in the adminstrative office were tremendously helpful. They were always helpful in locating stores or restaurants. I was directed to The Oyster Pub across the street which is a great place to watch a game and eat dinner. My needs were always met with a smile and the assurance that if I needed anything else they would be there for me. The rooms are a little older and the bathroom slightly small, but they have obviously been upgraded recently with small kitchenette with refrigertor, microwave, sink and cabinets. The King bed was very comfortable and both rooms had a new 42-inch flat screen TV. I was upgraded to Oceanview for both trips and the porch with chairs and table made for a very enjoyable experience. The elevators were older, but we had no issues with them on either occassion. The resort has tremendous location. It is located right in the middle of the action of Daytona Beach There are great bars, restaurants and shops within walking distance. The pool area with bar and grill is right on the beach and provides a nice, clean environment to get away from it all.

The faucet fixtures where poorly wiped down or not cleaned at all. You could see that the bathroom faucet was wiped down with what looked like a dirty cloth because there were cloudy streaks on it. YUCK. You could also tell the towels where folded in a rush because two of them where on the ground when we walked in - they fell out of their \"design\". They have these \"clean remotes\" but the remote obviously was not cleaned because there was sticky goo on the front.

We stayed in 809 (studio) and it was exactly like the pictures on the hotel website. The bathrooms have pedestal sinks, yes, but there are glass shelves ubove the toliet to put your things on. There are frames (2 inches,maybe) around the sliding glass doors, yes, that make you take a step over it to get to the other side... but no big deal. The balcony had 2 chairs and a table, it was the perfect size and perfect view. The pool area was very nice, clean, they have a pool bar, but it wasnt open. I didnt get in the pool to check the temperature but it was super clean. There is a very nice restraunt and lounge in the hotel, there is a very nice convenience store in the hotel lobby, if they didnt have what I needed, Walgreens was directly across the street. You are able to easily walk to Main Street and the Boardwalk. I see alot of recent posts about the elevator, we had NO problems, but when Thursday rolled around , alot of people were checking in for the last weekend of Bike Week and it was really busy, the elevator stopped at every floor for people getting on and off.... I think the elevator issue was due to the number of people using it.... There was 24 hour security out front for the motorcycles parked there, those guys were wonderful too. When I got home I emailed the hotel because I had a question about a charge on my credit card (something I forgot about) and BOB the vice president called me back 15 minutes after I sent the email.

I was ok with the bike week! We book an oceanfront with balcony, king size room. Navigating to the hotel was kind of a pain- it is right on the main strip in Daytona, but the main \"loop\" entry was filled with bikes, and was clearly partitioned for only bike parking. This meant we needed to go directly to the parking garage. For us, we already passed that entrance trying to get to the main blocked off entrance. Wish there was more signage so we weren't circling A1A for 15 minutes in bike week traffic. Parked the car and went to check in. Check in is clearly stated as being 4pm and it was only 2. We figured worst case we could leave the car and chill on the beach until 4. However, they were more than happy to take us and we were checked in right away. We were offered either the 3rd or 6th floor...we chose 6. And soon enough, I would wish we had chose 3. I know I had read 2 complaints here- 1: the moths and 2: the amenity fee. Right on the check in desk they had a sign with a picture of the moth and a statement saying this time of year they can be bad, keep your balcony door closed at night to reduce the number of them. No biggy, I live in FL I can deal. The amenity fee was expected, and she still clearly read over what it covered and when it would be charged. So off to our room. Upon walking in, it appears really nice. The size is great, the layout is great, I love the balcony wish has a real oceanfront view, and my husband loves the 42 in TV. The \"kitchenette\" is a tiny microwave, small fridge and a counter with a coffee maker. Not that I expected to be cooking, but thought it would be bigger. Once in the room I start to look around and notice these black splotches all over. It looks like someone killed huge bugs, and it smeared. Now these spots were all over the ceiling, the walls, and the moulding. They were about 2-3 inches long and an inch wide. These spots along with the moth sign, made me think thats what they were. Not a huge deal, but when you are just sitting in the room you realize how gross it really is. The only other thing that bothered me in the room was that when I sat or slept in the bed, I could smell a musty/moldy smell. Made it hard to get comfortable. When I walked into the bathroom, I would get a quick whiff of a pee smell, but it would go away quick. Like maybe one corner hasn't been clean in a really, really long time. So those couple things really ate at me and it was really hard to just relax and be comfortable. Now- we unload and we decide to go out for a bit to shop. Here is where I lose it. Hop in the elevator...bike week...elevator is FULL. Going down 6 floors aaaaaand it stops. We are officially STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR. This is my worst fear come true. I hate elevators. I immediately start rifling through my purse to find my phone to call the hotel or something...I didn't really know what to do. Luckily it only lasted a couple of minutes and we shake, and drop a couple inches at a time until it comes to a rest and one of the other guests pulls the doors open. So from this point on, we take the stairs. Up 6 flights, down 6 flights.... It rained all weekend so we were not able to use the pool or any other amenities the hotel offered. We spent most of our time out on the town so I cannot comment on anything else really. We did order food in one night from a local place and it was delivered without silverware. I wanted to call the front desk to see if we could get some here, and realized there was no info in our room- no numbers to the desk, room service, anything like that. So we did hike the 6 stories and the restaurant employee was nice enough to hook me up with some silverware. Just wish they had better communication in the room. Also- on our second day the housekeeping never showed up until about 4:30 pm. At that point I just asked for some towels and extra coffee and skipped having them clean the room. Strange it was so late?

There was a small resort fee each night but we booked a special that came with a $25 Food and Beverage credit. Still a bit overpriced considering there were a lot of choices on the beach. Of course we did not know this before arriving. Reserved a partial ocean view room and was able to check in early. The room they gave us was on the 3rd floor and had an obstructed view and was noisy. Front desk changed our room to the 9th floor and it was much better. Room was nice and view of the ocean was awesome. The problem with this resort was the elevators. It was impossible to get back and forth from the beach or pool to your room in less than 20 minutes. One elevator was not operating and the other 3 were very small and SLOW! They were always crammed full because if you did not squeeze in you would have to stand there for another ten minutes waiting on the next one. Unfortunately this really took away from the whole experience because of the frustration. We spent one night and half of the next day before we just ask to check out. The Manager on Duty was gracious enough to refund us for the second night even though it was well past check-out time. We cut our trip short and drove back home to Panama City Beach. Location of the Resort is great and it has a really nice pool area with bar and grill. I have returned to Daytona Beach 2 times since this visit but have stayed elsewhere.

We decided not to ask for another room, because the one we had was for the most part clean and quiet. With that said, if we paid a rack room rate on this room, I would not be happy.

The sitting bench in the room was filthy, we threw a towel over it and used it as a suitcase table. Hotel staff was friendly and courteous. We had problems with the safe and the deadbolt on the door, both time staff came up immediately and fixed each issue. I would say the elevators are average. The lobby is nice. One thing we found a little concerning was security. All doors leading to/from the pool and garage have signs stating a room key is needed to enter the hotel between 5pm and 7am, but everytime we went trough them the doors were not locked no matter what time it was. We found the pool deck nice and we noticed staff cleaning the pool most mornings, but it seems they neglected the pool bottom. It was in need of a good vacuuming, lots of sand. The pool depth range from three feet to ten feet. The beach in front of the hotel was great. Lots of space so people are not on top of each other.

Got to the hotel and first impression from the street looked fine. Went to check in and the front desk clerk told me I had to wait 45 minutes so the priceline.com reservation would show up in their reservation system. I told the clerk that I just drove 4 hours and asked if she could check a different system to confirm my reservation- I use priceline.com almost 90% of the time and this is common for hotels to do. She told me that she did not have a way to do that and said that I would have to wait until the reservation would show up. I told her that I never had this issue before with waiting 45 minutes for a reservation and she really did not seem to care. I finally told her to check me into a room and when the reservation arrived she could link the priceline.com reservation to my room. I gave her my c/c and id. She put both on the counter with a room key envelope and did not say anything. I finally asked if that was a room key and she said yes and pointed to the elevators. I asked about where should I park and she pointed outside-this is now what I am beginning to read as the front desk is clueless when it comes to customer service. I received a call at 3:30AM in my room from the night auditor asking me about my reservation and why I had two reservations and which was correct. Sorry but this is unacceptable to call a guest at 3:3AM asking about anything unless its security related. The next morning I went to the front desk and asked to speak to the general manager and was told he would not be in until 1pm. I asked to speak to a manager that is responsible for the hotel that was on duty. The lady (very nice) said \"I guess I am the manager\". I asked of the whole hotel? She said yes-- this is amazing and now understand why the property looks like it does because it must have a relaxed style of management. The invoice I received under my door indicated that I was a no-show reservation for priceline.com. I questioned the invoice and resort fee to find out the resort fee covers parking, safety deposit box and work out room which was never disclosed to me when I checked in. She did credit the $15 and said that she would credit more but since I prepaid with priceline.com she could not do anything else for me. I did not go to the front desk asking for anything for free but she when she said that it seemed she really did not want to do anything but get rid of me because if she wanted to do something a little extra she would have picked up my $4.31 bill from the hotel store. The hotel store lady was very nice to talk with. Just got back yesterday so not sure if it hit my c/c or not. Seems the 14th floor is popular because room 1423 (I think that was the room I was in) appeared it has some major damaged and they found a day laborer to fix the repairs. The windows were do dirty we just closed the curtains. I understand, lived and traveled around oceans, gulfs and waterways so I know about how difficult it is to keep salt off windows and clean but this window was not cleaned for a very long (if ever) time. The pipes (or something) in the walls had a clanging sounds all night which was pretty hard to get to sleep and back to sleep after the 3:30AM phone call. My girls would not even swim the hotel pool because the water was dirty. I literally had to talk my wife and young daughters to stay in the room because of the perception of it not being cleaned. When I get back to Daytona, I think I may find the adjacent hotels a better option. The Ocean View or Hilton seemed very well taken care of.

Wonderful character being an old hotel, gorgeous architecture and inside designs, lots of old photos near the front desk. I booked an ocean front room and decided to \"go for it\" and pay the price for this type of room. I was sorely disappointed in the quality of the room and some of the features of the hotel itself. The view was stunning and we loved having the ocean breeze right into the room. The beds were very comfy and no complaints there. Wonderful flat screen TV (although we didn't use it at all). To begin with, the corners of the room had spider-webs and dirt; behind the dresser when I plugged in a phone charger were more spider-webs with dust on them. Obvious to me that it had not been cleaned in a while. The sliding doors onto the porch were so heavy and hard to open I had to ask my 20 yr old son to unlock and open/close each time I wanted to go onto the balcony. The balcony was very small (but there were 2 chairs and a small table). That was not a problem. BUT -- the chairs were dirty, the balcony overlooked part of the roof and there was a dirty, used child's diaper on the roof, various pieces of garbage, paper on the roof. The balcony itself needed to be scraped and painted because the railing had chips and flakes of paint coming off. The room had a counter with a small sink, microwave and refrigerator. Very nice! But, it was put in at the cost of bathroom space, which made the bathroom and the tub short and difficult to maneuver in. When in the bathroom and one opens the door, you are almost touching the tub and toilet to move out of the way of the door. The elevators were very small and very slow for the size of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was ridiculously expensive for cold cereal and muffins ($5, come on, it could have been included in the cost of the room). The wait staff in the breakfast buffet (we only ate there one morning, no other meals) were not attentive, we had to ask 3 times for coffee to be refilled, but when she brought the bill she wouldn't leave us alone trying to get us to pay and leave (there were lots of empty tables and no one waiting to be seated, breakfast had a couple of hours left for serving). The main areas of the hotel were clean and nice looking, we enjoyed looking at the history of the hotel! The front desk clerk was wonderful ( sorry, her name escapes me) and was able to print our boarding passes for us. Odd thing was this hotel did not have a business room with access to a basic printer. Had a computer kiosk in the lobby but no place to sit. Hotel had free Wi-Fi, which I expect from any hotel these days. The beach was wonderful and traffic - free. Very clean and well maintained all the way out from the retaining wall to the ocean. The pool area was very nice but the pool was dirty. True, it is right on the beach, but there was dirt in the bottom and the water was not clear and clean appearing. We used to live in Florida and understand the nature of the tourism business. However, for the cost of this room and the prime location in and on Daytona Beach, I was sorely disappointed. I expected much more in the quality of the room as well as cleanliness of the room. We will not stay there again and I have told multiple friends who are headed to Daytona to find another place in town.

We had stayed here last year and wanted to return to a familiar place. We checked in late, around 9:45pm and got our requested rooms, oceanfront high floor. I asked when the Walgreen's closed across the street and was told 10pm...I didn't even go up to the room, I made the dash alone to get some drinks, including a case of water and a twelve pack of beer. As I started up the driveway to the lobby one of the security guards on duty ran down to meet me to help me carry the load. He was so very nice, he even helped me get everything to our rooms. That was the start of the excellent service we received. We got to our rooms and the view was amazing, even better than last year. The room was perfect, no bugs, just a nice clean comfortable room. There is a bar area with a sink, small refrigerator and a coffee maker. There were plates, bowls and cups for four. They provide two coffee services, not sure if they replenish that as we brought our own. The next morning we had some trouble locking the door. I called down to the front desk and the maintenance man was there in less than five minutes. He quickly fixed the hinge and we were off to enjoy the day at the pool and beach. The pool looked inviting, the water was cool, around the same temperature as the ocean which was 72 when we were there. There were plenty of loungers and around a dozen tables with umbrellas. They do need to update the loungers, last year they were fine, this year they seemed a bit beaten up. I suppose being exposed to the sun and salt air takes its toll on anything outdoors. We didn't use the outdoor shower, only the bottom shower to wash the sand off our feet...that part worked with no issues. There is a snack bar with the usual pool fare, sandwiches and cocktails, we didn't order anything but it looked good and the prices seemed reasonable. Last year they had a grill going outside with hotdogs, this year the hotel was much quieter and I guess it wasn't worth it to start it up. There are also alot of food trucks on the beach for lunch. There are rental loungers on the beach, I think they are around $20-30 a day for two with an umbrella. We thought about buying a couple of cheap sand chairs at Walgreen's ($10ea) but decided not to because we enjoyed the pool and the option of getting under an umbrella when needed. I used spf 15, should have used a higher #. The beach directly in front of the hotel has a lifeguard which was nice as they are spaced pretty far apart. The Plaza is in a good location, there are a couple of pizza places across the street and you can get pizza, hoagies, gyros and some outstanding salads. We walked up to Hyde Park in the Hilton for a great dinner. They have an early bird special that is well worth it for a special night out. There are also some beach/surf type stores right across the street. At the hotel they have a little shop for all sorts of necessities, they even have some frozen Marie Calenders boxed food items. All in all a great time was had by all.

I stayed at the Plaza Resort and Spa with my wife and two kids for 17 (Seventeen) days. At first I was a little bit scared with some previous reviews and made reservation for much shorter time, so we extended our stay twice and didn't want to leave. We had an inner corner room 721 with cityview which is larger than an average room from my understanding. The room is basic, but had everything we needed: two queen size beds with pull-out sofa, one large LCD TV and one older TV, well equiped kitchen with oversized microwave and small whirlpool fridge. Since we prefer city lights instead of dark night ocean, we were absolutely fine with getting that room. I didn't experience any kind of negative attitude from hotel staff. I had several packages delivered to the hotel during my stay, so it was most of my communication with the staff. Anyway I found them pretty friendly and ready to serve. Elevators work fine at weekdays and have some delays on Friday and Saturday when hotel is packed. I talked to a manager and was told that Plaza has more than 300 rooms and only three elevators, so at busy times elevators issue is true. Lobby area and convention area are nice looking and smelled okay with me. There were couple of weddings during our stay and a lot of family reunions and business meetings. The beach is incredible - great sand, great ocean with great waves, and just perfect seabreeze. The hotel stretch of the beach is pedestrians only and less crowdy than Hilton part of the beach. We enjoyed spending time at our beach. Pool area is pretty nice and the pool is down to 10 ft deep which is rare. The biggest issue is lack of pool towels. Wifi worked okay, they have free computer in the lobby. Walgreens is just across the street. Volusia mall is an old one, but the have A&F and Hollister which is a good sign. Overall, Daytona Beach is a great vacation destination with several own landmarks and things to see and very close to St. Augustine and Orlando. And The Plaza Resort and Spa is a nice older oceanfront hotel with long history, greatly located close to Ocean Walk, Lagoon Aquapark, Boardwalk and Intl Speedway.

Conveniently located near restaurants and recreational areas as well as banks, grocery and convenience stores. Our room was an oceanfront queen room with two beds, bath and kitchen area. The room also boasted a 42\" (poss. bigger) flat screen television with basic cable programming and a balcony.

The children had an awesome time at the pool. Because it was so hot outside, we waited each day until almost sunset to do the beach and the pool. This hotel was wonderful to not have restrictions on when you can be in the pool. The kids had a ball in the pool every night, some nights until 11 or 11:30pm. Ample poolside seating, Ample beachfront seating with umbrellas provided daily. Upscale setting downstairs in the lobby and colonnades of the hotel. CONS: stepping onto the balcony, there is this annoying upstep that I hit my toe on a few times (a sign does warn you of this), a couple of moths came into our room with the balcony door open at night and lights on in the room, one large water beetle/roach thing ran in---these however are expected in that kind of setting, so the bugs really didn't bother me too much.

I was however able to get connected in the lobby, so i don't think it was my computer. Overall a great place to stay. Extremely happy with the tranquility of the view, the rooms and the noise level.

Before we left, I did look at the other reviews on Trip Advisor and became a bit worried. I did know about the $15 resort fee when we booked, so we were not surprised by that upon check in like the person in line in front of me was. The resort fee does cover your valet fee for your stay and we did get free breakfast each morning with our package that we booked. The free breakfast was the hotel's breakfast buffet which could best be described as edible food. There was hot and cold food available, we did enjoy the fresh fruit. We had paid a bit extra per night for an oceanfront room. We were given a 1st story room that was indeed oceanfront, but we had to look past the courtyard and pool to see the ocean in the distance. We were really looking forward to time spent on the balcony, but we had only a \"patio\" with one chair that was open to the pool/bar area. Not very private. The room was very clean and quite roomy. Nice large flat screen plasma t.v., also. We had no problem with our room, just it's location. We asked the front desk if we could move to a higher floor after the first night. We were told that they were full booked and there was no way. It was a Saturday, so we accepted it along with our free breakfast voucher. The location was great, we were able to walk to many places we wanted to go. The valet's were very friendly and polite. The next morning my husband asked the front desk if we could change rooms again, I thought he might have better luck... The lady told him that it was possible since many people were checking out and that we should check back after 2:00pm. We decided to go see a movie around 1:00, so we stopped by the front desk again to check on their progress. The same lady was there and she kindly told us that they didn't know yet, but she would make sure to keep us in mind and let the lady coming on to the next shift know what we wanted to do. When we returned around 4pm, we were told by the 2nd shift that \"No, that's not possible, we're booked.\" This is the same \"non-friendly\" person who checked us in and couldn't help us the previous day with our request. I politely told her that the lady from the morning shift had said that she would keep us in mind and that maybe she had saved us a room. She replied \" We've had some walk-in's, we're full.\" It's not like we wanted a different grade of room, just a different floor. Couldn't they have switched us with one of the walk-in's before they had walked in?! This could be a very beautiful hotel if it was better maintained. My husband is an achitecture buff, so we notice pretty much every detail. There were many small things that needed to be fixed. Over all, I might stay at this hotel again, but I would be sure to ask for a room not on the first floor or at least one not near the pool/bar because they leave the music and t.v.'s blaring all night long many nights. Each time the air conditioner turned off, you could hear the noise through the sliding glass door. I did finally call the front desk at 2am and ask them to please turn it off.....they did. The hotel's restaurant seemed a bit over priced given all the eateries around the hotel. We did have the free buffet breakfast with our package, but I would not have paid $10 a person for it.

Please note, we were hosted by my inlaws, so we did not pay for the room, etc. Here are my thoughts: Pros Room was quite large - we had a room with two queen beds, and we were able to fit in two pack and plays with no issue. One of the largest hotel rooms I've had in the US without it being a \"suite\" Room included a \"wet bar\" area with an empty fridge, coffee maker and microwave. It's my understanding that not all rooms included this. The pool area was clean Proximity to the beach was great and the beach area was clean, uncrowded and had no cars allowed There was wireless internet in the room Hotel is walking distance to a number of restaurants, bars and a movie complex The Cons The hotel was not the cleanest I have stayed in. There were ants in our room and on our balcony, and we found them in the bed as well. The balcony was literally not attached to the hotel wall - there was a gap of about 4 inches of missing concrete. Because of the kids' sleep schedule I spent some time out there reading, but held my breath most of the time. I would not have let my kids step foot on the balconies. The wireless internet was spotty at best. Ok for checking email, but not much else. The elevators are awful. There are not enough for the hotel; they stop and start on a whim, and pay little to no attention to what buttons are pushed/floors are requested. We rode up and down the entire hotel a number of times. The view of the ocean from your balcony is great; the view of the dirty rooftop that is also included is not. The staff at the front desk were awful and there was ALWAYS a line of at least 10 people. Parking costs a ridiculous amount of money. Overall, for a relatively inexpensive beach vacation, this isn't bad - there is a lot of space, a \"kitchen\" area that is great for keeping snacks and a nice beach and ocean just a few steps away. But do not, for a second, think that this is a resort or a 4 star hotel.

My wife and I traveled to Daytona for the NASCAR July race. After reviewing the other reviews, we decided to go in with the best possible attitude.

However, our room was clean and updated. This is an older property. Thus the bathroom is small. The a/c is loud - but not terrible. The hallways did have a slight musky smell to them but so do lots of properties on the beach. We found the front desk friendly and helpful. The lobby is very nice and the pool areas as well. The average room price at the resort during the July 4th weekend was $329. We would have been disappointed if we paid that price. However, we would NEVER pay that price at any resort. We booked through priceline and paid $125/night. The room had two queen beds and the view was not ocean view. Again, for us, that was okay. We never spend time looking out the window at the beach. Another thing to consider. Daytona is an older beach town. The whole town has an old feel to it. From what we saw, there was very little new development of resorts. We would not choose Daytona Beach for a vacation spot. 25-50 years ago this would have been a great vacation spot - but not now.

They were very visible and looked like they had been collecting for weeks. Something housekeeping should have def taken care of. The tub in the room had mold and mildew growing in the corners...also something a little bleach could take care of if attended to. When the person did come to vaccum, she had a very dated \"commercial\" vaccum that didn't seem to have any suction and still didn't clean very well, she had to go over places repeatedly to pick up the debris. Housekeeping didn't come until after 3 when my kids were napping so some days I just had to ask for clean towels. The hotel does not seem to have enough staff, especially around the pool area. One late morning I took the kids to the pool and sat my stuff at a table with an umbrella, using 2 chairs. There was what appeared to be a discarded soda can at the table and noone around it. Soon after I sat down a \"female\" came to the table and said I would have to get up that she was reserving it and had been all morning.

We had great service and an amazing couples massage there! Its like it was a totally separate entity from the hotel. NOW let me tell you about our experience at your hotel. We had booked our room ( a king bed oceanfront) several weeks in advance from the 28th of May through the 31st of May. It was Memorial Day weekend, I understand that, but for my boyfriend and I it was a special getaway to celebrate our anniversary. I called the front desk in the early afternoon (on the 28th) to let them know that we were driving from the other coast after we got off work and that we would not be able to check in til' after 10pm (We didn't want our room given away). The lady I talked to said it would be fine and that she would make note of that. When we arrived the lady at the check-in counter informed us that we were \"upgraded\" to a hospitality suite Room #537. When we went in the room we were sorely disappointed! This room smelt musty and damp. We were also really disappointed about the lack of privacy on the balcony and the fact that our room being located behind the pool & tucked away in the corner wasn't really our idea of an oceanfront room (by the way I would like to know what I needed to say when I booked the room besides \"oceanfront\" to actually get a room on the \"oceanfront\"). I called the front desk to see about changing rooms to the one I thought we had booked and we were informed that the hotel was full and this was not possible. We then decided it wasn't going to be the end of the world, so we started to unpack our things. Then we saw our second cockroach! The first one we saw upon immediately arriving in the room, and I had mentioned it to the front desk when I had called about changing rooms . The man I had talked to was stuffy and treated me like I was stupid. He said \"this is Florida\" and \"You can't keep them out this time of year.\" I was thinking \"I live in Florida!\" and \"Yes you can!\" I honestly felt like he didn't believe me. I felt like he thought I was making it up to get moved to another room. The third cockroach followed shortly and I called the front desk again and complained, and once again I was treated like I was stupid and like I was supposed to just deal with it! It took a third phone call of dismissal, and then I finally went down to the front desk myself. I respectfully and calmly gave him my grievances. He was still just as smug as he had been on the phone. I couldn't believe his attitude! I was being VERY nice considering the situation and I wasn't being taken seriously at all! He said he would send up the security guard on duty, because he handles all \"incidences\" at night. The security guard was the nicest man and he totally understood why we were upset with the conditions of the room. He said he would go down to the front desk and see what they could do for us. While he was away we saw ANOTHER cockroach! and then another one! there were even baby ones! We freaked out! How could such a beautiful highly rated hotel be this GROSS! and EXPECT US TO EXCEPT IT! We quickly packed our things! There was NO WAY we were going to sleep in that room. We also smashed two of the cockroaches (although they were still kicking) and put them in a clear bag to show the man at the front desk who was treating me like an idiot . The security guard returned within 10min. and we were all packed up and ready to go when he returned. He said they could move us, and reassured us that the other rooms in your hotel DID NOT have bugs like this one. He said a room like the one we originally thought we were paying for was not available, so we had a choice of two different types of rooms, both of which were inferior to want we had wanted and thought we purchased. We had to make the choice to spend our weekend sleeping in separate beds or looking at the street from the balcony. We went with the oceanfront room #433 and tried to share a small bed all weekend. Our new room was very clean and NOT musty smelling at all, there were no bugs and it was way more what we had expected from this hotel. We made the best of our stay and had no further issues til' Monday the 31st we had ordered room service for breakfast at 10:30. We had requested to pay for late checkout at 3pm. So we wanted to sleep til' around 10:15 or so and wake up and have breakfast at our leisure in our room. We received a call around 9:15 or so rudely awaking us, the lady on the other end of the phone said they had experienced a loss of power and that our room service would not be available that morning. She said that however that were offering a breakfast buffet for a small fee and that it included all of the items that we had requested. I was way too tired and just wanted to forget about it at that point. I told her no thank you and went back to sleep. It was about 10:10 and I was awakened with yet another phone call, the lady said that they could now provide us with the room service we requested. I said \"OK\". At 10:30 we got our breakfast. Absolutely everything was stone cold as if it had been sitting out. It was either soggy or hard. It was completely inedible. We couldn't even finish it, and we are NOT picky eaters. We paid $41 for that inedible breakfast. We paid for a 3 night stay at your hotel. We paid for late checkout (btw we had 3 knocks on our door by maid's asking if we were checking out late when we told the front desk we were at check in) We paid for parking every day. We spent money at your hotel's spa for massages. We were good customers to your establishment! We never yelled at anyone about these issues. We never caused a scene. We are laid back people. I have NO problem spending money on a vacation, but honestly after that weekend I felt like the Plaza Resort & Spa totally ripped me off! We definitely did NOT get what we paid for. It has been weeks and it still makes me so upset at how nobody cares about stuff like this. That weekend my boyfriend proposed to me and will soon be my husband. It was a very memorable weekend, but the memory is tainted by the difficulties and ill treatment at your hotel. I would NOT recommend this hotel to other people. It's beautiful, has an excellent beach front and great spa, but the customer service at this hotel is THE WORST I have ever experienced. Its like they didn't care if we were even there. That they would rather have us go away and not deal with us, and we didn't do ANYTHING wrong except choose your establishment for our special mini vacation. I have never vented like this about an experience at any place of hospitality before, but this one definitely merits it. I just want someone to make this right by me and my fiance. I just want someone to care. That's all I have to say. Trisha Ann Dickens/Adam C.

The beds seemed clean, pillows soft / comfy, we had microwave/ coffee maker , sink and fridge all worked. We had a balcony, the door handle to the balcony was disgusting caked on fingerprint/ dirt (i took a pic if anyone wants to view) there was dust and garbage/ under and behind dressers and beds. Elevetors were HORRIBLE. They would stop on every floor / whether anyone was there or not, doors would not close again for 30-40 seconds. Elevetors were very old and in need of repair, very scary to take them, but we were on the 11th floor with alot of stuff and a little girl. Water went out for several hours one day, Elevetors were completly broke on monday morning- it was our parties check-out day, which means everyone had lug all the luggage and disable people down stairs. Not fun. Power went out monday morning as well. There was a roach-not Palmetto (common in florida ) in our room on two seperate days (I have pictures) also there is a restraunt down stairs several of our party went to have breakfast at while hoping the elevators would be fixed - ( i did not go) but they all saw several roaches at the restraunt. There is no security at the hotel, in the cabana outside a couple was 99% close to having intercourse, very drunk, 1pm and u couldnt find anyone to ask them to cease the behaviour. Also there are security keys to enter the building, but the doors in the back/ basement and by the pool just dont close so anyone can walk in.

The disappointment first started when making a reservation , I called and had a gift certificate and as listed on the gift certificate \" No restriction apply \" however as the first agent took my info they told me the gift certificates were sold out for the weekend? After the first call the GM I received a follow up call by someone who did not leave their name, ( it was not the GM however ) before I returned their call I called on the Hotel one more time to talk to another shift, and try again with my reservation, it was accepted the second time. I\u2019m not sure who I spoke to, whether the first or second person or who was correct, I suppose the first reservation agent was incorrect. The second incident happened after we checked out. We left our camcorder and a small pocket book in the safe in our room, after being over 2 hours away we called and was told it would cost us to mail the items back to us. Again I work for a hotel chain and we never charge to return forgotten items back to the guest, its just good business, and when you do that for a guest you are assured a repeat customer. Not a fight I am willing to fight, I paid the $16.00 to mail the item back to me. Upon receiving the items back to us in the mail we noticed $200.00 cash ( 2- $100's) where missing, I again called on the general manager the second time and as of this e-mail we have not received a call back from the anyone at the hotel.

We had a room with 2 queen beds, large flat screen TV, safe, wet bar which was stocked with 2 glasses and 2 coffee cups, refrigerator, microwave, coffee service, and balcony with a view of the beach and Atlantic Ave. The beds and linens are high quality. They offer free internet. Parking is either $8.00 per day to self park or $12.00 a day valet. We opted to valet park and the service was fast and friendly. There is an on-site restaurant, room service, and Market Cafe with many food items. You can opt to order a Caesar Salad from room service for $12.00 plus $2.00 room service charge and 18% gratuity, or purchase the same Caesar Salad from the Market Cafe for $4.95. We had some of issues with the room. The closet doors were broken and difficult to slide open and closed. The balcony door did not lock, but had a pull down Charlie bar. I would put the bar down when leaving the room for the day to lock the balcony door. However, when I returned, housekeeping would always put the bar up, unlocking the door. The entry door to the room was difficult to close and had to be slammed shut. The bathroom was very small with little or no space to store personal items and it needed some grout work in the shower. Housekeeping was average, one day cleaning the coffee pot and one day not. But, the worst issue was when I found a roach running up the wall at the wet bar. I managed to kill it and leave it in the sink for housekeeping to see. I mention this since the room was $135.88 the first and last nights of our stay and $552.13 for five nights in between due to it being Race Week and the Daytona 500. All of the hotels jack up the price during the races. When I complained, I was compensated with $50.00 off the room for that night and complimentary breakfast for the remainder of our stay (3 days), although we could not order off the breakfast menu. We had our choice of the buffet, which was not always available, or a set menu. My last issue with the hotel is that on three or more days of our stay there were Girl Scouts selling cookies in the lobby. My husband and I buy GS cookies for us and the military troops from our granddaughter every year, so I wasn't interested in buying cookies. They practically badgered you and if you didn't buy, they were a little sarcastic. This should not happen in a hotel.

Unacceptable staff, really, if we're going to try to call it 4 or even 3 star, and what hotel doesn't have a freaking printer that a guest can use these days? --Dreadful, generic cheap motel coffee --Only one trash can for the whole room; it's in the bathroom The bad: --Very noisy. --Dirty windows and graffiti carved into the windowsill --Sneaky $2.00 \"safe fee\" tacked onto bill. I think this is worse than \"resort\" fees. This, however, is admittedly somewhat offset by the fact that high speed was free--that's rare at 3, 4, and 5 star properties. --Just one glass in the room and it was spotty.

Although much of Daytona is older and run down-this hotel looked nice..but the rooms however, were much older than pictured. I paid additional to have an oceanfront room-but the balcony was really really small. You could not even face your deck chair forward it was so narrow. My mom received a serious electrical shock when the metal balcony deck chair she was sitting in brushed the a/c unit -because it was not grounded. Because the balcony is so small-it was hard not to brush up against the unit. There is also a 4 inch metal lip that separates the room from the balcony-and it's easy to trip over. After check in-I called the spa and they only had one half hour appointment the following day, and I was told they were closing early. We were disappointed-as we wanted a girls day at the spa, but we decided to have a cocktail and dinner early instead. Disappointed again. We went downstairs and found that the lounge. poolside grill, tiki bar and restaurant were all completely closed--which was not posted anywhere-and I was not advised of that at check in.

I explained my mom had had surgery, and that I selected the property for all of their amenities-none which were available. He was extremely rude-and said it was slow-so they decided to close without warning. He then added if I \"really\" worked in a hotel-I should know that, and he made a snide comment to the front desk clerk next to him.My mom had had knee surgery--so those were amenities were very important in my selection of a hotel, however I did not even receive an apology.

They tell you at check in that you must display the parking tag to prevent your car from being towed. The parking deck has many signs stating that unauthorized vehicles will be towed. On our second night, we were not able to find a parking spot after dinner. We were told to park across the street. When we got to the hotel, we went around and counted no less than 11 cars and one motorcycle without parking tags. When we went to the front desk to complain, we were told, \"Those people are really brave.\" We never once saw a tow truck on the property over the long weekend that we stayed there. The Plaza has many, many more rooms than it does parking spaces, so to charge a fee for a parking space \"lotto\" without stating it as such upfront is almost stealing. Plus, allowing \"party\" attendees who were there attending functions at the hotel conference rooms to park in the hotel parking spaces and not requiring them to pay $8 is bad policy. They should park across the street. Additionally, there is a $2 per day charge to use the safe, but this is not divulged unless you ask. I cannot believe this hotel had a 4-star rating. The rooms are OK, but we heard several people at the pool complain about roaches. We only saw one in the hall in the basement. At check in, they assigned us to a \"city view\" room, despite the fact that I had contacted them ahead of time and requested an ocean view room. We were told that all ocean front rooms were sold out. Only after I came down from the room in person and stood in line behind several other disgruntled customers did the guest relations person tell me \"OK, I'll just give it to you.\" I had already paid for it! Of the 50 plus ocean front rooms, we only saw evidence of occcupancy in about 20 of them, if that. They have towels at the pool bar for use at the pool that you have to sign for, but there is just a bin for returns. We found out later, that if you don't sign when you return them, you are charged $2 per towel. The towel girl did not say anything about this when I got towels. There are two \"cabanas\" at the pool. We watched different people go and sit in the cabanas throughout the day and then get booted out by the pool towel girl. She told some of them that it could be reserved for $50 for the day. A simple sign stating these things would have been a lot more courteous to the customers. At check out, I was charged $2 per day for the safe (after I had just called on the phone to inquire about it). The safe was locked with a sign stating that you would be charged $25 if you left it locked when you checked out. I called down to make sure they knew that it was locked when I got there.

Upon arriving, we were amazed at how nice the hotel looked. We pulled up, checked in (once again with a somewhat cold employee), then pulled around to see the deteriorating parking deck. We carried our bag down a few stairs to the elevator (not wheelchair friendly). There are 3 elevators, all side by side, that work at their own pace for the 13 story hotel. We got to our room on the 6th floor which looked like it used to be really nice...in the 1970s. It did have a refridgerator, microwave, and an LCD TV, but the room smelled of mold. The closet doors were off the sliders. The bathroom light didn't work. We were missing a chair on our balcony. The \"oceanview\" room had a beautiful view of the disgusting, old parking lot, and a peripheral shot of the ocean. The balconies were very crowded and impersonal. Had someone stayed next to us on either side, we could easily shake their hand from our balcony. The sliding glass door which led to the balcony had a 4 inch high threshold that we had to step over (usually trip and stub our toes) to go outside. The bed was a large and rather comfortable king sized bed with nice pillows. The shower had the basic hotel semi-weak showerhead. The bath tub was long and narrow. There was a lack of counter space in the bathroom as there was only a stand alone sink, a toilet, and two 4x20 inch glass shelves. As for the breakfast...there is nothing I can say that could describe its awfulness. The servers wear ties and appear professional. In actuality, they aren't very friendly (if you haven't noticed this pattern about their employees yet). The \"free\" breakfast includes the All-American breakfast with eggs, bacon, and grits, or the buffet which consists of cereal, breads, bacon, grits, sausage, french toast, fruit, and milk. It does not include a drink. The french toast tastes like plain bread. Bacon is super greasy. Milk tastes very weird. It's an altogether disaster of a meal. No better way to start the day than with an upset stomach. The pool was nice with plenty of seating and a meal/bar area. The entertainment at the pool was rather boring and obtrusive. The walk through the three foot tall weeds to get to the beach was rather uncomfortable. The parking deck looks as though it may fall at any moment. It appeared to have enough parking spots until Saturday came around and we found ourselves parking a block up the street. Altogether, The Plaza puts up a fancy front, but has nothing to offer behind it. I'm sure it was cream of the crop back in the 1970s, but it has done little to improve since then. Shave $30 off of the price, offer friendlier service, or don't cover up what it really is, and I would recommend this hotel.

It was decent, but certainly not at a 4-star level. Initially we had some problems. The couch frame was broken and could not be used for sitting, but the staff traded out the couch with one that worked. The A/C was also blowing warm, but they quickly fixed it. We also had booked the one bedroom suite, but found there is no door to the bedroom, only a wide walkway, so it is basically one large L-shaped hotel room with no privacy between the bedroom and the living room. That was disappointing. Also, we only had two towels and one bar of soap between the two bathrooms. That, too, was quickly rectified. One bathroom was huge, the other only had room for one person at a time. The room had a large HD TV, but the picture was fuzzy. The A/C was very noisy, which didn't really bother me, because it blew very cold once fixed and set on 68, which is how I like my room for sleeping. The king bed was incredibly comfortable. Overall the room was clean, except for the shower in the big bathroom. The hotel was in a good location, and our view of the beach was really nice. There were some restaurants within walking distance, and other good ones within a short drive. The pool was nice, but unspectacular. The boys enjoyed the 10 ft. depth. The beach location is great, just blocks from the pier, and outside of the area where cars are allowed to drive. It was great for walking and riding skim boards and boogie boards. No shells to speak of. The parking was easy to use and access during the weeks nights. On the weekend we had difficulty finding a parking space, until someone left. The security was lax. The hotel can be accessed by anyone from the beach or the parking garage, and one lady told us their room was ransacked earlier in the day. The lobby is very nice, and the hotel restaurant was hit-or-miss. The lobster bisque and the grouper were very fishy and lousy, but the crab cakes were excellent. Go figure. The breakfast buffet has plenty of food, but is very average in taste. The breakfast pastries were cellophane-wrapped muffins, like at a 7-11. Overall, there are a lot worse places to stay in Daytona, as I have found from personal experience, but there are probably a few better ones, as well.

Very comfortable beds, I believe I feel asleep in 2-3 minutes. The next morning, breakfast at Magnolia's Cafe was excellent! The location of this Hotel is great! It's not very far from I-95 and it is walking distance to the Ocean Walk Shops, the Boardwalk and Pier. The first night we arrived, we had to walk about 1 block to find an open Restaurant for Dinner (we arrived after 9pm and the Hotel Restaurant was closed) I had no hesitation about walking around the immediate area at night. It seemed fine to me. The pool is fine but not heated. (At least not in April) One thing the Plaza Resort could use-a Hot Tub outside. I believe there is a sauna and whirlpool in the Ocean Waters Spa, but there is plenty of room outside to locate a hot tub. The staff is great, and I must recommend the Spa. My daughter had a pedicure and couldn't stop raving about the service-she even sent me a text message during her Spa treatment. In closing-I would not hesiate for a minute about going back.

With that in mind, here is a lengthy review. Since I travel several times a year for leisure and a few trips a year for business, I've stayed in everything from a Fairfield Inn to the Waldorf Astoria. For this trip, I was looking for a 4 star hotel because I was staying 5 nights and it was to be a relaxing vacation. The Plaza was one of the few 4+ star options in the area. While there I used all of the facilities including the spa, fitness center, pool, beach access and restaurants. By the way, it turns out the hotel does not allow anyone under the age of 25 to book a room. I found that advantageous! The Plaza just meets the 4 star rating. It is definitely better then a 3 star, but I've stayed in slightly better 4 stars. The only true negative I had was the noise level. I was fortunate to be staying at a quiet time, but in the middle of bike week or spring break I suspect ear plugs are necessary. The other reasons the hotel just meets a 4 star rating is the fitness center. It is small with older equipment with no treadmill or eliptical. However I was able to get in a decent 20 minute workout each day. The pool is large but plain. What makes it nice is the large deck area and easy access directly to beach. There is also an upper deck which I liked because it was a little more private. There is a bar/grill at the pool. Plenty of deck chairs/loungers too. The rooms are large and clean. I had a king sized bed that was fairly comfortable. I had a 'river view'. I am not one to 'pay extra' for an 'ocean view' unless it is Hawaii. Frankly, I spend enough time on the beach, I'm not concerned about 'viewing' it from my room. The room had a microwave and fridge which I always appreciate. As soon as I get in town I find a local supermarket and pickup water and soda and a few snacks. It helps keep the costs down a little. (by the way, there is a Krispy Kreme donut shop a short drive away!!!! I used the microwave to 'warm' them up each morning!!! ) There is a very large flat screen TV in the room but no DVD player in the room nor available from the hotel. I have seen negative reviews about the bathrooms. Mine was fine. It was obvious that the 'upgrades' the hotel made were in part to the bathrooms where they put up marble walls in the tub area and new tile on the floor. The tub itself is still a standard porcelen tub. But the bathroom was a good size, and I had two glass shelves to 'put my stuff'. I was alone though so perhaps if the man in your life is coming along and has alot of his own 'stuff' it gets a bit tough, but it was fine for me. I saw some negative comments about the slow elevators. I did not find them any slower then most hotels. The staff is very nice and helpful. During my stay they helped me 'online check in' with southwest airlines, found me a place to watch the NCAA March madness games, found my cell phone, and gave me directions to the local library and lighthouse. Each time they were friendly, responsive, and knowledgable. I ran into my room maid a couple of times and even she was friendly! There is a decent selection of snacks and items in the gift shop. Including some frozen dinners and such. The Spa is decent. Better then most but not an Elizabeth Arden Red Door level. I paid $10 for a day pass to try out the steam room and jacuzzi. Nice locker areas, nice shower areas, nice area for mani/pedis, and nice steam/jacuzzi area. All services are priced at 'resort' level pricing (those of you who travel alot to spa resorts will know what I mean) I also tried out a spa a few miles away so there are decent options locally at better prices. But it is nice to just jump on the elevator and head down to the spa. That brings me to the location of the hotel. For me it was ideal. If I had booked my flights right, I would have been able to take the \"Do\" shuttle from Orlando International Airport to Daytona and avoided the cost of the car rental. Within easy walking distance are a number of restauant options. I was not impressed with the pizza shop directly across the street. The pizza was not good. There is another pizza shop between the hotel and the Oyster Pub so try it first. I was able to catch the games at the Oyster Pub sports bar which is one block from the hotel. The food there was ok, but not impressive. However, the staff at the Oyster Pub was friendly and fun and the place had about 30 TVs. There is also a movie theatre about 4 blocks (very walkable). Within a few blocks there is a Burger King, Quiznos, Bubba Gump, IHOP, and a couple of italian places (low to mid cost). In the hotel, I ate at Magnolias and the food was good at almost reasonable prices. Also one block away is a dance club Razzles (owned by Oyster Pub). I never did find an internet cafe so I headed to the local library and checked my email there once or twice. There is a $5 per day fee to use the library's computers. You get 2 hours for $5 but can use that 2 hours anytime during that day. The hotel has internet access if you bring your computer. There is a Walgreens across the street which has just about everything you could need and you can do 'cash back' if you run low. Save yourself the ATM fees. The lighthouse is definitely worth the effort. It is a 10-15 minute drive down the coast and very nicely kept up. Drive south down A1A until you can't drive any further. You'll see the signs. There is also a quaint chocolate factory a couple miles away. Free tours and samples. I plan to return to the Plaza. Especially if I get another great price! (Can't beat priceline's $95 a night including tax). You won't go wrong staying at the Plaza.

It was always lovely and clean, everyone was very polite and helpful and we have very little we could complain about. Being late Sept it was a quieter time in Daytona beach and in the hotel so there was very little noise at anytime. The room was very large and spacious.

I agree with another reviewer that if you ware going to supply cooking facilities you should supply the basic utensils.

They did try to charge us for parking but as we had never been told about the charge prior to booking they happily cancelled the charge.

We stayed in Daytona for only 1 day for the beach experience before starting our Orlando condo rental stay at Windsor Hills. (Will write a review about that later). Based on what we saw of the Daytona Beach area, we would not choose it as a family vacation destination. Not very impressed with the Daytona Beach area. There are much nicer family destinations like in Myrtle Beach. GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE HOTEL: Location, 2 blocks from \"The Pier\" if that matters to some people, and easy to get to right at the end of the road one hotel to the left. If you went straight you'd be in the ocean:) Very large room. Very well decorated Very clean. Very large awesome plasma TV. 9th floor OceanFRONT room had a private balcony. Nice but small with a table and 2 chairs. Very nice lobby Fast efficient pleaseant check in experience (possibly because we were almost the only one's in the hotel:) Clean beach, non-driving area. Pool area had tons of lounge chairs and large pool. Kitchenette: sink, microwave, mini-fridge, granite counters and cabinets. TIP: kitchen only had coffee cups and glasses. Need to buy your own utensils if eating or cooking in. Priceline price for ocean front room was less than any of the other online prices for an ocean view room and I knew ahead of time that I was booking at The Plaza. No blind bidding. They did not charge us for parking because we came at a very low visitor time. We had no trouble parking in the attached garage, but I could see where it would be very troublesome during peak tourist season. BAD THINGS ABOUT THE HOTEL: Small bathroom. Not only that but it had a pedestal sink that made it even worse. Absolutely no counter space. At least a vanity of some sorts would allow you to put a toothbrush on it! Shower needed to have INSTRUCTIONS on how to operate it. Maybe it's just us, but we had to figure out how to make the water come out of the shower head. For those of you not familiar with this type of shower, from what I can remember you have to pull DOWN on the end of the part where the water comes into the bathtub (spicket) and that makes the water come out of the shower. Never saw that before, maybe some of you have. Very weird smell in the room. Not musty per se but just funky. Too bad for such a lovely room. Hubby had to go down several floors to get ice because the ice machine on our floor wasn't working and he said the other floors smell bad as well. I can understand all the hotels on the beach especially if they are old having a musty smell because of the humidity, but this was more than a musty smell. Maybe they should use a nice fresh smelling room deoderizer to as least give the guest a good first impression when they walk in the room. As others have said, air conditioner was very noisy. Even though the controls are on the wall for easy adjusting, the cool air comes from an a/c unit rather than through the duct work. Maybe it just me, but we've never encountered having to use your room key to get ice from an ice machine. Maybe some of you more seasoned travlelers have but it was news to us. Not a problem just a tip to bring your room key with you when you set off to get ice:) The pool was nice but had some algae on the sides. No hot tub:( No kiddy pool area or play things. (that I saw) The \"putting green\" area and basketball area was not well kept. They should tear that out all together and use it for something else or redo it. A large hot tub area would be nice and might as well throw in a tiki bar:) The shower to the beach area was in disrepair and not what you would expect from such a nice hotel. It looked like it belonged to a low budget hotel. The steps down to the beach and the area around the steps was not very nice either. Not well kept with trash and over growth of weeds. Again, not on par with such a nice hotel. Another bad thing is the inconsistency of the \"neighborhood\". Good hotels next to not so good hotels and so on. If you look at one of the othere reviewer's pictures you can see one of the not so good looking hotels roof top and balconies right next to the Plaza on the right as you face the ocean. TIP/TOE STUBBING/TRIPPING WARNING: There is a 3\" metal bar by the sliding glass door that goes out to the balcony that you have to step over to go out onto the balcony. So please be careful. Do not trip! Your drinks might go flying over the small balcony if you trip:) The area was basically deserted when we were there. So, if you like to have the hotel and beach almost all to yourself, September is a great time to go. But keep an eye on hurricanes since it is smack in the peak of hurricane season. (Which I just found out:). But we timed it perfectly and the weather for our whole Florida visit was perfect in Daytona Beach and Orlando. Hope this helps. Feel free to contact me to ask a question. Will post pictures later. The hotel website pictures are an accurate representation of the rooms. Don't let the bad things I've written scare you from staying here. The goods far outweigh the bads. The bads were merely annoyances and not prohibitives. Although I'm sure there are many better more expensive hotels in the area there are a lot worse if you've checked out any of the other reviews online. For the money, I WOULD stay here again.

Well, the negative reviews about The Plaza Resort and Spa were right on. First off, the hotel looks beautiful from the outside and from the lobby. However, when we got to our room, the floor had a musty smell and so did the room. There was ONE towel in the tiny bathroom that also had absolutely no counter space at all. Don't even think about having more than one person in the bathroom. Hubby couldn't take a shower while I was blow drying my hair because the room is so tiny. We have a 3 1/2 month old baby and a 14 year old. Our baby seemed sick on Friday night with post-nasal drip and a cough. Our 14 year old enjoyed the pool, but also felt the room was dirty. Now that we're home, my baby is perfectly fine. Maybe mold in the room? The air conditioner was loud and we could never maintain a comfortable temperature. We were on the 12th floor, and the noise from the motorcycles on A1A was HORRIBLE! Forget a good night's sleep. The beds were NOT comfortable and there were no extra pillows. I always book a hotel with a fitness center, but could not use the gym because the smell was so bad. Okay, that was the DISLIKES. There were a few things I liked. The pool was heated and they have tons of lounge chairs and tables. The tiki bar food was really good, though a bit pricey (which was expected). The location of the hotel is awesome. 1/2 mile from the boardwalk, close to different restaurants, etc. Beach access is great too. The customer service is also really good. The bell hops and front counter people are very friendly and helpful. Overall, this is an okay hotel....NOT a resort and spa type that's advertised. My family and I have traveled a lot and we normally pay for extended check out at every hotel we've stayed in.

He loves motorcycles and chooses to vacation in Daytona because it's a \"motorcycle friendly town\" and I love the beautiful beaches! So we get the best of both worlds. When we fly down from Ohio, my boyfriend, a huge motorcycle enthusisast, rents a motorcycle from Beach Street Harley Davdison, so we can hop around the Daytona/Flagler/Ormond/Port Orange area. After lots of internet research, we chose the Plaza Resort & Spa because of it's location, amenities and ability to offer us that well-rounded experience that we were looking to achieve. Not only is The Plaza steeped in history as it is Daytona's oldest and grandest hotel, the location is perfect for the both of us. It is close to Main Street where we can experience all of Daytona's famous biker bar watering holes durng the off season. In addition, the Plaza is within walking distance when we park the bike at night and enjoy the shops, outdoor concert and numerous restaurants like Bubba Gump's located at Ocean Walk. Walgreens is also across the street and a Dunkin Donuts was easily walkable from the Plaza for a morning stroll to get a good cup of coffee and bagel. The Plaza also has an inhouse store with an assortment of food and beach staples available for purchase. We requested an ocean front room on the 14th floor and got it. The view was breath-taking. Our room was large with a sitting area. The private balcony had table and chairs so we could fully enjoy that ocean front view when we were in the room. Our room was neat and clean. The king size bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. I will agree with other posts that report small bathrooms and lacked counter space to place toiletries or hair appliances--that is one area the hotel could improve. However, the bathroom space was my only complaint. As for me, the beach lover, the Plaza has beautiful two-tiered patios affording awesome views of the Atlantic ocean with lots of lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas and beach access was easy. The lobby is tastefully furnished, elegant and comfortable with beautiful views of the pool deck and beach from every angle. I never used the pool as I was always at the beach! The Plaza's portion of the beach was a no-vehicle access area which was a great plus not not having to deal with cars on the beach. The staff were also very accomodating and we were able to park our motorcycle in a safe, covered patio area which was easily accessible.

The well-appointed lobby certainly makes it seem that way. The rooms told a completely different story. Our first room was on the third floor and just like another reviewer said, the oceanfront view was laughable. The room was as dark as a cave and it was due to the one, very small windowed door that you had to stand on your tiptoes to see anything. The rooms are set up like Embassy suites with a small living room and an adjoining bedroom. The bedroom had no windows whatsoever, making it very dark. I found this to be strange in an oceanfront hotel. The window on the sliding door was covered in grimy fingerprints and the small balcony outside had about 4 inches of standing water with cigarette butts floating in it. The room wreaked of mildew. We immediately asked for a new room and they accommodated us with a 7th floor room. The view out of the little door was much better but the room was still dirty. The baseboards were filthy, the toilet had not been cleaned and there was a hole in the bathroom door that looked like a fist had gone through it. I immediately opened my laptop and went to my trusty Trip Advisor. Another reviewer had checked out and gone to the Shores. We called the Shores and thankfully, they had openings. The differences in the hotels were like night and day. The Shores service was incredible, the rooms were a dream and it made our stay in Daytona perfect. We were there for a family reunion and a large part of our family stayed at Perry's Edge. This too, was quite a nice hotel, very clean with an expansive yard and many pools. Both hotels were above and beyond The Plaza. To top it off, when we left, the elevator broke down for a few minutes while we were headed to our car in the parking garage. Another thing about the Plaza, there is no valet parking. While in the parking garage, a fight started between 2 women and a man. Even the guests seemed a bit on the rough side.

The front desk said they don't do that anymore and I told them my confirmation said they do, so they need to change it!! Then, the bellman was determined to help us with our luggage. I don't like other people touching my personal belongings like that just because of germs. After someone has touched 100 other pieces of luggage that day, I certainly don't want them touching mine. Then, one bellman didn't even want us using his luggage cart-but we used it anyway. I told him I would go back to the front desk because I was already advised we didn't have to use the bellman. Parking is absolutely terrible! The prior reviews I read about the parking were right on the money! You pay $8 a day for parking, but have to park a mile away! Terrible! Just terrible!!! When we finally got to our room, the air conditioner sounded like a freight train every time it kicked on. It was so bad, that we had to turn it off at night, just so we could sleep.

It was also a very, very, small bathroom. No counter space at all. We had to leave everything in our bag in a chair, because there wasn't even room on the bathroom floor. Then, we discovered you couldn't have coolers on the pool deck. Absolutely ridiculous! My daughter has a medical condition that requires her to have lots of water everyday, but even more in the summer time because of the heat. So, my husband had to constantly go back up to our room everytime to get her bottled water. I was furious! We ended up just going in from the pool. The front desk had no sympathy at all and I told them I would never stay there again. The reply was \"ok.\" I know they don't care because they will always have people to stay there.

We took our bags to the car and left some other stuff in the room to retrieve a few minutes later. In those few minutes the maid helped herself to the alcohol we had left in the fridge. She didn't take anything else or clean anything, she just took some beer. My husband had to track her down while cleaning another room and ask for it back. She didn't deny it and gave it back to him, but how bizarre. She knew we hadn't left yet since half our stuff was still in the room.

We spent the first few days in Miami, but stayed here Aug 21 \u2013 25 inclusive. After reading all the reviews we were a bit nervous about this part of our trip, but I think some people may have confused this with the other Plaza hotel in Daytona. Our stay was excellent and although we had one or two issues they were handled professionally and satisfactorily. Below is my review and while a little long (OK a lot long!), I\u2019ve tried to address all the pertinent areas I could think of. If you\u2019re like me I want to know as much as I can so I can make the determination about the appropriateness of the hotel myself. I hope this and the pictures help. Overall: I found the resort to be relaxed, comfortable and well run. It\u2019s not a five start resort, but it doesn\u2019t claim to be. I\u2019d put it at more of a four star, and it\u2019s comparable to some of the mid-level hotels on Miami Beach. The food in the pool side bar is reasonable when you compare it to the prices on the beach and the boardwalk nearby. Overall, I would stay there again and would recommend it to family and friends. Reservations: Despite finding a great rate on-line, I booked through the phone as I hate giving my credit card number out on-line. When she quoted a different rate than what I found on-line I questioned it. She asked me for the site, validated the rate and matched it while we talked. This is great as usually I\u2019m either forced to book it on-line to get that rate, or I\u2019m asked to book, submit the copy of the lower quote and wait for confirmation of the new rate. Only down side was the 7 days cancellation notice on the lower rate. Check-in: Check-in was quick, easy and we were advised of the location of the parking and amenities upfront. There is a large and comfortable seating area by the check-in where the others in your party (like impatient teens!) can wait while the details are being sorted out. Room: The rooms were neat, clean and well stocked. Each room had 2 comfortable queen size beds (with 4 pillows for each), a plasma flat screen TV facing the beds, a microwave, a mini fridge, adequate kitchen area (with all the cutlery and dishes --- even a mini bottle of dish soap and a full size dish drainer!) a table with 2 chairs, a dresser with 6 drawers (on which the TV stood), a decent size closet and the bathroom. I say rooms as we had one issue around noise and we ended up changing rooms after the first night (more on that later!). The maid service was great and we always had enough linens and toiletries for the four of us in the room without having to make an extra request. The only downside was the noise factor in the first room. Originally we were in a corner, on a lower-level and facing directly on to the main road. This was a problem as the traffic racing up the road at night is noisy (the hotel is right at an intersection) and the corners amplify the sounds. As the windows are single pane, even with the A/C on we could still hear it. So my only suggestion here is to book either ocean view or partial ocean view rooms and make sure you\u2019re higher up. However, the noise from the traffic was not the main reason we moved, but more on that below. Attentiveness: It seems the couple beside us was having some marital issues as they spent the whole night fighting and calling each other names. This was handled well by the hotel. Hotel staff came up, calmed things down and told the couple to quiet down or they would contact the police and have them removed. The staff also checked back to ensure it stayed quiet. My husband and I didn\u2019t comment on it that night as we didn\u2019t want to make a bad scene worse. However, in the morning, we went to the front desk about this and asked to be moved. The desk staff apologized for the disruption and not only moved us, but upgraded our room to a partial ocean view with balcony at no extra charge in an effort to make it up to us! Pool: The pool was clean, the temperature was good, the various depths are clearly posted and it didn\u2019t smell overly chemical like some pools can. There are lounge chairs all around the pool and around the pool area. We never had to fight (or rise extra early) for them. There are also patio sets around the pool and deck area so you can sit under an umbrella at a table and still be near the action. Kids activities are based off of one of these patio sets, so parents can see them while they relax around the pool. Other amenities: There is a gym, laundry and spa all on the same floor as the entrance to the pool/beach area. This was great as it allowed me to get a much needed load of washing done while I worked out, and dry it while I sat by the pool sipping my morning beverage and reading the morning newspaper (countdown timer clearly indicated minutes remaining for each so I could plan accordingly). It\u2019s $2 to wash and the same to dry. Individual soap and Bounce are available in the dispenser in the room, but they are $1 each, so bring your own if you\u2019re planning to do laundry. As well there is a basketball court near the pool area. You do have to get the ball from the front desk, but there is no cost to use it. The main floor has a \u201cmini\u201d store with limited deli style foods. These are over priced, but if you\u2019re looking for convenience cost isn\u2019t always a main considerations. If cost is a concern the Walgreen\u2019s around the corner has groceries as well and at a much cheaper rate, you just need to take the walk. Parking: There is covered and uncovered parking. We used both without issue. While there is an extra charge it\u2019s clearly outlined. It\u2019s self park which is great as you don\u2019t have to wait for (and tip!) a valet! Staff: The desk staff was very polite and helpful. I was never left to wait while they talked among themselves. If I approached with a request while they were talking they stopped, resolved my issue and then returned to their conversation. They were more attentive than some 5-star resorts I\u2019ve stayed at \u2026. Ritz-Carlton included! The pool guy is a love-em or hate-em kind of guy. I liked the twice daily reminders to turn over and endured the lotion sales pitch as it was short. However, he was funny and still treated you well even if you didn\u2019t buy anything.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGood Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "RIguy_7", "ReviewID": "UR8497114", "Content": "My wife and I overall had a very enjoyable experience at the Plaza Resort and Spa.

The balcony was a little narrow but the view was spectacular. The room itself was very nice and spacious. The mini fridge came in handy as did the microwave. The 42 inch TV was nice but did need to be repaired because it would randomly come on and go off without anyone touching the remote. It is noteworthy that we made the front desk aware of the problem and it was corrected immediately. Some of the reviews we read complained about the size of the bathroom and we agree if there is one drawback to the hotel it is the size of the bathrooms. The bathroom was very small in relationship to the overall size of the room, but was relatively new and very clean, which is no surprise since we returned to the room one afternoon while it was being cleaned and the woman who was cleaning the bathroom was on her hands and knees washing the floor! We found the staff to be very helpful and attentive. It should be noted that except for Friday and Saturday night the hotel was not very crowded. Parking was sufficient and subject to an extra charge which was made clear to us at time of registration. Our only true complaint about the resort was that the morning we were checking out we received our bill under our door. The bill contained a charge for use of the in room safe (approximately $2.00 per day). We did not use the safe and in reading some of the reviews noted that others who have stayed at the hotel were charged for it as well even though they did not use it. We brought it to the attention of the woman working at the front desk and it was immediately corrected. While we were waiting for our ride we overheard at two other guests complain to the front desk about the charge being on their bill even though they did not use the safe.

I just don't get some of the negative reviews here. Either they are confused about the hotel they stayed in (there is a similar-sounding hotel next door) or the rooms must differ wildly, because this is a beautiful, true 4-star, bordering 5-star hotel. The only negative part had nothing to do with the hotel itself- Orbitz never sent my information to the hotel, so when I got there, they had no idea who I was. After an hour (literally) of both the front desk staff and myself trying to explain to Orbitz what happened and how to fix it (none of the 219 people at Orbitz whom I spoke with had a clue, unfortunately), they finally faxed something to the hotel which still wasn't what they needed, but was good enough to prove I'd actually booked a room and that it was paid for. They checked me in and presumably hashed out the details with Orbitz later. I am very lucky that there was availability- otherwise I may have been out of luck. After talking to one of the bellhops I was told that I was the third person within 24 hours that he'd spoken with that had told him Orbitz had done this to them! What's going on, Orbitz?? The front desk staff was incredibly kind (kudos to Debi and Alexis) and helped me throughout the ordeal. They tried to upgrade my room as a consolation (even though none of this was their fault- they said it was the least they could do) but they didn't have an ocean front available, so I stayed in an ocean view, which is what I was supposed to have. The room was HUGE, complete with microwave, fridge big enough to fit a pizza box in, coffeemaker, all the normal other amenities, huge plasma screen TV, etc. etc.. The spa was lovely though I've had better massage services elsewhere (try the vitamin C facial though, it rocked). The pool was well-maintained and it was a very short walk to the beach (the 'rental' lounge chairs on the beach were a tad tacky though- $20 for 2 chairs and an umbrella for the day? But that isn't run by the hotel.) When it came time to check out at noon, I asked for my bag to be kept until closer to my flight in the evening- I was told I was welcome to stay in my room until it was time to go (there is normally a charge for this but it was one of the same women who helped me through the check-in nightmare and remembered me). Thanks Debi! Tip: If you book on Orbitz, call the hotel 48 hours ahead of time and make sure they know you're coming, otherwise you may have a problem! I would absolutely come here again and recommend this hotel to anyone.

No space for cosmetics. But, they did use the shelves for artful displays of towels and their spa products. We did try the Cafe off the lobby. The service was mediocre. The food was ok. All the patrons (all of three couples) were having a quiet dinner when a female employee began walking through making several loud comments shouting into the kitchen and then back to the hostess stand.

The rooms, the lobby, the Veranda lounge, the pool deck and the snack shop inside the lobby were all very nice and convenient. However, with the exception of only 2 individuals, the service that I received was absolutely the worst I have ever experienced. One evening, we went to the hotel restaurant, The Magnolia Cafe, for dinner at approximately 6:45pm. We placed our meal orders and after waiting for 45 min, our waiter arrived at our table to say that there was a problem and that the cook had not received our dinner order. After waiting another 45 minutes for our meal to be prepared, (with no offer to bring a plate of fries or appetizer for starving and impatient children) the waiter suggested that we take our order \"to go\". Funny that he recommended this at closing time. Since I didn't feel like the waiter apologized for the \"mix-up\" and that he had not attempted to make things better, I promptly called the restaurant manager and left her a message with the details of my experience the same evening. However, upon check out 2 days later, I indicated that I wanted to speak with the manager prior to paying my bill. The manager wasn't available until noon (check out is at 11am) and thus, her boss approached me at the front desk with his voice raised and asked me why on Earth was I \"just now saying that I had received bad service, 2 days after that fact!\" He yelled so loudly that all of the other patrons in the lobby stopped to stare. He continued to badger me and never once asked me for any of the details of the experience. He just continued to verbally attack me with his voiced raised and tried to make me feel like I was in the wrong. There is absolutely no excuse for how I was treated. I kept my cool and indicated that I preferred to resolve the issue with his restaurant manager when she arrived at noon. She was the only redeeming part of my experience. (The Veranda Loung bartender was very nice too) She apologized, and made every attempt to make things better. However, I don't think there is anything she could have done to erase how horribly I was treated by her boss. I will never stay here again. I have visited Daytona Beach 3 times in the past 5 years and I agree with other posts.

We had an oceanfront studio with a King-sized bed on a corner room. We awoke each morning to awesome views, with one balcony facing the ocean and one balcony facing down the beach (with a view of the famous Daytona Beach Bandshell). The bed, with its pillowtop mattress, was the most comfortable either of us had ever slept in, and we wanted to bring it back home. My husband loved the huge television, and I enjoyed the mini-kitchen. It was just the right size for us, with a good-sized fridge, a microwave, sink, coffee-maker, and lots of cabinet storage. We had a comfortable sofa and chair in the sitting area. The bathroom was small, as mentioned by other reviewers, but it was big enough. The pool area was gorgeous and immaculate, the water temperature was warm, and the staff members there were friendly. We appreciated that staff did not allow guests to \u201creserve\u201d beach chairs by placing towels on the chairs early in the morning. We\u2019ve run into this problem often at beach resorts. We had breakfast one morning in the interior restaurant. It was a bit slow, but good. The restaurant staff went the extra mile for us in creating a meal that was suitable for our Atkins diet, but not explicitly listed on the menu. The store was great! We were thrilled to find they sold medicines, snacks, paperbacks, beer, wine \u2013 just about anything a traveler might need. I went down once asking to purchase extra coffee and Splenda for the in-room coffee pot, and the young lady just GAVE me a handful of supplies. The hotel is in an excellent location, just across the street from a Walgreens and an I-HOP, with several other restaurants within a block or two. Within two blocks is the new OceanWalk Resort, along with all the restaurants and movie theaters that go along with that area (like Bubba Gump\u2019s Shrimp). We walked down the beach to that area and it was incredibly busy, so I was grateful for our quieter, more peaceful spot at the Plaza. As with any travel, we did have a couple of minor complaints. Upon arrival we were booked into the wrong type of room. Rather than an oceanfront suite, we were sent to a standard double with no view. But the front desk quickly righted the situation when I provided documentation of our long-standing reservation. I misunderstood the free Wireless Internet, thinking it was available in all the rooms rather than just in the lobby. There was a dataport in the room for high speed Internet, but there was a surcharge for this service. We appreciated the underground parking, but didn\u2019t see the need for a $7 per day surcharge for this. I\u2019d rather pay the $7 a day extra on the room and be told the parking was free! I never did find the hotel\u2019s jacuzzi \u2013 I suppose it was in the Day Spa area, but that looked closed at night. There was an elevator with a mind of its own, that one day refused to let us off on certain floors. But that was good for a laugh and was nothing serious. Overall, we were thrilled with our stay and would definitely return to the Plaza Resort and Spa. Because we have family in the area, we travel to Daytona regularly so we are familiar with area hotels and resorts.

The Plaza is located on the non-driving area of the beach about two blocks north of the boardwalk. It's an easy walk to the band shell and Oceawalk shops/restaurants whether you walk the beach or along Atlantic Ave. We booked the Plaza after we were unable to get a room at the Hilton which is right down the block and stayed Thursday through Monday. The hotel is on par with higher end national hotel chains. Lobby is spacious and clean. Room sizes are above average and have recently been remodled. The king bed was exceptional. 42\" plasma TV is a nice touch. Our suite included a full size fridge and full kitchen. All of the fixtures and appliances were top notch. Staff was courteous and responsive at all levels. This property can be had for a bargain for high-end accomodations right on the beach. Our rate for a suite averaged less than $150/night. Don't book over the phone though. After booking our first room over the phone, my wife found a better rate (20% less) on the hotel's web site. When we called to try to get this rate for the already-made reservation, we were told that the lower rate was only valid for internet reservations which meant we had to cancel one reservation and make a new one. Some things to be aware of: Drinks in the hotel bar and pool-side are expensive (even bu hotel bar standards). Use the buy-one-get-one coupon in the TravelHost magazine found in the room. One hidden gem at this hotel is the Veranda Lounge. It's hard to find (located off the lobby behind the lobby bar and down the hall), but offers the opportunity to sit in an Adirondack chair on the terrace and watch the waves roll in. Things we didn't like and can be improved upon: 1) The pool deck area was atrocious by the end of the day - littered with cups, cans, cig butts, paper french fry boats etc. It was frustrating to see a staff memeber dedicated to guarding the towel bin al day, but no one to walk the pool deck and pick up trash! 2) If you book a balcony room, bring an umbrella.....unless you're on the top floor. Water from the air conditioning units on the balconies above constantly leak and run down to the balconies below. Luckily, our corner suite had two balconies, becasue one of them was completely useless due to the constant running water raining down. Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel.

They did not believe that we called and canceled, it was their word against ours and they believed the employees. We were charged for 300$ of services that we did not receive!!! When I called the manager the next day he was very nice and said he would take care of it, but after 5 days of waiting he said that he looked into it and that we are wrong and will not be reimbursed. Do not go to this hotel or spa.

Nice kitchenette with fridge, sink, microwave, coffee maker, and stove. Front Desk service was fantastic, had a profesional young man dressed in a suit check me in... Very warm and friendly.

I have never been to such a disgusting hotel. Oh yeah the lobby and outside looks like a million dollar hotel but once you step into the hallways, the smell is horrible. I thought maybe its just because of the ocean. When we got into our room there was a dead bug on the floor, dirty carpet, couldnt go out on the patio, unflushed toilet, unmade bed, and the door to the room didnt lock. Went downstairs to change and lady at desk just handed me a key and kept talking on the phone. Moved us to a suite we though ok this is better. While the room was a lot bigger it still looked dirty with filthy carpets, old rusted microwave. Still not wanting to complain we said okay until our second night. My friend kept saying it looked like rat feces on the bed but we were convinced she was exaggerating and that it was lent, until the rat scurried across the room. I was appalled. Went down to front desk he said no manager was on duty and all he could do was move us to another room. So at 3 in the morning we're packing up and moving to another room with no help from the hotel. The next mornin I go talk to the front desk manager and she tells me she'll give me one nights stay off but thats the most we'll get because usually they only give half of one nights stay off. I was completely ticked to hear her talking as if she were really doing me a favor. But they werent about to get over on me so I contacted the general manager and we got our entire stay free.

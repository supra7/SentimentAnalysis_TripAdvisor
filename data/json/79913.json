It is a nice hotel in it's price range. The rooms are clean and decorated in western style. The staff was helpful and polite. The hotel is built on a hill and there are lots of plants everywhere. It feels like every room has its own courtyard under the sky. There are also lots of chairs and tables in those courtyards. The hotel also has a small pool and a hot tub. The main attractions around the hotel are: state historical park, heritage park, mormon battalion museum and lots of restaurants and shops. The only issue we ran into was that: on our last day we asked the hotel to call us a taxi to the airport. When we went down stairs to the lobby the driver quickly took our luggage out while I was checking out. My family also sat in the taxi. When I finally went out something did not feel right. I sat in the taxi and he started driving but did not start the meter. I asked him to do so. At this point he told me that this not a taxi and we need to pay a fixed rate in CASH. It was a difficult situation as this was 6 am and we were already on our way. I also blame myself because I got into the car, although there was no taxi sign on it. When we got to the airport I paid him what he asked for in cash. By the way this was almost double the amount I paid to taxi for getting to the hotel. We did not get the receipt either. When I got home, I called the hotel and the manager told me that they had called us a car service through a company they have agreement with. The manager I talked to was nice. he apologised and even got the receipt for me. My only concern is that the hotel should not make decisions on customer's behalf. If the customer asks for a cab, they should call a cab and not a car. Also, if there is nothing fishy then why the driver asked for cash. My initial impression was that this was an illegal taxi, but the manger insisted that it was a car service. What ever it was, I suggest guests to be careful and the hotel to remedy this situation by making it clear to the guests what is being offered.

It is within walking distance to historic Old Town. Of course, we throughly enjoyed the walk and the restaurants nearby. This hotel has tons of rooms; however only two have a view of the airport/ocean side. Unfortunately, these two rooms are the top of the hill and let me tell you...........It's a hike! The room itself was average but clean. Furniture was a bit dated. I would say somewhat early 80's. The amenities are nothing to write home about. If you care to know, the TV was not the flat screen type,which in this day and age, it is the standard in hotel rooms. Another odd thing was that we were able to hear some noise from the room above. Not enough to keep us awake at night, but enough to notice the shallow separation between floors. The parking was rather tricky because the hotel offers parking for a fee, but they neglect to let you know that there is public parking accross the street from the lobby and also on the street bordering the east side of the hotel. We opted to park on the street since we had prior knowledge of this fact. However, beaware that parking on the street and in the public lot accross the front of the hotel can be hard to find. This is because Old Town is a tourist attraction and there are many visitiors especially on weekends. This inconvenience happens during the day only. At night, you should have no trouble parking on the street. The staff at the hotel was nice and courteous. There were no issues there. Oh by the way, do try their complimentary ice water with cucumber slices. I thought it was different to garnish water with cucumbers instead of lemons.

I saw it build up a booming tourist, business, convention and government contractor business. They had a lot of repeat guests. I was one of them. But ever so slowly, the property has entered a sliding decline. It is no longer the beautiful, garden-like place it once was. In 2011, they fired the expert groundskeeping manager and his staff and contracted the outside plants and cleaning to a contractor. This appears to have been done to cut salaries and benefits and prop up the bottom line. The hotel's appearance suffers as a result. Housekeeping staff has shrunk as well and on my last two stays I did not see even one of the housekeeping managers I had grown to know. The people who were there were pushed to the limit, sometimes not finishing with rooms until dark. The restaurant is owned by another company which is in bankruptcy with its assets being formally sold off on January 26, 2012. It too has declined. They don't even have cocktail napkins now and food quality makes me yearn for Taco Bell. The hotel attempts to prop up the restaurant financially by giving just about any guest free food. The breakfast buffet was so horrid that it wasn't even an option for free. Scrambled eggs were brown. Sausages were greasy and potatoes were wrinkled and looked days old. This hotel is facing a perfect storm of declining revenues, occupancy and a restaurant which may soon close unless it is purchased and kept open. Travel sites show rooms being sold for as low as $79 per night, so don't pay rack rate. On my last stay, I also found another area where cuts had been made: Security. My car was broken into in the garage. Another guest told me that this had happened three times to his knowledge in the past year and that it is a known problem. The hotel had no surveillance in place, just a security \"guard\" who was found asleep on the job just days after my vehicle was broken into. There was a time when I would see security people actively roaming the hotel all hours of the night. It occurs to me this ended about October of 2011. Senior management fought me off with a line of BS about how great their security is and how they could \"track their guard with GPS\", apparently unaware that GPS won't work three levels deep in a concrete and steel parking garage. The GM even said that \"Those signs are the limit of our liability\" and referred to it as something \"beyond (their) control\". Sorry. When you know you have a problem and do nothing, you are part of the problem. I sent a letter and a bill by courier to the GM who ignored it until, to their credit, the hotel's corporate office got their copy and became involved. They paid for the damages and I was comped one (1) night of my stay and I am grateful for that but not for the lies and attempted glad-handing and just utter made-up stories and admission that they covered up the damage (literally) so as not to alarm other guests. The GM even had another employee contact me to demand my first review here be taken down. I did ask TripAdvisor to do just that. It was a bit harsh. Time has given me a better perspective. The hotel is under pressure to deliver occupancy and revenue figures to the owner and they're cutting staff, services, cleaning and maintenance to prop up the bottom line as they give away rooms on the Internet. Attempting to brush off a 12-year veteran guest personally known to everyone on staff there was just offensive to me.

So, this time out to San Diego we decided to give it a try. I wasn't sure about staying \"inland\", as we go out there to be near the ocean, but this place convinced us otherwise. First of all, it's a huge place. There are many separate buildings spread across the hillside above Old Town San Diego. We happened to get a nice room on the 2nd Floor of one building, which looked out over Old Town towards distant Point Loma. We were very pleased. The room was large, with two Queen beds, a refrigerator and small microwave. It was quiet, clean and well-kept. As I said, the location is great and there is so much going on in Old Town, we just spent a whole day bumming around, having some margaritas, etc... As I walked across the \"campus\" towards the swimming pool, I realized that there are rooms that don't look out onto anything (they actually face the hillside), but you would just have to be conscious of that (I'm sure some people wouldn't care anyway). The grounds were well kept, the buildings were clean and we had a great stay...except for really mediocre customer service from the front desk. That was really the only thing that I wasn't too pleased with. It's not that the front desk staff (several of them) were RUDE, per se, they just weren't too focused on customer service. I call these types of people \"overly efficient\"; they do their job but don't put any \"love\" into it, if you know what I mean. They make you feel like you're burdening them by asking for anything. I went down for some extra towels, and the clerk gave an obvious *sigh*, reluctantly opened the cabinet behind her to reveal a pile of towels, none of which were in any sort of order, and no bath towels. So, I had to trudge back up 3 flights of stairs to wait on a maid to deliver them - Which she did, promptly, I might add. No concerns with housekeeping, they did a great job. It just seems that the front desk staff is the major customer service problem, nobody else that I ran across acted like that. The last thing I might mention is that it's not cheap to stay there. For a Best Western, it's pretty pricey, so if you have AAA, AARP or another discount method, use it. The parking is $12 per day (!), but it's in Old Town and parking is at a premium, especially weekends.

We had a room in the 800 building, which was easy to find and a great location. From the balcony outside the room, we watched the Sea World fireworks which was a neat bonus. The room was really spacious and very comfortable. The beds (2 queens) were new and the linens and pillows were very comfy. There were only 2 of us, but the room would easily accommodate a family of 4 (or 4 close friends). The bathroom was spacious and everything worked perfectly. The only odd thing was the mirrored door inside the bathroom directly across from the toilet. You had to watch yourself pee, which was weird. We enjoyed the microwave and refrigerator in the room, including the free bottled water daily. A nice perk, even though we were assessed a $5 charge (for tourism or something) to cover the cost. The hotel is directly across from San Diego State Park, which is where the historic buildings of Old Town are, and just beyond is the train/trolley station, so it's super easy to use public transportation. Plus, it's just a nice spot to wander around and spend the day. Parking is $12/day and the lots fill up fast, so take a tip from others and find street parking for free. One note about the surrounding neighborhood: almost all of the restaurants/bars close at 10pm, even on Saturdays. So eat dinner early. The Old Town Mexican Cafe was open until 11pm, so we were able to get a late meal, but if we'd missed it, we would have had to drive out of the area for food of any kind.

I also really loved the pick up service at the airport. That was so helpful. I was at the hotel for a wedding and had two seperate reservations for two days each with a night in between where I stayed elsewhere. But a few problems to note, 1. Our room was not ready in time for check in. It took a few hours to find us a room. However when we did get the room it was beautiful so there is that. 2. We had to cancel one night of our second reservation. I understand that you have a 48 hour policy but it was not posted anywhere. I notified the hotel within 24 hours and they rebooked the room with another guest but still I was charged the full amount of the stay. I felt that this was slightly unethical since the hotel recouped the money twice. 3. While most of the staff that I dealt with was very friendly even when I was voicing a complaint about the above two issues. When I did check in the second time at night (around 12:30 am) there was a staff member who had a bit of an attitude which was a bit surprising because I was not voicing a complaint, just checking in. She might have just been having a bad day because she was also short with the gentleman who was ahead of us in line. But then when it was our turn next she barked at us asking whether we were guests at the hotel. Then she seemed a bit nicer when we told her we were checking in but then when we asked for a wake up call and cab in the morning this was just too much for her and she was aggrevated again. 4. my bill was incorrect the first time i checked out but it was fixed immediately as soon as I pointed it out. 5. while the breakfast far exceeded my expectations in that it was really delicious, the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. But the service was awful. We must have waited 20 minutes for a waiter to take our order and then almost 40 minutes for it to show up. I had to go to the kitchen myself to get a drink. 6. wifi did not work at all in the hotel room or lobby but the computers in the lobby were great and loved the printer for my boarding pass. 7. I did not appreciate the $5 a day resort fee which was basically for two bottles of water that were not replenished every day.

The hotel is barely a block from Old Town and across the street from Heritage Park. Check-in was a breeze and because the property is so large, a map was provided. We found our room without problem. The lobby is inviting with plenty of places to sit, indoors or out. You can park in the garage ($12 a night) or on the street, or in a public parking lot across the street. The parking garage is narrow and difficult to maneuver if you have a large vehicle so you might want to walk the garage before you commit to paying for parking. Our room (top floor of the 500 bldg.) was neat and clean when we arrived and housekeeping kept it that way the entire time we were there. The room had comfortable beds, lots of top of the line sheets and comforters, and big bath towels. It had a coffee pot, mini-fridge and microwave, too. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a courtyard in the middle of the complex with lots of tables and chairs so you can sit outside and relax. The landscaping is well kept and, in keeping with the stucco walls and red tile roof, there were murals on several of the walls. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pristine, elegant, and very comfortable place to stay. The only down-side is that no breakfast is served at the hotel. We got vouchers for breakfast at O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hungry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Old Town but it was such a greasy spoon kind of place that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go back!! Old Town San Diego has a collection of Mexican restaurants. We tried Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Coyote, Old Town Mexican Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serves the freshest, most authentic food. The wait staff is very attentive, and the prices are very reasonable. I think Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the best on the block and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just down the steps from the center of the hotel courtyard. Breakfast can be difficult to find in Old Town if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not into huevos rancheros or greasy spoon establishments. We discovered a tiny little place on San Diego Ave (Old Town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main street) called Old Town Gourmet Caf\u00c3\u00a9. It has amazing coffee (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Seattle and I need my espresso!) and serves freshly baked croissants, lox and bagels, and pastries of all kinds. It also serves soups and sandwiches at lunch time and fresh fruit smoothies any time of the day. This gem of a caf\u00c3\u00a9 is across the street from Miguel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, on San Diego Ave between Arista St. and Linwood St. We used public transportation to tour San Diego. The transit station is about two blocks from the hotel. If you buy an all-day pass for the tram, you can use it on the bus, as well. We used the tram to get to Embarcadero, Sea Port Village, Horton Plaza and other downtown attractions. You can take a ferry or a bus to Coronado Island (eat at Lil Piggy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their pulled pork sandwiches are awesome!) The shops at the ferry dock are fun to explore and you can sunbathe on the beach near the ferry dock and swim to your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content. We also took the bus to Balboa Park (allow 4 or more hours to do Balboa Park justice). A free tram within Balboa Park will take you to the zoo (allow 4-6 hours to enjoy the zoo). The Hacienda Hotel is the perfect location if you want to tour Old Town and then hop on a tram or bus to visit nearby attractions.

Now it's a 'resort' charge...which I think they may tell you about now if you order online - but when they charged me for it, it turns out the pools were shut down...so I asked them to credit the $5, since the spa was the primary reason we came to this location and they didn't disclose it was closed when we reserved. Front desk guy told me to come back later he'd discuss with someone else. Later discussion went on for a while and they tried to convince me the resort fee was for all the amazing features of the facility besides the pool. Whatever - this is no resort, don't kid yourself. Most any other facility that have shut down their pool for maintenance would have no problem crediting $5 - but not these guys. Add to that on arrival the front desk sent me on a wild goose chase throughout their multi-level parking structure to the room - such poor directions I had to go back and ask for better info - and even then he couldn't be bothered to draw more than a big round circle on the map.

I travel a lot for work, and often I stay at Best Western properties. They vary in quality from excellent to awful. This hotel is much closer to excellent. I can't say enough about the location. You walk down the hill from the hotel and you are in the heart of Old Town San Diego, which has tons of restaurants, shopping, bars, and tourist friendly establishments. If you are visiting other parts of San Diego, you'll need a car which you can park in their garage for $12 per day. If you are just staying in Old Town, you won't need a car because everything is within walking distance. Several reviewers have commented about being forced to find parking on the street but this was not the case for me. My company specifically requested that parking and breakfast be included in my charges and there were ample parking spots in the hotel garage. I had never stayed in an establishment quite like this one. It was clearly designed for tourists in mind (consider where it was located). As a business traveller, there are a few things I look for in a hotel--internet service, breakfast, iron & ironing board, etc. The hotel had wife-hotspots in the courtyard, but it seems that almost every room faced the courtyard so I always got a pretty good signal. Breakfast was served at O'Hungry's around the corner. While it would've been nice to have breakfast served in the hotel itself, I'm sure if someone were on vacation this would not be a major imposition. The room was nice and comfortable. The bed was soft and I slept well every night. The only two issues I had were the loud and unruly people staying at the hotel and the tiny little bathroom shower and sink. First of all, I understand that it is primarily a tourist hotel. However, even at a tourist hotel they should be required to keep the noise level to a minimum after midnight. At least two nights while I was there, I had trouble sleeping due to the loud conversations taking place in the courtyard outside my room. Second, it may be a result of asking for a single room but the bathroom sink and shower area were extremely small. I'm not a large man, but I was constantly bumping into the sides of the shower each morning. Overall, I was very impressed. While the hotel is more conducive to pleasure than business, I'd definitely return to this property when I return to the area.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hollywood, California", "Title": "\u201cLovely Courtyards\u201d", "Author": "JBalzli", "ReviewID": "UR80234755", "Content": "This is a great hotel complex on a hillside with lovely courtyards and fountains.

The hotel restaurant lacks prompt service. But, luckily there are plenty of higher quality restaurants nearby in Old Town. I was pleased to see recycling bins in the rooms. However, their shower product bottles were not recyclable, indicating a serious lack of basic corporate environmental responsibility.

I felt bad for him that this was a less than pleasant experience at this hotel, as he did his best to make sure we had a fun time in a relaxed and beautiful location. I wish I could write a good review for this hotel, but I cannot. The room was ok at best, however, their customer service leaves a LOT to be desired. We were 'assisted' by what I assume was a manager type, given her choice of dress, when we checked in. Her name if I remember correctly was Jennifer. When my husband and I checked in to the hotel, we were informed by Miss Jennifer that there would be a 12 dollar PER DAY fee to park as a GUEST in the hotel. When we inquired as to why, she snapped out, 'Policy. You can always park out in the street or down the road'. Ever have someone in customer service that, while they never raise their voice once, are never outright rude, or get otherwise nasty with you, however when you speak with them, you can hear the unsaid, \"And if you don't like it, you can go eff yourself!\" tone of voice? That was Miss Jennifer's whole demeanor. There were NO apologies, no offers for us to speak to an actual manager about the issue, nothing. Other reviews are correct in saying that there is a sandwich board out front advertising parking for $5.00, however, the time frame is 0-4 hours. So basically, this hotel is having both non guests and guests pay for what limited parking this establishment has. I don't have an issue with them making a dime off of folks who just want to walk around Old Town for a while and not stay there, but to charge guests for parking is unconscionable. To make matters worse, there was a sign by the telephone that said that while local calls were free, anything over 30 minutes would get charged 10 cents a minute. WTH? Seriously?! Then add insult to injury, there was also another sign in the bathroom with the off brand soap and shampoo that stated if any towels or things were removed from the bathroom, your credit card would be duly charged. I was quite frankly afraid to touch anything or even use the in room coffee maker, as I was afraid there would be more charges appearing on our bill. I don't have an issue with charging for towels, as replacing them all the time can be expensive for a business. However, I have stayed in far better accommodations where such items were not only GIVEN to you, but they gave you brand new ones, beautifully packaged and wrapped up for you. The linen here is mediocre at best, so why anyone would want to swipe these is beyond me. All in all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for any reason.

You could decline the parking fee but would have to search for parking in adjacent locations but depending on when you park your vehicle this can be quite a task. At check-in we were also advised of an add-on fee of $5.00 to offset the cost of coffee (previously complementary) and two small bottles of water. This fee was not negotiable. Curiously, the Hacienda offered parking to non-guests for $5.00. I am not sure if the fee was for just daily parking and not overnight parking. Prior notice of these fees would be the ethical thing to do. I was not happy with the imposed fees so I ended our three day reservation after one day after making reservations elsewhere where there were no unadvertised add-on fees.

For those who don't know- Old Town is the end stop of the trolley/MTS system that will take you to the Qualcomm Stadium for $5 round trip PP. Going in we knew (thanks to Tripadvisor) taht the hotel could have issues. We have been to Old Town many times and always thought the location was ideal so we finally took the plunge. We showed up to hotel at 9am and just told them we we here. They said room 700 was ready (wow!) and we checked in, parked up and unloaded before going to Mission Beach. Room 700 is a king mini suite and cost $150 a night (steep) but again, location. Being able to walk to hotel after eating/drinking/dancing is a big plus. Went in to room 700 and were immediately hit by the heat. Wow, must have been 85 in the room and a/c isn't running. When will the hotels learn to leave a/c on if someone is checking in that day??? Oh well, we are thrilled to have early check in and change for beach in hotel room instead of bathroom. We set a/c to high-cold, unpack and go on our way. We return 6 hours later and room is still hot-maybe even hotter. Room 700 gets full sun all day long. I felt the a/c(old fashioned floor type beneath window) and it was blowing warm air. I went to desk and spoke about this with Brittany who seemed puzzled by the whole situation. She offered me a room next door (full sun as they are all in a row) and I said I would rather have a room away from the sun because the a/c isn't up to cooling the room. Hey, this is a $150 room-I want the a/c to work. She stated this was the first time anyone had complained about the room being hot. At that point (perfect timing) there was a couple next to us complaining their a/c didn't work and the room was too hot. They were far more vocal about it than me. At that point she said, \"What do you expect me to do?\" I said I wanted room out of the sun with a/c that worked, otherwise we couldn't occupy the room. She got a guy to show me another room which was the same as 700 just higher up. I said this one was just as hot. We turned on a/c unit (same as room 700) and it too blew hot air. He just looked at me and smiled, called back and asked what else he could show me. He was told to try 817. We went there and on the way he explained that 817 was a new building with better a/c and completely out of the sun. He said he had helped a couple move there bags out of one of the 800 rooms that morning and the room was ice cold. I said sounds great! So we hike/elevator over. Room is great. Test a/c and it blows cold air. I said wonderful we will take it. He brings us back to lobby-issues us new keys and offers to help move us. I said thanks but we will do it and tipped him $20 for hiking me around for 15 minutes in high heat/humidity. Wife and I moved and she was very happy with new place. Pretty much the same except a little larger with 2 queens. This is where things go very wrong. Later that night at 1130pm, after a nice night of a Chargers game, mexican food in Old Town and a great cigar/pint at Churchill's, we were woken by someone opening the door to our room-looking at us- and closing the door. ?????What the heck???? Couldn't see much as the person was backlit from hallway light. We were in deep sleep and I was wondering if I imagined it. No knock no ooops sorry no nothing. Wife asked did I forget to close the door and I said, well I'm pretty sure I closed it. I got up and looked out and there were some young guys walking the hallway looked pretty lit. I closed the door and put the chain on and eventually went to sleep assuming I didn't close the door and another guest tried the wrong room door. Seven am rolls around and a heavy knock wakes us up. I get up and look through peephole-it's a guy in a suit. I open the door with the chain in place and ask what's going on??? Guy has a heavy spanish accent and me being half asleep have trouble understanding him through the crack in the door. Eventually I understand him to be telling me that no one is supposed to be in this room and he's asking me who I am. I explained we were moved yesterday from room 700. He states again I am not registered as being in this room and asks my name. I tell him and he says again no one is registered and insists that no one has been in this room in 5 days. I get tired of this and tell him go talk to the front desk we are the ****** from room 700 and shut/lock the door and put a chair under handle. I then try to lay down and sleep in our nice cool room but the wife is upset and it dawns on me that this had something to do with the intruder last night. I called the front desk and spoke with Monica and ask what's going on and told her about the intruder last night and the guy in the suit this morning. She was very helpful and explained that when they gave me the new keys last night the person had forgotten to register us in the room. The hotel manager and security (I only saw one guy) had gone to 817 to find out why room keys had been issued when no one was registered and found us in there. I asked why didn't they call or say something or call afterward or anything??? They entered without knocking, saw us in bed and left. She didn't know what to say (she was in a tough spot ) and I then asked her about the guy at 7am knocking and why didn't they call etc. She said they didn't want to disturb us. She realized how odd that sounded then offered to take the self parking ($12) off the bill. I thanked her for the offer but told her $12 was far short of compensating us for entering our room at nearly midnight then waking us up again at 7am. This is all very civil and professional-no being upset on either end. Monica said she would speak to the manager and put me on hold. She came back and asked if $50 off the bill (and free parking) with a sincere apology sounded fair. I accepted and went about my day in Old Town until uneventful check-out.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant hotel in a nice location\u201d", "Author": "fhughes47", "ReviewID": "UR37230543", "Content": "The hotel is attractive in traditional Spanish style.

I put in a request when I first reserved our room for a certain room that my folks and I used to stay in. I was told there was no guarantees that I'd get that room (which was fine) but they'd be as accommodating as they could to give me a similar room. When my boyfriend and I went to check in the woman staff member that helped us was already unfriendly. She didn't seem like she knew what she was doing. She assigned us a room without looking at the special request I put in and when I mentioned my request she then stated that \"someone, not her accidentally gave that room away that day.\" If she simply said that room wasn't available I'd be fine, but \"accidentally\" gave it away doesn't sound right to me. I then asked if I could get a similar room to what I originally requested and so she booked my boyfriend and me into room 411. Do not stay in that room! It has to be one of the worst rooms on the property. When we got to the room we were very surprised. Walls were paper thin (could hear the neighbors the whole time), extremely small and has absolutely no view. I felt like we got downgraded from what we were originally supposed to have. We were paying 139 a night plus $12 dollars parking so we most certainly were not happy with this tiny room. When my boyfriend and I went back downstairs to request another room the manager came out and assured us that all the rooms were similar in size. The manager and his employees need to actually go through all the rooms on the property to see how very different they all are. Very unprofessional of them to say the rooms are all similar in size. By his definition, similar most definitely sucked. Since I have stayed at this hotel several times I know this not to be true. That is, the rooms are not all similar in size. Of the rooms I know I've stayed in is 403 and 407. Those rooms are both much much bigger than 411 and we paid much less for those rooms! What makes those rooms better is they have high ceilings, two full size beds (I believe they're full size and not queen), one fold out couch and a sitting area/patio right outside the room to enjoy a gorgeous San Diego sunset/sunrise and other views. I know my family has also stayed in the buildings higher up the hill which had similar layouts. Since the manager seemed to be just bs'ing around and it was obvious he wasn't trying hard to find us another room we said \"forget it since its too much of an inconvenience for you\" and had to stay in our miserable room. As if things couldn't get any worse, when we checked out of our room they charged us twice for parking!! So I had to go back in and at get refunded. The refund is the only thing they did right if you can even consider that right since they screwed up already. Gesh! These people must have never gotten any real training before being put at the front desk. Thankfully we didn't stay in our room all that much since there is lots of great eating to do in Old Town like Old Town Mexican Restaurant which makes fresh warm flour and corn tortillas right in front of you.

Located right in the heart of Old Town San Diego, there are great Mexican restaurants and shopping right outside your door. Unfortunately, the location is the only thing I would rate as \"Excellent\". The rooms were a bit out of date, they could definitely use some updates, especially in the decor-area. The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego. I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...) We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.

No newspaper was delivered to the room (more on newspapers below). The pool is very small (though it does have a nice view). The worst part is all the deceptive advertising which left a bad aftertaste to our stay. First, our room was advertised as a \"suite\", when in fact it was a single room. Second, and most galling, was the added $5 \"resort fee\". I booked directly thru the Best Western website and this fee was never mentioned, but when we checked in we were told it was mandatory for all guests. Surprise! What makes the fee worse is how pathetic the reason for the fee is: to pay for free newspapers and coffee in the lobby and two bottles of water a day. Well, \"free newspapers\" means one copy each of three newspapers in the lobby, mounted on wooden poles like they use in libraries, so you can forget about taking a copy to your room, and you may well have to wait your turn to read it. (On top of that, the papers were all a day old!) The coffee was cheap Farmer Brothers, just terrible. Which leaves the water which, at $2.50/bottle, is surely the most expensive water ever. Note that this hotel is on a steep hillside, and has many, many stairs (127 from the street to our room!). We found it charming, but if you can't handle stairs, this is not the hotel for you.

Sandwiched in the middle was the vanity area, mirrored-covered closet with ironing board located inside, and the bathroom with sliding pocket door. The rooms were clean, and housekeeping did a decent job. We were in the 700 building on the 2nd floor; was fairly quiet our entire stay (4 days/5 nights). Only downfall to the rooms other than the size would be both TVs had really lousy sound quality (one was even a fairly recently purchased LG flat-screen) and their selection of cable channels was pretty limited...would have much rather enjoyed fuller variety of cable, although let's be honest, we weren't really watching much TV with such beautiful weather! According to the front desk, the front desk area of this Best Western used to be a restaurant; many of the buildings are somewhat disjointed and it took us about 5 minutes to figure out where the heck we were going each time we were learning a new part of the hotel; parking is tight, but at $12 day it's better than many of the the other hotels we were considering.

I have always foudn the staff to be very accommodating and the property to be clean and neat. Over the years I have stayed in all of the buildings on the property and have seen constant cleaning, rennovations and improvements taking place to maintain the property. The Hacienda is more like a small village than a big box hotel. A series of buidings terrace up the hill with plazas and courtyards which allow guests in the 199 guest rooms to feel as if they have some air to breathe. All rooms are suites. The 700 building has efficiency kitchens. Decor is pleasant and in a Mexican style which is attractive and practical. Because the hotel is terraced up the hill, people with special needs or who need special access need to make this known when booking a reservation so as to be placed in a room close to street level. Internet service is fair but can grind to a halt on a busy late afternoon when everyone in the hotel is using it at the same time. I was assured by one of the Sales Managers that they were aware of the problem and were working with the broadband provider to upgrade the service. The fact that I was able to talk with a Sales Manager in a hotel these days was a very nice touch, but I always find the staff at the Hacienda to be approachable and omnipresent, ready to assist guests. In all of my stays at the Hacienda, the housekeeping staff have always been excellent. They are honest, efficient and friendly. All of the room sin which I have stayed have been properly cleaned and appointed. All rooms now include a small guest safe for valuables, two bottles of water in the refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, cable TV, Internet service (wired - wireless in the lobby and common areas), use of the hotel airport shuttle, coffee in the lobby each morning and a choice of USA Today or the San DIego Union newspapers stacked at the bell desk in the lobby. As a Best Western Hotel, the Hacienda introduced the Wednesday meet and greet wine and cheese mixer for BW Gold Crown Club members . If a guest is not a member he/she may sign up on the spot and enjoy the refreshments as well as the benefits of the program. As a seasoned traveler, I do not expect any hotel to be \"just like home\". I expect some differences. A busy hotel cannot be all things to all people, but this one tries to accommodate all guest requests with a smile when it is within the power of the staff to do so.

Nestled on several terraces, the Hacienda has eight separate wings/buildings each housing several rooms. The first impression one receives is that of a colonial property with excellent gardens. In fact, these gardens are just one of several signs of constant attention at the hotel. Throughout our four-night stay, workers were painting, grouting, gardening to improve the grounds. We checked in on Sunday, June 2, and were greeted cordially and given our room assignment with a warning about the no-smoking policy, the $5 resort charge, and the early check-out fine (for those leaving before the agreed upon check-out date, there is a stiff $75 penalty). I concur that the $5 resort fee is nonsense and should either be a part of the room fees or be made optional. I noticed that upon check-out one guest did in fact contest her resort fee and was credited. But for the $5, you do get bottled water replenished each day, shuttle service, newspapers (we got two papers each day--you have to ask), free internet and printer service. Our room, in the 600's, has views over Heritage Park, and is, in fact, preferable to those which front directly the harbor, as the freeway noise is quite a distraction. (Too bad San Diego chose not to install sound barriers.) Yes, the rooms are dark as befitting the colonial atmosphere. And I do wish something would be done about the dreary armoires housing the TV's. But the carpet is Berber style and comfortable to walk on. The bathroom needs attention. The fan--defeaning--does little good and probably wakes up the occupants next door. Efforts to contact maintenance fell on deaf ears. We ordered room service breakfast one day and received it 30 minutes late, only because I had to call to remind the Acapulco about the order. The restaurant itself is ok for buffet breakfasts and also their spectacular rum-raisin French toast (the complete breakfast order included 2 eggs, and sausages--enough for two to share, I would hope). Some very good restaurants. El Agave has phenomenal old style Mexican cuisine with perhaps the most staggering inventory of tequilas I've ever seen. Fred's is fine for a quick meal. El Bandini is amusing and has romantic allure. Cafe Pacifico was disappointing for its lack of service. Go instead Uptown to Kimo Sabe, a highly ecelctic fusion restaurant with many side dishes on the plates. So why am I giving this four instead of three? Because the personnel are so kind and friendly and are working hard to do their best. Yes, there are other options in Old Town. All but one are quite a walk away. The B&B at Heritage Park looked inviting, but the management would not let us see any rooms even after agreeing to do so.

VERY slow service. The parking situation is cumbersome. It is not gated (no guards) and like the person who wrote about their car being broken into, I sensed some suspicious characters who were watching guests as they checked in and hovering around the exterior of the hotel parking structures. The garage that is shared with the Acapulco restaurant is dark and not well lit and there are many \"hidden\" spots that seem unsafe. They should put video cameras down there or possible have guards roaming the parking lots, and install better lighting. As for the room, a \"superior\" queen: it was VERY noisy and the decor was something from 20 years ago (read: maroon and turquoise bed spread circa 1982 which totally clashed with the faux Spanish wood finishing in the room circa 1978). Old noisy wall-mounted air-conditioning unit. Could hear the person upstairs stomping around like Godzilla. Paper-thin walls. San Diego airport airplanes can also be heard landing. Room was near outside pool area, also very noisy. Bed was hard as a rock. Room was so-so on the cleaniless (could be cleaner). Didn't swim in the pool or spa, noting the crowdedness and cloudy water in the jacuzzi. For the amount of money ($200 with tax) you are getting what should be a $54 room at a cheapie roadside motel.

The only downside is the availability of hotels in this location. If you prefer top-end 4-5* then Old Town is probably not for you. As far as we could see there were 3 alternatives, Marriott Courtyard, Holiday Inn Express and the Hacienda (Best Western). Following the recommendations upon this site, we opted for the Courtyard which was a disappointment. The rooms were old/jaded, the operation franchised (ie. not Marriott) and it probably had the worst location of the 3 hotels. Although, we experienced no problems, it was dark walking back to the hotel at night and we had to keep looking over our shoulder! Our room also had a beautiful view of the I-5 in all its 8 lane glory with a large Lockheed factory as a backdrop! On our first night, we were walking into the Old Town when we saw the Hacienda on the side of a hill overlooking all the attractions etc. It had been built in a traditional style and looked beautiful with all its decorative lights off-setting the dark night sky. Remembering that we had researched this using Trip Advisor, we decided to take a closer look. We met the manager (Douglas) and explained our situation. He was very courteous and showed us a typical room at The Hacienda. The bottom line is that we decided to cut short our stay at the Courtyard and moved to the Hacienda for the next 3 nights. This was a good decision and we thoroughly enjoyed the remainder of our stay in Old Town. In comparison to The Courtyard, the Hacienda had the following advantages:- - traditional room, themed in the Old Town style. - great sunset views from our balacony across to Mission Bay. - nice Mexican themed restaurant. - great location - right in the thick of things with a short and safe walk home. - quiet location with little noise - US$30 per night saving over the Coutyard best rate for the same night. - free parking in a large garage (another US$15 saving in comparison to the Coutyard). - Our daughter also enjoyed the pool.

The hotel is close to the airport, has free broadband wi-fi hotspots -- and free ethernet broadband in Building #8 -- and is a short walk from a trolley stop. Of course everyone in San Diego drives -- but the hotel's proximity to the freeways is just fine. The staff are helpful with good advice on virtually everything. The Hacienda is good for business travelers, as well as families, couples, and singles wanting to enjoy the delights of this beautiful city by the sea.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cFountains, flowers, great location but a terrible mattress.\u201d", "Author": "Linzan", "ReviewID": "UR5025671", "Content": "Hacienda has a beautiful setting with fountains, tiled steps, flowers. Hard to believe this is a motel. Open the door to your room, now you know it is motel. Rooms were probably upgraded last time in the 60's and show it. NIce to have microwave and refrigerator and the location is great. This is not really a hotel, just a motel with some extra amenities. The mattress was deplorable and noise from other guests on the weekends partying in the courtyard and the pool was disturbing but ended around 11:30. In general, I recommend it aobve the other Old Town locations if you can overlook that it is a little rundown and don't expect it to be a HOTEL.", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d79913-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_PLUS_Hacienda_Hotel_Old_Town-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$123 - $196*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4041 Harney St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92110</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "79913", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cb/c1/cbc11d76709774fd9dc12483e10f9e8b6large.jpg"}}

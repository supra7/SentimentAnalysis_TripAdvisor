Opening the two small windows in the bedroom and outer room helped, but then you got the street noise. The TV channel lineup was OK at best. The bathroom was small but adequate. The valet parking....you need to drive into a alley behind the hotel. If this was at night, no way would I have done this but during the day with several other friends it was OK. My suggestion is to just park it across the street where the valet is going to park it anyway. Overall - very good value.

Cold Hash Browns, sandwich ham slices, premade pancakes and one barely functioning waffle iron does not a HOT breakfast make. There were a few nice ammenities including a nice Happy Hour layout and a plesant staff. These of course, were offered in general for the regular guest. There are no other facilities at this hotel (i.e. pool, game room), so these are what they have to offer. Very poor for children. This offer is a discounted product at a discounted Social Living price. It could never be confused with a regular priced product at a discounted price.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Millersville, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cAnd a good time was had by all!!\u201d", "Author": "LynneChildress", "ReviewID": "UR123905610", "Content": "We bought a Living Social deal for the Brookshire Suites that gave us a good room rate, free valet parking, breakfast, and a credit to a nearby restaurant.

I first tried to get a room for this past Saturday, but they were sold out, and I was put on a waiting list. I kept calling, and everyone was really, really nice and professional, but again, I was left waiting on the phone for a very long time. The good thing, though, was that there were cancellations last minute and we got a room on the day we wanted. The place where you pull your car to valet is a little cramped, but our car was taken care of. But everyone was so, so nice, from the front desk staff, to the valets, to the cleaning people. EVERYONE. Our room was nice and spacious, and really, really clean. The front desk called us a cab to our destination for dinner and they were prompt. The room was really comfortable and the bed was great! Breakfast was more than what I was expecting, and the mood of everyone there was relaxed, so people seemed to have all been in a good mood. The food was delicious, and once again, the front desk staff and valets were really efficient and pleasant. They also even have activities for kids with a treasure box that you ask for gold coins from to redeem for a prize. Really thoughtful place, a block from Harborplace, and near everything. I would definitely recommend. Even the regular prices are much better than a lot of the other hotels downtown, and it's worth it.

We have gone to Baltimore several times, staying in a variety of suite type hotel locations along the Harbor front. This hotel has a great location just a block from the center of everything! It\u2019s a short walk to the Maryland Science Center, historic ships, shopping, the National Aquarium, the Power Plant and Power Plant LIVE and Port Discovery Museum. Check-in went very smoothly with greetings and instructions from very friendly staff, from the valet to the front desk. They took the time to welcome my son personally, and begin him on a quest for gold \"coins\" that he can collect during his stay to earn a prize from the treasure box in the lobby. He loved this. This is an older hotel and the architecture is sort of bland, with a small but well-decorated lobby and narrow hallways. We had an executive double suite with wet bar and living room area and bedroom with 2 beds. Our space was very long and narrow, split in half for the 2 rooms. The decor is very old and mismatched, with some damaged furniture and decor in our living room. A very dirty air vent needed a good vacuum brush tool. The bathroom was functional but small. The hot water is the hottest I have ever felt, and plenty of it. We had plenty of towels but given only one washcloth and two hand towels for 4 people? The bedding was gorgeous, however, with bolster pillows and tons of regular pillows. The windows actually have small sections that open to give fresh air. There were 2 flat panel TVs, one in each room that both carried enough channels to keep us all happy. Due to the narrowness of the room, there is no seating in the bedroom and only a couch in the living area. However, there was ample closet space, two huge closets to store our luggage and clothing. The sound in our room was minimal, despite being street side. We also heard no other occupants through the walls, only maybe an occasional door slam when we were in the living room area. Our beds were very soft and we slept great. They have a top floor called the Cloud Club, which is a 180 degree view of the city from a nice height. It is a lounge, TV watching area where breakfast is also served each day. There is free WIFI up there, and in the lobby and wired internet for free in your room. Each morning, we rode to Cloud Club and partook of the free breakfast, which consisted of all the typical continental items plus a waffle station and 2-3 hot items, like eggs, sausage, sausage gravy, potatoes, omelet\u2019s. Great coffee. Giovanni was quite efficient keeping the tables clean and items restocked as guests cycled through. There was a microwave here and table wear and cutlery are left out, so we chose another night to sit up here and eat dinner, leftovers from a restaurant the night before. Adjacent was a small weight and exercise room. The staff is very friendly at this hotel. They also seem to work very hard, filling multiple roles. You would see the same staff at 8am that you saw at 6pm the night before and wondered if they ever got to go home! We called for more towels and who appears but Meredith, the nice lady who checked us in! Ian was also very friendly and willing to answer questions. The valets and bell captains were very nice, especially considering all the parking is off-site and every time you want your car, they have quite a walk to go get it! Even the maintenance man was friendly and gave my son a \u201cgold coin\u201d towards his treasure chest prize. The coin game encourages guests to notice and interact with the staff! What better way to ensure the staff are interactive and friendly. The lobby gets a bit crazy in the mid morning time with groups checking out, but all was managed well. The hotel is pet friendly, as we saw several small dogs in the lobby and on the elevator. However, we never heard any of them! Please be aware that Baltimore is a city and does have a homeless population, which tends to frequent the tourist areas, including the alleys around this hotel and the harbor area. We did see some beggars and people sleeping as we walked around this area, but there was also a police presence, both on bikes and in vehicles. While one should be aware of their safety, one should not assume that this hotel is in a bad neighborhood just because I mention this. As noted, the location of this hotel is very ideal. It is close to the stadiums, the convention center, the harbor, area restaurants (try the Cheapside Wharf restaurant on Water Street directly behind hotel for a great, inexpensive breakfast or lunch) and even a CVS drug store on the block. It was nice having so much within walking distance. For the price we paid ($99 Groupon rate, with free valet parking ($29 value) and nearby restaurant gift certificate ($25 value) this was a steal, even in the off-season. In the summer months, we would expect to pay $250-300 for the room we had, per night. The value of being close enough to the Harbor to walk to everything, without needing to move your car, get a taxi or water taxi was quite valuable to us, as these are quite expensive in this area.

Right in the middle of the inner harbor, we never moved our car! Our room was very spacious and clean (Queen suite 1106). In it we received complimentary coffee and waters, had a very comfortable bed, and 2 large sized TVs. The Cloud Club had an impressive view of the harbor and a delicious breakfast spread. Although we arrived early and our original room wasn't ready, the staff were very accommodating and even upgraded us to a larger corner room! I was very impressed. Cons: The bathroom seemed a little small and tight for such a large suite. Our room faced the harbor and street (which suited me fine) BUT, if you're not used to traffic, I'd HIGHLY suggest getting a room on the other side of the building, there's a lot of street noise. FInally this may seem like a small complaint but the TV remotes were annoyingly difficult. It seemed that the buttons pressed didn't register with the TVs at least half the time. Not a huge deal but definitely annoying. Finally the valet parking area is a pretty narrow and seems to fill up quickly which may leave you waiting a bit.

Check-in went smoothly and the front desk was very professional and friendly. The hallways looked very clean and did not have any odors.

While there were some good things about our experience, the hotel failed to provide three fundamental necessities that a guest expects when staying at ANY hotel that is not a discount motel/dump. Those three fundamental failures were the following: *THE TOILET DIDN'T WORK. SERIOUSLY. It never fully flushed, not once. Since we went out almost immediately after arriving at the hotel, we didn't really take notice until the next morning, when it became VERY necessary for us to have a working toilet. Because it didn't work, and we needed to check out in a couple hours anyway, it wasn't worth it for us to call down to the desk to have someone come up and fix it. Instead, we were forced to high-tail it out of there. *This is the most eggregious: WE DID NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE TEMPERATURE OF OUR ROOM! It was 58 degrees outside during our stay, and we were on the 10th floor, yet the heat was on and our room was a stifling 79 degrees. After trying to lower the thermostat with no results, we called down to the desk and were told that they had the air conditioning off and were not going to turn it on. We were advised we could \"open a window,\" which wouldn't have been a problem except the hotel is smack dab in the middle of downtown, and is noisy enough outside without the added volume of New Year's Eve and tens of thousands of people gathering downtown for the fireworks. I understand that it is unexpected to have such warm weather in December in Baltimore, but the hotel manager needs to be able to make the call to turn the air conditioner on so hotel guests are comfortable. This is the absolute first thing a hotel should do for its guests: make the rooms a comfortable temperature. *The TV remote did not work. While this might seem petty, being able to watch TV in a hotel room is kind of crucial. With no working remote, it made the activity very annoying. Of course, I can't mention the bad without mentioning the good. The staff are pleasant, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room itself was clean and pretty nice if a bit dated. Since it was New Year's, the hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and party hats, noice-makers, and a gold bead necklace. That was a very nice touch. Also, there was a free hot breakfast, and while not the best breakfast I ever had, it was free and they had a good variety (scrambled eggs, biscuits and sausage gravy, make-your-own-waffle station). Ultimately, there are many other hotels in downtown Baltimore that charge about the same rate for rooms but are successful in the three major areas where Brookshire failed completely. All of the ones I can think of (Hampton Inn, Rennaissance, Hilton, Marriott, etc.) at the very least have working toilets and room temperature control.

The location couldn't be better - you're literally 1.5 blocks from the harbor and close to the busline (which there's a free one) which makes it easy to go and do touristy stuff.

Wired internet access in room offered, but not working in all rooms apparently. The first room we were given (room 703) did not work at all (internet). The staff was very helpful, showing us two other rooms. Internet access did not work in the 2nd room either. The third room (room 503) was fine. However, their internet connection apparently does not allow vpn setup. This can be a major issue with business travelers. Also, I must wonder what we would have done if the hotel was booked solid and we were not able to change rooms! I realize internet access is not a major issue for all travelers and that is why I rated this 4 stars. They did have 2 functioning pc's with a printer in the lobby. Internet access here was fine. The location cannot be beat! It was just a block from the Inner Harbour, So much was walking distance (malls, shopping, aquarium, science center, drug store, restaurants, etc). Parking is a hassle. Since we stayed 7 days (6 nights) and I knew of this issue in advance, after reading previous reviews, I planned ahead. I contacted a parking garage just across the street -- caddy corner. To save money the parking staff over the phone suggested paying for a 1/2 month prorated rate of $94.50 + $15 activation fee ==> total=$109.50. This is less expensive than the daily rate and will permit going in and out at your leisure. About the rooms... Both 703 and 503 were suites with a beautiful harbour view. Both had similar issues with the ceiling. I am 5' tall and did not have a problem with this, but it was very noticeable, as I could touch the ceiling upon entering the room. After stepping inside the room about a foot, the ceiling does get higher, but not by much. I could not reach it, but my 5' 7\" companion could! The bathroom sink was noticeably deeper than normal. At 5' tall, I had trouble comfortably using the faucet. It was very far inside. Also, the hot water can be scalding hot -- just a warning for those traveling with children. The water pressure in the shower was wonderful. The carpeting 503 was very shabby and run down. 703's carpet was ok. The mirror in the bedroom in 503 was above the dresser but behind the flat screen tv sitting on the dresser. This was useless. In the other room (703) the mirror was off to the side of the room -- a position that made it possible to fully make use of. The heating and cooling was terrible. We complained, but nothing was done. At the start of the trip we wanted to cool down the room, but were unable to make the room comfortable with the a/c. Later in the trip after a cold wave was passing by we wanted to heat the room, but also had problems with this. One of the dresser drawers in 503 never shut all the way. This was very annoying! Breakfast was fabulous here! Every day they served scrambled eggs, sausage patties, potatoes, fresh fruit salad, yogurt, bagels, donuts, cereal, sliced breads, make your own waffles, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, oatmeal, milk, etc I have no complaints about breakfast.

David, the \"bartender\", was super friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our cocktails and even chatted with a few other guests. The room served double duty as it also was where breakfast was served in the morning. It is open 24 hrs, so if someone needed to escape his/her room, this was a great place to come to. During breakfast, we could see the harbor from the glass enclosed floor. There was a make your own waffle station, eggs, potatoes, sausage, yogurt, fruit, juices, donuts, toast, bagels and cereal. Plenty of options to fill the tank. And again, service was spot on. Empty serving dishes were immediately filled, and dirty plates removed even though this was a do it your self meal. Of course, if you wanted to be near the Inner Harbor, well you couldn't get a better location. You are but steps to the water, shops and restaurants.

Cons: room could use a serious rehab or at least a good cleaning - more shabby than chic; ceilings very low - I'm 5'7\" and could easily touch the ceiling - could be claustrophobic for a tall person; bathroom is tiny; pet walk is a city block away; $34.80 per night to park.

Price for the same room on Orbitz was $206, before parking fees, taxes and destination fees, whatever that is. I'm used to paying resort fees, but this is no resort.

Walking distance to Camden Yards to see the Orioles (15 minutes max ....a true must see .....Camden Yards has to be one of the finest and fan friendly baseball stadium - nice marriage of old and new right in the middle of tow) or right next door, the stadium for the Ravens. The walk is right through town, very safe neighborhood .....with great selection of restaurants and bars. Really nothing bad to say about this hotel ...it just lacks that little something to make it a killer for the price.

There is a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop thirty yards from the lobby - a lifesaver for late night arrivals. There is also a CVS drugstore up the block, but they close at 20:00 on weeknights (!).

The hotel had been recommended to me months prior by Harbor Magic as their hotel that catered to business travelers because of the breakfast, suites available, wireless, and shuttle to other neighborhoods within Baltimore. After booking, I learned that the hotel is no longer associated with Harbor Magic. I made reservations at the last minute and was able to be accommodated. Upon arriving, I was upgraded from a king room to a suite due to \"low occupancy.\" The following description is not meant to be funny and does not exaggerate. I wish I had had my camera to help show what I am talking about. Upon entering the room I felt like I was in a horror movie set in 1970. It was truly an eerie experience. The lights flickered on, some never turned on. The carpet was threadbare and stained with disgusting red and brown marks. There was a silverfish in the bathtub, probably due to the fact that the bathtub faucet constantly leaked. There was dirt behind the headboard and a long hair (not mine) on a pillow. There were stains on the ceiling and marks on the walls. The dark, dank, dirty room gave me such an unsettling feeling that I seriously considered checking out and finding another hotel. I decided to stick it out and it only got worse. When I was getting ready for bed I heard a phone ringing faintly in the distance. Turns out it was my bathroom phone, which had been turned to low volume. It never stopped ringing and I did not pick it up. I tried to call the lobby to let them know of this, only to find that neither the phone in the living room or bedroom had a dial tone. Instead, I turned the volume off. The phone was still ringing in the morning. Breakfast consisted of cold eggs, stale bagels, fruit from a can, yogurt, and various pastries. Juice and coffee were both from a machine. Positives: able to get a reservation at the last minute, was only $99 Negatives: there is no longer a shuttle running to all Harbor Magic properties, as was advertised to me. The rooms are not only drab, but dirty. There is no wireless in the rooms, only DSL. Breakfast was underwhelming at best. The location is downtown, but is not good because it is not safe to walk outside in the neighborhood at night. (I lived in Baltimore for many years and trust me on the safety issue.)

It is long, but useful. My family and I recently traveled to Baltimore before a cruise vacation on the East coast. After nights of deliberating, it was settled that we would stay at the Brookshire Suites. Firstly, let me say that the location of this hotel is perfect. We couldn't have asked for better! It is seconds away from the fabulous Inner Harbour which made sight seeing very easy. I do not understand the poor ratings for staff at this hotel. Front desk personal, valet drivers and bar staff were always friendly and polite (especially Amy and Dave). They were very kind to us and offered their tips and advice about places to visit and eat in the city. However, I would not consider the hotel to be one of the greatest that I have stayed at. My family and I had to switch rooms due to noise from Lombard St. When we attempted to do this, the hotel told us that no rooms on the opposite side of the hotel were available. It was only after several calls to the front desk that we were able to acquire a quiet room. It would have been nice to know that Harbour Magic was no longer affiliated before we stayed at the Brookshire Suites. Harbour Magic was one of the reasons why we chose to stay at the hotel and we felt that we had been duped. No information about the break was provided before or after our booking, and we were told only after inquiring at the front desk upon check in. The pullout couches did not provide a comfortable sleep and we were hard pressed to find a decent cot to use. The cot delivered to our room was lumpy, missing springs and had a deep concave which made it impossible to sleep on. The hotel, however, did bring a replacement as soon as was possible - then we switched rooms and had two queen sized beds for our use. As for the decor, the hotel could use some renovations, but it was far from a dive. Breakfast and snacks in the Cloud Club were the highlight of our time at the hotel - thank you Dave. All in all, the Brookshire Suites is not a terrible hotel. It provided decent accommodation for the time we spent in Baltimore. Whether or not we will return in the future has yet to be decided.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hazleton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBest location and friendliest staff\u201d", "Author": "NightNurse801", "ReviewID": "UR117133815", "Content": "My hubby and I stayed here for several days and were really impressed all around. 2 minute walk to Harbor area, safe, well-lit and lots of tourists day and night made us feel comfortable walking after dark.

Most of the staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgable about the local area and we were met with a 'hello' or 'welcome back' each time we passed through the lobby. I have to say that the only complaint we had was when I asked if a shuttle could drop us in another area of the city for dinner. The young lady behind the desk told me rather rudely that they have new owners, no shuttle and that she apologizes 'but theres unfortunately nothing I can do about that.' We didn't see her at the desk over the next 3 days and we were in and out constantly so I'll assume she isn't in customer service normally!

The hallway area leading to our room was run-down with poor lighting and the room itself had a really cramped bedroom and the bathroom was about the size of a closet (again, very different from our first experience). This room was also quite noisy. As for the service, we had asked several staff members about the light rail and other public transportation options to get up to the zoo area the next morning, and no one seemed to know...we ended up having to search online and figure it out ourselves. We also had called to ask about public parking options in the area and got a spacey \"uh, there's parking garages in the area, just look for signs.\" Not particularly helpful. All that being said, the complimentary breakfast was excellent and if you're not planning on being around your room much, I suppose it's still a good deal for the price since the harbor is practically right out the door. They always have excellent last-minute weekend rates if you sign up for the email list. It sounds like based on recent reviews people are still having quite divergent experiences, so I imagine it largely depends on the room you get an who's working when you're staying there. I just wouldn't go in having high expectations on the room quality or counting on the staff to provide reliable information about the area.

Sadly, that's where the great things about this place stops. The street noise at night was the worst I've ever seen or HEARD. There were thousands of people (foot traffic and cars) on the street as the hotel sits on one of the busiest street corners in Baltimore City. The police were out in force hurrying people along the roads, but also randomly blaring their sirens. This went on until 3 am. Then the street miraculously emptied and quieted down.

Not kids running down the halls or loud neighbors etc. The only other thing that really troubled me was the huge molded rusted stain behind the toilet bowl that was conveniently blocked by the trash can. Couldn't really see it till you move the can out of the way. Then, it was like OMG, what the heck is that. All in all, I would not stay here again until the windows were changed.

The staff at the desk is always wonderful and David in Club Cloud is a pleasure to speak with and is an excellent source of info for all things Baltimore. Unfortunately my complaint lies with the valet service. When we had last stayed here in the fall, my husband swore up and down that he had left a $10 bill in the console when he handed the valet the keys. He remembered putting $40 of gas in the car, paying with a $50 and placing that $10 change in the console. When we departed that money was gone but since neither of us were certain we had in fact left it in the car, we dismissed it and moved on. It left a bad taste in our mouths and diminished the fun we had a bit but it was over. We decided that when we returned in Feb or March we would leave a couple of dollars in the car to prove to ourselves that no employee of the hotel would steal from our car. That same valet (Brian, which is also my hubby's name and the reason we recalled it), parked our car on our recent Feb stay. He also returned it to us two days later and since we never called for our car over the duration of our visit, we have to assume that no one else was in it. Both of the $5 bills were missing and, unless someone broke into the car, left the navigation system, radio, etc and only took $10 in cash, we have to believe this valet stole the cash. My husband wanted to confront Brian but I convinced him it wasn't worth it and that we'd simply stay elsewhere on our next Baltimore visit.

Those are the only two truly good things I can say about the place. I booked a room at the Brookshire Suites in large part due to the glowing reviews on this site. My problems started immediately. I couldn't get an email confirmation that accurately reflected the rate, package and days I was staying. It took several calls before I finally got a correct email. These problems arose even though I booked the room directly through the hotel site. On arrival, the front desk was confused about a $25 spa/food credit that was supposed to be part of my package. I was told that the woman at the front desk would speak with the manager and get back to me. I never heard anything back. The room was not what I expected. It was like a cave, and I was on the 9th floor. I'm not a tall person. Beware if you are. Portions of the ceiling are so low that I can touch them with my palms while standing flat footed (I am 5'4\"). The carpet in my room was so poorly laid that it had huge creases in it. They were literally so big as to be tripping hazards. The bathroom is tiny and there is not one towel bar or hook on which to hang anything. There was a lot of dark hair in the shower that did not belong to me. The bed was very uncomfortable (very firm mattress and the sheets and blankets were arranged in such a way that it was hard to get the blankets up to your shoulders without unmaking the bed). The pillows were huge and very, very firm. I don't think the sheets were cotton (but admittedly I did not look at the label). The bed had one of those yucky, never gets washed comforters. The remote controls were almost impossible to use (they didn't seem to \"talk\" to the televisions). I thought it was an issue of batteries, but I requested a new one, and it didn't work either. I could go on and on about the problems with the room, but overall, mine was not comfortable and was quite shabby. The breakfast was average for a free hotel breakfast. I did not experience any of the great service other reviews reference, but even great service could not have fixed all of the other issues. Finally, when booking my room, the \"destination fee\" of $9.95 per night was not clear to me. When I said something to that effect at check in, the woman backed off from charging me and I was told that the package I booked was exempt. I guess that was true, but I looked at several package options and don't recall such a fee being evident with any of them, so it might be worth confirming before you book.

The breakfast was a really nice spread but everything was cold which made it unenjoyable. This was the standard all 3 mornings there so not just a fluke. They mentioned this to the breakfast staff but with no change of results. The room was nicely appointed although they ended up with rooms that had low ceilings. While the low ceilings felt a little confining, it wasn't a deal breaker. A minor inconvenience was that there was no place to hang your washcloths or towels in the bathroom. The hotel was able to accomodate a request for adjoining rooms.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jefferson Twp., PA", "Title": "\u201cThey couldn't do enough for us... what a pleasure!\u201d", "Author": "mtcobbpa", "ReviewID": "UR82865857", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here during a Parent's Weekend at her college.

Before I went to Baltimore, they had a travel specialist call me to discuss things to do in Baltimore. This was extremely helpful since I didn't know much about the area. She was very patient with me as I asked a lot of questions. She also let me know a little bit about Harbor Magic which is the larger group to which the Brookshire Hotel belongs. The hotel is a block back from the inner harbor,easy, safe access to harbor. The suite that we were in was very roomy, extra nice and we could not hear noise from the street at all. The bed was comfy. Many updated features! The breakfast was great with many hot items, even a fresh waffle maker. Thay had lots of room for seating also. While we were in Baltimore I remembered that the travel specialist had recommended Obticky's (sp?) and said that this restaurant has been written up to be one of the places to eat \"before you die\". We asked the staff at the front desk of the Brookshire about it and if we could walk there. They made reservations for us WITH FREE DESSERT and offered to get transportation for us. They recommended NOT walking, a big thank you to them! I had a little trouble getting the internet to work in my room, called the front desk, they transferred me to an outside company who hooked me right up in minutes. When we wanted to go to the aquarium, I asked about tickets at the front desk. They had VIP tickets which meant that we didn't have to wait in line. I didn't know how sweet that was until I got to the aquarium and saw that LONG line (and it was raining). We walked right past the line, up tp the VIP doors and went in! Oh, and the Hotel shuttle drove us there. As we found out the shuttle is available to take you lots of places. I didn't have children with me but they have a gold coin program for kids. Children ask hotel staff for coins. When the child gets five coins, they get a prize out of the treasure chest in the hotel lobby. I saw a child ask two of the staff at the front desk for coins and they were so very sweet to the child.

Both rooms have very large flat screens, and a nice touch, the bath room is not in the bedroom to avoid disturbing the bedroom occupant. A small sink, microwave and refrigerator are off the living area as well. It seems a bit unfair to single any of the staff out, as all were wonderful, but we will give special mention to Andrea at the front desk, who is very kind and always asked about our well being, Dory (sp?) at happy hour who brought a relaxing and happy end to the days, the night bellmen with their very helpful tips and friendliness, and the lovely and gracious Claudia, who gave great recommendations, runs such a friendly and tight efficient operation and overall assured a great stay and desire to return soon, which we plan to do next month.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cYour treated like family.\u201d", "Author": "knuck4", "ReviewID": "UR49552398", "Content": "The hotel is located in a great part of Baltimore near all the Inner Harbour attractions and great restautants.

This will be a lengthy review so if you want the bottom line, as the heading says, I found the Brookshire to have a great location, great people, great service, and great value. This was not a short-term stay. For 21 days in October and November, the Brookshire served as my \"home away from home.\u201d When you stay in one hotel for that long, comfort and good service aren\u2019t just extras, they are necessities. THE STAFF: The staff at the Brook (as they call it in Baltimore) was uniformly excellent. They went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed to make my stay not only tolerable but also enjoyable. Andrea, Agostina, Geoffrey, and Tad always greeted me by name, asked how things were going and if there was any way they could do to help me. Repeatedly they took care of the little things in a way that showed they cared. One example out of many: I dropped off my dry-cleaning a hour too late for pick-up but I needed it for the nest day\u2019s meeting. They got it to the drycleaners and back to me that night. Rooms can get pretty cluttered when you\u2019re there on business as long as I was but Maria kept the room clean and tidy. I didn\u2019t get this treatment just because I was staying there for a lengthy time. I saw the staff give the same level of service to everyone who were guests of the hotel. THE SUITE: I had an Executive King Suite. Very spacious. Nice living room with a large flat-screen TV. Good working area. Mini-kitchen area with a refrigerator and microwave. Two bottles of Poland water dropped off in the room every morning. Hugh bed in a large bedroom. Average sized bathroom but everything worked including the bathtub drain, (One of my personal bugaboos are bathtubs that fill up with water while you shower because the drains are slow.) You\u2019ll read in some reviews that the ceilings are lower than in other hotels. They are but I never had a problem with the height and I\u2019m over 6 foot. I didn\u2019t have a view but, given I was there on business, didn\u2019t need one. The only, very minor, quibble I had during my stay was the mini-kitchen didn\u2019t have any dinnerware, not even a bottle opener or a corkscrew. This was easily remedied with the purchase of some plastic dinnerware but it would have been nice to have some already in the room. There was a convenient coin-operated laundry across the hall ($1.75 for washer and dryer.) Be aware this is not a brand-new hotel so not everything is in pristine condition anymore than it would be at your house. But the facilities are clean and well kept up. THE LOCATION: The Brook is about one block from the Inner Harbor. Easy walking distance to most of the attractions, including the Aquarium. Lots of good shopping and restaurants nearby. Always felt safe and secure in the area. Well lit and plenty of street traffic. Three very good dining establishments within a block of the Brook (Burkes, Velleggia\u2019s and Peter\u2019s Pour House). 24 hour Subway kitty-corner to the Brook. Beer aficionados won\u2019t want to miss the Pratt Street Ale House, an easy five-block walk away with exceptional bar food and superb craft beers and ales. (Ask for Robyn.) Mass transit is a mess in Baltimore. The light rail and the metro only run along one line. Buses are plentiful but confusing. As part of the Harbor Magic group, the Brook has shuttle service to its two sister properties, the ultra-modern Pier Five hotel right on the Inner Harbor and the historic Admiral Fell Inn at Falls Point. These hotels share some guest services including a convenient shuttle. Both my shuttle drivers Roland and Rae not only made sure I got to were I needed to be but also gave me some of the history of Baltimore\u2019s neighborhoods and recommendations on where to eat. THE VALUE: Value to me means more than just a low price. It means attentive and responsive staff, good facilities, and quality service. The Brook was an excellent value. I have stayed at other suite hotels and received far less for more. There are also a number of special packages offered at all three hotels. I took advantage of the Best of Baltimore package during my stay.

We both do a lot of traveling around the country and internationally for our (very different) jobs and have seen the whole gamut of accommodations, and would rate Brookshire Suites in Baltimore as one of the best-ever. We've now stayed there three times, in different rooms on different floors, and can say from more than chance experience that the rooms are spacious and clean, with comfortable, clean-smelling beds, well-arranged work desks and relaxing couches, and everything you need to feel at home. You don't have to sit in bed to watch TV--in fact there are 2 TV's--one for the bedroom and one in the living room--as well as two sinks (bathroom and kitchenette), two mirrors, two closets--it's totally easy to share the space with another person without feeling cooped-up. The staff couldn't be nicer or more attentive, either. I had a problem with my internet connection close to midnight one night and within minutes (after asking me if it would be okay) the front desk dispatched an engineer who quickly replaced the modem and solved the issue so I could get back online right away. At every other hotel, that kind of request has been met with responses like \"Call us in the morning if you are still having trouble\" or \"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it.\" All the staff were as friendly as they could be. Dorian and Andrea were real standouts at the front desk, but the porters and lobby assistants also went well out of their way to be unusually helpful. Breakfast is everything you could ask for--not just a box of doughnuts and instant coffee like a lot of places but a real meal with freshly-cooked hot foods, fruits, pastries, fresh juices and a delightful view of the Inner Harbor. The happy hour (5:30-7:30 PM) is a nice touch, too, with free drinks and hors d'oeuvres and that same view of the water to get you in the mood for going out for dinner. For the visitor on foot, going out could hardly be simpler--one block away is Harborplace, with dozens of restaurants and shops, museums, the aquarium, music clubs and a Water Taxi landing if you want to catch a romantic ride to still more fascinating parts of town like Fell's Point or Fort McHenry. Camden Yards is a five minute walk if a baseball game is your goal. And if all you want to do is curl up in your suite and relax, a Subway across the street and a pizza place around the corner are great for running out for a bring-home meal. The hotel offers quite a few drinks and snacks in the lobby as well.

They are two of the three Harbor Magic Hotels in Baltimore, the other one being the more exotic Pier 5 Hotel in Baltimore's vibrant Inner Harbour. Both properties are well situated in two different but exciting neighborhoods, Brookshire in the heart of the business district and within steps of the Inner Harbour, and Admiral Fell Inn at the hub of Fell's Point with its vibrant nightlife (and also day life!). The neighborhood concept is at the heart of both hotels. In each, a guest is made immediately to feel at home by staff that are more like low key helpful neighbors (that don't no how to say no) than typical hotel employees who might live by corporate policies that don't always address real life guest situations. We are not talking luxury, rather value for money with luxurious touches. The beds at both properties are excellent; large and with the quality of bedding that you will find at the serious international chains. Bathroom amenities are spa quality and go a long way to make up for the traditional bathtub and shower curtain. And for those that have business at or rely on the resources of Johns Hopkins, the Harbor Magic Group has carefully designed an excellent program including discounted rooms and free shuttle service from all its hotels to and from Johns Hopkins, scheduled in the mornings and evenings but on-demand at all other times of day. Yes there are a few drawbacks - but very few indeed - all of which are outweighed by the outstanding value for money and guest experience. Don't expect shiny new properties with marble shower stalls and heated floors. Don't expect a swimming pool. Do expect (very) clean and well kept premises and great gym facilities. Apart from the Hopkins package which is generous and which meets our business needs, we come back time and time again because of the people. At the Admiral Fell Inn, look out for Brett Henry, a fine manager, who takes time from his managerial duties to give personal service amidst what must be a busy schedule for him. At the Brookshire Suites, Travis, Andrea, Al, Brian, and Geoff all distinguish themselves in even the most mundane work of guest relations with wonderful customer service attitudes and this, in the long run, is what stands this hotel in good stead.

The Brookshire was at full capacity when my boyfriend and I visited, but we had an extremely personalized experience. I've already recommended the hotel to my sister and brother-in-law for their upcoming wedding anniversary. For those who want more than my gushing: My boyfriend flew into town to help me celebrate my birthday. Since I live an hour from Baltimore, he arranged to stay at the Brookshire on Friday. I'm the \"planner\" in our relationship, so my first reaction was to check Trip Advisor. It didn't take long to find some pretty scary reviews. I called and spoke to Andrea who told me how the hotel investigated both the items taken from rooms and the car theft, my biggest concern. She also told me that even though the rooms don't have safes, there are security deposit boxes at the front desk. She further provided a description of the valet's outfit (black pants, black vest, and Brookshire Suites nametag prominently displayed) and told me to leave my keys at the front desk if the valet was helping another guest. Of course, this seemed like common sense, but apparently the victims of the car theft gave their keys to a guy in jeans and a t-shirt. I definitely feel sorry for them and their ordeal, but that wasn't really a smart move. :-( Dorien efficiently checked us in, told us the details we needed to know about the Brookshire, and gave us some great recommendations for dinner (Rusty Scupper) and entertainment (Power Plant Live) within walking distance. We headed up to room 1103 -- a two-room, corner suite with a partial view of the harbor. The room DID show it's age a bit, but it was neat, clean, and completely adequate. After dinner and a night of fun, we were more than satisfied with our comfy bed. The full breakfast the next day was enjoyable, as was our day at the National Aquarium (the tickets for that alone would've been $60 without the package). We ate an amazing lunch at Ra Sushi -- a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. (Tip: Ra has a happy hour from 3-7, even on Saturdays, with half-off appetizers, half-off sushi, and drink specials.) It was raining when we finished lunch, so we went to one of the Brookshire's sister properties and caught a complimentary shuttle back. We got the car back (in the condition we left it) AND received a complimentary box of Godiva for celebrating my birthday at the Brookshire.

The hotel provides a small breakfast buffet, which was a nice touch - especially considering that there didn't seem to be many alternatives in the area. No pool or gym onsite. Room service from a local restaurant but almost exclusively seafood. Parking was expensive, especially considering that the lot was empty. I travel 4-5 times a year, so I've stayed in a few hotels - many firsts at this one: This was the first time I've seen maids come to make up the room at 5:30-6pm - just when we were there resting and getting ready to go out for dinner. This happened every day except the day we checked out - on that day they were knocking on the door at 8:30 am!!! First time I've had to go to the desk to ask for bathroom tissue. First time I've seen a line of 5 people/couples at a hotel front desk. First time I've ever seen and paid a $9.95 daily \"destination charge.\" This was a surprise when we checked in. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending money. The daily rate for this hotel was reasonable (we did the Waterfront Invasion package and got tickets to the aquarium, science museum, etc.) and I would have gladly paid an extra $10 per night if that was the rate quoted. But I hate being surprised by bogus stuff like this - it's insulting. The \"destination charge\" supposedly includes internet access, copies, etc. - none of which I used. But it also includes 2 bottles of water per day and a daily newspaper. We stayed 3 nights and got 2 bottles of water and no newspapers. I didn't want a newspaper but if you're going to charge me for one the least you can do is actually give me one. Overall the trip was nice despite the hotel.

At check in, Augustina again treated us like we were some major captain of industry. Our room was not ready yet (got there way early) but they checked our luggage and parked our car for us, then gave us our passes so we could start our vacation early. Augustina explained all the perks that came with our stay, including a game they have for children where they ask hotel staff for coins that the kids accumulate until they have enough for a toy. Great idea!!!! Room was gorgeous. Decorated to perfection. One small problem was that the lid for the toilet was outside the actual bathroom. As we were leaving for dinner, I advised the manager, Andrea, about it. Not to be a bother or that I was upset, but just so I didn't get charged for trashing the bathroom. Andrea was very apologetic and promised to have it taken care of, even though I insisted that it wasn't necessary.

We waited for an hour in the hot lobby with our 4 young children only to be told that the phone call was never made and when it was finally made, we were told the rooms were not available and we would have to stay at Brookshire. 3)Room keys did not work 4) Rooms were dirty,small,housekeeping never came 5) Bellhop and valet are the same guy...hotel is COMPLETELY understaffed...one clerk at desk..and if he moved any slower, would have been going backward... 6) waited almost an hour to get our car out of valet so we could go to dinner *****7)****** OUR CAR WAS STOLEN BY A MAN POSING AS THE VALET WHILE THE \"REAL\" VALET AND FRONT DESK CLERK STOOD BY WATCHING FROM ABOUT 20FEET AWAY**** 8)When the car was stolen, the front desk clerk had to be instructed to please get off his cell phone and call the police 9)The manager arrived in the lobby, and while she was emotional, she was useless as far as helping us or accommodating us in any way. 10) The car was found 6 hours later, totalled. 11) we felt unsafe and terrified in our rooms, and felt very much so that the staff was somehow in on the crime based on thier ambivilant attitude toward us and our situation 12)We were promised a \"limo\" ride home to NJ since the car was totalled. We had a 9 month old infant with us and were told that the \"limo\" would have a carseat available for him 13) waited another hour for the \"limo\" only to realize that it was infact an airport shuttle van with faulty A/C and NO CARSEAT 14) had to drive 2/12 hours with an infant on my lap since no carseat was available. 15) was promised that we would not be charged for the rooms as the hotel's lack of security and competant staff are partly to blame....however, same front desk guy was reluctant to produce a receipt with a zero balance to prove that we were not being charged, AND the charges have shown up on my statement anyway 16) supposed 'higher up\" manager of hotel was USELESS, did NOTHING to help or try to make us feel better about the situation 17)kids are terrified now, emotionally distraught, PLEASE DO NOT STAY AT THIS DANGEROUS HOTEL******", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster,PA", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely the best hotel and customer service I've had in years, a must go to place.\u201d", "Author": "Robin10561", "ReviewID": "UR38958716", "Content": "My husband and I get away very few days a year.

My husband told him about my having a total knee replacement a few months back and I got curb side service. Roland was the nices person, I give him a thumbs up.

It was pretty warm in the room in the mornings and at night. Regardless of how low I turned the thermostat, it remained almost 80 degrees. It seemed like the cool air was reserved for the afternoons, because when I would return from work in the early evening, it was nice and cool.

The hotel is in a perfect location for what we were there for- the Inner Harbor was 1 block away, and Camden Yards only about a 10 minute walk. I booked the trip through Expedia, and called the hotel the week before to confirm our reservation. The desk clerk who answered the phone was not very professional, and was somewhat awkward, but, I didn't really think much of it. I worked for Fairmont hotels for 5 years, and also graduated from one of the best hotel/restaurant management programs in the country, and was constantly trained on customer service. Well, it is obvious to me that the staff at the Brookshire Suites have not been well trained. Check-in went fairly smooth. Behind the front desk area was under construction, and the newly renovated color scheme was hideous. It didn't give off the \"modern\" vibe I think it was going for. It reminded me of the Joker's purple suit from the Batman movie. When we got to our room, it was on the side of the hotel that was about 5 feet away from the abandoned, scary looking brick building next door. The room had a king bed, which I requested, but was so dark, even with the lights on, it felt like we were in a cave. The air conditioner was a floor unit with a huge white exhaust tube that extended to go out the window- again, disgusting. And the mini-bar that was supposed to be \"fully-stocked\", and had a menu on top of it, was completely bare. So, I was unhappy with the room. I went to the front desk and expressed my feelings, and asked to be moved to a different room that wasn't so dark. So, the front desk clerk, without making eye contact with me at all, searched the computer for at least 5 minutes. Then he said that they had \"1\" room, and gave me a key so I could go look at it. Upon entering the room, it was brighter, but about half the size of the other room, with 1 double bed. Now, shouldn't the desk clerk have mentioned that before he sent me all the way up to that room? Also there was a huge stain on the carpet in front of the bed. I returned back to the front desk and asked if there were any OTHER rooms- was told that there was not, and that was that. I did not get the feeling that this man was trained in customer service AT ALL. That day, I had run into a friend who was also visiting Baltimore, and they had heard that there is a train that runs from Camden Yards to the airport, and it only costs $1.75! That is much better than the $35 taxi ride we took from BWI to our hotel. So, that evening I approached the front desk clerk and asked him about it. He had no idea what I was talking about, but attempted to check the internet for me. Again, he made no eye contact with me, but his face was just about plastered to the screen for about 10 minutes. Now, if you work at a hotel in such a location, and it's about a 10 minute walk to the particular train, don't you think you would be knowledgable about it, or have resources to find out about it? No luck there, either. The one redeeming quality of this hotel is the Cloud Club- the breakfast is included in your rate, and it was very good. Also, the cocktail hour reception was wonderful too. Oh, one last thing- I wrote all of this on the comment card in our room, and have not heard any response from the management. It truly is a shame, because if the hotel properly hires staff and trains them well, it wouldn't be so bad.

We mentioned this when we were checking out and the person deducted $50 for each night from our bill. The real surprise was the continental breakfast. It was by far the best complimentary continental breakfast we have ever had. Scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, pancakes, bagels, breads, assorted ceral, fruit, juice and coffee. Just remember if you stay in Baltimore, parking is not cheap....$21 a day in the parking garage that we used adjacent to the hotel. For us, the Brookshire's location (one block from the Inner Harbor) and price (cheaper than many of the other hotels in the Inner Harbor area) made this a great choice for our stay in Baltimore.

Decided to stay at Brookshire for a change as we usually stay elsewhere. Very pleasantly surprised. Only one block from the Inner Harbor (if you stay in the front of the hotel, you have a nice view of it) and a short 10-15 minute walk to Camden Yards. Hotel staff were VERY pleasant and we were very impressed with the service there. Room was fine (a standard queen size bed room) and the included full breakfast made this a real deal. My husband loved it! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Only one small issue - we pre-booked (an pre-paid) through Orbitz. When we checked in, we were told we didn't owe anything because we pre-paid. We didn't charge anything to the room during our stay. The morning we went to check out, we had a bill for $20! When I asked what it was for, the said they had a $9.95 destination fee which covered a newspaper every day (we only got one on one day), bottled water in your room (we never touched it), the \"free\" internet service in your room (didn't bring a computer) and \"complimentatry\" shuttle service to their 2 sister hotels in the area (never used). We decided to let this go since our hotel rate with the included breakfast was such a good deal, but we were disappointed that this was not mentioned on Orbitz or by the front desk when we checked in.

The staff was very friendly, although check-in and check-out were very slow. We had two suites - one was the regular suite and one was an executive suite.

The rooms were clean, but needed some minor repairs - scuffs on the walls, frayed carpeting, etc. We parked across the street because the woman at the front desk said it would be cheaper, but we paid over $30 to self park for less than a day and valet would have been $25. The breakfast was very nice - something for everyone - pancakes, eggs, meat, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt. We booked the \"Discover Down Under\" Aquarium package through Orbitz, which includes two VIP (immediate entry) tickets to the aquarium. VIP tickets were great, because we didn't have to get to the aquarium at any special time, and when we got there, we just walked right in. Also be aware, other hotels offer express entry, but that is not the same thing as immediate entry. I would definitely recommend that you check around for rates. Our room rate through Orbitz was $159, whereas it would have been $239 if we had booked directly with the hotel. Just use the \"check rates\" button on tripadvisor.com, and you might get lucky like we did. I also have to mention the great customer service that we received via email before our trip.

As the agents will tell you on the phone, the ceilings are slightly lower than normal in the rooms but unless you are above 6' it shouldn't be a problem. Some scuff marks on the wall but well maintained. View was of the bulding next door, but you can't ask for much more in a city. The location is amazing- basically a part of inner harbor. There are a lot of parking lots around so don't feel like you must use their valet parking. We thoroughly enjoyed the included free breakfast- hot foods (sausage, french toast, egg) and plenty of pastries and cereals. The dining room is on the top floor, revealing a nice view of the harbor. Another great thing was their wine and beer testing. From 5:30-6:30 on most days they feature local beers and wines in the lobby with light snacks.

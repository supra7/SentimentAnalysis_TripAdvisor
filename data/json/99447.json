The staff was very curtious and helpfull. If you are travelling by plane through JFK, a private cab service will drive you there for 60$. The hotel makes all the arrangements for you upon request. I suggest the private cab service, do not use the \"shared van\" shuttle service....it will take you forever to get to the hotel. When we arrived we used that service and it was not worth the savings. A short walk to the 72nd street subway station, 4 stops you're in Times Square! A short walk to the American Museum of Natural History not to forget Central Park just around the corner. Prices are high considering the size of the room, but you pay for the location.

I will be honest and say the rooms are small almost box like but doesn't mean they weren't comfortable and accomadating, we had lovely hot showers daily, a large tv to watch a host of American tv on, a safe to keep our belongings in, fresh towels and bed linen everyday without fail and enough space to hold all our luggage :) it was also quiet and are air-con worked for us when it become too stuffy in the room :) The final thing I will mention is the lift now I fell in love with its eccentric nature because the lift has a mind of its own, we were on the 8th floor but for some reason it would always stop at the 5th and there would be no-one there and when we were going down the lift would miss us completely - drove my Boyfriend mad but I found it quite amusing how the lift had a mind of its own so be wary but take it in good humor! :D Other than that I loved this hotel and everything it provided it overachieved my expectations and helped us fall in love with the city so we will be the first ones booking this place again whenever we return to the big apple :) - Kara & Howard (England)", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201clovely hotel but small\u201d", "Author": "baltimoremary_12", "ReviewID": "UR126465948", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at this charming hotel near Central Park for one night because it was within walking distance of the Live! with Kelly studio ( I had tickets to the show), and also the Natural History Museum (fantastic museum).

Happy to report none were seen/felt during our stay. Infact we had fresh sheets and a comfy bed. Breakfast: This is a small room and there are issues with getting a table. We got there at 7 most mornings so were ok but one day we got there at 8.30 and there was a small que so we went elsewhere and paid. The brekkie is surprisingly good though. Room size: we were upgraded FOC to a Queen on arrival, I guess this is due to availability so won't always happen. The room was still small but more than adequate for our needs. Our only problem was a noisy radiator in the night which broke up our sleep a little. Other: The location is great, quiet but 100yds from Central Park and 200 Yds from a Downtown subway. The staff are great especially Thomas on reception who was fantastic. He showed genuine interest in us and gave us good advice when asked, good job.

Staying here on West 71st Street means you're in one of NYC's most desirable residential neighborhoods, and not stuffed into Times Square with the tourists, paying twice the money. Central Park is a fabulous city park, with everything to offer, and from the front door of this Comfort Inn you're only a minute or two walk away from a convenient entrance to the park near the famous Dakota apartment building on 72nd Street, and the Strawberry Fields area. Even as a business traveler I enjoyed walking across the park on a sunny February morning, to catch the #6 subway over on the opposite side of the park for a ride downtown. (Of course, convenient bus and subway lines are available without walking across the park, too, but the weather was just too good not to take advantage!) Being here on the upper west side, also means that you have limitless choices for restaurants, movie theaters, museums, and so on. New Yorkers love living in this neighborhood for lots of reasons. As for the hotel itself, it was fine for NYC and especially for the price of about $130 including tax (for a single person). The queensize bed was hugely comfortable, and the WiFi, TV and everything was perfectly fine. The decor was a little dreary, and the wallpaper was a bit dark and scratched up.

My biggest compliment goes to the staff, who are very cheery and helpful, and I often had a great conversation with them after heading back from a day of touring and a good dinner. The rooms are OK, but they are relatively small. I got two separate rooms due to splitting the duration of the stay, and the first room was better than the second one. However, I didn't travel to NYC to spend my time in hotel rooms, so I slept, looked at some emails, washed, had breakfast, then went out for the day, so CICPW served it's purpose. The wifi is quite strong throughout the hotel, and my phone & laptop didn't have any outages that I recall when in wifi range. The location is pretty good - about 2-3 minutes walk from the 72nd St Subway stop. The breakfast is a buffet, not something I am a fan of, so I stuck to packeted cereal and juice. I prefer they offer you the meal with the room, but you can pick from a menu what you want and the chef prepares it.

Our TV was broken so we couldn't use the channel guide, nor select a movie from pay-per-view. The hotel promised a \"hot breakfast\" which consisted of white bread and untoasted english muffins which you had to toast yourself and waffle mix. ? The kitchen or \"cafe\" was small, cramped, and dirty. I have NEVER written a bad review in my life but hope this will help at least one person decide NOT to book this hotel.

The breakfast room is also very small and you can find yourself waiting a while for a table if you get there at the wrong time. The hotel is perfectly located with most of the major NY sites being within walking distance.

One recommendation is to ask for a room with two beds. The front desk clerk recommended it, although we are married he said it had more room, and he was right.

The breakfast is good and plentiful to start the day, facility is clean, and staff is friendly. Neighborhood is quiet and safe. Local shopping and restaurants are a block away.

If money isn't an issue and room size is, may want to look elsewhere. As any review for any hotel in Manhattan will state, rooms in NYC are going to be smaller than you may have experienced elsewhere. If you are visiting the city for a short stay, have friends in this area and need a place to stay, or you are traveling with no more than one-two other adults or teens, then I saw no reason you would not be comfortable.

I knew that the room would be small (based on many reviews that I had read) so when we got up to our room and it was TINY I wasn't surprised. It was clean and suited our needs well enough however the bed seemed like a really, really small queen. The next day we were looking at a map of the hotel and noticed that our room was actually a double....so I went down to the front desk to ask what type of room we were given. The nice man (same one as before) at the front desk said that we had a double. I quickly pulled out the printed copy of my reservation which showed a queen room. He said \"the price on there isn't a queen room but a lower cost double\" We went back and forth for a bit and eventually he said that they had a software change over the summer and that could have caused the problem and that I should talk to the assistant manager in the morning when I checked out. So, the next morning when I was checking out I spoke with the manager and after a bit of a discussion she lowered the rate of our room by $10 a night. I was happy enough with that to come back and stay there again....although next time I will confirm when I check in that the room I'm getting is the room type I reserved. Breakfast was good and plentiful however the layout is really weird and people were bumping into each other.

The room at the Comfort Inn was very clean, and very safe. The breakfast room was small, but again - with so many options of places to eat in NYC, why would you eat in the hotel? We grabbed a small box of cereal to go and were thrilled it was something to snack on until we found the perfect new place to try for lunch.

(there is also a \"Gym\" downstairs, its basically a small room with two equipments, but dont let this put you off...who really exercises on Holiday?!! no-one used it the whole time we were there.) the Location is perfect!!, right near cenral park and there is a subway on the next street and a another few blocks away... its far enough from the busy, chaos and noise of Times Square but close enough by subway. lastly, the staff were soo nice and helpful, (always greet you when you leave and come back) especially Thomas, very helpful! highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back!!

We pre-booked a room for 3 people, non smoking with easy accesibility as one party was elderly and di not walk well. We called to confirm and found they had given us a smoking room, as an asthmatic not possible. They then said they would 'upgrade' us for free instead. When we got there they had 2 bookings for us, one for the smoking room and one for the upgrade, The upgrade consisted of a 12th floor room with a King size bed and a foldaway bed that you had to leave in the hallway when not using as there wasn;t any room for it in the room. We ended up having to move all the furniture around, which they refused to help us do at the hotel, and play a Tetris game each daye with the bed, our cases and a massive black leather chair which we wanted removed, again they wouldn;t do. I did check out the smoking room which stank of smoke and had a single and 'double' bed - the double would not have fitted 2 people as was tiny. The hotel only has one very slow lift so at times we waited downstairs for 10-15 minutes to get up to the 12th floor. I ended up walking down when on my own as was quicker. Breakfast was miserable in a tiny room with rubbish chairs and not enough room for more than 15 people at a time. The food was not very exciting and I didn;t bother after the first day, instead going out to Starbucks round the corner. The bathroom was minute with a child sized bath, they provided shampoo but no shower gel(?) The toilet flooded in the middle of the night on 2 different occassions and they did come and unblock it right away but still shouldn't have occured. Wi-fi was free but didn;t work everywhere in our room so had to sit in a corner to use it. The only good thing was the location which was amazing. Upper West side is great, there's a subway right next door and another 2 blocks away as well as the Park being right next to the hotel.

I think i can also say i've never been entirely positive about a hotel either. Everywhere you stay you'll find the good and the bad. The rooms in this hotel are small, but the hotel is in New York City - one of the most densely populated places in the world. It's also in one of the most vibrant cities in the world, so i can't imagine why you'd be spending a large amount of time in the room. The rooms are small, with no fridge, but with free wi-fi and, in our case, an oddly positioned television. The bathrooms are also snug and the major complaint has to be the muted glass wall that separates the bathroom from the rest of the well, offering very little privacy. There is, to be honest, not a lot of room left after you bring in your suitcases and yourselves. But if you're sensible and arrange everything to suit, you can get by. But the room isn't everything. The service is great. The desk staff were friendly and accommodating (especially after we locked the key in the room) and the people looking after the breakfast area certainly did their best to make everyone comfortable. The included breakfast has a good, standard assortment and probably the best possible considering the cosy dining room. There are only a half-dozen tables and it can be a struggle for space, but everyone makes-do with the assistance of the staff. It's not glamorous, but i don't think any reasonable person can complain when offered cereals, waffles, toast, bagels, pastries, fruit, yoghurt and more, with no limit. Everyone wants to be in a nice, safe neighbourhood with easy access to the city and that's probably what this is. It's almost suburban, with 250m to trains in either direction, as well as to Central Park. You can walk to Columbus Circle, or even Times Square if you're game.

The free breakfast is a superb bonus, though we found that we started noticing how 'beige' all the food was after having eaten it for a week. Healthier options are available in the way of fruit, yogurt, wholemeal bread and cereal... but you WILL find yourself indulging in the waffle making machine and muffins at least once during your time there! Only one negative would be the walls in our room (not sure if it applies to all the rooms but ours was like this). It appears that when the hotel put in the air-conditioning systems (as an afterthought it would seem) they didn't seal the gaps up and as such we could feel a draft coming from the wall! In fact we could see several small holes around the aircon unit where it hadn't been filled!

The air conditioner was very loud, which made sleeping at night difficult. There was only one elevator, which was very small and extremely slow. We stayed on the 9th floor and it was faster to walk up and down the stairs, which we did. The hotel staff was friendly. The biggest strength for this hotel is its location. It is located between two subway lines (Red and Blue lines) and close to multiple bus lines as well. The hotel is situated near convenience stores and a variety of restaurants on Columbus Ave. It is also footsteps from Central Park, which let us go for a walk any time we wanted.

The hotel moved us to another room for the final night - they were pretty casual about it and we had the impression this was pretty routine. We're not sure if there were bugs in the second room - I did have more bites the next day but we read that it could take a few days for the bites to emerge. We put all our luggage for the final night in the bathtub - assuming that this was the safest place. Since getting home we left all the luggage on our back porch - fortunately it is very cold so we're hoping any hitchhiking bugs and eggs will freeze into oblivion. As an extra precaution we are bringing stuff in from the cold and putting it in the dryer at a high temperature - since the clothes are dry, the high heat doesn't seem to affect them but we're hoping that the freeze-roast approach kills any New York bugs.

Really?\" So, my mom headed to town to help me with a little project. We know each other well enough by now to know that we like each other more with distance. So, having her stay with me in my (admittedly large, but still a) studio apartment isn't ideal. Normally, she rents an apartment, but her favorite was booked. So, I went hotel searching. Everyone knows that hotels in NYC are insane. I am thrilled that, as a NYC resident, I don't have to pay for them or even think about them most times. Everything was more crazily priced than normal this time. Then I stumbled upon this Comfort Inn. We all know Comfort Inn. It's a mid-range, reasonably priced hotel. I stayed in them with the folks on many a family vacation. It's not luxury, but it's predictable. And with a AAA discount, it was about as tolerable as you'll get in NYC for four nights. And it's not a bad location either...Upper West Side, steps from Central Park and a few more to Lincoln Center, etc., near the C, B, and 1 trains, etc., etc., etc. Yes, folks have said it before. The rooms are TINY...and a half. Seriously, my college dorm rooms were bigger. The full sized bed takes up the bulk of it. However, there's a TV atop a dresser, little chair squeezed in, nightstand, and a tiny bathroom. However, it's all quite clean. And really? Who comes to NYC to spend tons of time in their hotel room? There's a free continental breakfast, tiny workout room, and the wifi is reliable. How do I know? I know because I am on the internet now in the room. I know, I know. You're asking, \"Soubrettina, why are you staying in your mom's miniature hotel room?\" And that leads me to the last reason why I like this place. You see, mom was supposed to stay for four nights. However, she fell, ended up in the hospital, and busted up her kneecap. And here we are with her in an immobilizer on her right knee. I'm spending the night and will be getting her to a rebooked flight out of LGA tomorrow. But wait...what about those three other nights she's supposed to stay? You see, the hotel staff here is great. They adjusted her reservation with no fine and no early checkout/change fee...no questions asked. So, if you're looking for a place in the city on a budget (Don't forget the AAA discount, if you're a member!) and don't need fancy frills (seriously), think about the old, reliable, hotel chain of your family road trips past.

We entered the room and saw it had not been cleaned. We walked around the room and found personal belongings (cell phone) and realized the guest had not checked out. We reported this to the front desk and were sent to a different room.

We tried to take a nap but couldn't sleep because the pipes in the bathroom were rattling each time a different guest used their water. There was a problem with drainage in the shower; I stood in water up to my ankles while showering. While waiting in the lobby for a friend, I witnessed a fight amongst the front desk staff. A woman said to a man \"don't you dare raise your hand at me like that again. You are not my boss\" and she stormed out of the lobby onto the street. Other arguments between them were witnesssed during the stay. Lastly, we asked the front desk when breakfast coffee would be available because we were starting our day really early at approximately 5am. We were told breakfast is not available that early, but the front desk staff member offered to make coffee and provide breakast pastries to accomodate us. The next morning, the front desk was left vacant and the breakfast area was dark. We entered the room in hopes that something would be available. We only had 5 minutes to spare. We found the front desk staff person sleeping in the breakfast area. We asked for coffee and he said he could provide juice instead.

Would recommend!\u201d", "Author": "AH85", "ReviewID": "UR56014350", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews about this hotel I was a little nervous about what we were going to encounter. However, we had a great experience at the Comfort Inn Hotel. The first point to note is that the rooms are small and if you want a luxurious and spacious room then you are not going to get it at this hotel and you will have to pay a lot more money. I found that the cost of this hotel is very reasonable and I was told that generally the hotel rooms in NYC tend to be on the smaller size so I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really surprised. We only used the hotel room as a place to sleep so it was perfect for us as it was clean, tidy and the beds were comfortable. We did find that the rooms were very hot but it was easy to control the central heating and there was a fan if you needed it. One reason we thought that the rooms were on the smaller size was because the room had an en-suite bathroom. Apparently, this is quite rare in hotels in NY and shared bathrooms tend to be the norm, especially at this price. Not sure how true this is as we have only stayed in one hotel but when we were booking our holiday a lot of the hotels didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really mention bathroom facilities and hinted at shared bathrooms. Just one thing to look out for if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to share a bathroom! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with the rest of the hotel, it was clean, the staff were friendly and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noisy. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really comment... We found that the hotel was really conveniently located. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the very centre of Manhattan but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very far away. About 15-20 mins walk at a normal pace, not stopping to Times Square and 30-40mins to the Empire State building. We found that hotels that were more centrally located were at least \u00c2\u00a3100 more expensive. The hotel was only 2 blocks away from a subway station which we used a lot. One thing I will say is don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to use the subway. It is clean and easy to understand. We were told not to use it very late at night so the latest we used it is 1.30-11ish and it was still quite busy so we felt quite safe. You can buy an unlimited day ticket which allows you to ride anywhere and is really good value for money. We paid approx $8 per day. To sum, if you are going to NYC and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend a fortune on a hotel and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on spending much time in your hotel room this hotel is for you. If you want a luxurious hotel room then you will have to accept that you will need to pay more.

Hot water tends to run out in the mornings, so get up early or shower the night before. 3. Be prepared to wait for the elevator or take the stairs.

There was so little space around the bed, that if you sat on the edge of the bed and bent over to tie your shoes, you would hit your head on the wall. There was almost zero closet space. The air conditioner blew air, but not cold air, despite using the max cool setting. The bathroom had only a shower stall, not a bathtub, which I didn't think would affect me, as I normally take showers and not baths, but the confined space meant you often banged your elbows and knees on the walls of the shower. The shelf in the bathroom was only 4 inches deep, and inclined down as it went away from the wall, so things routinely fell off that shelf. The sink was so narrow that when you bend over to brush your teeth, you hit your head on the mirror, which jostled the shelf, which meant everything on the shell fell off.

The hotel is not THAT bad! Yes, it is very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccozy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but it still offers the basic amenities of any other hotel. There is too much to do in New York City to be lounging in the room anyway! The front desk staff is very nice and accommodating; we booked a smoking room and were given a non-smoking room at check-in. They gladly switched our room and all was well. They even offered to help move our luggage for us. The only real complaint we had with the room was the heating. It is hot water heating and was REALLY noisy at certain times of day when air would get trapped in the pipes. It sounded like someone was banging a wrench on the pipes for about 5 minutes at a time. Not so fun in the middle of the night that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for sure. Other than that, our room was cleaned everyday and everything was replenished appropriately. We stayed on the top floor and the elevator didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take too long to reach us most times. A large group of young girls checked in during our stay which slowed the elevator down a little bit but not enough that we were forced to take the stairs. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat breakfast at the hotel partly because the breakfast room was so tiny (tables were always full) and partly because we left early every morning for tours so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything about the food. Though we did find the lady that puts everything out in the morning pretty rude. Coffee and tea are served around the clock in that room and when we went in on our last morning to grab coffee before leaving for the airport she purposely stood in our way with her back to us and kept looking at her watch as if to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not time yet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She was very friendly to the next person that walked into the breakfast room when breakfast officially started which we were a little put off by. The hotel is in a GREAT location- a very brief walk to 2 different subway stations, central park is at the end of the street, there are quite a few different restaurants and markets close by on Columbus, Broadway, and the surrounding area. We even walked to Times Square on 2 separate occasions and it took us about 25 minutes. We thought it was neat to be a block away from Yoko Ono and down the street from Madonna. There is a great little restaurant at the corner called Big Nicks. We ate there on 2 separate occasions and really enjoyed ourselves. We recommend both the burgers and the pizza. The portions are HUGE and well worth the reasonable price tag. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend the Arte Caf\u00c3\u00a9 on W 73rd street. We received some bread that I think was supposed to be served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar but we never did receive the vinegar. I ordered a glass of wine and there was a bunch of little pieces of cork in it. The chicken parm was mediocre and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really feel it was worth $18 a plate. Sex and the City fans will be happy to know that there is a Magnolia Bakery and a Gray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Papaya within walking distance of the hotel. They are not the original locations from the show but if you just want to try them, these locations will do. NYC Vacation Packages is a great place to purchase tickets from. They offer all sorts of packages and tickets to just about everything New York has to offer. The only downside is that they charge $29 extra to have the tickets delivered to your hotel if you do not live in the US and we would have preferred to pick them up instead but in the end it was nice to have them when we got to the hotel. It truly is a time saver! The Statue of Liberty escorted tour was pretty good. This was our first time in NYC and will definitely not be our last!

Arriving at the hotel at around 10 pm, I was met by a very 80s style lobby and some reasonably friendly staff. One lift is shared by cleaners, staff and guests so you can't be in too much of a hurry to get up or down the 12 or so floors. A quick slide of the keycard, the door opens and I am met by one of the smallest rooms i have every stayed in. A single bed barerly fit in the room. Next to the bed was a tiny bedside table with a lamp that was disconnected. By the side of the door was a 3 drawer cupboard with a nice flat screen TV on it. Bathroom was horrendous though. The toilet was almost under the sink and considering i am not a small person, I found it very hard to use comfortably. Not something you even consider thinking about before booking a room!

Only half a block away is Central Park and you have 2 subway stations within 5 minutes walk. Complimentary breakfast offered was a bit of a soup kitchen and not very pleasant and the major gripe i have about the place (besides the tiny room) was that almost every night i had to have my key card replaced. After a whole day of walking, I would head up to my room but would have to head back down again due to the card not working. Management said this was because i had a weekly subway ticket that \"demagnitised\" their card. I hardly beleieve this to be true.

We had our grandson with us so we booked this because the room was advertised as having a double bed and a single bed. It had a single bed in a room with a small window taken up by the air conditioner and a double bed in another room that was pushed up against the wall so that you could get out of bed to go the bathroom. There was no place to put your luggage to unpack(which was useless because there was no place to put your clothes). Tiny bathroom and that was it. We got our room changed to a corner room with lots of windows and used a rollaway for our grandson. If they had not had this I would have left the hotel..even though it was midnight!! One small elevator for 14 floors..took forever to go anywhere. We were on the 12th floor and I am handicapped so we had to wait for it. Last night they did not make up our room. Manager offered me a 10% discount. I said \"wow..that much!\" He then said I would get no discount at all. He was the rudest manager I have ever encountered at any hotel. He is also the first manager I have ever reported to the chain. They said they called a cab that would arrive in 7 minutes and 30 minutes later a private limo shows up and offers to take us to our destination for twice the price we paid all week end for a cab. The staffer then argued with me and told me it would cost the same in a cab!! The guest service coordinator tried very hard to smooth over all the problems, but the manager made it impossible.

Our class was also spread throughout the entire hotel because there was about 8 rooms on each floor. Now for the rooms. They were clean if you ignore the small blood stains beside your bed. They were safe if you ignore windows blowing open randomly at night. They were private if you didn't make a sound and like your shower visible from the outside. They were decorated where it made you feel nice and cozy. We will give them that. They were big if you are the size of a ant. Speaking of bugs, you might see a few in the bathroom or even on the bed. By the way, the bathroom is smaller than my pinky finger. When you walk in the sink, shower curtain, toilertand door is touching you on all side.

I mentioned my issues in the morning (and hadn't allowed them an opportunity to address) and they gave me a bit off the rate....wasn't expecting or asking for that. My room was clean and I felt very safe. So good people, clean room, safe. What's not right? It's the value. I paid $314. Now I now with the bad dollar, this is probably a decent value for non-US people. But this hotel is not worth this price..It's a $200 room max. It's the combination of little things. The bathroom is very small. I could put my back against the shower wall and touch the sink with my foot. I estimate the bathroom to be about 2 feet deep by 8 feet long. In that area you have a toilet, mini sink, and small shower. Since the hotel is older, it took a long time for the warm water to get up to the higher floors...and since you can't turn on the shower without getting wet..that's cold! And the water sprays out of the shower because the shower is so small. The steam heat was off when I got there, so the room was quite cold. I turned on the register..and lots of noise. Like a whistling tea kettle. Woke me up at 4 am. I had a choice...turn off the heat or try to sleep while the \"tea-kettle\" was going. The bed was comfortable, big...which took up most of the room..and the pillows were good (for this range of hotel.) Slow, small elevator. Didn't get to try the breakfast as I had to leave before it started. The wireless connection was not very strong and I was only able to use for about 10 minutes before it disconnected and I couldn't get back on. The in-room coffee maker didn't work. There is an in room safe, ironing board, and hair dryer. The blinds were a bit tattered. Windows didn't shut enough to latch...which wouldn't normally concern me on a higher floor, but there is a construction scaffold outside so it did cause me some pause. (but no lost sleep.) You hear some street noise, but since the hotel is back off of Central Park West, it's not too bad. So my biggest complaint is the overall value. It's a solid 2 star hotel, but to charge $314, even in NYC, near Central Park on the Upper West Side..is overboard.

When I entered the room it was so tiny my knees hit the sink while going to the bathroom, but it's New York, that's pretty much what I expected, and the door to my room didn't properly lock. Once I was settled and after I paid for the room, I got called back down to the front desk to be told it was Valentine's Day Weekend and my rates changed, so I had to pay more. Whatever I was just going with the flow and decided to shrug it off because I was in New York. So I went out exploring and when I returned later that night, I found hundreds of ants all over the room, in the drawers, everywhere. They must have been attracted to something I brought but there was no way I was staying in that room. So I complaned to the front desk and they moved me into a queen size room, which was much nicer than my previous room, and kind of made up for the problem. But I was still paranoid. During the night the heater makes the most awful noises, so bad that I could hardly sleep and had to put on headphones to drown it out, but there was not much street noise.

So if they promise you a view of the street, I'd ask them if that is still through the builders netting, ladders and scaffolding. If that's not important to you, it's a reasonable choice. If it is important to you however, suggest you check before pressing the 'book now' button.

Hopefully, the room I stayed in was pre-renovation. If _that_ was renovated, oy vey. My #1 complaint was lack of heat. It was cold and drafty. I slept in sweatpants, a sweater and a hat. Admittedly, I like it fairly warm, so most normal humans will probably not find it as cold as I did. When I was leaving this morning, I noticed another room being cleaned and there was one of those oil-filled electric radiators there. So I'm assuming if you complain to the front desk, they'll give you an electric heater. My #2 complaint is that the room was quite scuzzy. The carpet was dirty and ratty, as was the desk chair. I put a bath towel over the chair before sitting on it. My #3 complaint was the noise the heat made. It is steam heat, and although the radiator didn't provide a great deal of heat, it sure provided a great deal of noise. If you've never experienced bad steam heat, it sounds approximately like someone beating on a pipe with a hammer. Not constantly, but several minutes every hour or so when the \"heat\" comes on. Also, note that the beds are double/full, not queen (at least in the two rooms I saw). I think that most of the rooms are way too small to accommodate a queen. I would say that outside of Manhattan this would be the approximate equivalent of a cheap motel on an old highway that's been replaced by an interstate. It's relatively inexpensive, but not nearly inexpensive enough.

As we were spending several days in New York, we originally thought the $200 a night room rate was a bargain. On entering the hotel, we felt it was dingy and dark. The lobby furniture if you can call it a lobby was worn and threadbare. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. Sam who was the Valet/ conceierge/etc.etc. seemed very helpful at first. Getting our luggage in the tiny elevator was no easy task. The hallways upstairs were extremely narrow and dark. Our room had to be the worst we had ever stayed in. It was dark and postage stamp small. We could barely get our luggage in there. We were tripping over the luggage constantly. The furniture was old and scratchy, the bedsheets so thin that in certain places they had holes in them. The minutature bathroom was so small you could barely close the door. The shower curtain had a very dirty smell to it. We finally left for the day dreading to come back to the room. I will tell you that the area was absolutely fantastic!!! Less than a block from Central Park. The Dakota apartment building was right around the corner and subway station less than a block away. The are great restaurants a block or two away on Columbus street. This was a residential area, therefore it was pretty quiet. The following morning, we decided we did not want to stay there another night. After a free continental breakfast at the hotel which was the biggest perk,( It is hard to find a hotel in New York with a free breakfast) we asked Sam to call us a cab. (BIG MISTAKE) An unmetered cab pulled up and took us to our new destination on East 81st st. 10 or 12 blocks away and the cabbie charged us $45.00 at would have been probably a $12.00 cab ride with a metered cab. We were so upset, we did not even give the cabdriver a tip. We are usually considered big tippers.

I was concerned about the safety of my car and myself. It is the biggest facility in the United States that Motel 6 has, I was told by the clerk. The bed was acceptable, but not great. The faucet in the bathroom sprayed water all over the place, and the floors were just so so as far as being clean. The doors had dents in them as if someone had tried to kick them in. The water pressure was great in the shower!! TV sound would not go except on a few chanels so could not watch TV stations I wanted to watch w/o disturbing other guests. I did not use the pools or other facalities. I would NOT recommend staying at this motel 6. There is one closer to Metro Center that looks smaller and nicer from the outside, that one might want to try, and the prices appear to be the same. I picked this hotel originaly because it was close to the place I needed to be.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStay away from this dump\u201d", "Author": "erezn", "ReviewID": "UR123797508", "Content": "I was looking for a place to sleep nearby the airport.

Got in late and was trying to stay a bit outside downtown Phoenix to be on the safe side. I didn't know the area and wasn't even expecting much when I arrived. The room was shabby. When I went to sleep, I was awoken by a phone call from whom I thought was a Motel 6 staff member telling me the motel had an emergency and had to be evacuated, to stay calm and that police would come evacuate me. He went through all the protocols and told me the story of a madman waving a knife, threatening to rape and kill people. I was half asleep, scrambling to get my contacts in and getting ready for the police to come. He then got dramatic and said that the man just broke into a room and to bang on the walls to flush him out and to alert the police where to go. I did not. Then he said, oh my GOD, ma'm, bang on your door, NOW, as if the guy was about to bust in my room. I was petrified and envisioned my death. He then said the police arrived and he'd transfer me to another staff member who would stay w me until the police escorted me out. This staff member had no clue what I was taking about, and the guy was still on the line saying, \"cha cha cha.\" I realized it was a scam but was absolutely terrified as a single woman that this sicko would play out his fantasy that night and come kill me, as he already called and knew my room #! I basically had post traumatic stress at this point and went to the front office where I found toothless, seemingly uneducated employees who were not phased. They informed me that he calls every night and seemed ok with this. There was an elderly man who appeared to be a drug addict, possibly the franchisee. He said the only problem I'd have is if I brought a problem with me, implying I was a prostitute or addict. They seemed uninterested in relocating me to another Motel 6 but did refund me for the night. Against my better judgment, I lay in bed with the lights, my clothes and shoes on the rest of the night. When I woke up the next morning, I realized the area was run down and heard it had high crime. I am lucky to be here to write this review and told myself I'd never travel alone again or stay at a Motel 6 after this.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vantaa", "Title": "\u201cNoisy room, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "HannuVantaalta", "ReviewID": "UR79924178", "Content": "OK, you can't really expect anything fancy for $30, but somehow I did expect little more.

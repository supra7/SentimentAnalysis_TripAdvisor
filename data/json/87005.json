His unit had recently been renovated and was nicely furnished, with room to sleep 4 (2 adults and 2 little kids on a queen bed and convertible sofabed) as I had requested. I arrived after a full day of travel and was shown a run-down room with only one bed for 2 people. I was not happy.Though individually owned, the condo was managed by Marc Resorts, and they switched me from the unit I rented (which was specifically noted on the reservation) to the dump they showed me for some reason that they couldn't explain and couldn't remedy because someone else was already in the unit I had rented and was staying for another 2 weeks. The compromise solution was to put me in yet another unit that did sleep 4 (just barely--on two double beds with ill-fitting sheets) but was also pretty run-down. This accommodation came only after considerable pressure put to Marc Resorts and the owner of the unit I rented.I knew that the Diamond Head Beach Hotel was a property of individually owned condos of varying quality, but thought to escape the bad experiences of some others by getting a specific unit. Apparently my mistake. I did press for some compensation for my considerable troubles and got a 20% discount/refund, which took away some of the bad feelings. The location is ideal for families, close to the beach, park, and the bustle of Waikiki if you want it, but without the noise and general clamor.

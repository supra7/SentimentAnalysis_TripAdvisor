It was in a great location - within steps of the subway, and many restaurants and coffee shops, and within 5 minutes of Times Square. This made it so easy to get around! It is also conveniently located beside the theater where The Book of Mormon is playing - that came in handy, since all we had to do is walk out the door to the hotel and we were in our seats in the theater in minutes. The reviews are correct that the rooms are VERY small. However, I found our room to be fully functional. The bathroom was huge - we had no problems getting ready together. Also, all the built-ins helped maximize space. When I saw pictures of the decor in the rooms I had my doubts, but I found myself totally charmed when I saw it in person. It's definitely not the decor of your average boring hotel room, with the matching patterned wall paper, bedspread, headboard, and curtains! Our view wasn't great - we seemed to look out onto this dark courtyard space between the two sides of the building, but I actually kind of loved being able to look out and see the pigeons out there. I think they could probably stand to upgrade the TVs they have in their rooms, but on the other hand, I'm not even sure the rooms could fit bigger flat screen TVs! This was my third time in NYC and this was by far the best hotel I've stayed in on my budget.

This was my first trip to NYC, my husband's 2nd. We wanted to be near Times Square, but found the prices of most hotels out of our budget. We stayed 4 nights, arriving on a Thursday and leaving on a Monday. Our room was tiny, but again we expected that. My husband is 6'4 and could touch both walls of the room. The bathroom was big enough for one of us to get ready comfortably. There was a leak around the shower that caused a small puddle to develop - we threw a towel on it. There was a nice sized flat screen TV - we watched SNL on Saturday while Jimmy Fallon was there, which was fun! We were on the 4th floor - that elevator is VERY tiny. So if you would like to avoid it altogether, ask for a lower level floor. The location is the best! When we wanted Starbucks, we popped out of our hotel and walked down 2 blocks to the one on Times Square! When we went out to see Wicked on Broadway our first night there, we just waltzed down the street to the Gerschwin. We took a short walk to Central Park one day, and a longer warlk down 5th Ave. another day. Loved it. We were in the middle of it all, sort of tucked away in this little hotel that I considered to give us the full \"New York\" experience.

Overall, I am glad we stayed here. For off broadway shows, this was VERY close to many theaters (two doors down from one of them). Just about everything was walking distance, especially some 'big ticket' items such as Rockefeller Center, Times Square (we only wandered what seemed to be a couple blocks and looked up and realized we were in the middle of Times Square), Hard Rock, etc. We walked to Macy's and the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings though they are a bit further of a walk.To get to Battery Park/Castle Clinton/South Ferry which gets you to the Statue of Liberty, we took the 1 subway and the entrance was a block up and a block over from the hotel and took us right to the South Ferry in less than 1/2 hour. It was very convenient. Now for the hotel...it served its purpose. The room with 1 queen bed was sufficient - not big, but we weren't fighting each other for space. They even fit a small table, chair and settee that I believe could have been unfolded and used as a single sleeper. There was some dark spots in the corners of the shower and the mirror was cracked. This may sound nightmarish, but it really wasn't. The hair dryer in the room didn't work but within 15 minutes of reporting it, someone came to the room and replaced it.

I would not stay again - however, this hotel is probably a good option for some. If you are from Europe (especially Eastern Europe) and want an affordable tourist class hotel in Mid-town - you probably will like this place. I have traveled a lot in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and I have a high tolerance for un-impressive hotels. This hotel is similar to what I would expect from a budget hotel in London or Paris (though I would expect those properties to be more clean). When I travel in the US, I have different expectations. First - the good. 1. Location, location and location. The spot is perfect for tourist wanting to explore time sq, walk to central park or shop Harold Sq. It is close to metro stops, small grocery stores for an affordable meal, and near deli's and pizza places. 2. The price. I paid $250 per night - it is nearly impossible to find something else for this rate in mid-town. 3. The staff. Other reviews have stated the staff were rude and wanted lots of tips. I did not deal with the staff much, but when I did, I found them to be nice and helpful. I did not tip any of the hotel staff at anytime and no one ever hinted that they expected a tip (I did leave a tip for the maid, but I did this without being asked and because I felt bad for the maid staff as they clearly work very hard). The Bad (why I would not go back): 1. The room is just really too small. Luckily I only had one small bag, so I was able to make the room work. But most Americans travel with large bags and I don't know where I would have put my bag if I had brought a larger bag with me. 2. There was really no window within the room. Technically, there is a window, but it looks out onto a brick wall a few feet away. So, there is little to no natural light. There is also no way to circulate any air into the small room other than through a window shaker AC unit. The AC unit made a ton of noise and filled the room with the smell of urine when it was raining (my guess is that people are urinating in the alley below and the rain is activating the urine smell which the AC unit is then pulling into the room. When it was not raining the AC unit was fine, but when it rained I could not tolerate the smell and had to turn it off). 3. The room and hallways are dirty. This is the issue that will keep me away. I found it difficult to determine if my feeling that the hotel was dirty was based on the fact that the hotel is very worn down or if it was actually unclean. I am still not sure which is correct and my best guess is that it is a combination of the two. The carpets are worn and stained, the wall paper is torn and stained, the floors are uneven, there are random holes in the ceilings (not in my room, but in hallways and elevator). I don't know how a hotel cannot plan to replace its carpet and wallpaper/paint every 2 to 3 years - having people coming and going requires an investment in the property year after year and the owners have neglected the property for too long. I do think the maid service worked really hard to try and clean the place, but there is only so much they can do. If you can't afford $50.00 more per night for better hotel options than you can probably make this place work, but if you can swing spending a little more, I would, and I will.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cMayfair Hotel near Times Sq.\u201d", "Author": "VadimBelousov", "ReviewID": "UR119382123", "Content": "Typical hotel, just at the center of Theater District, 100 m away from Times Sq. and Broadway.

Make sure to carry a spare footware, as the floor mats are not really clean. Ac quite noisy. Hotel staff, friendly, but you need to tip them regularly. The hotel charges for maintenance service, fuel and surcharge which we found quite strange. So get the room cleaned everyday because you are pating for it. While checking-out, hotel staff will suggest you a taxi service from their end to the airport (ours JFK), we got a limo, but make sure to verify prices with the hotel and the driver before you board. Its usually $50 to JFK, but we believed what the hotel staff said and had a bit of haggling to do at the airport, as the driver said it was $65. Hotel so close to Times Square. Don't miss the Italian restaurant next to the hotel as you turn right at the exit, pricey, but really good.

It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. My first room was tiny and was fine for me but as a double room not enough room for two people.However this was not an issue. First impression apart from the size was ok, however I was not alone as I was accompanied by a mouse emerging from the en suite. My immediate complaint was treated with an upgrade to another room. During the move however it was clear there was more than one mouse as the corridors revealed yet more of the scampering creatures. My upgraded room again initially looked ok but further investigation revealed bare wires hanging from the AC system. The fire alarm was hanging from the ceiling with the wires exposed and two of the concealed ceiling lights immediately above the pillows on the bed were unprotected. Wall lights were novel as they revolved 180 degrees and not fixed to the wall correctly. The bathroom wall lights were absolutely filthy with grease and dust and obviously had not seen a cloth in months. The 'mouse' saga had not ended as you could hear them scratching, on the floor above, in the skirting boards and goodness knows where throughout the night. There are absolutely no facilities for any refreshments, a pokey and unstable lift and stained wallpaper peeling off the walls on the staircases and corridors. The staff were amicable but not friendly.......images of the Bates Motel in Psycho......I didn't feel safe at all. Where was the Restaurant that was advertised? When I asked about somewhere for a cup of coffee or breakfast the following morning I was directed to a very 'seedy' looking cafe around the corner that looked equally as run down as the hotel. My bill was more than I initially signed for when I checked in.......along with the usual American taxes which I'm sure were inflated.....was wait for this....a fuel charge for heating and lighting. What! I refused to sign anything on check out expecting some sort of compensation for the discomfort I had endured during the overnight stay. They said I could contact the manager during the week to discuss the matter. Although I was at sea I made ship to shore calls but was told he was not on the premises. Expecting to negotiate a price before any money was taken from my bank account to my horror the money was extracted from my account within 3 days (there was a weekend in between). Money as far as I'm concerned taken from my account under false pretences as I had not signed the relevant paperwork. I am of course looking at legal advice unless the 'manager' whoever he is.....an Ed Brown I believe.......comes up with another solution once he receives my letter. My last attempt at contacting this 'elusive' figure will be by letter. Never available on the phone....no email address, whoever heard of a business without an email address and never at the hotel in person. Odd! Does this person exist? As far as I'm concerned the hotel should be condemned. It is totally misrepresented in its advertising and should undergo immediate inspection. The sad thing is that it is in a superb location and has the potential to be a first rate small and friendly hotel.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "Shawn-YYZ", "ReviewID": "UR99468887", "Content": "I travel a lot, and stay in hotels all over the world.

Negatives: - Tiny room with barely enough room to walk around the bed. You may not get a view out the window either. - Wireless Internet had poor reception in my room. - One small elevator. - Some public areas of the hotel need work (carpet tattered, some walls need painting, etc.). - No room service or onsite restaurant (but you're in Times Square and many restaurants will deliver there, and you're right around the corner from many good places to eat).

We knew what we were getting into, an older, smaller hotel without the amenities of the chains. We essentially got exactly what we were looking for, great location, great rate (considering it was an event weekend in NYC). The hotel is older and the halwaysbeing narrow and elevator being small and slow are accurate, who cares?? We had a king room with the pull out chair and those rooms are at the front of the hotel, that means street noise can be expected. Room was clean, bathroom was clean and was of good size. Location was great, a couple minute walk to anywhere. My negatives were that the tv remote also controlled the AC/Heat unit so if you changed the channel you were changing the settings on the unit as well. Funny, and easly cured by changing the channel at the tv itself. The issue with that was when it turned the heat on and the heat smell that is associated with heaters sets off the smoke alarm. Then at 3am the first night the heat kicked on automatically which triggered the smoke alarm again, that wasn't funny, would have been worse if it happen on race morning. I solved that problem by unplugging the Heater/AC, the room temp was fine and we didn't need either, I'd think in the middle of winter it could be an issue. The other complaint would be that prior guests must have tried to solve the smaoke detector problem by disconnecting it, but unlike many household detectors these are direct wired and our detector seemed to be hanging by the wires (Within a wire mesh cage to prevent removal) We asked the hotel to look at the smoke detector when we were out for the day, they never did. It worked so we were safe but it probably should have been repaired by maintenance. All in all it was a serviceable hotel in midtown for cheaper than the chains.

It had two internet stations past the lobby area, which were free for hotel guests. You needed to get buzzed in by the lobby clerk. There also was a place up in the room, by the desk, in which you could hook up your computer. There really was no view, but curtains covered the windows and it wasn't an issue.

There is nowhere else where I would consider $200 a night to be a budget hotel, but in NY it is. Keeping that in mind, the Mayfair was a decent hotel for that price. The room was small, but bigger than many other NY hotels. The air conditioning worked perfectly - important since it was 90 degrees outside. My room was in the back and considering there is a theater right next door, I heard nothing. Slept like a baby. The bathroom was relatively clean and the water was HOT. The room had a TV and a computer station. I didn't use it, I used the one in the \"business center\" in the lobby. I'm still waiting to see if I got charged for it. The room was clean and the linens and towels were spotless, soft and fresh-smelling. That's a big one for me. I can't stand musty or dirty-looking linens and towels. The housekeeper even came in as I was moving in to change one of the pillow shams because it didn't match. The room decor is getting a little shabby and was downright odd. Everything from the wallpaper to the curtains, the bedspread, the pillow shams and even the lampshades were all covered in the same exact French-style blue and cream print. At first glance, it was hard to see the wall lamps and even find the bed! It was like playing Where's Waldo. Downsides: the lobby, the hallways and the elevator were filthy and completely worn. This was not a good first impression, although it made the room a pleasant surprise. It would be worth their time and money to fix those areas up. As others have the said, the location is amazing. 2 blocks from two different subway stops giving you access to most subway lines. One block from Broadway - right in the theater district. Half-a-block from 9th Avenue where all the restaurants are. A billion people on the streets all night long so it's very safe walking. The best thing in my opinion was the staff. Friendly hotel staff are rare in New York and everyone - day crew, night crew, front desk, or cleaners - were so nice at the Mayfair. It doesn't take much effort to say \"hello\" or \"have a nice time\" or make small talk and more hotels should work on this.

We did open our 3rd floor window (opened to an alley) and was cooed to sleep by the pigeons. The water was scalding hot (watch out) and it took both of us to figure out how to get the water up to the shower (push the little knob in HARD). Great water pressure, little soaps and towels were just fine. There is a powerful hairdryer and iron. This hotel obviously has been around for a while, but there is nothing that shouts \"old\" or \"musty\". There is mahogany paneling in the lobby that is pretty classy looking. There are framed vintage black and white photos every where depicting old time famous stars. There is a internet area in the lobby as well as a baby grand piano ready to be played. AND someone was when we returned from our evening. We grabbed our bottle of wine and thoroughly enjoyed the \"concert in the lobby\". OH, we needed some ice and the conceirge brought it right up in a very nice ice bucket with lid. They also stored our luggage after check out. Very nice staff.

Hotel is very convenient to the 49th/50th St stop on the A/C/E subway lines, as well as the 1 and N lines, all of which are half a block away. Hotel is kept clean and shiney for such an old building. There are two staff at the front desk 24/7. All staff were always professional for a small-scale hotel like this. Hotel is 7 storeys with a classic early 20th-century closet-sized elevator. Speaking of closet-sized, the rooms are classic-New York - very small by modern standards. The hotel had obviously been converted from an SRO (single-room occupancy) building over the years, but was very clean. Ask for a room at the front of the hotel (the '04's for example) as they offer a view of 49th street. The rooms are air-conditioned but the windows also opened fully, which was a nice feature you rarely see anymore). Washrooms and showers have lots of hot water and were very clean and well-maintained. Housekeeping was friendly and quick to make up room. An excellent touch is a full computer in every room, including printer. High-speed internet is free. Great if you don't want to lug your laptop on the trip with you. I totally wasn't expecting that, and it was a great selling feature to get me to come back. Good for looking up restaurants, etc. It is an economy hotel, and as such, I did not see pop or ice machines in the hotel. There is a modern market and bodegas at the end of the block at the corner of 8th Av. There is a restaurant/bar space beside the lobby currently under renovation. Check-out is noon and there were no surprises on the bill. Got the impression that the hotel was a professionally run operation that could be trusted. There was a safe in my room for valuables.

I called in advance in make sure that there was a WORKING elevator and that access with my electric mobility scooter would not be a problem; I was given assurances that there was a ramp and all would be OK. I arrived to find that there were steps at the front entrance. I asked where the ramp entrance was located and was informed that the ramp was ONLY for luggage. The doorman said that he would lift my scooter into the lobby when I needed to come and go. Once inside I learned that I would not be allowed to use my scooter to get to my room because the mgr felt that the elevator was too small to accommodate it (I didn't agree and I'm the one with 10+ yrs experience using the scooter0. Then the mgr said that I might damage the elevator with the scooter and they couldn't risk it. I asked if the hotel referred travelers that they couldn't accommodate to another property but was told (and I believed it) that with the NY Gift show that week, I wouldn't find a room elsewhere. So, I left my scooter in the lobby, reluctantly left my only key to it with the front desk, and went to my room. Yes, they put me in a room near the elevator and, yes, as other reviewers have stated, the room was closet-sized. The bathroom was almost as large as the room. The room was decorated in toile fabrics, but showed some wear. The next day when I went downstairs, the mgr told me that they were completely booked and that someone would only be available to help me with my scooter once (out) in the morning and once (in) in the evening. In other words, I'd better do whatever I needed to do before coming back to the hotel, because once I was in, that was it for the day. I was furious and threatened to call whatever NYC agency that handled ADA complaints; I was told to go ahead. I actually did call and was given the run around from a city office regarding landmark properties. So I spent 8 days at the Mayfair under these conditions. Their restaurant was closed for renovations and I ended up buying my dinner from the hot/cold buffet bar at the Food Emporium supermarket nearby and carrying it back to the hotel along with whatever I needed to drink for the evening, plus my briefcase, purse, etc. My company had prepaid the cost of the room so I had no recourse with the hotel, there was nothing I could do but put up with an incredibly insensitive mgr and an old hotel that didn't meet ADA requirements.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "rainbow2bike", "Title": "\u201cDon't Stay Here!!!\u201d", "Author": "rainbow2bike", "ReviewID": "UR21501790", "Content": "I was quoted a price of 190 but then charged 340.

You won't find mention on the website, but renovations have closed the connected restaurant next door (the \"Garrick\") and it does not look like it's going to be reopening anytime soon. The lobby is half torn up, as well, and the gent at the desk sighed and said it had been going on as long as he has worked there, with no end in sight. This is actually a reason for hope, however, as the biggest problem with the Mayfair is that it is simply tired and needs a facelift. Maybe it's on the way. Reviews have pointed out that the rooms are tiny, and indeed they are. This is perhaps what the hotel means when it refers to its \"European\" style (I didn't see much of Europe there otherwise), and in fact I have not seen rooms this small outside of Europe. I was in what was referred to as a \"petite single\" room (# 307), and in a hotel already famed for small rooms, I was a little worried about that. But it was fine -- a bed which was a little wider than a standard twin and just about enough room to put your feet down on either side. Have to note that there are numerous maintenance issues (missing light shades, a bathroom faucet that would not turn off, most of the TV stations were out, etc.) There was, technically, a window but it opens out onto a brick wall about three feet away and since I was on the third floor, I could not tell whether it was daytime or nighttime by looking, so I just left the curtain closed. The carpet and elevator should have been retired long ago. Those are the negatives though. On the positive side, first and foremost, this is a comfortable, quiet and secure-feeling hotel, with a fine bed, clean sheets and towels, in an absolutely fabulous location. Next door to the Eugene O'Neill theater, across from \"Chicago\" (although I don't recommend seeing it). The lovely St. Malachy's Church (the \"Actor's Chapel\") is directly across the street, offering Mass, Adoration and just a peaceful, quiet island in the most bustling place in North America. Times Square is just around the corner and Carnegie Hall is about six walkeable blocks away. Also, easy access to various subway lines. So, if you do not plan to do much more than sleep in the hotel (like me), the rest is not a problem. And the price was, by NY standards, a real steal.

I have to laugh at the reviewers who give brutal reviews to cheap hotels for being... CHEAP! Of course you are going to end up in a small room with dated furniture if you are paying $150/night in Manhattan! I'm giving the Mayfair New York a score of 4/5 in relation to the VALUE (the cost vs. my needs) for a midtown Manhattan hotel. I would obviously not give the same review if I paid $500/night for the same room. The Mayfair New York is safe and located in an unbelievably central location in the Theater District. Walk a half block east from the front door of the hotel - and look at the lights of Times Square. Walk a half block west from the front door of the hotel - and grab breakfast at a great diner on 8th Avenue. There is an internet cafe just a few doors down, and another just a block away. A gym is 2-3 doors down. Walk just about any direction for a block or two, and you will hit a subway station. You just can't beat the convenience. The property itself is dated and a little beat up, but that stuff just doesn't bother me. The desk staff and manager were friendly enough, and my room was just what I needed... a safe, clean, comfortable bed to sleep in. My room was tiny, but I expected it. It is a \"double\", but their online reservation system will only show that room if you say that \"1\" guest is staying. If you enter \"2\", it will only show queen rooms. The wallpaper, curtains, and pillows are all decked out in toile (check out the pictures) - which is cheesy and charming at the same time. I thought it was fun. My room was on the second floor and looked into a shaft (no view). This actually worked out fine for me, because my room was quiet (no street noise) and stayed dark in the morning so I could sleep in a bit. My only advice is to make sure the window is locked. I didn't check until the second night, and it was closed - but unlocked. I don't know if anyone can get access to the shaft, but if so, it would be easy to climb into the 2nd floor window. Of course, it is smart to always check the locks on windows at your hotel - wherever you stay. I stayed the night of St. Patrick's Day (March 18) and the following two nights. I paid $162 for the first night and $150 each for the following two nights. I couldn't find any room in midtown with a private bath for a better deal for those days... including properties with lower reviews.

The flower box on the front lobby window had no plants or flowers-not even artificial flowers. This is a tiny little hotel, with tiny little corridors and tiny little rooms. The room decor is a knock off of the early Schraeger-type boutique properties in the City. The guest room was basic and met our sleeping needs. The coordinated Chinoise wall covering and matching bed covers aided in making the best of a room that had a double bed with no more than 24 inches of walking space around it. There are two phones in the room and a decent radio should you opt out of viewing television. A word of caution, the thermostat on the wall does not control the room air conditioner. For that you must use a separate remote control. The bathroom was large, when considering the size of the guest room. The lighting was functional and the water pressure in the shower was good. The mini shampoo bottles were made of such rigid plastic that it was nearly impossible to get any product out of them. The hotel is conveniently located near multiple subway lines that can get you to virtually any area in the metropolitan area. The closest subway is west of the hotel at Eight Avenue (north bound for cars) and Broadway (south bound for cars); you can catch the 8th Avenue subway from either Penn Station or Port Authority should you be arriving by train, bus or airport connections. There is a parking garage right at 49th and 8th Avenue; but, I would be very afraid to guess how much the nightly charge may be. There is an intranet cafe next door and you can catch up on your emails should you not be traveling or being weighted down with a laptop.

We had a queen bed, which was comfortable. But it was difficult to find space to store our luggage in the small room. The floor severely sagged toward one corner--enough that it caused me to stumble on a couple of occasions. During the recent renovation, they were unable to fix these structural problems. The view outside the window was of a nasty brick wall about five feet away. There is a fire department station around the corner, and we heard firetruck sirens every night. The bathroom facilities were adequate, but with very limited storage area. It would take several minutes to get hot water in the shower. Fortunately, our room had a water temperature gauge on the shower control, so we could tell at a glance when the water got hot. A wall-mounted blow dryer was available, but it often would not work on the high setting. The computer with internet connection and printer were handy resources to have available. I found using hopstop.com was very helpful in finding the right subway trains and connections to take to specific destinations, especially on the weekend when some trains do not operate. The built-in computer had two USB ports on the front, but the ports seem to be out of alignment with the case, for I could not get my flashdrive to insert. Every time the computer was rebooted, all settings were reset, including the sound level, which always came on too loud. Since I was previously told that not all rooms have computers, but they all are supposed to have internet connections, I took along my laptop to ensure that I had a computer resource. In this room, however, it would have been very difficult to plug a cable into the ethernet jack, as the jack was located behind a panel that was installed to deter theft of the LCD monitor. The digital wall safe had ample room for small items, but not large enough for my laptop computer. Fortunately, I had taken along a Kensington lock and found a place to connect it in the room that allowed my laptop to be at least theft-resistant. An iron and ironing board was provided in the room, but no refrigerator, microwave oven, coffee maker, etc. was available. The desk staff did, however, say that they could store small refrigerated items for us, if needed. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful, although the foreign accents of some personnel were not easy to understand. As other reviewers have stated, the price and location are big plusses.

I called the hotel directly, talked to the manager who asked, \"how much do you want to pay?\" WOW! I named my price (which was the average of the original three night price) and she agreed.

There is a grocery store/deli right across the street, a Starbucks on the corner, and the Eugene O'Neill Theater next door. The Mayfair's restaurant was closed for renovations, but the front desk recommended a small Italian restaurant 1/2 blk away which was delicious!

I have stayed there various times in the past and have loved the proximity to Broadway(1/2 of an avenue). it is located across the street from a great food store and there is a Catholic church right across the street. In the past, the rooms that I have had(the cheapest) were so small that I felt like I was going to suffocate. This time, I had a \"queen\" size bed in a very comfortable room. The plusses: there was a wall safe that was able to accommodate my laptop(very important for me!) and the bathroom was immaculate. The bed was very comfortable and the staff was very helpful. The negatives-there is no coffee service at all, either at the front desk or in the rooms. The room that I was in (411) had no heat. I had to use a portable heater which worked well, however, I can't believe that they continue to rent out the room without heat. The toilet flushed fully every five flushes. When I mentioned the heat issue(they could not have missed it, because it was freezing in the room) they did offer to move me to an adjoining room, but I didn't want to pack and unpack again. I cannot emphasize the proximity to subway lines(going directly to the train station) and to Broadway. In addition, there is an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 next door, but it is rather expensive(12.50/hr.) There is DSL, but you have to have a laptop. There is no business center in the hotel. in spite of the above negatives, I think that a room with a \"queen\" bed is workable. Do not expect an expanse of a lobby, nor any type of lounge or breakfast room.

It also had the most comfortable king size bed & a pull out sofa bed for our 12 year old. There was a good size bathroom & a computer in the room, which normally had internet connection, but due to the renovations the internet was down. But there's an internet cafe right next door. There's no fridge in the room, so it was hard to keep drinks or anything cold in the room. Apart from that & the pink wallpaper, the room was fantastic.

The hotel is an old one, and the decor is reminiscent of the 30's and the heyday of Broadway. The hotel is small! My daughter and I are five footers, and we barely fit together in the one elevator with one bag each. Because of the size of the elevator, and because there was only one,we always walked down the six flights of stairs when leaving our room. The room, as could be expected, was also small, with about fourteen inches of room between the bed and the walls. There was a small desk in the corner and a portable television mounted on a shelf above -- cable, but no movie selections. Although high speed internet was advertised, the DSL did not work, and no one was around to look into things. Fortunately, there was a Cyber Cafe two doors down that had great food, and great computer access for a very reasonable price. There seemed to be a restaurant attached to the Mayfair, but it didn't appear to have been open for some time. A bar type area was in the lobby of the Mayfair, but that was not open during the time we were there. If a person is looking to spend downtime in a hotel, this is not the one for him/her. If looking for a place to sleep while spending most of the time exploring, then the Mayfair would be a good choice. The location is excellent. There are two Broadway theatres on the street, and another one a block down. Times Square is a blockand a half away, and Rockefeller Center (the Today Show) about five blocks away. Gray Line Tours is also a block and a half away, and there are at least a dozen restaurants within a two-five minute walk.

I lived in NYC for 8 years and have stayed in many, many hotels since I left 12 years ago. I consider myself one who isn't very picky, but there were just too many issues here. First, having access to the internet is very important to me. The hotel promised me that they offered DSL, but it has been broken all month. While the manager blames it on the service provider, an employee explained to me that the hotel is too cheap to put in a reliable solution. To their credit, they did reimburse me for an expense from an internet cafe, but I really missed being able to look up information from the comfort of my room. My wife wants me to mention that the toilet paper was the roughest she has ever experienced. It sure fit in with everything else! While some reviewers on this site and others have praised the hotel in the past for its service, we found the staff to be inattentive at best. In what was almost funny, my wife called down to the front desk to ask for information about an address. The person said \"you'll have to look it up on Mapquest\". While I don't expect that they will always have the answer, this was like throwing salt on a wound given the lack of internet access despite it being promised. In general, we were shocked over the five days to see the staff seldom greet us. Often, they were engaged in conversation with each other and refused to even glance. One morning, I heard them all complaining about the manager and about how much they hated working for him. While some may complain about the room's size, ours was quite adequate for the $200 a night we were paying. It had a king-sized bed. It even had a computer, though that was rather useless given the lack of internet! The bathroom was marble and had plenty of space. With that said, there were so many examples of disrepair. First, there were missing light fixtures or improper light bulbs. There were other examples of poor maintenance that were just shocking. The shower door, a glass slider, was in such bad condition that I had to open and close it for my wife. Even outside the room, there were signs of deferred maintenance. The posts on the stairs were all quite loose, for instance. We had a great time despite our annoyance with the hotel.

The hotel's own website says \"intimate\" rooms, which seems to mean: miniature; and \"European\" seems to mean: poorly maintained. The bathroom: a very small shower corner, a toilet and no room to put your toilettries because it's all post stamp size. The cover caps of the faucets were still loose on the sink. I guess the maintenance people forgot to finish their work after lunch? One of the electric outlets in the wall was hanging half loose. The wall paper may be described as \"European\" style decoration, but it looked very cheap and I found nothing European about it. I can't say the room was dirty, but the overall impression is simply a bit run down. There is supposed to be a place where they serve breakfast. But people were busy at the front desk, and I was a bit in a hurry, and I saw nothing that looked like a place where breakfast is served. Some postings talk positively about the decoration with all the pictures of broadway stars. They are there, but don't make the hotel a special place. Over all I was disappointed. I know: my booking was last minute through the travel agency; I believed this hotel was more or less same standard as my original choice, so I accepted the price. But I can't help feeling it is overpaid. There have been postings about problems with too high charges on the bill, but I did not experience any dishonesty like that. The staff seemed OK. If you don't mind paying this much for just a bed and a shower in an admittedly fantastic location, then this place may be acceptable for you. But don't let the \"intimacy\" and \"European style\" descriptions on the hotel's own web-site convince you; if you want a reasonably convenient room you may consider a different hotel.", "Date": "October 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLovely Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4004374", "Content": "I thought the Mayfair New York was the quaintest little hotel. We found it very late on a saturday night when no one else had available rooms. The man at the front desk was very accomodating. He let the three of us stay in a single room, and even went so far as to get us an extra futon mattress. Since it was so late (around 4am on sunday morning), he checked us in as sunday morning so we wouldn't have to check out until monday at noon (thereby getting two nights for the price of one). Our room was very small, but it was clean and comfortable. We had plenty of clean sheets, extra blankets and pillows, cable tv, air conditioning, and a clean bathroom with a fairly large shower. We slept in on sunday and no one bothered us, it was very quiet, and the curtains were very effective at keeping the room dark. Our room was on the top floor, and there was a very sturdy fire escape right outside the window that allowed us to climb up one level to the roof and look out over 49th and Broadway (shh don't tell). Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was very affordable as well, our room was $90 + tax for the night.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Fla", "Title": "\u201cSweet office Staff, Awful Rooms\u201d", "Author": "SteveTampa_Fla", "ReviewID": "UR3935550", "Content": "Having just stayed 4 days for Business, the Hotel was simply awful, except for the exceptionally kind office staff.

The carpets were so filthy, that one dares not walk barefoot on the floors. I rubbed a white sock across the floor to confirm my suspicion and the sock came out black. Whats most disturbing is the management, as innkeepers, have no pride in the accommodations that charge in excess of $200 per night. What is it all coming to? And right next door is the Days Inn which is usually known as a very poor hotel choice, and which at this second under total rennovation. Readers and I should be careful and truly read the reviews of current visitors of the Mayfair as the reviews are certainly correct.

In fact, I've returned to stay at the Mayfair about a dozen times during the past six years! I travel to New York on business frequently, and have stayed at quite a few of the more affordable hotels in the Theater District. I've stayed at probably 20+ hotels in midtown Manhattan on both the East and West sides. My favorite of all of them in terms of value is Mayfair New York. It's true that many of the rooms are small (some are outright cramped), and the hotel doesn't have internet. However, the Double Deluxe rooms (not listed on their web site) are great for one person, and the King rooms are great for couples. There is also an internet cafe next door to the hotel that has reasonable rates for WiFi (less than $10/day). The hotel is clean, and I like the many old black & white photographs of movie and theater personalities from bygone days. The slow elevator doesn't both me, since I prefer to walk up and down stairs (I usually stay on the sixth or seventh floor). I've had nothing but positive experiences in dealing with the staff at the Mayfair. One reassuring thing to note is that the staff seems happy and I've seen relatively little turnover during the past six years. A nice personal touch is that some of the staff remembers me when I arrive.", "Date": "June 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay Here!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3576124", "Content": "The rooms are very small (as expected) and the air conditioning is very noisy and old.

What we found was a friendly and helpful young woman from Belgium at the desk, a bellhop who took over our luggage and got it to our comfortable room. Yes, the king- sized bed took up a lot of the room but it was comfortable. The room was clean and well appointed. Our window looked out on a dark area where the fire escape was. It was a good location because it was very quiet. No traffic noise. The elevator was small but adequate. The air conditioner wasn't working. We called the desk and a young man appeared and fixed the problem within fifteen minutes. The hotel is located a half block off Broadway--great!

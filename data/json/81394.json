There was a problem with the freight elevator so one elevator (of 2) in the lobby was shut down for a while, but the staff handled it so well it was not an issue. The free wi-fi never really worked well, speeds were so slow I couldn't really use it - it would get hung up whenever I tried to pull up a map. The good news is the staff was great - very outgoing, friendly & helpful. We had lots of exposure to the staff: making up the pullout bed, turndown service, we needed extra toothpaste, we ordered room service, suggestions from the front desk on restaurants, directions, valet parked our car - even the maintenance guys using the freight elevator were considerate and apologetic...all were great and made the stay wonderful.

Rooms were huge with a kitchenette area with microwave and fridge which came in handy for light snacks and also tableware for 2 people and coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee. King size beds were so comfortable and also the sofa (which could be turned into a sofa bed but didn't use). The bathroom had marble sinks and a telephone and also an additional TV in the mirror! Bonus to have whilst showering and brushing your teeth! The Club Lounge was was a bonus with free coffee, tea, hot chocolate all day. We didn't use the fitness centre but did use the co-ed jacuzzi (and there is also a separate men and wmen sauna. The location was excellent, a block from Union Square, walking distance of Macy's, Westfield, cable car, bus stops, etc. Yes there were city street noises at nite but hey we were slap bang in the centre so expected this - we were overlooking the JW Marriott side. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, helpful and assisted us at every opportunity. The Concierge booked our Wine trip to Sonoma/Napa Valley as we requested and also booked our taxi on way back to SFO which turned out to be a limousine - an extra bonus at the end of a fabulous San Francisco trip!

A call to housekeeping solved the problem very quickly, and the sofa bed was actually quite comfortable. The room was spacious and well laid-out, and despite appearing a little dated, was very clean. The only downside to our stay was noise from the street. Had I paid attention to other reviewers, I would definitely request a room away from the street. This was quite an issue on Sunday morning, when at 6:30 a.m., chanting through a bullhorn awakened our family. Evidently, workers at a hotel across the street are on strike and kept up quite a racket for an hour and a half. I called the front desk to request that we be moved for the following night, but was assured that the protesters only caused this commotion on the weekends. Sure enough, Monday morning only brought the standard street noise. The room is equipped with a mini fridge, microwave and plates, dishes & flatware for 2 people which made it easy & convenient to have breakfast & snacks in the room. Free coffee & tea are available on the top floor 24 hours a day.

We had no problem with the sound quality in the room because we always travel with our noise machines and ear plugs. The hotel is very conveniently located in Union Square. If you are there on Wed or Thurs, go to Le Colonial Restaurant on Cosmo Alley...just a short walk away for some of the best live music in the city. The Cosmo Cats play on Wed night. The Martini Brothers play on Thurs night (think big band playing swing with a cool singer). Local people show up to dance and it is entertainment to watch them. Le Colonial was our highlight of our trip. Also, if you are a tourist, take the Hop On Hop Bus to see the city. A cheap way to do it and you will see ALL parts of the city this way. Also, check out happy hour at the restaurant in The Donatello; great drink prices and 1/2 price appetizers. The ravoli is wonderful; we dreamed about it until we get get back this year to eat it again. The lounge also has jazz. You should really enjoy The Donatello...we love it.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service\u201d", "Author": "Histo01", "ReviewID": "UR120143338", "Content": "Our stay at the Donatello was truly wonderful.

There was a huge line for them at Fisherman's Wharf. I called the hotel in advance to reqest a room facing away from the street. The desk staff assigned a room for me on the 6th floor, overlooking a roof or parking garage. I heard very little street noise. The bed was on the firm side but still comfortable. The room had plenty of space including a small couch and coffee table. Wifi was free. My room key had a small piece of paper with the password next to it. The bathroom was good, pretty typical of a good hotel. I liked that the shower has an inner and outer curtain liner. My only gripe was getting the shower temperature just right. Very small adjustments would change the temp too much. Toiletries included shampoo, bars of soap and body lotion. No shower gel, no big deal. Next door to the hotel is a company that rents bicycles.

Again, I would like to emphasize the cleanliness -- it made up for the slightly dated appearance. San Francisco is a fantastic city, but quite expensive. If you are looking for a more moderately-priced hotel, this is a nice one. The negatives: (i) the Internet service was spotty. The hotel offers free WI-FI, but it seldom worked in the room. It was more reliable in common areas, but still cut out at times, and (ii) the room initially seemed very noisy. We came from 100F weather to 60F San Francisco weather. So, the a/c was turned off in the room when we arrived. We wanted to enjoy the cooler weather, so we didn't turn it on (although we left the windows closed).

You can walk easily to the trolley cars which are 1 block away at Union Square. I would highly recommend on your first morning you walk to Union Square and go to the half price ticket office. You can purchase play tickets and City Passes there. The City Pass were an amazing deal. The passes get you on all trolley's, underground and buses for 7 days straight and entrance into the Aquarium, Exploritorium, Science Museum, Boat tour of Golden Gate and Alcatraz and the Art Museum. All for $69.00 for adults and $39.00 for children. It was an amazing deal. The Exploritorium was also exceptional as was mentioned in other folks reviews. We had 4 hours there and it was not enough.

In short, this hotel (is it a timeshare that rents rooms?) offers excellent value relative to others in the Union Square vicinity. As others have mentioned, the club room on the top floor is a very nice retreat with comfy seating indoors and outdoors, newspapers, coffee and Friday evening wine/cheese reception where they tell you what's happening in town that weekend. Also, the lounge downstairs has a good happy hour - $5 for house wines and several cocktails. The location is great for Union Square and everything east and north, however the Tenderloin lies immediately to your west, which is still a dicy place at night. Whenever we needed to walk west (like to the Civic Center), we just went up one block to Sutter across then down Van Ness to avoid the Tenderloin. If traveling on the metro rail, getting off on Powell and heading up Powell street (rather than Mason) was better because of far fewer panhandlers. It's a shame SF hasn't been able to manage the homeless/begging problem better .. we only had one (of dozens) get physically agressive (on Mason St., we just kept walking). Walking to Nob Hill, Chinatown, Pacific Heights is very easy (hills excepted), and points farther away (Waterfront, Telegraph Hill) are also very walkable, so we only needed to use public transportation to get to Golden Gate park. Our room had a microwave, coffee maker and mini-fridge, so we had breakfast in the room, which saves money for other things (it's not a cheap town). But if you can help it, don't buy at the nearby corner markets ... prices are marked WAY up ($14 for a box of cereal and 1/2 g milk).

Each night after a long day out exploring and walking the lovely San Francisco hills we would head up stairs to the clubhouse where we enjoyed the outside patio and then the clubhouse itself. The clubhouse included the outside patio area, a place to relax and enjoy complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolare and it also has a fitness area. We stayed an entire week so the hot tub was a great relaxing experience. Being from Boston and YAY, we did win that 2011 Stanley Cup!!!!! we didn't want to miss the games and the relaxing clubhouse with a large screen TV came in handy. The staff knew we were routing for Boston so they immediately became Bruins fans as well to help cheer our team along. All in all this place is tremendous in all that it has to offer, location, cleanliness, helpful and pleasant staff. All in all, this made for one of our favorite vacations ever and we love to travel.

The room is large, and has a mini bar area outside the bathroom with a sink, coffee maker, microwave oven, and even dishes. The room feels clean. My 9-year old son slept on the sofa bed, and my daughter was able to sleep comfortably with my husband and me in the king-size bed. Yes, we could hear sirens at times, but it did not bother us at all, and never kept us up. We were in the middle of the city, so it didn't seem unusual. One of benefits of being in the middle of the city was being close to shopping, eating places, theaters, the cable car turn-around, museums,...all within walking distance. Our whole family loved it! Being coffee and tea drinkers, we appreciated the club level amenities, which included complimentary (Peet's!) coffee, tea, and hot cocoa. The bellmen are all very friendly and helpful. Joe was so polite, and suggested the best way to the airport from the hotel, then handled everything, so we could just enjoy our vacation. On one drizzly day, we were standing on the street, and Rolando came all the way outside to suggest that we borrow a couple of their umbrellas! At the same time, he asked Tony, another bellman, to hail us a cab.

Negatives of room: not many, but fixable with some long-term inve$tment from management. - Water pressure was low in the shower, and had to leave hot water on full blast early in morning, to get the pipes humming with warm water. Perhaps an upgrade of the boiler system is overdue. - WiFi was erratic, and I couldn't connect on my iPad. Apparently, this was widespread, as one concierge mentioned it on my way out, in the elevator. Fortunately, hotel offers free use of a desktop in their biz center. Location: Perfect. One block from Union Square, transit buses nearby. No problem getting to the west end for museums and Golden Gate bridge (take the open top bus tour -- I listened to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries on my iPod, as the bus drove across the GG Bridge at 45 mph in the bright sun and cool breeze. Bay views spectacular on both sides of bridge. Was a better thrill than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which is boring by comparison. What an adrenaline rush!). Overall: A super hotel with lots of fine details that are missing in big chain places like Hilton and Marriott. And at these rates ($159-179/night) why settle for anything else? Will stay here again. Many thanks to the management team for making this hotel a very memorable experience.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cThe Donatello has the largest rooms in SF!\u201d", "Author": "Chris9111948", "ReviewID": "UR102847774", "Content": "SF hotel rooms are usually small.

We were pleasantly surprised by the Donatello. I would stay here again. The only real con is that the furniture was older and could use a freshen up. Examples: The handle to a drawer came off as I tried to open it, the table was clearly worn down, there was a burn hole in the couch, overall the style of the furniture was dated, lots and lots of mirrors in the entry (good and bad, depending on from how many angles you want to view yourself). Pros: Friendly staff, some of the nicest I've encountered. Great location -close to all with plenty of good restaurants around and we could walk to the convention center (we like to walk but it is pretty close). The room is Large, especially by San Francisco standards which is more European in style. I think ours was about 400 sf. It had a couch, a nice desk, a good entry way, and a decent view (not a lot to look at, but nice space outside). We were on the 12th floor and faced South. If we were on the other side we would have been looking into the Marriott. There was a small workout room on the top floor with a sauna and whirlpool in the women's bathroom (assume the same for the men). There is also a lounge on that floor with an outside patio, nice chairs and tables, coffee and tea and such. This was a nice place to sit and get some light. A concierge was also up there and very pleasant. Note: I booked through Club Donatello (just by happenstance) so I am not positive if everyone gets use of this room, although I would think so. When I checked in and asked for a higher floor the man said that I booked through Club Donatello which starts on the 8th floor. They have a timeshare there, so that may be part of the timeshare. We had a very good time here and would consider staying here again. There are a lot of homeless in this area so you will be hit up when you go out. Just part of the scene there. We have been staying away from Union Square partially for that reason and there are hotels we like in other parts of the city.

I chose this place primarily for the location and also the fact their amenities included a microwave and a small fridge, so I could make simple breakfast and meals for my toddler. It turned out to be more than I asked for! First the location was great. It had the BART, MUNI, and the cable car that would take you up the hills to fisherman's wharf with in very close walking distances, with in a few blocks. It got a bit noisy one part of the night on Saturday but only for about 10 minutes. We were glad that we didn't book a hotel at the Fisherman's Wharf after visiting there... there were so many tourists, and just so congested in general. The Union Square area that Hotel Donatello is in was perfect. Not too far from any of the key places, and most places were very walkable. The service was always prompt and friendly, by everyone including the porter and the concierge. We called the front desk for a taxi at the last minute to get to a wedding, and a limo service was waiting downstairs- and the price was better than what a cab fare would be. The cleaning ladies even washed the dishes I had brought and neatly laid them out to dry on the counter. The rooms were kept clean and neat and they had plenty of closet space. I had read some reviews before the trip about how things look very worn-out, but in reality, there is some wear, but still maintained nicely. I think if you take flash photos of corners of a bathroom floor or walls in any hotels you'd probably see some worn-out areas. This is not a newly constructed hotel, but still up-kept nicely. The kitchenette has a small sink, a coffee maker, a microwave, and a small fridge (no freezer compartment, though). In a small drawer are metal utensils, and up on the shelves are mugs, glasses, bowls and plates. The bed was a bit high but incredibly comfortable. We just had our son sleep in between us, but they do have cribs if you need one. One extra note-- I had left my son's favorite DVD in the room and didn't realize until we got back to the east coast.

I totally agree with everyone. I do have a couple of comments to make but all in all, I really enjoyed staying there and would definitely stay there again. It all depends on what you are looking for in a hotel. If you want a great location, friendly staff and a spacious room then this is the hotel for you. Are there nicer hotels in SF? Yes. Are there more upscale and modern hotels? Yes. Are there more hip and happening hotels? Yes. But, this hotel felt so inviting, friendly, quaint, convenient, and did't have that corporate feeling to it but yet had all the amenities that a corporate hotel has. So, the location is quite central and perfect. The customer service at this hotel was excellent. I called before our arrival and spoke to Bobbi and Jesus who were excellent and took down all of my requests including a wheelchair that they let us use for the entire week that we were there following my surgery at no cost. When we checked in, all of our requests were taken care of and we picked up the wheelchair as promised. Any time we needed anything, everyone was very accommodating and friendly. I do have to comment on the room service breakfast. It was terrible, the fruit was old, and the oatmeal was a bag of instant quaker oatmeal. Don't waste your money on this. There is a Bristol Farms nearby and lots of bakeries. Just go pick up some things for your stay. You have a kitchenette which includes a mini refrigerator, microwave, sink and coffee maker that were all very convenient. Also, on the club level which all hotel guests have access to, you can get free coffee and tea all day. The concierge is there and the lounge is really nice with a flat screen TV, plush couches and outdoor seating which we got to enjoy. This hotel does not have 24 room service but you are in SF so you can order from just about any restaurant that you want and everything is delicious. We had a wheelchair accessible room and it was huge, very spacious, had a fold out couch and large sitting chairs. I felt very comfortable there. There was a flat screen TV but it was a bit small and too far from the Bed. Also, they didn't have On Demand although they did have HBO. The gym looked small but had everything that one would need for a full work out and the equipment looked modern.

Fridge, microwave, wifi Breakfast served in room, no onsite, so we ate at Pinecrest, Cafe Mason, David's Deli (including dinner at the last 2), all within a block. Good value for money, and very happy with the quality of food. American breakfast coffee is appalling - always filter coffee, topped up constantly, and just awful. We could not find anywhere that did genuine cappucino or latte with breakfast. Evita steered us to Encore cafe, diagonally opposite the Donatello, which did very good coffee, with a range of beans including Yergacheffe, Sumatran, Ethiopian, etc. Best coffee (and pastries) is in North Beach (Little Italy) at Stella Pastries on Columbus Avenue, where you can also access the wifi from Hotel Boheme next door. Very easy access to and from SFO via BART to Powell and easy walk to Donatello. Everyone helpful, never any concerns for safety. We took buses everywhere - Haight Ashbury, Golden Gate, Golden Gate Park, Legion of Honour. These and the Cable Car just minutes away. Biggest downside to this hotel - which I suspect would be the same everywhere near Union Square - is the street noise. We were then on Black Friday, and so a holiday weekend.

Adjacent to the lobby/entrance was a fully specified small bathroom including a telephone. The club room located on the top 16th floor had a very helpful Concierge. In the clubroom was a comfortable seating area with 'free'local newspapers and coffee and tea facilities. I did not use the adjacent fitness room. I enjoyed eating in the restaurant where the food and wine quality was excellent. All in all this 6 night package proved to very good value considering the location of the hotel, the space of the room and its facilities and very friendly and attentive staff & service.

I was tired so I didn't want to wait for someone to come but i phoned down to reception and told them. They were not apologetic and were happy for me to leave a note for the cleaner the next morning. Which I did and still no apology! When I asked at the front desk for directions I was never informed that the concierge was upstairs. It was interesting how you would stand there and wait then when they were free they would not walk towards you and ask if they could help just look at you and wait until you walked over to them! Interesting approach to customer service. When I came before there were pastries and coffee upstairs each morning. I contacted them before my arrival to ask whether or not they supply anything gluten free and i was not advised then that this facility no longer available. I also remembered the sauna and spa being a welcome addition so my friend and I looked forward to this. However when we spoke to the concierge who showed us how to use the controls even he did not tell us the the sauna no longer worked! So we sat there for half an hour like two stuffed lemons getting chilly!

Happy Hour at the bar on the 4th floor had great 1/2 price drinks and appetizers in the late afternoon. On the top floor you could relax with coffee any time of the day. There was a whirlpool spa for relaxation. I had the best massage I have ever had!

The room has a small kitchenette and also has a comfy sofa and armchair, all in a large room that is no way cramped.

When we got up to our room it was a wonderful surprise. I have traveled to other big cities and most do not have this size of room. King size bed, couch and chair, small desk, little kitchen. What more could you want. The kitchen was a bonus. First thing we wanted to do was get some groceries for breakfast, so down to the front desk to ask where a good grocery store was. The man at the front desk was very helpful and directed us to a bunch of different options and gave great directions on how to get there. The location was fantastic. We walked almost everywhere we wanted to go, even to the Legion of Honor (which is about 6 miles from the hotel). The cable cars are 1 block from the front door and the bus system is right out the front door. The cable car line that is close goes right to Market Street and all the way to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf making it a very convenient and fun way to travel. The Donatello is also right by Union Square which is the shopping district in San Francisco. The only thing is that there is a dance club, Ruby Skye, right across the street. This was not a problem for us because after a long day walking in the sun we powered down at night and slept right through the weekend noise. During the week the streets around the hotel are quiet at night but we were woken by street noise around 8 am each morning. This was fine because we could get up and get going to see the beautiful city. We did not use all the amenities they had to offer at the hotel but we did check out a few. The hot tub is very small and I would not want to sit in it with more than 4 people total in there. But it was nice and warm and wonderful after walking all day. The restaurant was fantastic. It was small but the food was great and the service just as good. My boyfriend is a chef and he recommended that other guests check it out while they were there. The lounge has nightly jazz and it is very good. It gets very full and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to sit and listen in the lounge but we went down to the lobby and listened from the couches. On our last night we wanted to go for a very nice romantic dinner and saw a restaurant on the waterfront that we thought would be nice. We did not have time to go in and make a reservation so we went to the concierge upstairs in the hotel and asked him to make a reservation for us. He immediately picked up the phone and called. Within a couple minutes we had dinner reservations at the place we wanted and the time we wanted. Every day we left the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on the door and one day housekeeping did come into our room while we were out. A nice surprise to come to a clean room but it did make me feel a little uncomfortable to think that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abide by the sign on the door or our request I put in at the front desk to not have housekeeping enter our room except on certain days.

There is an exceptional Italian restaurant, Zingari on premises with bar area and happy hour specials Sunday through Thursday. The restaurant offers live jazz nightly which was an additional treat. An adjoining garage offers fairly priced parking for hotel guests. There is even a nice spa/sauna area for the guests to use at their leisure.

They had a variety of \"unexpecteds\" that made the stay outstanding. To start, the staff at check-in made a fine impression, but then the relatively slow elevator bummed me out (I got over it later). I got to my very clean room, but felt so-so on it- the decor was nice but not particularly luxurious, the view was only decent, and overall it was somewhat forgettable, though very spacious. I will say I really didn't like the shower. But, everyday after returning from perusing the city, our lights were on, the curtains had been drawn, and there were mints on our pillows- it was awesome. HOWEVER, from this initial impression on the stay got better and better. We went to the club house, where they have complimentary wine and cheese tasting opposite their excellent fitness center- it housed updated and slick machines and a beautiful coed hot tub area, coupled with saunas separate for the boys and girls. Further, the concierge can be found on this level and they were all amazing- the best I've come across. We got a variety of recommendations on restaurants and activities that were all enjoyable, plus they got us a reservation to a VERY exclusive restaurant that we had contacted not an hour before and were told it was full. From here we went down to the excellent bar/ Zingari restaurant. Happy hour had very good pricing, and while I didn't get a full meal, the appetizers we tried out were delicious, if slightly small on portions. The bartender made me the best Tom Collins of my life, and as we continued to return over the next few nights, we had great conversation, all my variety of drinks were made fast and better than the last, and I felt like my patronage was truly appreciated- really the bartender was excellent. Further, they had live jazz music scheduled for every single night- maybe not the best singers in town, but they were all very enjoyable and it made a great atmosphere. The location of this hotel is about as good as it comes, very satsified. While the rooms were very comfortable, it was the unparalleled staff that made this stay fantastic. Its not like I sat around the hotel for 6 hours a day, but I spent a good amount of time here and it was one of the highlights of my trip. I travel pretty regularly and this beats most other places I have ever stayed, probably all of them- and the price was phenomenal. I can't recommend it highly enough because you will really feel like an important customer, and also reap a heightened experience of the city because of the resources they make available to you.

But I didn't hear a lot of street noise from the 5th floor. The hotel staff were friendly and responsive. The rooms are large and we lucked out by getting a terrace room. It's not luxurious but it's clean, spacious, and you can't beat the price. My only criticisms would be that my teen son found the sofa bed to be uncomfortable so there was some complaining. I understand that they have cots also, so that might have been better. However, I found the king bed to be comforable. Also, I am surprised it is highly-rated for business as there was no proper business desk and chair which is typical in hotels. You either sat on a low bench at a table, or on the couch with a low table, to work on a laptop. Or you sat with it on your lap. We stayed for five nights so this was bothersome. also, they don't have breakfast anymore which is too bad. we did some breakfasts in the room but also had a few expensive diner breakfasts nearby. I thought the hotel restaurant was a bit expensive - $9 for gelato one night -- but they do have happy hour with half price appetizers. I found SF to be generally an expensive city - restaurants, museums, etc. More expensive than New York and Washington. one place that we liked for a reasonable dinner was Postrio at 545 Post Street, just next door. they had a bar menu that was tasty and perfect for a light meal. Having the microwave, sink and fridge in the room was handly. they should provide dishwashing liquid and dish towels though. I did wonder if dishes were properly cleaned by the housekeeping staff. All in all, if you aren't too fussy and you don't require top notch furniture, linens, etc., you will be happy here.

We were not disappointed. We arrived before noon and were happy that they were able to give us a room immediately. Jesus, who was at the desk, was very friendly and polite. As he checked us in, he asked if we were there to celebrate anything, and my husband told him it was my birthday. Jesus then asked if I wanted a bottle of champagne, red wine or white wine. He apologized that they couldn't deliver it before we got to the room, but promised to bring it later in the day. We went up to the room and within five minutes, they delivered a bottle of wine and a small box of chocolates. Amazing!! I was shocked at the size of the room. . . GOOD shock. It was quite large. . . actually huge by San Francisco standards. In addition to the bedroom area which had an entertainment center/arnoire holding a flat-screen TV, DVD & CD player, radio. There were also a small refrigerator, microwave & small sink in a bar area. Seating included a love seat and chair as well as a bench for the \"desk.\" In addition, there was a small dressing area with a small bureau and a safe in the closet. There were plates and silverware in the bar area. The one thing I check immediately when I enter a room is how clean the floor is. The carpet, while older, was SPOTLESS. SPOTLESS. The bathroom was clean, too. The bed was fine. The sheets were a nice quality, which I like. I hate thin sheets on hotel beds, and the Donatello's sheets were very nice. Neither of us had a problem sleeping on the bed, so it must have been okay. Someone else mentioned the Club, which is very nice. There's a fireplace, a few tables/chairs, and a leather sofa and a few chairs for seating. They have coffee/tea available 24/7 (THANK YOU!), and you can use the gym, sauna, etc. Only massages were extra. The two concierges with whom we spoke were both nice and willing to give their thoughts on restaurants, and they and the other two that we saw regularly were very polite and welcoming. As others have mentioned, the hotel is a block away from Union Square. Restaurants and shopping abound. In addition, public transportation is close. We walk a lot, and the Donatello is in a perfect location for walking to Chinatown, North Beach, and the Orpheum (Wicked is there.). NOTE: Since the hotel is in such a great location, there is a lot of traffic, so you will hear it in your room. It was not so bad that it kept us up, although a couple of times emergency vehicles flew by with sirens blasting, and that did wake me up (not my husband). A couple of negatives: 1- The towels were old and worn. I realize they get a lot of use, but they were not comparable with the quality of this hotel. 2- The bathrooms need to be re-done. The grouting was spotty, and the fixtures all seemed aged. 3-The pipes made noises quite often, and in the middle of the night, it's quite annoying.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBig beautiful room, excellent service.\u201d", "Author": "lazrgirl", "ReviewID": "UR59062204", "Content": "We enjoyed our time at The Donatello.

Once in my room, I noticed that there was no ash tray in sight. So I called the front desk to verify that my room was indeed a smoking room (because the room did not smell of stale smoke and even though I smoke I hate the smell of stale smoke!), and he said definitely and appoligized for the lack of an ashtray. I received one within minutes of my request. I was definitely pleased. I ordered room service, and the food from the restaurant within the hotel was extraordinary, and arrived within 20 minutes (10 minutes less than they promised). My entire stay (5 nights) was excellent. Everyone employeed by the hotel was very friendly and accomodating! The only small down side was the softness of the bed. I generally prefer a bed with a little more padding, but it wasn't terrible and I had no problem sleeping. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone going to SF.

I also heard that the restaurant in the hotel was quite good but I had other plans. The club level has coffee and tea available all day and a lovely fitness center, steam room, jacuzzi and showers. If you want to have breakfast, there is a wonderful place called Lori's right down the block at 336 Mason. They are friendly and they even do room service to the hotel. Avoid the Pinecrest Diner. I went there when it was half empty and they rudely told me that booths were only available for parties greater than one. I was told to sit at the counter. Instead I chose to sit at Lori's.

For early birds like me who are out the door by 7am I would prefer earlier hours or 24 hours. Perhaps with key access they can do that. I will definitely recommend the Donatello to my friends. If you go don't bring a car. You are within walking distance of lots of great places to eat and shop. The cable car is one block away and the BART is right down the street. Plus you have to pay extra to park your car overnight. It's a great value and I had tons of room compared to my friend who stayed at the Hilton down the street. She paid MUCH more than I did.

The front desk called back a few minutes later just to make sure I had woken up! They knew I had not. The hotel has an Italian restaurant down stairs called Zingari, and while I didn't eat there, it was full both nights. There is a continental breakfast every morning, and it's better than most offerings of this type of breakfast. Fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, eggs, pastries, English muffins, bagels, coffee, tea, an assortment of juices and more await you for ten dollars. For the tourist who is not familiar with San Francisco, here's one important point: the hotel's front entrance is facing Mason, not Post Street. So coming from the East Bay, after you turn left on Geary, you turn right on Taylor, right on Post and when you hit the corner of Post and Mason....turn right on Mason. The hotel's entrance is about 20 feet down with a blue canopy out front. it's confusing- it looks like the hotel is on Mason. Parking at the hotel is $28 per 24 hours with in and out privileges, but here's something to think about: they ran an early bird special both days I was there. In by 9:30 AM, out by 6 PM,and it's $10. That's a steal in San Francisco proper. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. You can't beat the price, the service is fabulous and it's very quiet. I'm guessing there are only ten rooms per floor, so you don't hear a lot of people in the hallways. The location is superb--you are walking distance from some great restaurants, including Morton's The Steakhouse which is a half a block down on Post on the left side.

The mini kitchen area with sink, fridge and microwave was very useful. And I have to say, the staff was the most accommodating I have ever encountered. They were always so friendly and helpful, whether it was providing loaner umbrellas (it poured a good part of the weekend), giving directions or providing extra blankets. The few times we had to call the front desk to make requests, the knock on the door to fulfill them came in 5 minutes or less. Also, the community room on the top floor was a great gathering place for the 14 of us when we all wanted to be together to just hang out. There was a small outside area here with lounge chairs that would be great in better weather.

For the most part, it was invigorating. However, when you want to 'turn it off', the huge single-pane windows can only hold back so much - although they do partially compensate by opening a crack to let in the brisk air. It can be especially rancorous when the beer bottles start to fly or your neighbor uses the powerful plumbing (Mgmt: try looking into some hammer arresters). If you can deal with the hubbub, you will be treated with a nicely sized room with all of the necessities but not much in the way of trendy furniture (or calming color choices - unless you are a Bears or Gators fan). Beds are just to my liking - not too hard and not too soft. Yes, there is an icebox, safe, and wet bar. As you will typically find in this great city, service is great and friendly.

Good city views from room and also from Club level at top of building where free hot drinks are available and there is a spa, sauna and fitness room. Staff all very friendly and helpful with good concierge service for booking restaurants etc. Location on Post Street and Mason is good, although Mason down to Market Street has its fair share of rather tacky tourist restaurants and stores.

The queen-sized bed was comfortable. I was fortunate enough to get a corner room and experienced minimal hallway traffic and noise. The room's layout and cleanliness were good but the quality of furniture and lighting seemed below average for this level of hotel class. Since I was on the fifth floor, there was also a fair amount of street noise. The bathroom was a pleasant surprise with a convenient layout, plenty of counter top space and clean towels. Overall feeling of cleanliness was extremely high similar to what one can find at a five or six star hotel. The continental breakfast was basic but good. Sliced bread, bagels, donuts and pastries and fresh fruit were available. Coffee was quite good and served hot. Every morning, the tiny breakfast room and outside deck areas were crowded with as many guests as it can hold. The fitness center is across from the breakfast room and small with one treadmill, cycling machine and some free weights. The Donatello is little more than one block away from Union Square and about five blocks from the trolley car station. During the day, the area around the hotel seems to be relatively safe. Many nights walking back to the hotel was uneventful with a decent amount of people and cars still going through the area. Most memorable was the friendliness of the hotel staff. They were very approachable and helpful and keen on making your stay a pleasant one. Overall the service was highly commendable with generously-sized and comfortable rooms.

I had read the many positive reviews, and the experience lived up to my expectations. The staff was unfailingly polite, cheerful, helpful, and downright friendly--particularly Ed at the reception desk. We arrived 2-1/2 hours before the 3 p.m. check-in time, so Ed took my cell phone number and called to tell us when our room was ready. The room was large, clean, comfortable, and very light, with large windows that afforded a view of the SF skyline, and side windows that actually opened, providing welcome fresh air. We had asked for a quiet room, and our 10th floor location provided just that. Several fifth floor rooms shared a common terrace, but we were afraid that the street noise at that level might be more of a problem. The concierge (Peter) suggested we eat at Colibri, a wonderful restaurant serving Yucatan specialties, rather than the more typical fare one finds at most Mexican restaurants. The food was delicious, and the restaurant is located just around the block. Zingari, the hotel's second-floor restaurant-lounge, offers half-price appetizers and $5 house wines from 4-7 p.m. The portions were sufficiently large to serve as dinner for us the night we arrived. The continental breakfast provided excellent orange juice along with oranges, apples, muffins, croissants, breakfast pastries, tea, and coffee in the Club Room on the hotel's top floor. Surrounding the Club Room is an outdoor terrace area that provides great views of The City. The complimentary wi-fi was a definite plus. A computer is available in the lobby for those who are not traveling with a laptop.

I thought too much street noise filtered through the windows during the night from street cleaners and various garbage trucks which always seemed to be around. Noise from adjacent rooms, however, was no worse than other hotels. The newspaper outside your door each morning was nice, but the complementary \"breakfast\" was less appealing. While the orange juice was fresh and coffee pretty good (both in paper cups), the high-fat, high-sugar pastries on offer were definitely not my idea of a nutritious breakfast. But at least they were fresh, gave you lots of energy... and who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth?

This was our first time in SF, so I cannot compare to other places. The room (King, standard) was of sufficient size (400 sf) which I hear is a rarity in the city. The location is downtown amid the tall buildings. It is very close to Union Square and all methods of public transit. I chose the deal that included parking. I highly recommend this unless you are familiar with SF and know \"where\" to park already. Otherwise, Donatello is part of a property network that offers comps if you to listen to their sales pitch for an hour. Parking was one of the comps. We didn't do it, since I had parking in the deal already. In a city of this size, night time noise is expected and SF does not disappoint. We were 10th floor though I'm sure we could have been 1000th floor and it wouldn't have mattered. No biggie for me, I hope I didn't disturb the street life with my snoring. The city is busy and safety was of no real concern until dusk and later. When the throngs of people with permanent residences thin out, things looked a little tough a couple of times. There are some begging homeless, but I found them no more of a nuisance than the people that hand out girl cards in Las Vegas. Don't make eye contact and keep moving. In their defense, I saw a number of them giving directions. This is a characteristic of the city - not the hotel. I did not see anyone \"living\" near the hotel at night. You want service? You got it! We were immediately checked in and dished off to the concierge for a warm welcome and some useful information. Special mention of Ed (It's always Monday at the Donatello) at the desk, Sarah the concierge, and Joe the bellman. I'm sorry I don't remember the valet, but top notch there, too. Sarah was spot on with restaurant recommendations two out of three times (Fino's downtown and Alioto's on the wharf). Even the third was good - just not \"San Francisco\" good. The room also included a complimentary continental breakfast, available from 7:00 to 9:30. We were 0-2 on finding anything other than a muffin or a banana / apple. This was a bit of a disappointment (which I have also seen in other reviews). Sheesh, get a big fridge, have some cereals, pastries, jams, jellies, fruits, bagels, cream cheese - you know, the standards - and have enough to last the entire 2 1/2 hours. A little more attention to this and there will be precious little negative to say about the Donatello.

That being said, we travel frequently as a family so I am familiar with similar such options in general. The valet parking package for an extra $20 a day is simply unbeatable in THIS city and there were no issues in that regard. I found other places charging $30-$50+ per night, so as \"locals\" making the trip from Monterey, we really had no options other than bring the car and were pleasantly surprised with it. The room itself was fairly spacious, but the layout a bit inefficient. This may have been due to being next to the elevator, but for the amount of space, separate living and sleeping areas would have been nice. The sofabed was located in the same room as the bed, so no luck in being able to put the kids to sleep at a different time. The furnishings are in a modern blue and tan decor, and the tv was nice so we still enjoyed the room and found it a pretty good value. Free wireless internet was also included and worked without issue. A small fridge and microwave were also included. We stayed on the sixth floor on a Friday -Sunday on Mother's Day weekend and found outside/street noise to be very prevalent at night with Saturday noise levels being enough to disturb sleep repeatedly. This may be common for hotels at Union Square as there are several night clubs in the area. I don't blame the hotel for this, but may be a consideration for travelers. Within hotel noise was not really an issue, even by the elevator, with only a rare loud grouping passing by. Other than the night noise, everything about this hotel was pleasant. Staff was friendly and attentive, the property clean, and the value for the space is outstanding. I would definitely come back if it was just my wife and myself, but might look for the quieter financial district when bringing children or perhaps insist on a higher floor to see if that alleviates the issue. Finally, a few notes about the trip itself to help others. First, skip the cable cars. Yes, I know that they sound like a romantic experience but the reality is long lines and packed cars, so you are far more likely to be viewing another rider's behind than parts of the city. For the same price ($5 a person) you can get a limo from Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf. If you absolutely must get on one, you will likely need to get on at either end of the line as we saw people repeatedly be told no room at each stop. Second, go to touristy spots early. We went to Pier 39 at opening (10 AM) and without the crowds, is actually a great place for sightseeing and to take the kids. By 1-3, the crowds are there and expect waits for a lot of stuff. Same goes for the Exploratorium. We got there at 10 on a free day expecting the worst, and again, not too bad for the first hour or two. Then the crowds commence. From a practical standpoint, we found 2-3 hours sufficient to view each. We also did the 1 hour Bay Cruise and found that enjoyable. Bring your jacket though. All in all, a very nice stay-cation and well worth the weekend.

I got a room on the 5th floor with a little terrace, but in Feb it was of no use. It was too close to street level (the noise was too much), and I didn't have a very good sleep that night. When I walked into the room I found it to be tiny, and the carpet and bathroom a bit tired. I asked at the front desk if I could get another room, and the the girl left a note for the day staff to set me up with a *better* room (she claimed there would be none available until the next morning) . The next morning I headed downstairs and talked to Jesus (yes that's his name) and he was very nice, and relocated me and my bags (while I was out) to the 10th floor. The room there was mich nicer, however the noise was still problematic, but not as bad. There was some kind of shrill that kept coming from across the street, and it occurred to me on my last night that it's the doorman (I think) of the hotel across the street, using a whistle to hail cabs. It was rather annoying, but if you kept all the windows closed I managed to get some sleep. The cleaning staff kept opening the windows every day, so I had to keep closing them. Oh yeah...the maids knock on your door at 8:00 a.m. !!! which is incredibly stoopid...so you need to leave the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign out, or expect to be waken up, and they will come in unless you go to the door to tell them to go away ! The shower-head was a disaster. You cannot adjust the pressure, and instead of a nice \"shower\", it bolted out like a firehose, and I literally had to get on my hands and knees in the tub to keep my scalp from blowing off from the water pressure (it was the same type of shower-head in both rooms I was in, so I suspect it's the same all over the hotel). It was also too low vertically. If you're 6 feet or taller, you'd have to be bending over regardless. Either way...you'll be on your hands and knees to shower, so good luck with that ! The breakfast room on the \"Club Level\" (same floor as the gym) was nice enough, and the continental style food was fine. Good coffee, bagels and pastries ! There is only seating for about 10 people though, and the hotel has about 20 floors...so you do the math. After one attempt, I just took the food to go after that. Once I just went up to get it and came right back down to my room with a paper plate of food. The front desk staff and the doormen were great though, they were very accomodating in listening to concerns, and orfering airport shuttles. They also have a map pad that is handy for when you're heading out at the strart of your day. I got a new sheet every day, and never managed to get lost ! The beds are hard to describe, but they are very comfortable, and linens were good. The rooms have FREE Wi-Fi, so I was happy about that. I could check my email and FaceBook every night without getting gouged with extra fees ! The price I paid was based on a \"recession special\" and for San Fran it was pretty good ($620. for 5 nights), so there is value for the money ~ I was happy once I got the 2nd room, otherwise my stay there would of been a negative one I think. It's at a good downtown location, just a block from Union Square, and a couple from Market St. (major shopping). You need transportation down to the wharf (waterfront) area, but that's Ok. I pre-bought a 2 day \"On/Off\" double-decker tour bus ticket, and it's main stop is at Union Square, so my transporation around town was taken care of, and I got the narration as I went ! All the \"On/Off\" tour bus companies stop at Union Square, so all good there - I hightly recommed them !..they only stop at the major tourist stops/areas all over town (including both sides of the Golden Gate Bridge), and you get a narration as you go...I only took cabs at night after the tour bus's stopped (after 5 p.m.). They service each stop every 30 minutes or so (although there was one cheap company I read about that only did it once an hour - so shop accordingly ! Anyway, I digress. The Donatello would likely get my business again, but keep in mind the above, and the fact that the actual rooms do not look as nice as their website. But San Francisco is an expensive town for accomodation, and their rates are competitive, so unless you're made of cash, it's a good option to keep in mind.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat in many ways, but not perfect\u201d", "Author": "Lemalle", "ReviewID": "UR25148213", "Content": "We just returned from a 2 day stay at the Donatello.

Late Check Out), overall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Awesome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The hotel was very clean & well kept. Both our rooms were Hugh compared to some rooms I have stayed in San Francisco & included a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, coffee, utensils, etc. The room had a pull out sofa which was larger than normal & the king size bed was awesome. There is lots of storage space for your clothes, either in drawers or in a closet. The bathrooms were a good size which I think could accommodate someone in a wheelchair, but if you are someone who needs wheelchair access I would suggest you contact the hotel just to make sure. All rooms have flat screen TV's, CD & DVD players. There are windows in the room that do open just enough so that a child can't fall out, which I like as I prefer fresh air over a ventilation system, however it did have both. With the windows open I did sometime notice the noise at night but I did have the option of closing the window plus you are in San Francisco what can one expect. The hotel provides a FREE, yes free, continental breakfast every morning, which included bagels, muffins, pastries, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, orange juice which was good enough to get you through the morning. On Friday afternoons they also provide a FREE, yes free, 2 hr wine & cheese tasting on the Club floor which is at the top of the hotel where the continental breakfast is provided each morning & where there is a small but adequate gym, co-ed whirlpool & sauna\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in each of the change rooms, which also have showers. The Gym, whirlpool, sauna's & change rooms were VERY well kept. The hotel is conveniently located about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the BART's Powell St station, which is San Francisco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s light rail subway system that runs from San Francisco International Airport & only costs a mere $5.35 US per person one way & takes approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get from the airport to the Powell St station, which I highly recommend as its quick & cheap plus I think the BART is the cleanest public transit system I've been on in years, in fact there were people walking through the train on our way to the hotel picking up garbage, talk about impressive. The overall location of the hotel was great, close to Union Square for those who like to shop, lots of restaurants, China town was a few blocks away & access to the BART, MUNI, buses & street cars were only a few minutes away. I took a street car (not a Cable car, they are $5.00 per person) from one of the many stations located on Market St ( which is which is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel) to Fisherman's Warf & it was only $1.50 per person one way & the transfer I was given was good for almost 3 hrs. At the hotel both the Concierge desk on the main floor or the one on the Club floor can make arrangements for all your travel needs (Tours, Restaurants, etc) & at reasonable prices. One thing to keep in mind parking in San Francisco is not cheap, so if you can get by without renting a car try using there transit systems, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awesome. This hotel was great for me (a 46 yr old professional male) & my friends, in short, if you want a clean, friendly, well located & reasonably priced hotel, try The Donatello.

I have lived in SF for many years so I know the area and was not surprised by all the beggars and other bad and ugly elements that show up, mostly late at night, in that area. What I did not expect was to stay in such a disgusting room with paint peeling and mildew. The people at the reception are very nice but were totally ineffective. We arrived at the hotel two hours before the check-in time. Jesus, who somebody recommended for a review and a raise, and maybe he deserves it, welcomed us and checked us in. He took our mobile number and said that he will try to have us checked in as soon as possible and will call us when the room is ready. We never received the call and upon our return to the hotel we found out that the room was ready but that they forgot to call us - no big deal. What was a concern to us was the fact that the concierge could not find our luggage. It took him several minutes to realize that his colleague has left them in a conference room near the lobby - the door to that room was unlocked and anybody could have entered the room and take the luggage from there. With our hearts still pounding we took the elevator (dirty and in need of renovation) to the ninth floor. Our room was away from the street, which is highly recommended in this area, with a view of a car rental place and some other shady hotels and apartments in the same block - just next to the ice-maker and the door to the maintenance room - not such a big deal unless you want to sleep late in the morning. The worse part was the bathroom - SEE some pics attached. I called the \"effective\" and nice people at the reception and asked to speak to the manager. \"no problem - he will get back to you very soon\". I called 3 times and left 3 messages and I never received a call back from the manager. I can go on with other examples of how ineffective the staff is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but all I can say is that I will never stay there again, not even for free.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThe great combination of value, comfort, service and location\u201d", "Author": "aorrdalca", "ReviewID": "UR21363456", "Content": "We just spent a week at the Donatello, a clean, spacious and well-located hotel very close to Union Square.

We stayed on the 8th floor close to the elevators and never once heard the sounds from anyone in the hall. There was a wall of windows fronting Post street, and we loved having the natural light with the curtains open. Perhaps we're heavy sleepers, but with the windows closed and the air on, we slept very well. One night that I left the windows open, I was disturbed by the trash collection going on early in the morning. We tried out the new jacuzzi in the workout area and had a great time. We were the only ones using the tub, and using a tip learned here on TripAdvisor, I set the timer on the womens' sauna before entering the jacuzzi so that the sauna would be nice and hot after our soak in the jacuzzi. Unfortunately for me, either I don't know how to use the sauna or it was broken. Either way, I was disappointed. My husband had a great 15 minutes in the mens' sauna and wanted to return every evening. We only had the free continental breakfast only once during our four night stay. It seemed to be very carb heavy with lots of donuts and bagels, and not what we normally have for breakfast so we decided to go out all other times. There are many diners, and coffee shops nearby in any direction. You will definitely find something to eat. I appreciated the free San Francisco Chronicle and US Today available, and also the coffee and tea available throughout the day. I would definitely recommend this property as a good middle of the road hotel with very large rooms in San Francisco. If you want to spend more money for luxury then you should do so.

Based on TA advice we requested, previous to our arrival, a room on the highest floor and on the backside of the hotel to get away from the noise. We were given room 1011 (Floors 12 & 14 are apparently VIP/expensive rooms). Our view was poor as expected, but with the AC on, we never heard any noise at night, and very little during the day. Loved it. After getting information on activities, we were given an offer to see Muir Woods free if we sit through an information spiel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153updating us on using our benefits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

INTERNET: We used it everyday and never experienced any problems. The BATHROOM was a little smaller than expected. Only 5x8 including the tub/shower combo. The whole room is well planned, except for the waste of space across from the bathroom. If the room entrance had been moved from the center, the bathroom could have been at least 50% larger. The toilet flushed very loud. The BED was reasonably comfortable, but a little hard. We are spoiled with a foam mattress at home. We ended up putting the extra sofa sleeper sheets from the closet on top of the bedding/comforter, and then covering ourselves with the extra sheet and blankets. We then slept more comfortably. CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST: See pics - Reg & Nonfat milk/various coffees & teas/tasty OJ; good donuts/pastries/muffins; bananas/apples/oranges; bagels/cream cheese/butter/jams; Many TA folks have complained about the breakfast. Perhaps some do not understand that this is a classic continental breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a buffet. Nonetheless, how hard is it to add little cereal boxes? And regardless of anything else, we are in the year 2008 and it is just very poor not to have yogurt, which is a staple of quick breakfasts today. If you get in there in the first hour, food selection is fine. After that, the selection diminishes quickly. The selection also seemed to diminish during the week from Monday to Thursday, but then Friday and Saturday were decent. Outside there were 2 tables with 4 & 2 chairs, and also 2 lounge chairs. With a light jacket it is very nice to enjoy your meal outside. Inside there are 4 caf\u00c3\u00a9 tables with 3 chairs each, and also 4 sofa chairs and one sofa. Seating is hit and miss after about 7:30am. We ate there a couple of times, otherwise we just brought our food back to the room. FITNESS CENTER: Very minimal EQUIPMENT: 1 stair stepper, 1 stationary cycle, 1 treadmill, set of free weights; meager universal machine, scale and water dispenser. Small but adequate separate SAUNAS. You may need to turn it on and then wait 15 minutes or more for it to warm up as I did on all 3 occasions I used it. The aluminum JACUZZI is brand new and a bit small. The first time I could barely fit in with several other people in it. The next 2 occasions, there was never more than 1 other person. They have towels, locker room, showers etc. LOCATION IS EXCELLENT! Just a block from Union Square and 5 blocks from Powell and Market. You can get half-price tickets at TIX in Union Square for numerous plays, comedy clubs and entertainment venues. 1 block from Biscuits & Blues where we listened to some great blues. Ruby Skye club across the street. 1 1/2 blocks from Colibri Mexican Restaurant which was great. 1 1/2 blocks from the American Conservatory Theater which is a very nice theater where we saw \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rock n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Roll\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 1 1/2 blocks from the Curran Theater which was a decent theater in which we saw \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spring Awakening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 1 Block from Honey Honey Caf\u00c3\u00a9 & Crepery which is great for a sandwich or burger and excellent for an omelet or a crepe. Innumerable eating, shopping and entertainment establishments very close by. MASSAGE 4 blocks from the Union Square Stress Reduction Center (on Sutter before Kearny) where we both got an excellent massage for $50 per hour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend a ridiculous $105 per hour at this hotel. If your calves hurt like ours, this was almost a necessity. IF YOU WALK places like we love to do, and you are here for more than a couple days, we highly suggest that you take the cable car or buses when going upward or downward. We both jog/walk a couple times a week. Nonetheless, walking up and down the hills now and then during our stay caused both of us significant and unusual discomfort in our legs and shins after a couple of days. We used the sauna and Jacuzzi only 3 times, but we needed to use it every single day. TRANSPORTATION: Unless you are traveling away from San Francisco, driving is completely unnecessary and probably frustrating. Public transportation is fun and inexpensive. The MUNI pass is only $24 for seven days. We highly recommend the City Pass for $59 which includes the 7-day MUNI pass and the $25 admission to the California Academy of Sciences (a MUST SEE!), a 1-hour bay cruise which is cool, and a few other good attractions. Last year we stayed at the Le Meridien Hotel on Battery Street near Embarcadero Plaza and Pier 1. It is a better hotel with a great location too. However, given a choice of the two at the same price, we would stay at the Donatello because the location is the best, and the free internet which we used to explore SF every day.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co.

Unlike some other reviewers, we didn't have any problems with noise from the street even though it was Friday and Saturday and we could see the entrance to a nightclub from our 15th floor window. The only negative is the breakfast. It's fine if you're happy with coffeee, croisants, bagels, fresh fruits and gooey gunky sweet muffins, but the breakfast room itself is very small and nowhere near able to seat all the guests who come in so most ended up taking their breakfasts to their rooms to eat. Again, fine if you don't mind doing that but something to be aware of. Location is very good and it seems quite critical. We popped over to look at the Hotel California which is only a couple of blocks away and one we were considering staying at. But those couple of blocks make a big difference.

The bathroom was very clean but could use some updating such as the tub caulking in a few spots showed some \"age spots\". So if you are one of those people who is picky about such things, this lovely hotel might not be for you. My complaint is that the shower really sucked (can I use that word?); I felt like I was being shot at by a fire hose! I like a soothing shower after a long day and being shot at by a water canon like shower was VERY unpleasant.

The comforter on the bed was probably the heaviest one I have ever found in a hotel. Room was very bright and colorful.

Also, despite other guest's comments, we were never bothered about attending timeshare. The breakfast was nothing special. I say you're better off buying some cereal & milk from Walgreens & eating that each morning than eating their sugary offerings.

Maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a little jaded because I had such high expectations (and had read some great reveiws) and was disappointed from the very beginning. This hotel has some good qualities, but a few minor improvements here and there could make it a lot better. The bad: Dated rooms, poor communication and check in, questionable housekeeping The good: Good location, Lounge with coffee and tea, Free Wi-fi... The parts that made me sad: Before checking, I called to see if I could get some assistance, we were celebrating our anniversary and I wanted to get some ideas and restaurant listings. Well, I called several times and they kept transferring me to someone else, then someone else, and then leave a voicemail (and I did and was never called back), but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too big of a deal. We got to the hotel (after a very long trip and flight delay) about 15 minutes AFTER check in time, (which was perfect in my mind because I really wanted to check in and relax). When we got there, they said our room wasn't ready yet because the people who had been in the room previously had requested a late check out. So they proceeded to call housekeeping to have the room cleaned. They said our room would be ready in 15 minutes (is that all it takes to clean a room?); we could have a seat in the lobby or go up to the lounge on the 15th floor and have some coffee. We elected to go up to the lounge and they said they would send someone up with the keys. Well, over half an hour later, we were still waiting, so I asked the concierge in the lounge if they could check to see if our room was ready yet. The answer was, yes, it was almost ready, but we would have to go back downstairs to get our keys because the bellboy was busy. And please keep in mind that we were dragging our luggage around this whole time. And they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to apologize or thank us for waiting. So we finally got into our room. And I am usually a very happy person. I was NOT happy to be moved around back and forth because they failed to plan well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6They let someone else stay late and made us wait because of it. I have stayed in many hotels all over SF, and I appreciate and recognize the difficulties that come with antique buildings. I expected thin walls and even though we were on the 11th floor, we were able to hear traffic outside. This was expected. However, I was kind of surprised at the large gap at the bottom of our room door, it allowed quite a bit of light through (making it hard to sleep for me), but can be covered with a towel. The room showed its age, was not cleaned very well, as there were documents from the last guests left in our room. The couch was a lumpy looking nightmare; the cushions didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to fit right. They seem to be pretty cheap here. A hotel booking website lists that they have free breakfast, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is actually $4 for 1 glass of orange juice and 2 pastries. Spend your money elsewhere; there are tons of great restaurants in SF. The housekeeping staff left me somewhat puzzled day after day. On some days, we would receive replacement toiletries, some days we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. When we got there, there was only 1 bathrobe (for 2 people), but they were nice enough to bring another one at our request. But then on another day, they took both robes and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t replace them. They even gave us a used shampoo on one day. The maid also came in when we had the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 She said she thought that we had left. Those were some unusual experiences for me, but I figure they were just oversights..? On a side note regarding housekeeping, I came across a coffee spill in the lobby that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned for 2 days\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not too sure if they regularly look around and clean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And then 2 days after I checked out, they charged me $1 for a soda I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink. When I called to ask about it, I got transferred 3 times and was told, \"well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only $1\" but she would ask to see IF they could refund it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153courtesy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even drink soda. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my fault if they miscounted something. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about the dollar, but in the travel and hotel industry, I expect a different standard. The parts that made me happy: The concierge (both downstairs and upstairs) were friendly and seemed willing to help. Wi-fi in the room, as well as a computer in the lobby for guest use was nice. This hotel is in a pretty good location, very close to Union Square (but you are in SF; so there will be beggars anywhere you go), the lounge upstairs has some nice views. The lounge also has coffee, tea and hot chocolate all day. This was a small little perk that I really liked, especially considering the cold weather. They also have umbrellas in the room in case it rains. The rooms are a nice size for SF. The safe in the room was big enough for our laptop! New TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6There are a lot of nice things about this hotel, but they need to tighten some of their employee and organization issues.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Donatello!\u201d", "Author": "Citprof", "ReviewID": "UR13874220", "Content": "I stayed for two nights over the President's Day weekend & just loved the Donatello!! I was there on a RCI exchange. The staff just couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful! The lobby concierge Shari was so great, felt like we were old pals by the time I left. Room was huge! The Club level was really nice to get a cup of tea & it would've been nice to sit outside when the weather was nicer. There was a great little cafe across the street (think it was La Tezza), lots of yummy fresh food, soup was killer! The refrigerator & microwave in the room, along with the kitchen amenities made it easy to skip restaurants. Tip: go to the ferry building & get some wonderful cheese, sourdough, & some wine & have your own little feast. The Donatello has a GREAT location & easy to get to transportation...BUT make sure you buy your Muni pass at the airport, then take the BART in to Montgomery Station & walk straight down Post Street to the hotel, about 5 easy blocks. DON'T get off at Powell Street, especially dragging luggage, crowded, crazy people, and some folks begging. Always go straight down Post to Montgomery/Market, then you can catch the underground Muni to the Embarcadero & the ferry building, or catch the F-Market, the old streetcars that will take you all along Fisherman's Wharf.--although it was an easy walk down Market to the ferry building too. There are taxis right across the street from the Donatello if you need one too, fare was about $6 to the ferry building (I was running late for my Napa tour) and fare was about $9 from the end of fisherman's wharf by the Maritime Museum (my feet just couldn't take anymore walking/standing!) Although do venture down Powell to the beginning of the cable car route, fun way to see different neighborhoods & heck, you have to if you're in San Francisco!! 8-) Tip: Get a Muni pass at the airport, it will be good for the underground Muni, street cars, buses, and even the cable cars. The Underground Muni is not the same as BART, even though they share terminals, BART is the train you can take in from the airport, RT to Montgomery was $10.70 My fav. travel book: Dummies Guide to San Francisco, gave me all kinds of great tips!

It was ok, but if you have a room over the street, don't expect to get much sleep unless you crank the room's forced-air fan.

We could hear every word the workers said. I went to the window and found out the latch didn't close all the way so I called the front desk, but they didn't seem very interested. The next few nights we turned the fan up and it drowned out most of the noise, but then we ended up with that irritated sinus feeling from all the dry air.

The front desk, bellhop, and housekeeping staff are very well trained, friendly and have great customer service. The location of the hotel is ideal for shopping, sightseeing and tends to dodge landing straight in the middle of all the tourists. A plus in my opinion. Given the prime downtown location the rooms are also pretty quiet. A bit of street noise heard occasionally but nothing overwhelming. The only thing that seemed a bit off and didn't quite seem to blend with the friendly personality of the rest of the staff was the concierge. The concierge seemed friendly until we didn't want to go to their Napa time share property presentation. I found this to be a bit standoffish and kind of goes against the friendly nature of the rest of the staff. Just an observation.

The Donatello is a clean property, located is a fairly good area within one block of Union Square and the Powell-Hyde Cable Car line. We were offered an upgrade to a Terrace Room, but were not informed by the front desk that a Terrace Room has no air conditioning! When I raised the issue the next morning that the air conditioning didn't work (nothing in the room indicated that), I was greeted with somewhat of a response of \"duh!! you were in a Terrace Room!...and a Terrace Room has no air conditioning!\" In addition, we had a service tech up to our room twice because we could get no hot water in the shower. He said he did not have the replacement part, and he could only take it apart and have it scalding hot or cold. So we had cold water ..and I mean cold water for showers. In addition, the television was barely visible with \"snowy\" reception. When we went to the Club Level for continental breakfast after being told the restaurant does not serve breakfast, we found the continental breakfast consisted of donuts, orange juice, and coffee. No cereal, no yogurt, no fruit. When I reaised the issue of lousy TV reception, no air condinotioning, and cold water at the front desk at check-out, I was still charged full price, and told they would have the manager call or email me the same day. I am still waiting for a call or email two days later. On the positive side, our hot room was clean and fairly spacious.

You can hardly get a bed in a shared room at the YMCA in Manhattan for that price. However, we were charged exactly the price I had reserved online, and the quality of our room and the hotel were great. The front desk people were also extremely friendly and professional, a lot more so than at most hotels we have been to. The decor is nice, the bed is comfortable, and having a microwave, fridge, sink, cups and other kitechen supplies was very convenient. The closet is also quite large for a hotel room. Also, the turn down service, including chocolates, is a very nice touch for such an affordable hotel. The location of the Donatello, as many other guests have said, is pretty good. Close to the Market Street Bart stop, cable car, and various buses, which we all used, and it's very easy to catch a cab right next to the hotel, which we also did. There's great shopping nearby, as well as Walgreen's and other convenience stores/delis, and a pretty good 24-hour diner about a block or two away (down the street parallel to Market Street.) I do have a few gripes, though. For instance, I called the Donatello a few days before our stay to make sure they had our reservation, and I asked them at that time if they thought we'd be able to check in at about noon, which is when we expected to arrive at the hotel. The man I spoke with indicated with confidence that this should not be a problem at all. However, when we got there, around noon, there were no clean rooms available. It was a little hard on us to walk around town for a couple hours, having been up since about 3 am DC time. That said, they did tell us we could sit in the club room upstairs if we wanted, and also, they took my cell phone number and called me at around 2 pm, I think, to let me know our room was available. They had let us leave our luggage, and the bellboy brought our suitcases up immediately after we arrived at our room. Another gripe- there was a lot of car-horn honking every night, all night, and a lot of noise from people on the streets below. I think the car lot just below our window belonged to Hertz, but I'm not sure about that. We are quite used to urban noise, and still found the noises hard to get used to. Also, we didn't have any view to speak of- just that car lot and the backs and tops of some nearby buildings. And one final gripe, although we did really like this hotel- when we checked in, there was one hotel staff member who tried to get us to go on some kind of \"free\" tour, with some kind of nice breakfast, which requires that you endure some kind of pitch for a timeshare, or something like that. I didn't listen too attentively, as we already had our own plans, but I find that kind of thing very annoying. I think they give that spiel to every guest. Anyway, despite a few gripes, we were very pleased with the Donatello, and we would definitely stay there again, as long as the price stays in an affordable range. One more thing- there's a nice place for a dessert, breakfast or light meal about a block or two from the hotel on Post Street (away from Market Street).

We drove up Saturday morning from Monterey, CA to see Spiderman 3 on the IMAX at the Metreon and to go to the nightclub Ruby Skye. We couln't have picked a better location. Period. Upon our arrival, the bellhop was curteous and very patient as I unloaded ALL the crap I had brought for my 1 night stay (you know how many shoes women like to bring!). Mark, the front desk man, was extremely nice. When I entered our hotel room, I was astonished at the size of the room! If you've visited San Francisco, then you are aware that most normal hotel rooms are pretty tiny. This room had to be around 400 sq. feet! It was very modernly designed and the comforter on the bed was one of the softest I have slept under. We hadn't been in our room more than 10 minutes when there was a knock at the door and the maid was there to give us our complimentary bath robes. The concierge also called to say she was sorry she had missed us when we checked in, and to come down for our free maps of San Francisco (which had an AWESOME map of all the shopping places). Talk about great service! I've visited 5 star hotels and not been paid attention to this much. They have a jacuzzi, and men/women dry saunas as well as a fitness club. I didn't get a chance to visit their restaurant Zingari, but it looked very nice. The biggest WOW for me was when my husband and I opened the curtains to check out our view and TADA! Ruby Skye was DIRECTLY in front of us. We could literally CRAWL home from the club if we needed to. ;) So instead of showing up at the club at 10pm to avoid the line, and then waiting until 1am for the headlining DJ to come on, we were able to drink our alcoholic beverages in our room and peek out the window every 15 minutes or so to make sure the line wasn't getting too long. It was so great! For all you Ruby Skye visitors, we were in room 601.

Only two blocks away from the hustling busyness of Union Square and its myriad of shops, restaurants, and malls. The hotel itself, is slightly set away from this conglomeration, so it was actually quieter than we initially anticipated. Also, only several blocks away is the SF cable car route, which we caught several rides on throughout our stay - truly enjoyable! Only one minor hiccup in our long, weekend stay. The concierge wasn't entirely helpful in giving us advice on things to do, places to eat or see. We informed that this was our first time to SF together, and essentially gave him a few expectations of what we would like. In return, it seemed as though we received a lot of canned responses or pieces of paper/brochures shoved our way. After nearly 10 minutes, we gave up and just set out to explore on our own.

After we had gotten settled into our room, which I felt was quite large for a studio in the city, we asked for recommendations for somewhere nearby to eat and the guys in the lobby pointed us to Max's across the street. Good food! After returning from lunch we were suprised to find a bottle of champagne and chocolates in the room congratulating us from the staff, and we didn't even mention that we were just married. When we went down to thank the guys at the front desk for the gesture we asked where to go for drinks and maybe go dancing. Not only did Deo give us great suggestion he also got us on the guest list for the club right across the street which was a blast. The desk clerks and bellmen paid a lot of attention to our needs and seemed very knowledgable. Marianne and Mark gave me great advice on the shopping nearby and the guys in the lobby; Deo, Chris and Nick, should have been annoyed with all my questions but instead were so helpful. In fact they even gave us great advice for our trip to Hawaii. I read other reviews of this hotel and it's true the staff is very helpful and we felt that they gave us very personalized service. I did however have a problem with the tv during our stay which was dealt with quickly, but we really didn't have much time to sit in the room and watch tv. Our stay inclduded a light continental breakfast which consisted of pastries, but I recommend going to Dottie's a couple of blocks away. The outside noise that others have complained about did not bother us. Yeah the hotel itself could offer more ammenities like a better breakfast or newer tv and dvd players but we would definetly return and recommend this hotel just on the experience we had with everyone we encountered.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "enk56", "ReviewID": "UR5231763", "Content": "Very good hotel.

San Francisco has a very inexpensive and efficient bus and subway system which I highly recommend. The room was superb, large with just the right amount and quality of ammenities. Since all rooms at the Donatello are king bedded it was wonderful having the pull-out sofa bed (an absolute must for people traveling with children or parents). Everyone at the hotel couldn't have been nicer. Very very friendly staff. But San Francisco is like that, people who are just nice to each other. We did not use the Club level with fitness room, jacuzzi, or concierge. We did however, go up to see it and were quite pleased. We could hear street noise from our room, but it wasn't that bad. The windows all open which is nice if you like the outside air, but the in room climate control was adequate. If you are sensitive to big city noises, then perhaps a large chain hotel with many stories is the place to stay.

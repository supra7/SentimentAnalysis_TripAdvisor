The hotel was clean, roomy and comfortable, and the food in the dining room was excellent! The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful. The pool was very nice too -- large and with plenty of umbrella tables and lounge chairs. I really had a great time here! The only drawbacks were the fact that there is nothing of real interest within walking distance, and you have to pay $10/night for parking, which seems excessive, since the parking isn't really secure. However, with a room rate of approx. $125/night, it's still a good deal overall. If you do have access to a car, the bus/metro station is within a short driving distance.

Upon entering the lobby, you see worn, ill fitting and stained carpet, furniture that is outdated and airplanes hanging from the ceiling. There are clocks showing the time in various countries, but none of them, including the local time are correct. When I asked about the differences in time, I was told the batteries needed to be replaced. Upon checking in, I was told that there was a $10/day charge to park my car, nowhere on their website was this addressed, nor was the additional daily charge to use their antiquated \"business center\". The room was large and the linens were clean. The first day there, my car would not start, the battery was dead. I asked the front desk for a jump and was told they couldn't help \"due to the liability\" and the hotel van was not available to take me to my destination. I paid $15 round trip for a cab. The cleaning and maintenance staff were pleasant. But on the second day, someone walked into the room after 2 knocks to exchange a hotel directory, she didn't introduce herself, I still don't know who she was. The WiFi did not work most of the 4 days there. I was told that my room was in between routers? After 2 engineers came to investigate the problem, it still didn't work. The food in the diningroom, with a limited menu, and the snack area was decent, but certainly not more than a 2 star rating. The signage showed vending machines on each floor, but the only one I found was outside by the pool. The old heating/air conditioner either put out very cold or very hot air, was not able to adjust it to a comfortable setting. There is a display in the lobby showing what their renovations will look like but I will never see them since I will never go back to that hotel. I was able to get the parking fee credited, after some arguing with the front desk clerk, because their website does NOT make reference to the charge. My grand finale' was at 3:45am when one of the employees was to take me to the Flyaway bus. He was not able to start the hotel van. After 5 minutes of trying to start it, he finally went inside for help. When he came back, he started it right away. He told me one of the older employees, he was new on the job, had played a trick on him and told him to breath on the steering wheel to start it. Normally, this would have been funny to me, but due to the delay, I missed the 4am bus and had to wait a 1/2 hour for another.

Well.............\u201d", "Author": "Djinnphiz", "ReviewID": "UR124961948", "Content": "If you are an aviation fanatic and don't mind being on the edge of Van Nuys airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the attendant over-flight of some quite noisy planes and helicopters, then this place is not \"too bad\". (NOT that there is an amazing amount of alternative choices available locally...) Patently, there is an \"old\" part and a \"new part\" to this establishment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and whilst the new part is as neutral and sterile as any similar hotel of this class, the older part is definitely in severe need of a \"freshening\". The staff are OK - mostly. In general, they were both helpful and welcoming: then again I had a couple if contacts that lacked both warmth, welcome and empathy. Perhaps I'm overly critical. Everyone is entitled to an \"off\" day... EXCEPT in the hospitality industry. I guess that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as a Manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you get what you pay for, and for sure there was no-one overtly and obviously destined to greater things within the possibilities of some other better class of (internationally-reaching) establishment. The bar-fare is typically carbo-heavy USA-style. With a touch of Mexican influence. The service here was proficient if not other than neutral in character. Which \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is OK. One doesn't always want one's Barman to be one's \"best friend\" either... The buffet breakfast was more-or-less correct for this kind of hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was finally good to find some fresh vegetables and even fruit. The bacon was D-licious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the omellette majorly sucked. As with most other places of this kind that I've experienced in the US, the coffee and tea was indifferent and typically devoid of any class or style: being of the simple, passe-partout blends that reflect economic considerations and a culinary ignorance born out of commercial pragmatism. I was in the New Wing and the accommodation was equivalent to my expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a decent sized room, clean, efficient AC and with functional but indifferent furniture. The TV offered what it was supposed to offer as entertainment, the bathroom was as it should be and everything that I could see was as clean as one might expect: but this is not the kind of establishment where I would necessarily be overtly looking under the bed... The mattress was OK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as were the pillows. All-in-all, a very standard, and honest, room with no unpleasant surprises. There is a \"kind-of\" coffee shop in the entrance that offers a limited assortment of seemingly not very fresh, and obviously commercially-derived buns, cakes and other typical American stomach-stuffers. The coffee could almost have been a kind or ersatz \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so very ordinary was it in taste. Not impressed either by the styrofoam cups... The swimming pool is a strange \"L\" shape and, unfortunately, due to it's steps at both ends \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with rounded corners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's impossible to really do any laps, if so inclined... The surroundings are soulless, and the usual easy-maintenance but characterless, concrete, sunbathing area, was furnished with some equally banal plastic lounges, some of which were broken and needed maintenance. The only interesting detail about this hotel are some of the pictures that are displayed on the corridor walls and which depict the quite interesting pictorial devolution of the airport from its foundation days. Indeed, with the aircraft hanging from the ceiling in the entrance lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that provides some kind of focus of interest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the place very much rests on its laurels as an erstwhile welcomer of aeronautically-interested fans. I guess at the start of the airport in those early days, there wasn't very much choice at all for accommodation locally... It seems to have survived and modestly thrived through being a useful conference facility serving the environs. Quite who its clients are in this area I was not able to discern. But \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hey! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why not...? I wouldn't see it personally as having a particular \"retreat attraction factor\", but for that day-long meeting serving the needs of provincial businessmen, its facilities are more than adequate. No doubt it also serves well for local marriage, and other celebratory functions. All of which is good... I don't know what it is in the 'States - as opposed to Europe or Australasia. Maybe because \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as a statistical fact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so few Americans actually have passports and travel abroad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (and so are not able to educate themselves as to other traveller's standards) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it would seem that there are really only three categories of hotels. The VERY good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amongst which could also be classified the \"boutique\" establishments; the pretentiously \"good\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but which are, by international standards, actually rather ordinary; and then there are the \"in-and-out\"-category \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what I personally think-of as \"service\" hotels: such as the Motel Chains and the small, privately-run places along the highways \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or on the outskirts of the town. This hotel would sit at the bottom end of the middle category: essentially a trifle more pretentious than it really ought to be and living off a \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once past, \"local reknown\". Cast aside this pretentiousness and all other things considered, therefore, I would rate this hotel as entirely \"pedestrian\" and of \"limited merit' \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its sole, and main, attractive point being that for anyone flying out of Van Nuys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for whatever reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is convenient. Other than that, it really is no better than most any other hotel of the same genre and only differentiates itself from a Motel-Chain quality of establishment through \u00e2\u20ac\u201c precisely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its pretensions to be more than it isn't, and will never be.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crete, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPretty Nice\u201d", "Author": "DawnD57", "ReviewID": "UR124603311", "Content": "I stayed here just after I had come in at LAX.

My husband and I had our wedding reception at this hotel back in September 2010. For a bit, we were concerned since during our wedding planning event coordinators would quit, and then we would be assigned to someone else.this happened 3 times. so that was scary, but then we were assigned to Alma Garrison. Boy we couldn't have been in better hands! Unfortunately , she also quit a few months after our wedding, but also the other event coordinators were very very professional, very helpful. Alma was by far the best though. Friendly and very professional, with amazing ideas and very understanding of the stress of planning a wedding. All the staff was pretty amazing during the planning and the day of the wedding. They even did some things for us that would have costed us money and they threw them in for free. The food is sooooo good! They did a great job in decorating, attending to our guests.they were open to following a recipe I created for a signature drink, and they served it. The banquet room was awesome. Our guests have reported that during the cocktail hour while we were taking pictures, they never ran out of appetizers and that they were very good. We got to stay in a terrace spa suite for our wedding night, wow! so pretty, huge terrace right in front of the runway. Some people may not like it though because of the noise,, but we loved it! We didn't have any problems checking in or out, and apparently no other family members had any issues. We had like 30 rooms rented and things went pretty smoothly. We have been back for dinner and lunch, and still, food is great. Hotel and rooms are older, but this hotel in the middle of Van Nuys, not such a great area, is pretty cute and has a special charm. So far, we have had good experiences with them, we have been back just to have dinner and lunch at their restaurant, Landings, and again very very good experience, food is great.

Check in was smooth but they do charge $12 for parking. The parking lot is not secure and I did notice some broken glass in the parking lot. We stayed in the newer tower but the room was just ok. Some members of our family complained the room had a certain odor. The new tower rooms are located near their convention center/ballroom. The first evening we were there, someone was having a Quincea\u00c3\u00b1era (party). The front desk did offer to move us (but Im not sure why they would put us so close since the music was quite loud to begin with). One thing that bothered me was that the entry into the hotel was NOT secured. So anyone could gain access to the hotel. The newer tower is away from the front desk so I would keep this in mind if you decide to stay here. We had breakfast in the buffet and it was typical with fruits, breads, eggs, etc. Pool was ok.

I think it is a very good price for a hotel in California. We did have some issues, though. When we arrived, we had booked a room with one bed because it was all that was available. We would have preferred 2 beds, and when we arrived, they said they had a room available with 2 beds. After we checked in, parked, and carried all of our luggage to the room, there was 1 bed in it. I called the desk, and spoke to someone who must not have been at the front desk. After 2 confusing phone calls, the front desk called me back, and told me they gave me the wrong room. They did correct it and gave us a room with 2 beds. Parking was also included with our room, but I wasn't sure it would be. That was nice, but when we went to leave the lot, we hadn't been given the ticket we were supposed to have. This was corrected, too, but required another trip to the front desk. The issue that concerned me was that one day we had no towels. That was ok, and we called the desk and asked for them. When we returned to our room, the bolt lock that you use on the inside of the room was left on the outside of the door, so our room door was not shut. The worst part is, there is also no safe in the room, so any valuables we had left in the room were left completely unguarded. I have no idea why they left it this way. There was a maid down the hall, and towels had been left in our bathroom. Regardless, it disturbed me that our door would be left open for any period of time. Nothing had been taken, but most of our valuables were with us (wallet, credit cards, jewelry, etc) So, in the end, I could recommend staying here. Like I said, for the price it's great.

ITheir Universal Package with hotel and discount tixkets were cheaper than any of the hotels we shopped around that were closer to Universsal. For those that want a tip, I suggest taking the complimentary hotel shuttle to the Metro less than a mile away and take the Metro to Uiversal, so for about $1.25 each and 20 minutes later, we were at the bottom of Universal Shuttle stop.

You can get a great rate but you will pay for any extras. I got a rate of $69.00 through Priceline and that was far below what the other hotels are averaging. You will be charged $10 a day for parking, $3 for internet usage (free wireless though), no provided breakfast, and 1 cup of coffee in maker provided in the room. I also asked for a courtesey upgrade to a suite since none were occupied but was quickly denied unless I wanted to pay. The hotel itself was very clean and I was impressed that the maintenece staff took as much pride on the outside grounds as they did on the inside. The airport next door is extremely busy and sometimes the small jets were very loud but never noticed the noise during the night. I was usually awakend around 6 or 7 am by aircraft. The two spas by the courtyard were well maintained and the courtyard itself was very nice. The main pool is quite a walk though from the tower rooms. I also believe the tower rooms are much bigger and better for a family. The beds were very nice as well. We never heard noise from any other room but that is usually dependent on who is next to you. I did not have a problem with the neighborhood. It seemed safe enough and the parking lot was secured nicely with a paid parking attendant. We really did not find any restaurants in the area that we wanted to visit. The area is aging as well as the eating places. If you are flying into LAX and taking the Flyaway to the hotel, get ready to walk. I might walk if I was by myself and carrying a duffle bag. Otherwise, be sure you have transport to the hotel. I am guessing a half of a mile or more. Getting in and out of the hotel lot was very easy. You are about a mile or two to the 405 and traffic to the highway was never an issue. We visited Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Venice Beach and Universal Studios. It took about 20 minutes to get to Hollywood. Traffic was always heavy but moving. It was actually a nice trip through the mountains. I would suggest this hotel if you are willing to drive a little.

So take this review with a grain of salt, because the Airtel Plaza Hotel speaks right to my aeronautical infatuation. However, even if this property was located somewhere else and not done up with some of the airplane kitsch, I'd still think it was a pretty pleasant place to stay. My room appeared to be fairly recently remodeled. The decor was pleasing ... a nod toward modern minimalism, yet comfortable. One can tell that before the remodel this was probably a pretty standard large motel-type property. The renovations, though, have made this property quite comfortable. There are a few items that still seem a bit cheap: the plastic surround shower/bath, wood veneer doors, dresser drawers that looked a bit out of place, the low-quality A/C heater unit below the windows. But those are minor. The room was comfy with a bed with great linens and pillows and a desk with a nice ergonomic desk chair. Bath linens were fine ... not the fluffiest or whitest, but just fine. Carpet was clean and seemed pretty new. I did order a pizza from room service, which was pretty tasty and delivered within 20 minutes.

I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Its main attractions are probably that it (1) is right next to the Van Nuys airport, and it (2) is in the Los Angeles area. So, unless you have a need to be right at the Van Nuys airport (to catch an early flight the next morning, say) or you really like aircraft, you'd probably do better somewhere else. The room I stayed in was comfortable and had basic amenities. There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. I didn't care for the decor, nor the style of the bed (ugly headboard). The room and bathroom were very clean, and everything functioned. Being at the Van Nuys airport the hotel lobby naturally has an airplane motif: Pan Am posters and other nostalgia everywhere. Very nice to look at! I really liked the large, articulated model of a Boeing 747 hanging from the ceiling. Other miscellaneous items: breakfast was not provided, and parking was $9. I'm told charging for parking is \"normal\" for the area, but there are certain levels of hospitality I expect. Charging someone to stay in the hotel, then charging them to park their vehicle, is a little low in my book. The bottom line is: I've paid less and received more at other places.

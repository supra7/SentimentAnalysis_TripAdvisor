First off how is it that you consider yourselves a 4 star and supposedly a convention center at this particular location and yet you are charging $13 per Day for Wi/-Fi??.. That is Outrageous!! Shouldn't providing free or at least affordable access to business tools be a part of boasting a business friendly atmosphere.?? .. And dont tell me about becoming a HH honors member because first off I don't travel to the extent where i would build up hotel points like that ( So what if I'm the little guy, and not some big whig with a limitless budget) That shouldn't matter. We were there for 8 days the Internet alone would've cost us $104! I don't pay that much for a month's worth at home!!.. And On top of the cost of our stay. Which was well over $800 even on Priceiline.. at those prices plus $13 per day to self park or $23 per day for valet , certainly providing free WI-FI wouldn't break the Hilton hotel bank! And if you are going to pretend to conpete with the real 4 star hotels please replace those old Dell computers in your business center.. And as another reviewer wrote the noise in this hotel was beyond reasonable.. One night I had to call the front desk because something kept slamming really hard right outside our door. It stopped scout an hour later but I continued to hear it off and on throughout the other nights and some mornings even..during the remainder of our stay. So I can only assume that it was those loud doors on each room. And housekeeping is so loud in the morning it's ridiculous!! There was noise every morning both over our heads and outside our door, starting at around 7 am.:( Now, finally and ( only because I am tired of typing and not because I don't have anything else to do or more to say) last but not least let me not forget the dingy towels. I mean come'on Hilton. I know your little signs in the bathroom about saving water and being energy efficient and earth friendly are cute and all, but really ??...who do you think you are fooling,? Certainly not your guest, we know the profits you retain from not replacing or washing as many go back into your pockets. But for cleanliness and customer satisfaction sake, I strongly suggest that you invest in some new ones and instruct your housekeeping staff to replace them when white begins to appear gray :(., ..

Overall the hotel looks nice and has plenty of ammenities to offer. I only spent one night, before flying out of DFW recently. Here are the pros and cons: Pros: The hotel and lobby are beautiful. The hotel looks and feels luxurious, and is decorated well. The lobby has several bars and eateries, and places just to hang out. The staff is friendly and helpful. The concierge was great, reccommended and made us a reservation at a lovely steakhouse. The hotel shuttle is convenient and the driver was really interesting and funny. The rooms are HUGE and brand new. The decorations and furnishing are not the normal drab Hilton stuff, but actually look like a designer was in the room. Our room had two flat screen TVs, and the bedroom was seperated by a half wall where the living room and kitchen were. Bathroom was separate with a walk in dressing area. The bathroom itself was quite small, however. Cons: The biggest con is the sleep quality. The fan in the room made a loud woosh/clicking noise every time it turned on or off, which woke me up about every hour. Then, between 3 and 4 AM, the people in the room next to us were so loud that both my husband and I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep. They were coming and going from the room so we could hear the door slam repeatedly. We could hear everything that was said in the hallway, and we could even hear loud talking through the wall. This is surprising because if you remember how our room was set up, our neighbors were on the far side by the living room, away from the bed, and behind another half wall. It was by far the loudest night I've ever spent in a hotel. When we complained the next morning we were told we were the first people to ever stay in the room and they would look into the air duct noise. We were offered complimentary parking as consolation for the noisy neighbors. The other dissapointment here is the executive lounge. As Hilton Diamond members, I've seen some great perks and lounges in various hotels. The week we stayed the lounge was under going renovation, so was temporarily moved to a small conference room. There was no view, and limited seating. The food that was offered in the evening was good and appreciated. However no free drinks is a bit of a disappointment. We ended up just going to the bar in the lobby for a drink, since the ambiance was much better. You must pay to use the business center. I believe there was free wireless, but since I was travelling without a computer, I had no access without paying. Average: Gym is small but great selection of equipment. It was full, but I was able to use what I wanted. Parking fees are average. Breakfast at the hotel was good, nothing to rave about. Overall, the sleep quality at this hotel made it really miserable for me. But, I do believe this could be a great property once the kinks are worked out.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice Hilton\u201d", "Author": "PShermanATL", "ReviewID": "UR121297337", "Content": "Very nice Hilton with an extremly nice staff.

Over this time I have come to see the pros/cons of this hotel. Before you read the nitty-gritty, I want you to know that I enjoy this hotel and actively seek it out when I come to Dallas. Overall, it's a nice hotel with a wonderful staff. If you get a good room rate it's definitely worth staying here. Pros: Nice rooms - the rooms are your standard hotel rooms. I have noticed that some rooms are better than others. If you can request it, ask for an odd numbered room. The hotel is curved shaped and I've noticed if you stay on the West side (odd numbers) of the hotel you get a bigger room. Recently I've been put on the East side (even numbers) and my room is noticeably smaller. Most recently I've been put at the end of the hallway and this is by far the smallest room. The poor room service guy can' hardly walk between the bed and the TV armoire. Since I mostly travel solo it's no big deal for me, but if I were traveling with my wife/small kids we'd have no room for the 2 playpens. Try to get a room closer to the elevator and on the West side of the hotel. Beds - I've been in about 15 different rooms while here at the hotel. Each one has had quality mattresses and pillows. Good room service - The room service food is excellent. I can only assume you'd get just as good food if you went to the restaurant downstairs. I'm just too lazy and like to do work and have my food brought to me. Nice gym - the gym looks like it was recently remodeled. They have a bike, a few stair-masters, 3 treadmills and some free weights. They also have some balance bubbles as well as medicine balls. Each exercise unit has a personal TV attached to it to help take your mind off of working out. They also have a nice pool. The best part is that all of their equipment is in working order. I have stayed at other hotels in the Dallas area (Hilton chains) and their exercise equipment wasn't always in working condition. Quiet - For the most part, I do not hear my neighbors. If someone is talking loudly I will hear them, but it's not like the walls are paper thin. Friendly Staff - everyone has been very helpful and made me feel welcome. I have not run into any rude staff members. Cons: Probably my biggest complaint about the hotel is the lack of a microwave. They have a mini-fridge, but no microwave. I'd like to be able to heat up leftovers sometimes. Also, if you have a small kid like we do, you wont be able to heat water to warm a bottle. Parking - self parking is $12 a day. It's not like they try to hide this from you, but just know going into it that you'll pay $12.99 a day extra to park. Also, the parking garage isn't exactly attached to the hotel. I've noticed that most people walk across the property to get to the garage (I did my first few weeks). However, there's a tunnel that connects the parking garage to the hotel. It's not all that well marked. Ask the front desk and they can point you in the right direction. This is a helpful thing to know, esp on a hot or rainy day. Traffic - the hotel is located at 2 major highway intersections (Tollway and 635). Getting into and out of the hotel can be tricky, especially during rush hour when everyone is doing 60 MPH on the access road while trying to get on/off the highway. I would hope it's better during the weekend, but during the week it can pose a challenge for those who are timid drivers.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oro Valley, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "berniss", "ReviewID": "UR67302522", "Content": "I arrived after a stay at the Palomar in Philadelphia and this was a large hotel by comparison.

Another reviewer made mention that the clientele was mainly business travelers, which is probably true, but we did see some families and couples here and there. There were a few discreet events going on (receptions and a baby shower), but nothing loud. There is a small snack bar that serves Starbucks coffee/baked goods, but it isn't open all day and it does not have the full Starbucks menu.

No flat screen tv's or anything too special, but the hallways and rooms do have a comfortable and luxurious feel to them. Staff: everyone seemed friendly. Lady who checked me in offered two twin beds at first but was more than happy to find a king bed room for me when asked. Food: we ate at Crockett's restaurant one night and the food was very good. Had a steak and it was cooked perfectly and delicious. All-in-all I would recommend this hotel for business travelers or anyone looking for a safe and clean place to stay. There were several conferences taking place while we were there. Great atmosphere. The one criticism I would have is that they made you pay for wireless internet in the room.

With that said, I will mention the positives: I like hard beds, and found the beds to be hard and comfortable. If, like some of my coworkers, you prefer soft beds, you are out of luck. The pillows were also comfortable. The room was fairly quiet, and although I was on the 16th floor, I never had to wait long for an elevator. Internet access was expensive but fairly reliable. Now the negatives: I guess they still allow some smoking in this hotel. I was on a supposed no smoking floor, but my room and the hallways smelled faintly of stale cigarettes. I was assigned a room with two double beds - I can't remember the last time I slept in a double bed. I am very tall and find queen or king to be much more comfortable. The TV was small and of the picture tube variety. Most TV stations did not come in very well. No bath robe in the room - I hate that. The gym was tiny and totally inadequate for a hotel with 20 floors. The gym consisted of 4 treadmills, two ellipticals, a bike and miscellaneous free weights. I had to go to the gym late at night to get a treadmill/elliptical. When I complained at the desk, I was told the gym was not normally busy, and it was just unfortunate that I was there at the same time as a meeting with a bunch of young guys. There is another gym in LIncoln Center, but the Hilton did not offer free guest passes to irate guests. Hilton guests can use the other gym for a price. I like to work out in the mornings, but could not get a treadmill at 6 am during my 4 days at the Hilton. Restaurant selection in this hotel is dismal - not much to choose from. It was very inconvenient to have to leave the hotel every night for a decent meal at a reasonable price. The hotel has shuttle service to the mall once an hour. Which brings me to another big problem for this hotel - it is totally isolated in the middle of the highway. You cannot walk anywhere without crossing a highway. This Hilton was not even ideal for a meeting - the first day of our meeting we had constant problems with the audio system. The meeting rooms were noisy - there was a lot of foot traffic on the tile floors in the hallway outside the room. Consideration should be given to carpeting the hallway. Overall, I could not believe this hotel is part of the Hilton chain. Although lately I find myself saying that about quite a few hotels in other once upscale chains as well.

They are remodeling - it covered the entrances and lobby when we were there in December but has since cleared out and now the lobby looks nice. They fall in with everyone else in this area (haven't found anyone with free self-park or a decently priced valet) with parking. It was $20 for valet and $12 for self park in their garage. FYI to a tip I received - they are in a kind of business center so there is other parking it is just not theirs so you can park without paying but you do so at your own risk of tickets/towing. I've parked else where twice with no problems. The December check-in was uneventful. The January check-in was irritating because after being questioned if we were parking with them (we answered no) they said that the self park fee would be added to our room at which we again insisted we were not parking with them. Instead of letting it go the person then begins to lecture us about towing/tickets - not their parking lot - I tuned him out after the first few minutes. It was a bad enough spill (I'm sure they have to tell you but the delivery of this message needs to be improved) that it upset me for a good rest of the evening because the delivery makes you feel as if you are stupid and not capable of assessing the risk and reading the signs in the parking lot. We got our keys after a nice little bit of this speech and went to our room. The rooms are decent. There are not any bugs and they are clean. My one pet peeve is that a hotel that lists itself as 4 star has no fridge, microwave or extra amenities. They even charge a pretty penny for their internet which is not even competitve (makes me feel like they are trying to squeeze me for money) because there are other hotels in the area that do not charge or charge much less. Plus starbucks is right up the street or at the mall for free wifi - these rooms are not nice enough to make me want to stay and pay for the internet. In conclusion the outside, lobby and entrance are much more immpressive than the rooms and if you are looking for a clean place to sleep with a coffee maker and nothing else - this is it.

There was even a dinning table to set all of our stuff on. Then there is the living room, that had a huge corner couch and the blinds open up to a entire wall that is a window. The bedroom had a awesome bed and another table and chairs. The bathroom had a jetted tub and a shower. The toilet was in a separate room in the bathroom which was nice when we are both in there in the morning. Needless to say the room was amazing and we were there last Thursday night when all the OU fans and alums were checking in. We met some really cool people in town for the game. We went to go eat at Cricket's but there was not a lot of stuff on the menu to choose from so we asked our waiter, and he gave us a few options that were close by, were we could go. He really didn't have to do that, but it was really nice of him. Since we both have been drinking for a few hours up in the room, we decided to just go back up to the room and order room service. I had the bacon cheese burger ( on a wheat bun) which really hit the spot. My wife had the crab and avocado salad, which she loved and could not stop talking about. So we just sat up in the room, ate and watched the entire Season 5 of \"Curb your Enthusiasm\" which we brought along with a portable DVD player. Most of the movies that the hotel had, we already have seen. It is always good to have a back up plan. The total of the room service was $45.00, but I would pay that any day to spend a quite and very romantic evening with my wonderful wife. The next morning, I woke up before my wife and I wanted to be a nice husband and go get her breakfast and bring it back up to the room for her so she could have breakfast in bed. Well, I went down there and they said I could not bring it up to the room...Oh Well. On my way back up to the room to wake up my wife, I stopped by the Starbucks right by the lobby and picked up 2 Caramel Macchiato's and went to wake up my wife. Then we went to breakfast at the downstairs restaurant. It was a buffet thing and it was like $17.00 each. It was a good thing I got vouchers for a free breakfast. I mean, I'm glad it was free, but the food was really good for a hotel breakfast. It was all the same stuff the other hotels have, it was just better. I think it was the bacon, it was really good.

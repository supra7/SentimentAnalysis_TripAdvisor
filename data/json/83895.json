The one thing that keeps me from giving this hotel a better rating is the problems we had with the Internet. The hotel advertises free wifi, but we had constant trouble connecting in our room eventhough we had the router right next to the conputer. We called for help and they came and said that is just the way it is and even the desk has trouble off and on. I was able to get our boarding passes using the computer in the lobby, though it had connection problems as well. So, if you are depending on Internet access, I would not stay at this hotel.

The hotel is about 20 minutes from downtown. I was impressed with the hotel considering it is a \"budget\" brand. I thought the value was great. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which is great when I travel with my daughter. I love being able to put her to bed in a separate room. The room was a good size , very clean and the bed was comfortable. It was very chilly when we visited but I noticed that the pool was heated and we decided to give it a try. The pool was immaculate and was warm enough for us to enjoy on a dreary 55 degree day. I was not expecting that and my daughter was thrilled. The only draw back was road noise from I-15 which was right outside our window. I think that some rooms probably face away from the highway and are probably much quieter.

If you are the kind of person that expects a luxury spa hotel, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here go to the Hotel Del Cornado and pay 5 times more. If you want a clean, safe place with plenty of FREE parking in San Diego, I recommend this hotel. It is 15 minutes away from the zoo, down town, sea world and most everything you want to do on S. D. Lego land is 18 miles away and about 30 to 40 minutes. The staff is nice and the rooms are good. The hotel pool and hot tub is kept nicely. The FREE breakfast was a little better than your standard continental breakfast. Every morning there is at least some form of hot meat and eggs. The coffee is fresh and there is an attendant that takes care of everything. The most disappointing part was the happy hour. Yes, there is free beer and wine, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcso called\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 light dinner consists of chips and salsa.

We have never stayed at any Comfort Suites and driving up to the property, we were pretty happy! The actual location of the hotel is right off the 15 freeway at Mira Mesa Blvd., so seeing it is very easy. However, the only cumbersome part of getting to the hotel is that you have to drive all the way up to the Scripps Ranch Blvd. and then make a U-turn to get to the other side. If you're staying here for several days, it just gets a little tedious, but not a big deal. There is free parking which is great, but since it is shared with the Holiday Inn Express next door, it can get a little difficult to find a spot if you're arriving late in the evening and during a weekend. For the most part, this wasn't much of an issue. Checking in was a breeze and once we got our keys, we went to our room and was really happy with it. The room itself had a nice flow to it and since it was tucked away in the corner, it felt very cozy and was quiet. Entering into our room, first you came across the living space that had a pull-out sofa. We didn't personally use it, but the sofa itself was comfortable to sit on. There is a TV, wet bar, mini refrigerator, and microwave - all very convenient to have if you'd like to heat up some food and store beverages. The bathroom was quite small, but functional. It was nice to have the sink basin outside of the shower area so that one person could be taking a shower and then the other could be outside washing up with no hassle. The bedroom was very nice. There was a small hanging closet with an iron and ironing board, dresser, and another TV. Off to the side, there was a small armchair to relax in. We absolutely loved the bed and slept like rocks every night we were there. The decor was very inviting with green curtains and it blocked out the outside light pretty well. We were very fortunate to have a room that faced away from the parking lot and the swimming pool. Being away from it allowed the room to stay cool. That just improved our sleep quality, as after a long day of being out, there was a nice retreat to come back to. My only problem with the room was that the soundproofing was pretty bad, as you could clearly hear people walk above you and when the water would turn on for the shower, or when the toilet was flushed. If you're a light sleeper or don't want to get up early, I'd suggest getting a room on the top floor (4th). We didn't get a chance to try the swimming pool and jacuzzi, but it looked like a decent size. The jacuzzi was very popular, albeit a bit small. The pool wasn't huge, and you certainly couldn't do laps in it, but it is a good size to play around in. Perfect for the kids. The internet was left to be desired, as it was painfully slow, unless you used it during the day or early in the morning. We ended up using our phone as our portable modem to surf the internet. Thankfully, we weren't in our room for a lot of the day. Overall, I'd have to say that this place is a pretty good option if you want to save some money from staying in Downtown SD. We enjoyed the inviting atmosphere of the room, and the layout of the hotel itself is quite nice. The energy doesn't feel stifled or forced. The front desk was quick to check us in, but the guy was a bit too whiny, so that was a little unprofessional, but not a major problem. The breakfast was very basic, but at least you could make your own waffles, but since you are so close to a Trader Joe's market (across the street on Hilbert St.) and other eateries on the other side of the freeway, you're better off eating around there. It's called the Mira Mesa Market Center, and there you will find everything from In-N-Out Burger, Target, Edwards Cinemas, Pat and Oscar's, Chipotle, Jersey Mike's, Cold Stone Creamery. Within walking distance of the hotel, there is a Denny's, Japanese steakhouse, Afghan restaurant. Suffice to say, there are A LOT of options. :)", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Layton, Utah", "Title": "\u201cGood Location -\u201d", "Author": "Go2theZoo", "ReviewID": "UR100338464", "Content": "This was our third time staying at this hotel.

We originally chose it for it's central location between The Zoo/Sea World and The Wild Animal Park, however we have chosen to stay there again even when not visiting the Wild Animal Park. However since it is right off the freeway, we request a room facing the parking lot so as to avoid the freeway noise. The parking is a little tight as it is shared with another property. There is not a washer/dryer in the hotel, it is next door at the Holiday Inn. That's a little annoying, but not too bad if you know and plan ahead. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. They have always taken care of the minor problems we've had in a timely manner. The breakfast is very good.

The Holiday Inn Express is closed for renovations right now (January of 2011), so the parking was ample this time. Last time I stayed here, the parking lot was very crowded with tiny parking spaces. I was coming in late this time (around midnight), so I expected the worse in trying to park a big car. I was pleasantly surprised, but found out in the morning what the reason was. The rooms are nice for kids or individuals that don't go to bed at the same time. There is a door to the bedroom, so one can be asleep and the other person can read/watch TV to their heart's delight. We had the potential for a triple whammy in January as we had a 1st floor location right next to the pool on the inside, next to the fitness room on another side, and right across from the reception/party room of Holiday Inn Express. Yikes. However, it was too cold for the pool, the fitnesss center was vacant most of the time and walls were sufficient anyway, and with the Holiday Inn Express not open, no parties.

The door jamb that holds one of the security locks was coming loose. My in-laws had white flakes (I guess it was paint) all over their floor. They asked and were moved to a non-smoking room. They were told that one would be available in the afternoon. We came back to the hotel in the evening, and the hotel had moved their stuff and had already checked out their old room. There was a lack of parking. The Holiday Inn Express and the Quality Suites are RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. There was little or no parking available at night. It was so disgusting to my in-laws, that they checked out early and didn't even care if they got a refund on their last night!

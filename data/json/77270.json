The lobby is unpretentious, but the rooms are large and comfortable, the staff pleasant and helpful. Breakfast and parking are included in the the room rate. There is a small heated pool, which my grandchildren loved. Every room has a full kitchen. If you want a large fancy hotel with a gym, large pool and several restaurants, this is not for you.

The Hollywood Orchid Suites hotel lies just around the corner from Gramin's Chinese Theater, Madame Trousseau's House of Wax, Ripley's Believe It Or Not, and the famous walk of fame. There are five and a half miles of film, TV, radio and music Stars surrounding this hotel so you won't be bored if you just walk the streets for a couple days, which is exactly what my husband did while I was busy in seminars and meetings March 2012. I highly recommend a stay at this hotel but don't expect the pool to be heated. It was not the whole four days we were there. Other than that, the staff was nice, the suites included a full kitchen with pots and pans, so you could cook a full meal. A Fresh and Easy grocery store is walking distance away so we ate a number of meals in our room. Otherwise expect to pay at least $25 for lunch and more for dinner in neighboring restaurants like California Pizza Kitchen and the Hard Rock Cafe. Also, each suite has either a balcony or spacious patio deck. We had a patio deck and it was wonderful for smaller, informal meetings. Bring your camera and extra batteries because you'll take a lot of pictures. Oh, one last thing, make sure you check out the size of John Wayne's feet at the Chinese Theater.

Booked it based upon glowing recommendations on TA and am very pleased we did. We got a family suite with a super king bed in the lounge area plus a separate bedroom with another super king bed. I shared with my daughter and my husband with our son; we were concerned about being squished in the bed but to be honest we could almost all have shared one. THEY ARE ENORMOUS!! As other reviewers have said, this place is not palatial by any stretch. The rooms are very well used and are as clean as you could reasonably get a place which has painted kitchen cupboards. Housekeeping were great, the rooms were made up every day. The lady in the breakfast room was just lovely; she sliced my kids' croissants for them and couldn't do enough to help. All of the front desk staff were lovely too; couldn't have been better really. I take my hat off to them for storing our mountains of luggage on our last day between checking out & leaving for LAX. Definitely ask them for one of their bus / metro info sheets; they tell you where to catch buses for different destinations which really took some of the stress out of a trip to The Grove shopping centre (well worth a visit, esp to the farmer's market - fab pizza and doughnuts to die for!!!). Apparently when we were there we missed Jack Black filming... we were 100m away having lunch, so google it before you go as we were told that they advertise what's going to be happening there. Universal Studios is one stop away on the Metro... easy peasy.... there's a huge supermarket just further up Hollywood Boulevard - can't miss it... walk a couple of blocks and then it's down a flight of stairs on the right. We ate at the California Pizza Kitchen in the Hollywood/Highland centre (fabulous Skecher shop there - great prices for us kiwis)... which is right on your doorstep. Great service, great food and great prices. Also walked down N Highland Ave to Inn and Out Burger (yummo) on W Sunset Blvd. Just across the rd is a huge discount shoe shop (Off Broadway) where the kids got some well priced Adidas trainers & Nike hi-tops. I don't think we'd stay in this area if we were planning a longer trip around LA as it's not the most relaxing place to be (it is after all tourist central!!) but certainly can't fault The Orchid Suites :o)", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat spot - bargain for the location!\u201d", "Author": "Margyg", "ReviewID": "UR125364398", "Content": "I agree with the other reviewers of this property - the location is fantastic.

This was once an apartment complex that has been converted into a hotel. It's old and it is outdated. What they say is true, but the rooms are HUGE. Last weekend was my second stay and I have to say it is a great value and an awesome location for visiting Hollywood. Did I mention the rooms are huge? They have standard hotel rooms, but also huge suites. The rooms come with full sized kitchens and they have upgraded the furniture and televisions since my last stay. They also have secure parking. There is a heated pool and a rooftop garden. In the morning, they serve a pretty decent continental breakfast with juices, bagels, fruit, cereal, etc. They also have both a computer you can use in the breakfast area and free wi-fi. You have to understand that this is an old property, so it is quite dated, but it is clean. The only thing I found to be not as clean as I thought it should be was the shower curtain. I think it might have gotten missed as it was a little dirty on the inside. Otherwise, I feel comfortable staying here. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it's not a five star hotel. There are Marriotts I don't even give a five star to, but for what you get for the price, this is an amazing place to stay. Oh, the price! This visit I stayed in a one bedroom (king bed) suite with a living room sofa bed and of course, a full kitchen. It's was $140 out the door. That's an average cost for a hotel, but if you want something decent in this area of Hollywood, this is the only thing you will find at this price that isn't grungy. It's just a little piece of affordable Hollywood. If only they would nix the bedspreads and go to duvets! That's really my only complaint! Have I mentioned the location? Oh, it's right behind the Hollywood & Highland mall. Yes, that is where the Kodak Theater is (think Oscars) and the El Capitan is across the street, and Grauman's Chinese Theater is a couple blocks away. You are literally steps away from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We walked to the Palladium for a concert, but there is also a metro station right around the corner so you can literally get around LA and Hollywood very easily even if you don't have a vehicle or don't want to have to drive and park!

This could have been a really bad start to our holiday. Thanks for being honest :) The location was great. Many people told me that Holllywood was a bad place to stay, but the hotel location and that section of Hollywood Bouvelard was great. My thirteen year old son and I even went for a walk on Hollywood Bouvelard at 10:00 PM on New Years Eve, and I felt fine. The extra security of the hotel was appreciated including the locking underground parking. It was also very handy to have access to a washer and dryer to do a few loads of laundry. There was a grocery store approx. 4 blocks away that we could walk to that had everything we needed.

Lots of security getting into it but the front desk people were very friendly, helpful, and kind. Went up to our room...yes, it is an old apartment complex, but the room was huge! Large sitting area with attached kitchen, hallway to bedroom, and then bath area. Lots of storage area. The next best part after LOCATION is that it was very clean...especially the sheets...nice and crisp. Ok, the carpet is old and the linoleum in the bathroom is stained, but the tub, sink, toilet were clean. Couches in living room were plush and not seedy looking. They do ask you to clean the dishes you use but that's ok, especially since the dishes were nice and clean and new looking. I read reviews about it being noisy...yes, at times, it was but you are in the heart of Hollywood, not Beverly Hills....there are going to be some sirens and noise. Unfortunately, while we were there we had the flu (had it before we arrived) but I have to admit that, if I had to be sick, this was a nice place to be in.

After reading reviews on TA was aware of what to expect of the hotel. It was as it had been reported, a little dated but very clean and well kept. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment with a full kitchen which was much appreciated after staying in hotels. The apartment had a sofa bed and we requested a rollaway as we had 2 children with us. The bed in the main bedroom was very comfortable, however the sofa bed and roll away were very uncomfortable. I would suggest trying to book a two bedroom apartment to avoid this. The price of $465 including tax for 3 nights was very good considering there were four of us and it included breakfast. The breakfast was very good with choice of cereals, fresh fruit, bagels to toast, croissants, coffee, tea, juice etc and as much you wanted. There was always a very helpful staff member there to assist and even toast your bagel for you. All members of the staff were friendly and helpful, booking taxis,giving directions etc. The location was excellent right near Hollywood Blvd with the Hollywood and Highland Centre with shops and places to eat, Kodak Theatre and Metro a few steps away. Grauman's Chinese Theatre was a short walk up the street. On the day we visited Universal Studios it was good having the Metro so close and it was only one stop to get there. The cost was $1.50 each way. The only small complaint was that being on the ground floor we could hear some noise from upstairs on one of the afternoons when a child was running around but did not disturb us at night. I would ask for an upstairs unit to avoid this. If you are looking for somewhere to stay that is close to attractions, clean and reasonably priced I would recommend the Orchid Suites Hotel.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cFavorite Place in Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "purpletravler", "ReviewID": "UR123564574", "Content": "This is our third times check in to this hotel, the main reason is the great location, so close to Kodak Center, Metro station, Magic Castle.

There is a subway station in the same block which was great because we caught the well run and beautifully clean trains everywhere - one stop from Universal Studios - and only $21 for a 7 day Tap & Go pass. Also the Hop on Hop Off Bus stops just out the front in Hollywood Blvd which is great for orientation. The staff at Orchid Suites are extremely helpful and friendly. A special thanks to Marlo who came to our rescue when we got lost, well over and above the call of duty. Orchid Suites is an old apartment building so don't expect brand new 5 star rooms, they are a bit dated. However, they are spacious, very well appointed with excellent heating and cooling and are very kept very clean. We stayed in a deluxe suite which had a separate bedroom and a full kitchen with oven, fridge, coffee machine and microwave as well as crockery and cutlery all in very good condition. The lounge room had a large LCD TV and the bedroom LCD was not much smaller. The free breakfast is an absolute bonus. It's a continental breakfast, meaning of course, no hot stuff, but a great selection - muffins, bagels, croissant, cereal, toast, fruit and juice (see pics). The kitchen area is a bit tight and there are only three tables, but you can load up a tray and take it back to your room, which we preferred anyway.There is free secure parking which we didn't need but is yet another bonus if you do have a car. We paid $129 (before tax of course - never quite got used to that!) which we felt was amazing value for what we got.

By the end of our holiday we were almost broke so the fact that it is great value for money was what sealed it for us!

The parking is free and the continental breakfast is complimentary and was sufficient for us although our friends preferred to walk down the road for a breakfast of eggs and bacon - they are big breakfast eaters but we are quite happy with cereal, toast, muffins, fruit and juice. The place is spotless although a little dated. We had a one bedroom suite where the lounge had been removed and replaced with another double bed. To share accommodations proved to save us money just about everywhere we travelled. The loungeroom was very large so to have a bed in it wasn't a problem. The suite also had a full kitchen. It was also very quiet. If there was any complaint I could make it is the fact that the bedroom didn't have a door on it so there was little privacy. If you are going to book this type of suite to share you had better know the other people you are staying with well as you have to pass the bedroom to get to the bathroom ;) If you are interested, we paid US$135 per night so if you split this between two couples it was extremely cheap.

We also had 2 queen beds, a full kitchen and a table/chairs for 4. We took advantage of the kitchen to save money on dining and ate in 2 nights. There is a small supermarket that is only a 3-4 blocks away so we could easily buy food and bring it back. The parking was great. You used a key to get in and out so it felt like the car was safe and you could go in/out as much as you wanted. Breakfast was fine for a free, continental breakfast. The breakfast area was small but they provided trays to bring the food back to your room. And, with such a big room with a table to eat at, this worked out very well.

First let me start by saying my husband and I are in our late 30's. Hardly party animals, not noisy people by nature. We arrived in LA from the UK late afternoon and tried to get straight on LA time, but inevitably we were wide awake at 3am the following morning. We got up, took showers and dressed - all done quietly, no TV turned on or anything. Yet the front desk found it necessary to call us around 4.30am to say that someone had complained about the \"noise\"!!!! What, the noise of us walking to the bathroom and back and having showers??! I explained to the person who called that we had simply arisen early, showered & dressed and they said yes.....it was probably the sound of the shower! That night when the people upstairs above us arrived back after their day out and we could hear every single footstep, every creak of the floorboards, hear when they flushed the toilet and when the shower ran, we understood how our everyday living sounds could have been heard. Still, a bit rich to complain and worse still that the hotel then called us - as if it's our fault the walls and floors are so thin your neighbours can hear you? Clearly it's an ongoing issue - so the hotel need to deal with it, not put the onus on paying guests! I have read MANY other reviews saying the same - so if you are okay walking on eggshells out of fear of offending people, this is the hotel for you. To my mind though, a hotel should be used to dealing with international travellers from different time zones and making sure that the hotel can handle this. I can honestly say - hand on heart - that we did not make any excessive noise, or much noise at all. We felt very awkward after the complaint, and more than a little upset. The bathroom was very small and quite shabby - dirty tiles, grouting etc. The taps in the sink area were old, dirty and need replacing. The suite itself (room 210) is spacious, with a new flat screen TV and dresser but the whole place has a feel of being old and basic, but we are fine with that - after all, it was also on the whole clean, safe and roomy. The positives are the location - you cannot get closer to Hollywood Blvd, the Metro, Hollywood & Highland shopping centre and The Kodak Theatre without paying twice, three times the price. This is the trade off you make - you get a very reasonable price of $109 per night if you book through the hotel website. Breakfast was very good, the communal areas (pool, roof terrace, lobby, computer area etc) are all clean and well maintained. The staff here are simply wonderful. Every single person we interacted with was polite, attentive and helpful; they are a credit to the hotel. The housekeeping is spot on. I wanted to love this hotel. By the end of the holiday I was feeling better about it all. Would I return? Probably, just for the price and the location. The Wifi is very sketchy. We often could not pick up the hotel wifi and ended up being connected to another network which worked better! With some updating, replacements made to basic things such as faucets and some replacement carpeting/walls/soundproofing, this hotel could be a 5 out of 5.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cmy home away from home in Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "sistinas138", "ReviewID": "UR120113887", "Content": "I just got back from my most recent trip and spent 5 nights at the Hollywood Orchid suites. It was my 2nd visit to the Hollywood Orchid - my friend and I stayed there a couple of years ago and really liked it, the only reason we hadn't stayed there on our last trip that it was already booked! It is a small hotel & apparently rather popular so my advice is book well in advance to get your room :) If you book directly through the hotel's own website you will get the best rate, we booked a room with 2 double beds and a kitchenette (fridge & mini stove with 2 burners, a cabinet of pans & dishes & silverware but no microwave) It is nothing lavish andt the furnishings and rooms look a bit dated but the Hollywood Orchid Suites has lots going for it - #1 is LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. It is immediately hidden behind the big Hollywood and Highland complex, I mean immediately as in walk outside the loading docks & cross the street and there it is. From the pool area you see the back wall of the Kodak Theater a few feet away. We went to see the Cirque Du Soliel Iris show in that complex as well as a Jimmy Kimmel taping across the street and it was wonderful to have such a short walk and not worry about parking and traffic.You can also catch the subway from there up to Universal Studios. Parking is free (great value!) and quite adequate for the hotel. I got a chuckle out of the fact that every parking space is named for a celebrity, I had enough trouble remembering what my nondescript silver rental car looked like but I could remember if it was \"Brad Pitt\" or \"Angelina Jolie\" very easily : ) the staff are all very friendly and helpful and glad to recommend things in the neighborhood and post helpful ideas of what to do in the elevators. A very nice continental breakfast is provided and they have a computer set up with a printer in the 2nd floor breakfast area that was very handy for printing out tickets. My only (very) minor complaint is that their wifi isn't very strong and connecting is a bit spotty in the rooms but worked better in the hall and breakfast area, at least we were able to do what we needed to do and didn't spend that much time awake hanging in the hotel as we kept very busy! It is definitely nothing fancy and if you 1st class accomodations and la-ded-ah decorating then pay 3x as much and stay at the Renaissance next door but I find the Hollywood Orchid Suites to be a great value and nothing could be more convenient!

You're never sure what you've booked and sometimes maps are hard to read on the Internet (or maybe after 4 weeks travel we were just delerious). But wow! We were so close to many things! The Chinese Theatre, Stars on Hollywood Boulevard etc, the Train (Hollywood and Highland) so we could get to Universal Studios quickly and easily (one stop!) and the bus which we took to Venice Beach and also Rodeo Drive. The staff were great. We were impressed when we arrived in a taxi from Anaheim and the staff member was expecting us and then held the garage door open for us so we could wheel our bags to the lift rather than lug them up the stairs. Bliss. Breakfasts were a simple continental affair on the second floor - cereals, pastries, fruit, coffee , tea - but adequate. Not much space to eat there but trays were availbale and so we took ours to our room which was a great option with the kids. Our room was great. So spacious for the rate we paid. I thought they got our booking wrong! There was a separate bedroom in the rear which we gave to the kids,a and we took the bed in the main combined kitchen//dining area but did not lose out on space. (we wanted to access the fridge at night so it suited us ;-) The kitchen itself was basic and I couldn't imagine cooking much else than cheese on toast but who wants to cook on holidays in Hollywood anyway? Our bed turned out to be a little less comfortable than the kids. All it needed was a thicker mattress protector, which it seemed the kids room had. My only gripe was the smokers. The room was non-smoking but smokers were able to smoke on balconies, so we still encountered the smell as we wlake dor if we wanted to open our windows for fresh air -especially as our room was near the executive rooms which have their own private balconies and mostly has smokers in them :(", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic.\u201d", "Author": "VS0718", "ReviewID": "UR118549601", "Content": "We recently stayed here for 3 nights and loved it.

Nothing special when we arrived in front of the hotel, as the building looked a bit weary but clean. I found this hotel from TA (TripAdvisor) with good reviews stretched back to year 2009, and when I called, the front desk staff (Amalia) responded warmly including suggesting the room that may fit to the three of us. I brought her a small gift for her appreciating her valuable assistance through the phone. Okay, before the hotel itself, the location. Couldn't be more perfect. It's located at the heart of Hollywood itself. It's just behind the Kodak Theatre. We went to all major Hollywood attractions just by walking (Kodak Theater for Cirque du Soleil:Iris, you've just got to see this!, visited the MaxFactor Hollywood Museum, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Mann's Chinese Theatre, Hard Rock Cafe, Madame Tussauds, and others). There is also a shortcut to Hollywood Highland Mall (and Hollywood Boulevard) where you can shop and also have lots of choices for dining, further more, next to the mall is the Hollywood Highland Metro Station where we easily boarded the train for Universal Studios, just the next station away. There is also Budget Rent-a-Car across the street where then we rented a car (3-days) for trip to Disneyland, Santa Monica Beach, Griffith Park, Farmer's Market and other places. I found that returning the car very easy early in the morning and then walked back to the Hotel. Please be mindful that this is not a 5 star hotel but it fulfills your requirement of a safe, clean and quiet accomodaions with lots of extras. The room it self (Deluxe Suite) was very nice and spacious. More like an apartment. It has a living room with sofa bed, there is akitchen (complete with necessary utensils, pots and pans). A bed room with ample closet (another two at bathroom hallway). We took the advantage of having this kitchen and went to a grocery shop located in the neighborhood when we returned to the hotel late in the evening. There were two plasma TVs (one in the living room and another in the bedroom), really nice treat for myself and my son with our own favorite TV channels. Bathroom (with heater) were spotlessly clean with fine working hot/cold shower and decent water pressure. The housekeeping also great, they cleaned the room around 10-11 AM. Breakfast is included, although the breakfast corner is fairly small, you can always take them to your room where it has small dining table for 4. A paper bag is provided for this. A choices of croissants, muffins, frootloops/applejacks with fruits (bananas, apples) and coffee, tea and juices. These were more than enough to start your day. Another thing is the WiFi, I stayed in room 304 (or 305? I forgot) and it's fast. I chose 3rd floor as I was expecting no one will be stomping around above us but only expecting moderate WiFi reception, but turned out to be better. There is also a secured parking facility at no additional cost, located in the basement. Every guest will be given a key to open the automated door. Still at the parking level, there is coin laundry facility complete with ironing station and snack vending machine. There is also a pool but we didn't use it but on a warm-sunny day, this will be very inviting. Front staffs are always happy to assist you in giving directions and tips for the attractions. They even lightheartedly phoned a cab for us while we were having our breakfast before we checked out. I feel that I'd like to keep this as a secret, knowing this hotel, but when you're travelling with family surely you would've wanted this for the best value of your money can get.

The train station located in that area brings you to Universal Studio! You don't need a car if you live there. We even took bus to Santa Monica and came back in taxi with a fare of around $60 (for 4 pax). Overall it's a nice place to stay if you want to stay in Hollywood, as a first timer.

This hotel has got quite big rooms! We got a room on the 2nd floor on the front (Orchid Street). We liked it immediately. The door is on the inside of the building, next to the breakfast area (noisy in the morning) and in the same space as the reception. The trouble began at midnight, my girlfriend couldn't sleep because of some ticking noise from the A/C. I had my earplugs in, but when she told me, I heard it too and couldn't figure out what it was. I thought expanding metal parts because of a cold-warm effect. Next to that, we could hear the phone at the reception ring every time and you could hear people talk quite easily. Because of the clicking noise and not be able to sleep I went downstairs to the reception to ask if there was another room available. They didn't have one right away (I can understand that), but if I came back the following morning, they would see which rooms would be available. The problem with the ticking A/C was because of condenswater from the A/C on the floor above us, which dripped on our A/C. Could be solved by placing a towel on the A/C outside, but that's a workaround... The nice lady at the reception offered us two rooms. One just above us, and the other one on the back of the building with a patio. We gladly took the one on the back. Maybe the room was a little bit smaller (don't know for sure), but the in-room safe was even bigger and the patio was great! As long as I can have a good night sleep, I'm happy. Problem solved. For light sleepers I would recommend not to sleep on the front side of the building. Request a room on the side (pool) or back, in the morning there are a lot of trucks unloading in the shoppingmall. Now some facts; Room is big and clean, I like the in-room safe, fully equiped kitchen. The only downside and which is mentioned earlier, are the matresses, they are quite hard on your back, but I still managed to get a good night sleep out of it. Large gated underground parkingspace. Light breakfast, with quite fast refilling of items. The building is next to the Highland mall, so within one minute you are in the mall, within two minutes you are on the Walk of Fame.

Mum was disgusted however I thought this was just hilarious. They finally sent a plain clothed man to fix it who looked like someone they pulled off the street. On our second last day here the front desk man got drunk on the job. Some guests weren't impressed but mum and I were so used to the abnormalities of the hotel by then.

The Bad: the hotel is older (60s maybe) which is fine for the price, however the air conditioner was older and very loud and positioned 3 feet from the bed at the same height as the bed so I either had to chose between no air conditioning (a bit hot and stuffy with 3 people in the room) or near arctic conditions blowing on my back all night.

The included free secure parking was excellent and the free high speed internet really came in handy.

We went to Whiskey A Go-Go too where we saw Wild Child, an excellent Doors tribute band, and we had such a great time! Robby Krieger the original Doors guitarist and song writer even showed up and played!!! We got there early so we ended up eating there and the cheese burger & fries were really good. We also hit Barney's Beanery off Route 66 and had dinner there... it was so yummy! We also did a $20 Hollywood 2 hour star and it was fun. Brace yourself when the go over Mulholland Drive after the scenic stop lol Venice Beach was a great time but we did get a lot of venders asking us if we wanted to buy their music or needed a 4:20 prescription. We declined both a few times but they didn't hassle you after that. Even in San Diego you get asked a lot to go on their buggy rides. They are more persistent and you have to say no at least twice. We also went to the Griffith Observatory where the view alone is worth the drive up there! The huge telescopes were not open to the public during the afternoon so we didn't get a chance to view anything but the rest of the building was open and the exhibits were very interesting. We toured the Hollywood Bowl after that and learned a lot of history about the place. Both the Griffith and Bowl were free entry! We went to Chinatown in downtown L.A. for dinner and it was okay. We also went to San Diego and had lunch in Little Italy at Zucherros and the Tortellini with Fungi (mushrooms) , peas and pancetta was incredible. My husband ordered the chicken and veggies but didn't like it as much and ended up eating over a third of my pasta! I still was full and enjoyed the rest of our day trip to San Diego. We did the full Doors tour and even stopped at his old hotel room where we got to look inside and take pictures because the guest was leaving and gave us permission to look around.

After exhaustive searching by myself and my friend we decided the Hollywood Orchid Suites would be just the ticket! Happily I booked, with no issue. I arrived in LA on 3/12/11 and called the hotel to find out if it would be okay to check-in must later than the usual check in time. No problem, your room will be waiting for you. Excellent! Fast forward to later that night. After I am buzzed into the hotel (yes, buzzed in like an apartment building) I am met by the \"receptionist\" who appears to be the only one around trying to do everything (including informing a guest, who while trying to do laundry had the machine turn off on her, to push the electric cord in all the way and the machine will start again). I was checked in and handed a key with a large chunk of plastic attached which can only be likened to old fashioned computer punch cards. The key was for the garage gate, the hunk of plastic, the room key to 311. I make my way into the garage, park my car and proceed to the wide OPEN door to the hotel to a hallway that is pitch black. Now, the only way you can get into the garage is if you are a guest with a key for the gate. However, as a woman by herself, I found this to not be best circumstance to be in. Upon arriving on the third floor, I see a very long open hallway. Wondering where room 311 is I start down the hallway and low and behold, 311 is way down at the end. The issue with this? This section is almost separated from the rest of the rooms in the floor sharing space with a staircase, slop closet and another unidentifiable padlocked room. After several tries and a heavy shoulder I get the room door open. I enter a musty, dank room with the bed barely 5 ft from the door, sagging chairs, water stained ceiling, peeling paint, a rusty aged heater, filthy curtains, AC not on (when turned on not pumping anything out), a circuit breaker box, a cigarette burn on the bathroom counter, a bathroom fan that appears to not have been cleaned for years and the shower pipe separating from the wall. But the kitchen was spotless. Oh, and the reason the door was so hard to open as my friend discovered? The frame of the door looked like the door had been kicked in and then rehung. I immediately went downstairs to check out.

The kids loved being able to stand in the stars footprints at the Chinese Theatre (less than a 2 minute walk from our room). Additionally for us having a suite with two rooms (for considerably less than many others in the area charge for a twin) was fantastic. Despite being in the thick of it there was no noise that we noticed as its at the back of the Kodak Theatre and mall and down a side street so the noise was really non existant. The staff were great (saved us a fortune with their advice on tickets for Universal) and the trip to the Studios was less than a 10 min drive. The free parking was also a real bonus in that part of town. I would recommend this place (and have) to all - its not the Beverly Wiltshire but nor is it pretending to be and if you don't like the breakfast (cereal and muffins) then at the price of this place you can easily walk out to the mall and get something else.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Janice81", "ReviewID": "UR90522093", "Content": "The biggest plus about this hotel is its location - right in the heart of Hollywood, next door to a huge shopping mall (Hollywood & Highland) where there are tons of shops and also a train station underneath. It is also literally a 2 minute walk to Hollywood Blvd where there are more shops, eateries and tourist attractions like Madamme Tussauds etc. Also, the hotel has free internet (although only one computer available) for guests which was extremely handy - you can even use the printer available to print out maps, tickets etc. Staff was pretty friendly too. We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was spacious, clean and comfortable. The only complaint I had during our stay was that the walls are extremely paper thin. If you decide to stay there, I hope you have quiet neighbours. Because some of the rooms have kitchens within, we could hear cabinets opening and closing, cutlery, pots and pans banging around... on our first night, we also heard the TV from next door turned on... unfortunately he/she did not turn it off until 3am. If you have a room facing Orchid Avenue, which is also the street located at the back of the shopping centre, you will be woken up at 5-6am each day (I think only weekdays) by trucks unloading stuff for the shops in the shopping mall I presume. Lucky, I had ear plugs. If you don't mind noise or if you are a heavy sleeper then you won't have a problem. Otherwise, try and get a room which does not look out onto the street.

Our room (105) had plenty of space and our two sons were impressed with the large flat screen TV.

The lady managing the breakfast area is excellent and always happy to oblige with any requests. The location cannot be beaten for the price, and free parking and excellent WiFi thrown in.

It doesn't have those things and frankly, it doesn't need them. What the Orchid Suites does have is this: Helpful and friendly desk staff, clean but dated rooms and a location that's nigh impossible to beat for a visitor to Hollywood. Just steps from the Orchid Suites' front door is a passage into the Hollywood Highland center, right in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard: think Kodak Theater, Mann's Chinese Theater and more people trying to take you on celebrity tours than you can shake a stick at. It also puts you pretty much directly on top of a metro station that can take you to Universal Studios and beyond. Meanwhile, parking is free and the underground lot seems pretty secure, so if you've got a car you shouldn't have to worry about someone taking it for a joyride. The rooms themselves are fairly unexceptional, but there's little to complain about. We found our room to be clean and a little old... no surprises there. The floor was a little lumpy in spots and the suite could have probably used a renovation. But it was perfectly functional and given the choice of new carpet and a soft underlay underfoot or the affordable rates at the Orchid Suites, I'd go with the cheaper rate every time. Let me be clear, though: This is not a place that gets by on its location alone. With an older building like this, preserving the sense that it's clean is not an easy thing to do. Yet that was my first (quite pleasant) realization after checking in (\"this place *is* clean!\") If you're looking for luxury, go somewhere else. But if you're looking for somewhere to rest your weary bones for a reasonable price, this is the place. Clean, comfortable accommodation and a great location at a great price.

I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is located right behind the Kodak Theater. The location was absolutely awesome. It was about 2 minutes to the Hollywood at Highland Center and Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame. Also there is a metro station right next to the center so it's easy access to North Hollywood/Burbank, Wilshire Blvd and downtown. The hotel has free underground parking which is great for the location. It's also secured. So is the hotel, although I never felt unsafe in the area. The area seems pretty busy well into the night. We had a two bed room with kitchen and dining room and it was huge. The kitchen had everything you would need to cook yourself. It has a full fridge and stove, utensils and sink, you name it. The beds were queen size and extremely comfortable. The A/C was a little tricky to work but not impossible. They have wi-fi and they serve breakfast from about 8-10am. There is also a rooftop patio or gathering area but nothing was really going on up there when we checked it out. The pool looked fairly large and very clean but it was too chilly to use it anyway. The best way to describe this place is to picture all the new places you see that look horrible inside because they don't keep it up. Well this place is rather old but kept up very well. So it features a lot of true hard wood fixtures, old ceramics and older appliances, kept up very well. It reminded me a lot of my grandparents house. The best part was the cost. For the location and proximity to everything nearly possible, you can not beat the price at all. I would imagine that if there is a major event going on in Hollywood, you probably want to book early. But I went the week of the AFI Festival and got in fine and I don't believe the place was sold out (although by the end of the week the parking basement seems to get pretty full). And if something is going on, walk out to the boulevard and the chinese theater. You might see somebody. We saw Will Ferrell and Sylvester Stallone while there, and several other semi-famous stars too. There's even a Coldstone Creamery in the Center. And the California Pizza Kitchen was awesome.

A ten second stroll to the entrance of the Hollywood & Highland Shopping Mall followed by a thirty second stroll through the mall gets you to Hollywood Blvd and the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame. Approximately three minutes walk gets you to Fresh & Easy supermarket, CVS Pharmacy, Direct Shoe Warehouse (they stock designer shoes and handbags at cost price, ladies...) and souvenir shops. Other attractions on Hollywood Blvd include tour providers, chain stores, the Kodak Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, Madame Tussauds, Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian Theatres and Ripley's Believe it or Not. Public transport is readily available on Hollywood Blvd - buses (212/213/217/780 express) arrive frequently and travel directly to places such as CBS Studios, The Grove, Melrose Avenue, La Brea Tar Pits and the LA Museum of Art. The entrance to the Hollywood/Highland Metro station is opposite the eastbound bus stop. Universal Studios is one stop away from Hollywood/Highland station. Other areas that can be accessed by metro include Downtown, Chinatown, Long Beach and LAX. A one-way trip on the bus or train costs $1.50. Dining options in the area are countless - Hard Rock Cafe, Johnny Rockets, Hooters, Mel's Drive-in, Baja Fresh, McDonalds, California Pizza Kitchen, as well as the famous Frank & Musso Grill. There is a Starbucks next door to California Pizza Kitchen in the mall which offers free wi-fi and outdoor seating. The hotel provides a free continental breakfast daily from 8-10am, with items such as muffins, croissants, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, juice, tea and coffee on the menu. The hotel itself is dated but incredibly well-maintained. Rooms are spacious, beds comfortable, the kitchen well-stocked with crockery, cutlery, washing-up liquid, kitchen towels and the fridge was spotless and odour-free! The bathroom is sparkling, includes a shower over a bathtub, toilet, sink and a fantastic row of Hollywood-style lights above the bathroom mirror which makes make-up application a breeze (and just a teeny bit dangerous with make-up megastore Sephora so close by in the mall!). Room amenities include an in-room safe, flat-screen TV with 17 different channels to choose from, a small balcony with table and chairs, built-in wardrobe, chest of drawers, and two large, comfy armchairs.

Since my friend and I weren't travelling with a car, location was very important to us and we wanted to stay somewhere where it would be relatively easy to get around. Transport in LA isn't the best - hard to believe for such a modern city! I came across the Orchid Suites on a website, checked it out on Trip Advisor and it had pretty good reviews, so we booked the last room available for two people - a junior suite. I was expecting it to be small, but it was quite roomy, with two double beds, a kitchenette, a TV, nice bathroom, closet and safe, which came in very handy. There are many positives about the hotel. They include: * friendly hotel staff - I think the guy was called Marlo, he always had a friendly smile and was too happy to give advice and tips * free internet!! which was so handy, it was great being able to check your email in the morning and at night and print out tickets to theme parks * free continental breakfast every morning - we were so appreciate to have access to cereal, fresh fruit, muffins, bagels, tea, coffee every morning...it was simple but a great way to start the day of sightseeing * location, location, location! Just a walk to Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre (which is handy if you want to take a Starline Tour to any of the theme parks, around the city, etc), the metro is just down the street (which is just one stop away from Universal Studios) * decent sized swimming pool (which we didnt use) * free parking (which again, we didnt use but was a great option to guests who needed it) * decent sized rooms - more than enough space to store your suitcases. I was happy to have a decent sized fridge to store drinks and fruit too One tip if you're visiting LA and staying at the Orchid Suites - check out this website for details of upcoming premieres http://www.seeing-stars.com/Calendar/index.shtml#premieres Thanks to that website, I discovered that Angelina Jolie was having her premiere of \"Salt\" at the Chinese Theatre during our stay and since its just a walk away from the hotel, we was able to watch all the stars walk the red carpet and even had a moment with Angelina and Brad!", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cbest hotel ever!\u201d", "Author": "april_li", "ReviewID": "UR77171665", "Content": "good location, friendly staff, reasonable price, huge room!", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in a handy location - look elsewhere if you like 'boutique style' tho\u201d", "Author": "JC_Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR75325449", "Content": "We stayed here for 7 nights in August and loved this hotel.. not for the great views or the luxury accommodation (neither exist) but for the convenient location, space and value for money.

Facilities are great for the price - 24hr desk, free and secure parking (guaranteed space), decent sized pool, rooftop terrace, free Internet access, PC & printer plus a full kitchen (utensils & crockery are basic). Breakfast is called 'light continental' but there was lots of food on the buffet every morning so you won't go hungry - cereals, fruit, bagels (& cream cheese), croissants, muffins, tea, coffee, orange juice, etc. Plus, you can take it all back to your room or sit on the roof terrace to enjoy some sunshine with your meal. The staff were all very friendly and helpful - directing us to the closest supermarket (fresh & easy, just past the Chinese Theatre), printing maps for us when the PC was busy (usually at breakfast time & early evening) and booking a $55 fixed rate taxi deal to the airport. If you're someone who gets annoyed by small things when you're staying at a hotel (eg some people have pointed out that the bed sheets don't fit well.. they're right, they don't! We also had a leaky tap in the bathroom and a very slow running cold tap in the kitchen) or you like to have modern furnishings then you probably won't enjoy your stay here.

The room had two queen beds and full kitchen, dinette table, flat screen TV and bathroom with separate sink. The sink being separate worked out great when getting ready in the mornings. Although the room was dated, it was clean. We had a small balcony and table that looked out over Orchid Avenue which we did not use. Although we did not use the kitchen to cook it was nice having a fridge, plates, utensils and glasses to use when we brought home take out. The staff is friendly and useful. They have pamphlets near the front desk for sightseeing and ideas on things to do in Los Angeles. A continental breakfast was included with the usual fare of muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, tea and juice. There was a small pool but the weather was cool during our stay so we did not use it. There is a computer and printer which was handy when printing out our boarding passes. I loved the use of the free underground parking garage which always had plenty of parking. The hotel is not very aesthetically pleasing but it was such a bargain and a great base for traveling to all the sights we saw. The hotel is centrally located to Hollywood sight's and about a ten minute drive to Universal Studios and the Griffith Observatory. It is also near the scenic Mulholland drive and very easy to get around to most of the sights we saw. The furthest drive was Santa Monica which took around forty five minutes. The only issue was that there was some construction going on around the Hollywood and Highland mall which we were able to hear in the mornings but it did not impede on my sleep. One night they were some noisy neighbors that did wake me up around 4am but this is not the hotel's fault. What to do in Los Angeles Mulholland Drive: Nice scenic drive through the Hollywood Hills. They are some great scenic lookouts. Checkout Runyon Canyon Park for some trails. Getty Center: Beautiful architecture, gardens and grounds, also nice overview of LA Griffith Observatory: My favorite for a scenic overview of LA and the Hollywood Sign Universal Studios: pales in comparison to Florida Disney parks but had a great time here nonetheless. Favorite was the Simpson and Mummy ride. Rodeo Drive/Beverly Hills: Saw some really nice houses. I like 5th Avenue in NYC better in comparison to Rodeo. Farmer's Market and Grove: Although not an outdoor outlet complex, it reminded me of Woodbury Commons in NY, however much nicer. I really enjoyed the Farmer's market. Had some good old fashioned pistachio ice cream and great brazilian churrascaria. Santa Monica: The pier reminded me a little of Coney Island in Brooklyn but much nicer. I enjoyed the Third Street Promenade. Although the shops were nothing new they had a lot of my favorite ones on one small strip. Also kudos to the H&M there for having my size and the clothes not being in a disarray like most of the H&M stores in NYC. Had pretty good pizza at a place called Joe's but still not as good as pizza in NYC. It's the water...heh Venice Beach: the beach itself was mediocre. It reminded me of a inferior Greenwich village. Not my vibe but was fun to walk through. Felt that an hour there was enough. Hollywood: an inferior Times Square. You have to experience it but an hour is more than enough. Took a tour of the Kodak which I enjoyed. Unfortunately the theatre was covered in plastic due to construction for a new cirque du Soleil. Mel's Diner has the best burgers ever!

I was in town for the TCM Classic Film Festival. First, the MANY pros: -Price. $139/night, was approximately 1/3 the cost of the \"official hotel sponsors\"--the Roosevelt and the Rennaisance. -Very spacious room. It was more like a studio apartment than a hotel room with sleeping area, full kitchen, four-seat dining table, ample closet space, and bath with shower/tub combo. -Location. The property is right behind the Kodak Theater and adjacent to the back entrance of the shopping mall right next to the theater. One might think that the location in back of something else might make it more seedy or dangerous to walk around, but as a solo traveler, I can tell you that I felt much safer taking the quick right into the mall rather than venturing out onto the streets at night. -Attentive staff. The property is small enough that they recognize you quickly. You either have to use your room key or get buzzed into the front door. I never once managed to produce my key quicker than I was buzzed in. There is a security camera by the front door that they use to recognize you. Since I am a lone female, I requested a room near the front desk when I made my reservation and they honored it by giving me the closest one with a clear sight-line from the desk to my room. -Easy access to public transportation...no small feat in LA. I don't like to take long cab rides when I'm traveling alone so chose to use the Flyaway bus from LAX (thanks for the tip, Amazing Race!) to the Union Station stop then the Red metro train line to the stop just 1/2 block from the Orchid Suites. This is the first time I've taken public transport in LA. On the way from LAX, I was not familiar with the system/times so it took about 1.75 hours to make the trip. On the way back, I timed it better and was at the airport in just under one hour. -the small pool was clean, private and lovely. There is also a rooftop garden and sitting area on the top floor where I can imagine it would be nice to enjoy a drink with friends...especially if you want that drink with a smoke. -free wireless internet throughout the property. They issue you a security code at check-in. Two Cons: -beds are moderate. Not terrible, with springs sticking out, just not up to the level I'm used to at Westin, Hilton and Wyndham. I did manage to sleep fine, but it took a bit to get comfortable. -No view. The hotel is surrounded by parking lots/access roads on three sides. In conclusion, I thought the Orchid Suites was an excellent value and will certainly book there again next time I'm in town. Didn't cook anything in the kitchen (there are plenty of restaurants and quick stops in the area), but found the fridge to be a convenient and cheaper way to keep leftovers and drinks than going out for more.

The hotel itself is a pretty no frills motel style deal..we were lucky enough to get one of the few (I think there's 3?) rooms with a sun filled balcony. Really nice to relax on at the end of the day. The kitchen was handy with a full size fridge and would be great for families...bed's comfortable enough. Bathroom was fairly average and the shower water pressure wasn't great but for the price we paid who could complain! It was nice to be able to walk downstairs and collect a few things for breakfast and bring a plate back to your room...great having a pool too. Really it's all about location...sephora, johnny rockets, cpk, mac, cinemas, forever 21 you name it right on your doorstep. Universal studios is also only one stop on the subway away and super easy to get to. The Starline tours all leave from the HH mall too and only 30 seconds walk from the hotel. Def a good bet! just be sure you want to stay in the Hollywood area though..that was the only prob I had. it might be cleaner than before but it was still pretty seedy about as the night got on and we found the LA bus system a bit of a nightmare to try and navigate around!

NOT handicap friendly. Stairs up to check-in desk and to small elevator. Nice staff. Walls thin as paper. Decent breakfast. (coffee,tea, cereal, juice, muffins, bread, jam, fruit) Has a very sloooow but serviceable computer and printer for everyone. $15 per person shuttle bus from airport. (We didn't buy shuttle bus tickets ahead of time, but we did not go during high season) Did not rent a car. Jimmy Kimmel show, Madame Tussaud's, Graumann's, Kodak theatre, shopping centre and grocery store 1-4 blocks away from hotel. If it's the first time in Hollywood for you and you want to do the tourist thing, I would recommend taking hop-on hop-off Starlight bus tour for 2 days which office you will find about 2 blocks away from hotel. Although the subway & bus stops are about 2 blocks away from the hotel, you won't be able to identify trivial things like \"where Jim Carey stayed when he first came to Hollywood\" unless it's pointed out to you (like they do on the tour bus) and frankly, we just didn' t have enough time to plan and travel around by bus & subway (if you do take public transport, buy the $5 day pass for unlimited travel for the day) The tour bus also gets you to Santa Monica where you can walk (45 minutes) to Venice Beach. Souvenirs on Santa Monica Beach are 1/2 price on Venice Beach. You can also use the tour bus to go to downtown L.A., Chinatown (where you can bargain for items) , Farmers' Market, CBS Studios, Paramount Studios, Rodeo Drive, Melrose street, and to Universal Studios Theme Park (which we didn't go into). Went to Jay Leno show which was good. Also went to the Warner Bros tour. This is a very good tour and our tour guide Tara was extremely well informed and entertaining. Also went to 4 hour taping of \"New Adventures of Old Christine\". That actually went very quickly bc the emcee was incredibly funny. They give you pizza & water. For both Leno & \"New Adventures\" they say you can't bring in cameras, but as long as you don't use it, \"Leno\" won't take it away from you . Leno comes out before show & chats . If you ask nicely, he will usually take a pic with you. Will also stop and give you an autograph & shake your hand if you wait outside for about 1/2 hour after the taping. \"New Adventures\" will take your camera and hold it for you until you leave. It's a $25 taxi fare (one way) from the hotel to Burbank where Leno & Warner Brothers Studios are. NOT worth going to are Hollywood Wax Museum & Guinness World of Records Museum. Celebrity & TV & movie character Impersonators in front of Graumann's & Kodak theatre. To take pics with them, be ready to tip them $2 to $4. They don't ask for money and many tourists will not tip them, but remember this is what many of them do for a living. So the better the costume, the better the tip. Went to Los Angeles County Museum of Art - LACMA *sigh* Maybe it's bc I've been to the museums in Paris, New York & London, but I don't consider this a world class museum. Architecture is good, tho (I know that it gets raves from others so I was disappointed. I suggest you go to the Getty instead) Personally, I prefer New York bc everything is pretty close by and subway more extensive. L.A. is a very large and all the tourist attractions are far from each other.

Thankfully it was already 9:30 am and time for me to wake up anyway. When we were leaving, I peaked into a room that the housekeeping staff was cleaning. I was reassured by the thoroughness of their cleaning. They were pulling off all the linens on the beds and making sure that all the sheets were fresh for the next guests. I also got a kick out of the parking spaces. They named each of the spaces after a famous celebrity. I remember we were in the Al Pacino space for the duration of our stay.

If your plans are to see Hollywood and do all the \"touristy\" stuff, this the perfect hotel for you. Its located just behind the Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Center. Its a 2 Minute walk from the Hotel through a side-entrance of the shopping center and you have everythink you want to see right in front of you: Graumann's Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Hollywood Wax Musem, etc. etc.. The Shopping Center provides diverse possibilities to eat and shop. I can especially recommend the uWink bar, where you can order food and drinks and pay and play casual games on a touchscreen display located on every table and also at the bar. The italian restaurant on the second floor of the shopping center also has some really fine food for reasonable prices. If you want it a bit cheaper almost every fastfood franchise is located directly at the Hollywood Boulevard in front of the shopping center. Finally, if you plan to visit Universal Studios, in the shopping center there is a metro station. The very next station (direction North Hollywood) is Universal City. On the hotel: it has a very nice and clean pool that is not very crowded (it was not when I was there on the weekend in the end of August), hotel staff is very nice and helpful, rooms are ok (big enough but a bit old), there is free WiFi everywhere in the Hotel area and also a public PC including a printer. Finally: book a shuttle to get from LAX to this hotel. Taxis cost a fortune. Regarding which shuttle company to use: I can recommend Karmel Shuttle.

The most important one, however, is the location. You are seriously 1 street behind Hollywood Boulevard. It takes a short 30 second walk through an alley to get to Hollywood and Highland. Another fantastic thing about the hotel is the free parking. You can securely park your car underneath the hotel which was so handy seeing that you need a car to get around LA. Breakfast is now also included, however when we went there it was always busy and there were no seats to sit at. As we had a kitchen, we just made our breaky anyway. There was also a computer where you could use the internet, you just have to hope that patrons are not inconsiderate and only use it to send an email or to check into their flight.. not to sit on it for an hour and browse (like a few people did). Now for the negatives. Our room was '201' which is RIGHT next to the lift and the breakfast area. It was so noisy it was unbearable. Don't expect to sleep in after 8 because everyone will be banging around. Also don't expect to get to sleep early (9pm) because people were still banging around on the computer or wailing in the reception area. The walls and floors also seem to be paper thin because it sounded as if the people above us were baby elephants (I'm sure they weren't purposely stomping though). We were also next to a really noisy family who would leave their door open and make so much constant noise and slam doors. Also, when they left at 4am one morning, they made sure we heard every suitcase they were dragging around. I had earplugs but I was still constantly woken up. It was so frustrating. So, the location was above fantastic. The rooms were also spacious and a good value for money. However, I would not stay there again if I was put in the room I was because of the noise. I'd request to be put further towards the back of the hotel and away from the reception and breakfast area. I am quite a tolerant person and don't expect much for the money I pay, however it was unbearable and frustrating.

We shared a super king bed (to try save on cost lol!), the bed was a bit uncomfortable - there was a plastic sheet on the mattress that acts as a protector I suppose, every time you move it makes a lot of noise so if you are a light sleeper this is going to annoy you. Location cannot be beat - just through the back alleyway you hit the Hollywood walk of fame, Kodak Theare etc. We had lots of fun coming out several different times of the day to see which character dress ups we could take pictures with. We found a favourite diner, Johnny Rocket, which is located inside the Hollywood/Highland shopping centre. It was apparently Elvis' favourite burger joint! Burgers are priced from $5 upwards, very handy when you want a quick, cheap meal. The pool is very small, but the hotel is not big so I suppose it is adequate. We had fun just mucking round there. Really appreciated the free breakfast every morning between 8-10am. The area gets quite crowded, there are only 4 sets of tables/chairs so we often took away breakfast in paper bags (provided). Breakfast included croissants, muffins, cakes and coffee/tea. The free internet station is also located in the breakfast area, so using the internet at this time is impossible. Very handy having this free service though - we had just come from hotels that charged $0.50 per minute! Besides the uncomfy bed, I cannot fault this budget hotel.

We took a taxi about four miles to CBS for a taping of the Price is Right and it was about $15 each way, largely due to the traffic. The red line Metro station is right on Hollywood and Highland so we took it to Universal Studios, just one stop away. We also took the red line to Union Station to catch the Amtrak train to take us down to San Diego for a few days.

We had read the reviews and had high expectations as far as location of hotel and friendliness of the front desk. Neither disappointed. The folks working the front desk are amazingly nice and welcoming - they literally go out of their way to see that you know where you are going and how to get there. I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere where the front desk was that nice. We reserved a 2 King Executive Suite and we were very happy with the size and the price. Not to mention the fact that we had a full kitchen, tons of closet space, and a dining room table that seated four which made it handy for meals brought in. The hotel is an older property, so it's not the Sheraton by any means. But we were really only using it for a launching point to take our kids to Universal Studios and to see the sights of Hollywood, so we didn't need a lot of frills to get by. And the room was exceptionally neat and clean. The carpets could maybe be replaced or get a good scrubbing and I know that grosses some people out. I took socks, because I'm one of those people that can get grossed out, and simply used them to walk around in after showers, etc. But I have to stress that besides that, the room was spotless. It even smelled good, which is some kind of modern day hotel miracle in iteself. The beds are ok, nothing is ever as good as what's left at home, but the kids slept soundly. Our bed was little soft, so that caused some slight backaches, but nothing we didn't get over quickly with a little moving around and stretching. Our suite was nice because the kids had their bed in what would have been a front room in a 1 bed suite, and we had a bedroom to ourselves. It's always nice to have that privacy and quiet. The bathroom was just an average bathroom with a tub/shower combo and toilet. The sink and mirror were located outside the \"wet room\". My husband was so happy because at 6'3\" he could fit under the shower spigot. Towelse were thick and fluffy and didn't have that weird \"washed in old bleach\" smell to them. Our bedroom had a full closet with sliding mirrored doors, and a small entertainment center/dresser. There was also a large coat closet in the hallway and another closet with sliding mirrored doors in same hallway that had shelves for storing shoes, pants, etc. We were all able to hang or put away our gear and leave an uncluttered room which was nice. We did not eat the continental breakfast, although my kids snuck a bagel the 2nd morning we were there. We ate out at the Bob's Big Boy in Burbank (best restaurant every IMHO). We did not use the laundry facilites. The parking in free and subterranean. We have a 2WD Ford Expedition and it barely fit under the gate - if your driving anything taller that 6'4\" you can forget parking there. The only real gripes I would have is that the A/C units in both rooms did not blow true cold air. It was chilly when we were there, but with four people taking showers would get humid and hot in the room. My husband figured out that if we opened the bathroom widow it sucked all that humidity right out of there. Once we got that figured out, it was so nice and cool in our room we didn't need the a/c - but I would be concerned about the temp in the summertime. Also, the tv in the front room/kids room had a short or something and would turn off and on. You had to do some kind of voodoo ceremony over the remote to get it to stay on. It was great entertainment for my kids who decided the tv was haunted - so thank goodness for kids with a good sense of humor! We bought tickets for Universal there and got a $10 discount off the price we were going to pay online. So we saved $40 on those alone. And, just as an aside, we'd read on the forums that Universal was a 1/2 day trip. Well, none of us had every been there and it took us from open to close to see and do everything we wanted to. So just a word of warning for other Universal virgins, it's not quite as easy on time as some might think. All in all, we were very pleased with the hotel. The location could not be beat. The hotel is directly behind Graumann's Chinese Theater and it's a hop, skip, and jump through the Hollywood and Highland mall and the Kodak Theatre to get to Hollywood Blvd and the walk of fame. Once you hit Hollywood Blvd., you are directly across the street from the Jimmy Kimmel Live show, the El Capitan Theatre (plays all Disney movies), and the Roosevelt Hotel.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mosman, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDo yourself a favour!

We had booked a suite as we were travelling with our two teenage sons. The suite is actually only one bedroom with the second bed in the lounge/kitchen area. We asked for a rollaway bed (as the boys are unwilling to share a bed) and were assured that it wouldn't be too cramped. We found that it was very cramped. The kitchen was very small and did not have a dishwasher and there were no tea towels to dry things. The oven seals kept falling off the moment the oven was heated and the oven door did not fully close. There were no dishes in which you could put leftover food. We were given one room but the moment we walked in we could smell urine so asked to be moved to another room, which the staff did. The carpet on the floor was dirty (as mentioned in another review). Staff did not come in to clean the rooms until around 5pm which meant that we had already arrived back from being out all day and were getting ready for the night's activities. Getting luggage to the room was difficult. One alternative is to carry them up to the third floor or use the lift. The lift is only accessible from the road via the garage. The garage is locked and had to be opened for us and the lift is extremely small so only 1 large suitcase (we had 4 in total and carry ons as we had been travelling round the world for the previous 6 weeks) would fit in, meaning a number of trips had to be taken to bring all of the luggage up.

Hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodated our request for a quiet room away from the pool area. Unfortunately on Morning One, our shower didn't work properly and water just spurted everywhere all over the bathroom floor. The conceirge came up and said there was a knob missing. He gave us a key to shower in a room on the next floor up. This was inconvenient, but our shower was fixed by the time we returned from Universal Studios later that day. The room upstairs was much nicer and better updated than our room, and while he offered us an exchange of rooms, we prefer not to move once we've settled as we're already staying in 5 hotels during a 3 week stay. Providing we can get some sleep, we can cope with any other little inconveniences. No breakfast was provided, but go to the Fresh and Easy supermarket a few blocks up the road for supplies to make your own breakfast / other meals (the frozen vegetarian selection is outstanding!) The best thing we did in Hollywood was take the Kodak Theatre tour which is right next door. When you are standing on the front steps of the Orchid Suites, look up on your immediate right and see a long glass corridor with yellow paint underneath. That's where the Oscar winners walk past the photos of previous winners after coming off stage to do their press interviews. This tour was the entertainment highlight of our whole 3 week trip to the US (especially walking out onto the stage itself, then taking Johnny Depp's front row centre seat while learning more about the theatre and Oscars ceremonies).This hotel is definitely not the Ritz, but you coudn't get any closer Grauman's Chinese Theatre (we missed the tour there but bought tickets to see a film inside), the sidewalk stars (not the dodgy fakes dressed up as stars who charge you to take their photos!) and the celebrity hand and footprints. The UWink restaurant in the Hollywood and Highlands centre is a bit of fun for a meal (except when 40 drunk male and female 'Santas' arrive right after you've placed your order on the computer screen on your table and get even more drunk while you wait for your meal!)

Booked the stay based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. We wanted somewhere that was close to the main tourist-style attractions, and with easy access to Universal Studios. Our room was a king executive suite, which had it's own bathroom, kitchen and dining area. The most important thing was that the room was clean. The sheets and towels were fresh. Our room was not facing the pool, or on the balcony, but around the corner, facing a car park behind the hotel. This felt far more private, as no one would be walking past us to access their rooms. The safe was a helpful addition to the room, but quite small, which was a downside as we were traveling with a laptop computer. The hotel is located conveniently just behind Hollywood Boulevard and the Kodak Theatre. Tucked away in a private street along with other hotels like the Liberty and Hollywood Celebrity, it is just on the end right behind the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Mall. There was easy and convenient access to the centre at a 1 minute walk. The mall backed right on to Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame. The mall was useful for places to eat, but we found it tiresome and limited in terms of options. We could not find anywhere that served breakfast, which was very disappointing. We often skipped breakfast altogether because of this. Universal Studios was easily accessed through the Metro station which is underneath the Mall, and people looking to visit the main tourist attractions will be pleased with the location. It's also close the the Hollywood museum, and the Hollywood Wax Museum. The one problem we found with this hotel was that the day we arrived, there were some MAJOR construction works going on next door, on the Mall. Massive drilling noises were VERY intrusive and trying to sleep after a long international flight was near impossible. We weren't warned about this in advance, or when we checked in. The construction was still in process when we checked out. This didn't go on during the evening or early morning, but if you wish to sleep in or have a sleep during the day, you might find it annoying. Overall, though, we found our stay a pleasant experience with no problems. The staff were helpful, by arranging us a cab and letting us know where the major attractions were, and how to access them.

I wonder how bad it is that they have to lock everything? We walked over to Hollywood and Highland which looks like a new outdoor mall. Very nice place. Within minutes of the hotel. We then walked Hollywood Blvd. Went back to the hotel and was told we could check in. Went to our room only to find cleaning ladies still there. They rushed out of there. They only left two towels for four people. I had to go find them to get more towels. Room was just okay. It was really big but very outdated. It had a weird smell. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. Very lumpy, terrible. Room was as clean as it could be for a very old place. The pool was very clean although we didn't use it. The worst part about the whole thing is at 5:30 am you feel like you're at a freight terminal. You're right behind the mall so you hear trucks backing up making deliveries. Unloading of the trucks and trucks ideling while waiting to unload. The whole hotel was up by then or so it seemed.

The initial four of which was spent here at the Orchid Suites. And they were a good four days. Unlike the previous reviewer, my experience in check-in was pleasant. We came in late past 10 pm, tired from a 4+ hr. drive from Las Vegas. On our way over, I was worried that our room might be given to another guest so I called to confirm our arrival. The person who answered assured me that our room is waiting for us. Upon arrival, the same man who I talked to earlier greeted us with a smile. Check-in was a breeze. Good start I thought. The last time I was in L.A. was more than a dozen years ago. And my memory of this part of town was that it was seedy. But reading the reviews here in T.A., I found out that the area has undergone a transformation. But unless I witnessed it myself, I had my doubts especially since I was travelling with my 7 & 12 yr. olds. So security was a major issue. I took a chance since I felt that this is the area I wanted to be in. The road where the hotel was located is a real quiet road where nary a vehicle pass. This despite the presence of delivery trucks to the nearby big hotel and mall. The traffic from the surrounding very busy streets of Hollywood, Highland and Franklin could not be heard. One of the things I liked was that upon check-in, you will be given a key (aside from your room key) that can open all the other common doors like the entrance and garage doors which were locked. Safe. The garage is located underneath the hotel and was ample. It was always full but I managed to find a spot all the time. And for those wondering, I saw big SUVs parked with space to spare. Transporting your luggage was easy since there was an elevator. The room was big, generously appointed, and clean. The look won't win any awards and might even be dated and turn off some, but it didn't matter to me. I liked the fact that it had a complete kitchen with a ref, mini oven, microwave, coffee maker and plates and glasses even. You can save money by preparing meals occassionally. A bonus were the mini safe in the closet and the working heater in the bathroom (it was cold when we were there). Service was good. The front desk staff would suggest activities for the day when they see you in the morning (or at least one did). And they were cheerful when answering my daily querries. Aside from the ready answers when asking for a great place for breakfast or a nearby grocery store, they researched and got back to me when I asked sor something they didn't know ( I asked for a nearby church if you must know). And let me repeat the available free wi-fi. You could probably find better accommodations elsewhere. But at $139 a day, it is hard to fault this hotel. Okay, included breakfast would be nice. Would I come back? I definitely would. After my stay here, I brought the family to San Diego and Anaheim, but returned to L.A. for unfinished sight-seeing. But for comparison's sakes, I decided to book at the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel for the 2nd half of our L.A. holiday. Let me state that it is hard to choose between the two hotels. While I liked everything that the Orchid offered, the free breakfast at the Celebrity may be clincher for some. Add that to the fact that the latter is $10 cheaper. But on the Orchid's plus side, you feel more secure in it. Plus, it is a more convenient hotel. This is expounded in my review of the Hollywood Celebrity Hotel. The way I see it, if you have a car with you, the Orchid Hotel might be a better deal. If you don't, the free breakfast and the $10 difference might point you to the Celebrity instead. Personally, I'd put the Orchid Suites in front by a whisker (I had a car). Travelling with my young ones, I like the security and the convenience it offers. Plus the free breakfast the other hotel offers I offset by buying some bread, cereal and juice myself (which is pretty inexpensive). Sorry if this review has stretched out the way it did. Jet lag has given me extra time to write early in the morning (2 am). I just hope I helped you decide if this is the right hotel for you.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans", "Title": "\u201cMy only complaint\u201d", "Author": "HotelReviewerNOLA", "ReviewID": "UR15436851", "Content": "My only complaint is that we stayed there.

We had a car so drove around the rest of LA but being so close to all the main parts of Hollywood was a bonus and there were heaps of shops and restaurants nearby plus all the Hollywood attractions. It was really easy to park in the undercover carpark and we had a 1bed king room with kitchen facilities that was all clean and tidy and everything worked well. If it is 5 star luxury you are after then you will be dissappointed by this place but if it is a clean room with lots of space and good location for a good price then this place is excellent.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for budget travellers\u201d", "Author": "Stroppers", "ReviewID": "UR12808328", "Content": "Had stayed here before in Summer of '06, and returned in January for a second visit.

Overall we found it to be in a good location, for a fair price, with excellent amenities. We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon & made it to the hotel fairly easily in our rental car, thanks to Google Maps. Check-in was smooth & we were able to park our car in the underground car park for free (this is a huge drawcard, as many properties of this nature do not have car parking). This parking facility seemed quite secure. We made it up to our room on the 3rd floor, looking out over the pool on the way. Although this accommodation is aurrounded by buildings (as it is directly behind the Kodak Theatre), it still seemed to maintain a fairly relaxing air about it, with most rooms having their own balcony, & table/cahir set. As well as the main pool areas, there is also a rooftop garden setting where you can see further afield. Our room was a real surprise, with a large bed, TV & lounge chairs, as well as a full (seperate) kitchen & dining area. The bathoom was a little odd with the sink actually outside of the bathroom, although this is becoming more common in many accommodations. The whole unit was fairly spacious although a little dated. However, everything was clean & in good condition. The shower was OK too, with good pressure & plenty of hot water. There was an air conditioning unit in the room although it wasn't that effective for the space it was trying to cool (it was certainly better than nothing). Downstairs (above the lobby) was a free internet comupter, also with printer, which was really helpful, although sometimes you have to wait to use it. Downstairs in the basement there is a laundry facility with a pile of vending machines. The location is fantastic - right behind the Kodak Theatre, it is about a 1 or 2 minute walk to the Hollywood & Highland complex, & just a few more minutes right around to the Hollywood Walk of Fame & Mann's Chinese Theatre. There are loads of things to see in this area so you can get to so much just by walking. Across one street there are some more small stores, as well as a convenience store where you can buy alcohol if you would rather enjoy it in the comfort of your own studio unit. The service was great & we were always greeted at the door. Staying here was a breeze & it was really nice to have full use of our own facilities.

Just go out the front door, up a little walkway to your right, and you're in the Hollywood-Highland shopping complex, which houses three stories of retail stores. It's Babylon Courtyard looks like a Hollywood set, complete with giant elephant sculptures. Viewing bridges at the back of the courtyard offer a great photo-op of the \"Hollywood Sign\". There is a wide variety of places to eat. Our favorite was the California Pizza Kitchen. (The lettuce wraps and the Waldorf Salad were awesome!) One of the stores that we frequented was a Kodak camera shop. Everytime we filled up a memory card, we would have them transfer the photos onto a CD (for $9.95). Take the escalator down to the street level and you're right next to Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the main entrance to the Kodak Theatre (Emmy's, American Idol), a movie theater, the El Capitan Theater (Jimmy Kimmel), the Walk of Fame, the wax museum, Mel's Drive-In, some of the best souvenir shops in town, and so much more! We spent one full day at Universal Studios. It took us about 8 minutes to drive there and park. (By the way, we recommend splurging on a \"Front of the Line Pass\"! No waiting in lines and you get to go \"behind the scenes\" on various attractions). Allow some time for Universal's \"City Walk\" also. There are LOTS of neat shops and restaurants. If you like Italian food, Buca di Beppo is fantastic for both food and atmosphere! If you like seafood, one just can't beat Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. We recommend their \"Bucket O' Boat Trash\"! On a separate day, we made the short drive over to Beverly Hills. Be sure to take the trolley tour around town. It only costs $5.00 and is full of photo-ops!!! All of the staff at the Hollywood Orchid Suites were personable and accommodating! Our favorite was \"Adam\" at the front desk! He really made our day with his wonderful attitude and smile! The hotel itself, as noted in many reviews, is rather \"tired and worn\", but it was clean and entirely adequate for our needs. (Just keep in mind that it is a 40-year-old converted apartment building.) We paid $119/night for a nice-sized room with two very comfortable queen-sized beds, a couch and coffee table, and a full kitchen with dining table. There are, of course, fancier accommodations in the area, but one would have to pay another $100-$200/night. It just isn't worth it, unless you will be spending more time in your room than seeing the sights. One of the main reasons we picked this hotel is because of the security features. Although we were two women, staying alone, we felt very safe here. One must have a keycard to use the elevators, the underground parking garage (parking is free), and the front door \"after hours\". The pool was very clean and warm! The laundry room was a plus. The vending machines had a nice assortment of snacks/drinks. Don't forget to visit the rooftop garden. It's a nice place to relax.

Other configurations are available as well. The kitchen was a real plus--in addition to a full-sized refrigerator/freezer, stove, microwave and toaster oven, it included dishware, silverware (including a corkscrew), a coffee maker wih a daily coffee/cream/sugar setup, salt and pepper and paper towels. We saved a lot of money by being able to buy groceries and take home leftovers, and saved even more with the free parking. The location was great--you can cut through the \"back entrance\" to the Highland Center and be on Hollywood Blvd (and at a Metro stop) in under 5 minutes. A 24 hour drugstore (Long's) and a food market are about 2 blocks down the Blvd. The Hollywood Freeway (101) is a straight shot by car, just a couple of minutes away. There are also on-site laundry facilities and pretty extensive vending machines on the ground floor. The negatives are pretty much what other reviewers mentioned: tired decor (but clean), a shower meant for short people, some outside noise from delivery trucks and passersby on the outer walkways, and some ceiling noise from people on the floor above you (did not detect noise on either side, though).

Located right behind the Kodak Theatre and Hollywood Boulevard, this is the best hotel I've stayed in Los Angeles. At $109/night for two person, we got a wonderful executive suite with a kitchen, which was enough for two people to cook in, and four people to eat in. The room had sliding door so you could easily walk onto the balcony. We had a wonderful view of the Hollywood Hills. Bed is comfortable and a huge King size, bathroom is excellent, and there's a big closet. Hotel has a pool, but we didn't use it, since there's so much to do. Staff: Very friendly and efficient. But my favorites were the cleaning staff. All of them were totally sweet and friendly and very helpful. And they seemed to appreciate to be able to talk to some of the guests. Our room was cleaned and left spotless each day. Location: Excellent, since you can do some shopping very close by and the area is very safe. You can easily walke around at night in the area, but don't wander to far up Hollywood Boulevard. The block aroud the hotel is very safe, up until the Gap there's no worries. And if you plan a trip to Universal Studios, don't take your car, but take the metro, since it's close to the hotel and the Studios are only one stop away. Traffic: This is LA and Highways are terrible. We went to Santa Monica from the Hotel and took Road 66. Major road works, so we got stuck for quite some time. Same thing with the Highways. And if you wanna go to orchid suites coming from Hollywood Boulevard, beware that you are not allowed to make a left turn onto Franklin Avenue at rush hour. I would advice you to turn left onto LaBrea Avenue from Sunset or Hollywood Boulevard and then a right onto Franklin Ave. It's gonna save you a lot of time and trouble. And if you get stuck in traffic. Keep calm and turn up the music! Parking: The hotel has a closed garage only guests can use, so no worries there. Going back home from the Orchid Suites? You have time to spare cause you plane leaves in the evening? No worries, just ask and you can leave you car in the garage. There's table and chairs near the pool.

The only criticism we have is that the room was a little old and worn out, but that seemed to be LA in general.

The clientele are perfectly OK, just everday holiday makers from all over the world.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNext time I will not look anywhere else\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5326477", "Content": "I chaperoned a small group of high school students visiting colleges in the LA area. The main reason we stayed at the Orchid Suites was because of the price, but now I cannot imagine having been happier anywhere else. While the facility is not top of the line, the rooms in our block were all clean, spacious and met our needs. One of the best experiences our group had was visiting the nearby grocery store to gather items to stock in our kitchens for the week we were there. The location was very nice - right in the heart of Hollywood. Although we used the nearby subway a time or two, we had rental cars which were very secure in the free parking garage under the hotel. While one should be cautious in any major metropolitan area, we felt safe walking through the area. I recommend the Orchid Suites to anyone looking for a great location and a good deal.

It's on the same block as the Chinese Theatre with the Walk of Fame running along it. It's also quite close the freeway which made it easy to find and despite the traffic straight forward to get to Disney to in just over an hour. The area felt very safe and the accomodation had a good level of security. There was free, underground, locked parking and always free spaces. The staff were extreamley helpful and let us keep are car there after check out. The property is very well maintained and very clean. Our apartment was very spacious and clean. The furniture is very comfortable and well maintained although it might be a bit dated for some peoples' tastes . We had a large open plan lounge with sofa bed, armchairs, dinning table and four chairs, kitchen including microwave and a breakfast bar area. We had a seperate bedroom with king bed and there was three large wardrobes. The bathroom had a shower. There were two televisions and a safe in the room. There's a laundrette and an outdoor swimming pool.

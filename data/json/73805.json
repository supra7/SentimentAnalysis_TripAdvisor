After this experiance I truly believe that requesting certain things in advance never works! Requested ground floor, no way, requested quietest area, nope! Folks, we made these requests 2 1/2 months iin advance and when you remind them of this they look at you like your nuts. I do believe that the desk clerk could have been more helpful and accomadating in this matter if she wanted to. OK , the rest of the review. Pool is very small and very dirty. Bloody band-aid and coins in the bottom of mirky, dirty pool. Hot tub will fit maybe 2-3 children or 1-2 adults. AC units are unusually loud and annoying. I would recommend this hotel if you are just passing through the Phoenix area and are deaf, staying 1 night.

She did not look happy to be there and did not bother asking me how my stay was. I gave her my room cards and she said, \"your checked out.\" I asked her about the $25.00 charge and wanted to make sure it would be removed from my card.

To call the location \"Metrocenter\" is a bit of a stretch as the Metrocenter Complex is at least one mile (if not more) north of the hotel, but it's an easy drive by car via the frontage road. Years ago this hotel was a first-generation Hampton Inn and all the rooms are accessed via outdoor corridors rather than the favored indoor hallways. If you want quiet be sure to get a room by the pool; other rooms, especially those facing the freeway, are going to be a bit noisier. (Although, during warmer months when the pool is getting heavy use the rooms facing the freeway may be quieter.) My experience was quite positive; my plane arrived well before Noon and when I called the hotel and asked to check-in early I was told, \"Come on over! I'll find you a room!\" (Truth be told, the hotel wasn't very busy that weekend; it was Thanksgiving.) The front desk had my reservation in order upon arrival; one signature and I was on my way to my room. I seem to recall paying about $65 a night and got a clean room overlooking the pool. They trumpet their \"housekeeping awards\" on their website and I will allow that my room was very, very clean. (The bathroom, while clean, was a bit dated.) My sister was staying in another room and she remarked how clean her room was, and my sister is very, very picky. There were plenty of towels, soap and shampoo. The front desk staff was friendly at check-in and check-out. The business center in the lobby worked fine. The outdoor pool and hot tub were both clean and operational, but it was really too cold for either. I only stayed one night so I am not qualified to comment about on-going housekeeping, but my sister (who stayed 4 nights) reported a sparkling clean room with piles of fresh towels on a daily basis.

Clean bed and clean bathroom. The carpets might be smightly worn out and not too plush and so would the towels be - but they are clean and very much in acceptable state.

The spa was out of order, the printer hooked up to the lobby computers for residents' use was also out of order. Neither was fixed during our stay. On our second night at 3am someone tried to gain entry into my room...twice! Then 10 minutes later the front desk phoned my room to verify who was staying in it and a minute later phoned again to verify the spelling of my name...at 3:15 in the morning! Evidently the staff never entered in their computer a room change that I did from the night before so newly arriving guests were trying to swipe the key to no avail. After lodging my disgust with the front desk the following morning I was told that a manager would contact me about noon to discuss what had occurred. No call happened and I had to wait until the next morning to speak with their General Manager. When I finally spoke with her (Connie) she was down right nasty and rude. Maybe she was just having a bad day but her lack of professionalism handling my customer service situation was shocking. The first thing she points out is how much money I was saving by having room discounts during my stay and that the pet fee for my two dogs was substantially reduced as well. She actually did the math and pointed out the total savings I was receiving. Are you kidding me? I was quoted rates when I made the reservation by phone. Does anyone ever pay the \"rack room rates\"? I chose the hotel based on what they quoted me at the time of booking. How am I supposed to know what the actual rate is? Apparently it's quite okay to be woken up by staff in the middle of the night if you're paying less even though you're not aware in the first place that you're supposedly getting such a great deal. When I mentioned to the General Manager it might be nice at the the time of check-in to have the staff inform a guest that the spa is in disrepair, and that if you show your room keycard to an off property fitness center nearby they will allow usage of their spa. I was told that info only when I mentioned the disrepair to a desk clerk. Anyway, she was not having any of that complaint saying that if I didn't like the hotel why didn't I just move to another one. That line was so ridiculous my jaw dropped. By the way the spa hadn't been working for the past two weeks! The hotel comped me the final night but seemingly reluctantly so. I will say that Connie was in a much better frame of mind the following morning but in my opinion the damage was done the previous day. I couldn't imagine that a hotel GM could act in such a nasty way as she did with me. It was absolutely uncalled for. The rooms were clean but since I requested a room change because of loud traffic noise the sleep quality rating suffers. Because the staff isn't properly trained on handling room changes or informing arriving guests of spa disrepairs I can only lay blame on its GM for responsibility. Considering her lack of customer relations skills it's not surprising.

I do have a few issues. The hispanic girl at check in seemed distracted, like she was tired. She almost put the wrong rate on our card. The blonde heavy set girl at night time clerk wasn't all that helpful when we asked what type of restaurants were open in the area past 9 p.m. Her responce was \"I don't know? Just go to Burger King in the plaza next to us.\" I gave the sleeping a 1 out of a 5 because of a few things: the AC and the door/window. The AC would shut itself off. Even though it was about 101 outside, you can't have the AC run continuously. No matter what you do, after 10 minutes at best it would shut off. Also, even when the door was closed, you could still hear every little sound! The windows don't open at all. That was the bad part. When the cooler wasn't running, you could people walking, talking, shutting their door, etc. Morning was loud because you have kids swimming in the pool. The young lady when we checked out was incredible! She always had a smile on her face, made conversation, apologized for our discomfort. She greeted every person that entered the lobby for breakfast. The other girl that had worked the morning before didn't acknowledge anyone. The rooms were renovated and do the triple sheeting. They had nice pillowtop mattresses at no extra cost.

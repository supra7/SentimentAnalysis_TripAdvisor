We booked our 2 bedroom condos in July of 2011. When we arrived at the awesome location, we were told that they had only one 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit that met our requirements. As a result our party of four gave the beautifully appointed 2 bedroom, 2 bath premier unit with king/queen beds to the couples that were celebrating their anniversaries. After quite a bit of unpleasant exchanges at the front desk, the remainder of us were put in two 1 bedroom units. The following day we met up with Jeremiah at the front desk who could not have been more accomodating. He offered us several options for getting the remaining couples into a 2 bedroom unit. We opted to wait two days to be placed in a 2 br premier unit and finish out the rest of our time together as planned. Now for the good part. Awesome views from the entire unit, The pool area and beach as well as the grounds were beautiful. Staff and housekeeping were awesome and friendly. We met a charming 88 year old resident named Peggy who took us to the Mahana Herb Garden to pick some fresh herbs. We were mesmerized by views from our lanais of the whales, turtles, dolphins and rainbows; and enjoyed the relaxing, quiet atmosphere of the Mahana. If it had not been for the aggravating situation with the reservation, I would definately return; but it seems there is no way to confirm, as we did by calling about a week prior to our visit, that the reservation was in place only to be told that there was no way to predict what units we would be placed in. However, I doubt there is a resort on Kaanapali that can compare to the stunning views from Mahana's 2 bedroom corner units.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Mirage, California", "Title": "\u201cThe view is to die for!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jturner48", "ReviewID": "UR126202711", "Content": "It is all about the view at this beachside condo.

We did have a couple of problems with the bathroom in that it had broken towel racks, non-dranining sink, etc. The maid service was good, but they forgot kitchen and bathroom towels twice.

As soon as you walk in, if feels like home. Ok, not like our home but like the home we would want. Well appointed and beautiful. The first thing to catch your eye are the 3 large windows overlooking the ocean. Walking out to the lanai (patio), you notice the islands of Lana'i and Molokai. Scanning the ocean, you will most likely see whales if visiting Nov through April as we were. The living room had two very comfortable swivel chairs (good for watching the TV or the whales) and a nice couch. The TV was huge and has lots of available channels. There is the nice dining room table before you get to the wonderful, updated, fully stocked kitchen. The bedroom is spacious and the king sized bed was very comfortable. Beach towels, coolers and everything else you may want or need readily available. We typically cooked breakfast in the condo and ate it on the lanai. It was wonderful. Parking was easy although it was crowded, we always found a spot. We also went snorkeling several times, going about 200 yards up or down the beach to find a sandy spot to get into the water. There is a lot of coral around so you have to be careful but it was fun. There were surfers the last two days as the waves picked up to 2-3 feet. Still very easy snorkeling. Black Rock is about a 1 mile walk to the south. The locations is excellent with lots of activities to do nearby. Driving north 15 minutes gets you to other nice beaches. Continuing north gives you a winding road to get to the north shore areas and several nice geocaches. If you go south, about 10 minutes away is the tourist town of Lahaina. Make sure to find out where the free parking lot is in town. We used the free lot each day without any issues. Discounted activities such as submarine rides (nice and you can save money and buy tickets for $35 around town) and whale watching are available plus some nice places to eat. We liked the Cool Cat Cafe and the Lahaina Pizza Company. The Warren & Annabelle Magic show in Lahaina is very funny. We did just the show and not the dinner and show combo. We arrived at 8:30 p.m. and they put us in the lounge for an hour (gives them a chance to make more money on the drinks). When the show finally started, we had a great time although it didn't end until close to midnight. Dress warmly as the theater is very well air-conditioned (i.e. COLD). We also did the snorkel cruise to Molokini which was quite excellent. Driving to Iao valley (so-so, 1 hour) and to the Haleakala National Park (2 hours) took a bit of time but we enjoyed it. As the condo wasn't available for the entire length of our visit, we also stayed a few days in Kihei. That is an excellent way to visit that portion of the island without a lot of extra driving before heading up to north. Gas prices were about $1 more than the mainland.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful views, beautiful place - Bad front desk experience (Karen)\u201d", "Author": "A B", "ReviewID": "UR126001244", "Content": "My husband and I visited the Mahana for the second year in a row. The hotel is expertly maintained. The room was perfect, beautifully decorated. The kitchen was amazing and the view is spectacular. The beaches are perfect! We visited in February and whales put on a show nearly all day long. We ate almost every dinner on the lanai. The BBQ's are cleaned daily and a great way to cook the local fish we picked up everyday. We also enjoyed meeting different guests while our dinners cooked. All in all it was a great place to stay. For the second year in a row we had to deal with Karen at the front desk. With no one else around I stood at the desk to ask a question. Karen was \"busy\" organizing papers. Moving things around on the desk and ignored me. She finally looked up and said. \"What do you want\", she was curt, rude and her attitude was maddening. After my experience I spoke to some other guests and owners, who informed me she has been at the Mahana for 30 years. She is always like that. ..... How she still has a job? How do the owners not call for her resignation? Is everyone afraid of her? She did not treat her co-workers with respect either. Please Karen - retire. It is time. Find that aloha spirit you so desperately need and use it somewhere else. I spent a lot of money to enjoy my Hawaiian vacation. I have a very hard time understanding how you have a job, given your obvious hate for everyone around you. Bottom line - The Mahana is hands down the best location in Kaanapali.

We also requested a recently renovated unit, which included granite counter tops, newer appliances, and in general a renovated bathroom and common areas. We were not disappointed. We were in room 508, and it was fabulous. The view was incredible and we could watch whales play right outside our unit. We had maid service daily, and Susie did a great job. We also had coffee replaced daily. The unit had a washer and dryer which was great, we were able to bring less clothes, and therefore less luggage. The location is also wonderful with access to the boardwalk where we spent a couple of nights at Duke's, enjoying Happy Hour and good food. There was a grocery store nearby, however the Safeway in Lahaina had better prices. We were also able to make arrangements for activities through the Local Expedia Expert, Susan.

Like everyone has mentioned you are very close to the beach and the views are amazing. We had stayed on the 10th floor and our unit had everything we could want. It was very modern and must have been recently remodelled with the granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, washer/dryer etc. The staff at the front desk was very courteous and helpful as was Susan at the conciege desk. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance if you want as there are none on the Mahana property. Dukes is about a 2 minute walk south, the Ka'anapali Shores (sister resort to the Mahana where you get a 10% discount) has a restaurant about a 5 minute walk to the north to name a couple. The Time Supermarket is about 3 blocks away (short walk) and has everything that you would expect from a large grocery store. Even a wide selection of beer, wine and hard liquor. Also things for quick meals like rotisserie chicken, sandwiches and salads which we enjoyed as it was just the 2 of us and we didn't want to do a lot of cooking. The Pizza Paradiso is in the adjoining strip mall which had great pizza, also Subway, Java Jazz (live entertainment) to name a few others. We went to the Old Lahaina Luau as well as a couple of tours. The sunset dinner cruise (2 hours) and the Molokini crater and Lanai snorkeling tour (7 hours) which were all excellent. The tours were through Pacific Whale foundation and I would highly recommend each one as well as the Luau. We drove around the island quite a bit and explored a lot of the beaches on the west side from Big Beach to Honolua Bay. We didn't drive the Road to Hana as over 600 curves and 50 narrow bridges in 50 miles and then turning around and doing it all again didn't seem like a great way to spend a day to us. A lot of people we talked to really enjoyed the Hana trip as well as the drive to the top of Haleakela to see the sunrise. I went snorkeling every day as there was lots to see right in front of the Mahana. We had walked along the beach to Black rock (where the Sheraton is) and beyond, nearly to Whaler's Village, a few times as the beach is perfect for walking. I saw at least 1 sea turtle 14 out of 16 days as well as numerous fish and rays. We even saw some sea turtles on our beach walk about 10 feet from shore as well as a few Hawaiian Monk seals that had come on shore to sleep. You can't really walk a long way north along the beach from the Mahana, maybe 10 minutes, as it gets too rocky. The walk to Black Rock from the Mahana must be close to a mile so a few times we just drove the car to Kahakili park which is about half way and went to the beach there. That was my favourite spot to snorkel and you didn't have to walk all the way. To get to Kahakili park from the main road you turn right on Kai Ala road which is the second set of traffic lights after you have left the Mahana and are travelling towards Lahaina on the highway. About a 5 minute drive and they have showers, washrooms, big parking lot and picnic areas as well. We drove into Lahaina quite a few times, about 4 miles south of the Mahana, and enjoyed it. Lots of shopping and restaurants on Front street. A fun and safe place. Parking can he hard to get sometimes but there is a large free parking lot at the far south end of Front Street near the school.

This was our first trip to Maui and the staying at the Mahana made the trip very special. We stayed in a premium 1 bedroom unit on the 9th floor and the views were simply spectacular. Feburary is prime humpback whale season, and it is not a question of if you will see humpacks from your unit, its how many will you see in an hour. Sometimes we would be watching a half dozen whales in every direction. The building sits so close to the water, perhaps 25 yards, and unlike more modern buildings every unit has a front row seat with the same view. Its only a question of what floor you will see the whale show from at this time of year. The condo we stayed in, unit 914, was very comfortable, with a good bed, tastefully furnished and the kitchen was well stocked and had good appliances. Resturants are very expensive in Maui, so it was great to have a kitchen where we could eat in, and there is no resturant on Maui with that view. This place is also so private, very unusual for a beach resort area. We booked through Aston, so we had daily maid service. The staff is very helpful and kind. Thanks to all of them for being so nice. They offer a one hour presentation in the morning for your first day giving you an overview of the island, and things to see and do, since we had never been to Maui before it was very helpful. There is a grocery store near the driveway entrance to the building, but better yet, about two blocks down the road is a place called the Fish Market. It is primarily a fresh fish store, but also has carry out items as well. Their fish was the best. They claim the fish is caught either the night before or that morning, and the fish is so fresh that it is very hard being back in Mich and contending with what they claim is fresh fish here. The also have seafood gumbo and chowder that are outstanding. We went on line and found a Mama's Fish House reciepe for the mahi mahi- my my was it good! There is a reef directly in front of the Mahana so there is no swiming directly in front. However, there is swimming and snorkeling right off the ends of the building. With a reef right in front, we saw giant sea turtles when we looked down from our balcony! Also because there isn't any beach activity right in front the units are very quiet during the day. The pool and hot tub area is very nice, and it looks like its been updated, but it is a smaller pool, by today's standards, probably 1970s 1980s vintage. The Mahana also has gate access to the Kannapali boardwalk. Be sure to get the code from the front desk. You can walk all the way to the Hyatt on far end of the Whalers Village area on the boardwalk. We heard its about 4.5 miles from end to end. Its a great way to see the area, and lots of resturants and shops along the way if your interested. We did all the first time on Maui must do's, the road to Hana, ate at Mama's Fish House, saw the crater, drove around most of the island seeing the beaches. The road to Hana is a must do, as is Mama's, but bring lots of money for Mama's. The driving on the road to Hana was not as bad as they say, but its about a 10 hour trip round trip with very few stops. On our next trip we will stay in Hana for a night or two. We went back a second time to see the Gardens on the Road to Hana and to eat a Mama's. The Gardens are wonderful, lunch at Mama's was to die for, and well worth a seperate trip. My husband and I agree the crater was our least favorite. Very cold even mid day on a sunny day and very windy. The best were the boat trips for sunset, whale watching, eating, and snorkeling or any combination thereof. We highly recommend the Alli Nui and the Hula Girl for all of the boat trips, both are pricey but well worth it. I have never snorkled before and I am not much of a swimmer, and the folks from Alli Nui, got me in the water and snorkeling like a pro. And I am 58. What fun. I would recommend getting a premium room and request a higher floor and try to go in Feb or March as those are prime months for the humpbacks.

There's a shopping center right across the street that has a supermarket as well as a few restaurants, nail salon and shops. We didn't do any cooking but it was very convenient to stop at the store for snacks and drinks, and it was nice to pick up lunch and eat it back at the condo rather than dining out every single meal. The pool was nice - not too crowded - but the way the building is set up means that for a good portion of the day, the pool area is in the building's shadow. Directly outside the hotel is a coral reef, so if you want to swim you need to walk down one building in either direction - not exactly a hardship.

I've looked at other options but have found Royal Hawaii has better rates than Aston's website and pretty close to VRBO's, especially when you figure in Aston's daily maid service, no cleaning fee, etc. And Royal Hawaii's cancellation policy is very forgiving by Hawaii standards: a $100 nonrefundable deposit is all that's at risk as long as you cancel more than four days ahead. VRBO, of course, does let you know exactly which unit you will have, while with Royal Hawaii/Aston you're playing the availability lottery. I always request a high floor (8 or above), and I usually get one, but not this time. The one we had, though, #417, was beautiful and I have absolutely zero complaints about it. The Royal Hawaii website can seem a bit confusing at first, but I've come to like all the different options they offer, especially if you book well in advance. I was able to grab a rate of $268 for our 1BR 1BA unit, after factoring in a 5th-night-free promo on our 5-night stay. After taxes and a $10 daily amenity fee (an annoying recent addition by Aston), the cost came to about $313 a night - not cheap, but not bad for this location and quality in high season. (The rates go down in spring and fall.) So I definitely recommend the Mahana - one of our favorite places anywhere.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holden, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Condo!

The Mahana is a condominium property that owners rent out through Aston, the building management company. The Aston staff was all very helpful and friendly. In most ways, this condo is exactly like a resort hotel. The maid service was excellent, rooms were very clean, coffee was replaced, bath products were replaced, laundry and dish soap was provided. Our maid even ran the dishwasher for us when it was full one day. The maid would also phone us in the afternoons just to make sure that we didn't need anything else for our room. I've never seen that at a hotel before. The location of the Mahana is right in the heart of North Ka'anapali beach. The beach right in front of the building is great, but shaded by the building. There is also a coral reef there, so there is no swimming immediately in front of the building, but 100 yards in either direction leads to swimming areas. Lots of people snorkel and surf out in front of the buildings though. We could see sea turtles and fish from out balcony every day. I'm sure it's great if you like snorkeling. On your first morning at the Mahana, Susan (who works for Expedia) provides an information session/sales pitch for different excursions that you can sign up for during the week. Many of them are expensive, and her recommendations are not always consistent with those on Tripadvisor, so perhaps you can decide who you trust more. We didn't sign up for any of her excursions because we had already booked the Trilogy boat cruise to Lana'i and the Old Lahaina Luau. Both were great excursions. We also had a rental car, so we drove the road to Hana and the Haleakala crater ourselves (both highly recommended, but on separate days. The road to Hana takes about 10 hours round trip if you stop at several spots along the way). The Mahana has a nice pool and hot tub, dvd rentals, and towel service (included in your $10 per day resort fee). The $10 per day fee is annoying, but most resorts are charging it now. It's just a bit deceiving that it's not included in the initial price, so it makes you think that you're getting a better deal on your trip than you actually are. Rooms are clean, and updated. Ours had granite counter tops, an over the range microwave, dishwasher, stove, fridge, washer and dryer, coffee maker, toaster, and all of the cutlery and dishes that you would need (even champagne flutes!) The balcony (called a lanai in Hawaii) have spectacular views, and a nice table and chairs to sit at. We had breakfast outside every day. You can see the islands of Lana'i and Moloka'i from the balcony. The beach was long and great for walking on. We walked down to Black Rock (a volcanic rock that sticks out into the water and cuts Ka'anapali beach into the main and North beaches) several times. This takes about 30 minutes each way. We also walked beyond this along the boardwalk to Whalers village outdoor shopping mall. It's got some nice stores, and some high end shops. Also some restaurants. The walk from the Mahana to Whalers village is about 45 minutes each way. There is also a bus that picks you up at the roundabout in front of the pink hotel next door. It's $1 for a trip to Whalers Village, then another $1 to continue on to Lahaina. We spent several days wandering around in Lahaina. It's a great little town with tons of shopping and great restaurants. Far and away, our preferred restaurant was right next door at Duke's Beach House (at the Honua Kai resort). It's right on the beach, mostly outdoor dining lit by torches, with amazing sunset views, and excellent food. They have happy hour from 3-5 too, so drinks are a little cheaper then. They also have a taster menu served between 4:45 and 5:45 every day. It was $25 and included 3 courses. We really enjoyed this meal. Overall, we had an excellent time at the Mahana. We didn't spent a whole lot of our vacation at the resort, but it served its purpose and we were very happy with everything about it. It's also generally much cheaper than nearby places such as the Honua Kai or the Sheraton. Those places have nicer pools, maybe a few more amenities, and a larger property, but I don't think they're much fancier. Save your money and go for a swim in the Honua Kai pool if you really want.

When we went to the hotel, they told us that priceline fooled us because *ALL* rooms are ocean front. So be aware of how priceline fools its customers and select the 1st option while booking this (and potentially other) hotels. - The rooms are privately owned. They have a policy that if the owner comes, you get booted out. That's what happened with us. We were assigned a room on the 5th floor, and we did not specifically ask for a room on higher floors when we booked through priceline (there was no such option available). So when we arrived, we came to know that the owner of room 502 has booted us out, and the only 1 room available is 103 on the 1st floor with a lesser ocean view due to the hedge.

We saw whales, dolphins and turtles on different days all from the balcony in the morning with breakfast! The kitchen was well stocked, washer,dryer, dishwasher etc all v helpful. The one thing I was concerned about before the trip was that there was no beach to swim in directly in front of the Mahana. Literally turn left or right and walk 100 metres max and swim away! In fact actually having reef outside the hotel enabled more wildlife and less people to view from the balcony which was a blessing in disguise. Didn't use the pool at all as we were too busy exploring the island, snorkelling etc and when we did encounter the staff they were very helpful. No restaurant onsite but Dukes next door at Honua Kai is excellent both for food and a cocktail. The Organic Farmers Market store down the road is great for fruit, granola, homemade guacamole etc.....and weirdly a lot cheaper for certain things than Times store across the road (e.g. bottles of mineral water). The walk to Black Rock takes about 20-25 minutes and the path goes alongside the beach then through the gardens of a couple of resorts. We nearly booked at Whalers or Kaanapali Beach Hotel and are glad we didn't. There is a lot of construction going on there (at Whalers mainly I think), and whilst the beach is beautiful, you do notice a change in vibe that side of Black Rock. Maybe it was just the couple of times we went but people seem less friendly and more interested in pouting and doing press-ups on the beach! We're both in our 30's and keep ourselves in quite good shape, but come on people you're on holiday....relax and smile and Aloha! Final thing, Napili beach just up the coast is BEAUTIFUL and the Gazebo there is highly recommended!

Our flight from our hometown was cancelled at the last minute, and we would not be able to fly out until the next day. Since we'd be losing a day, I immediately called the resort to inform them. However, they said we would still be charged for the 4th night. When we finally arrived at the resort the following day, the front-desk personnel informed us they would waive our first night. This is a gesture that they didn't have to do since American Airlines was fully responsible for the cancellation. It's refreshing to know they were kind enough to just charge us for our 3 night stay instead of the original 4 nights. Also, we were upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite since our original booked 1-bedroom was booked. It was nice to have a lot more space.

We were not able to leave out any pastries or anything since we were afraid of all of it being attacked by unwanted bugs. The cons of the unit: The smell of old and mildew was very apparent in the second bedroom. The A/C unit was leaking water and gave a musty smell. Although the kitchen was updated, the furniture, paint and carpet all need to be thrown out. The beds were incredibly uncomfortable and hard as a rock. However, I am spoiled at home since we have a Tempur-pedic mattress. However, it would have been nice to have a softer mattress. The most odd thing about the unit were the incessant amount of mirrors. It was wall-to-wall mirrors in the unit with some pink walls and pink carpet. I would've spend the bulk of their budget on painting the walls a neutral color and maybe installing laminate flooring. This would be much easier to clean. As for the beach, this side of the island was incredibly windy in October. There was nothing pleasant about being pelted with sand. However, it was nice that the owners provided beach chairs and boogie boards for their guests to use. Overall, this was a decent resort for the price. Is it 5-star? No way but it's clean and convenient. The best thing about staying in a condo was cooking our own meals and knowing what ingredients go in it, along with saving money. Although Safeway was pretty pricey, it was cheaper than eating out every single meal.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cFabulous vacation of a lifetime!\u201d", "Author": "Lezahp", "ReviewID": "UR119368307", "Content": "Spent a week at the Aston Mahana in celebration of our 30th wedding anniversary.

Waking up to the sounds of crashing waves and a picture perfect view of the ocean, preparing meals from a very well equipped kitchen while still being able to gaze out on the ocean, strolling the beautiful beach just steps away with very good snorkeling within a very short walk (200 yards to the left of beach entry), watching the sunset over the corner of Lanai, gazing at the stars from the patio, falling asleep to the crashing waves, and then waking up and doing it all over again and again - I wish I never had to leave! It is truly how I pictured staying in paradise should be, and it is one of the closest places you'll ever get with a truly full unobstructed ocean view just steps away from any room. We've stayed at several other very nice (and more expensive) locations with ocean front and ocean view rooms, and none of them come remotely close to what Mahana provides. The staff was quite friendly and very accommodating and the location provides easy walking access to almost any place along Kaanapali beach. Having a washer/dryer in the room makes it really nice both not to have to have a bunch of dirty laundry around and allows you to bring less \"stuff\" since you can just \"rinse and reuse\". The beach directly in front of the condo is not really good for lying on (unless you want to get wet) and you can't snorkel or swim out from there due to a rocky reef, but a short walk less than 200 yards to the left brings you to a nice beach to hang out on with great snorkeling, especially if you snorkel back to in front of the condo beyond where the waves are crashing - the ocean is crystal clear with a beautiful carpet of coral below. There are lots of fish as well even if you don't swim back that far - but you do need to swim out a little bit to get beyond the crashing waves. It's well worth it and the water still isn't very deep. For those of you who just *have* to have your connection to the real world, the internet connection from the balcony works really well (less so in the room), and they are also working on installing modems in every room. But chances are as you sit on the balcony looking out on the ocean, spotting an occasional turtle and watching surfers try to get the most out of relatively small waves as the sun dips below the horizon, you'll forget all about the \"real\" world, as you should.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Haledon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent condo choice\u201d", "Author": "Rob S", "ReviewID": "UR119199100", "Content": "We rented a 1 bedroom 1 bath condo at the Aston Mahana.

The apartment was lovely - it has this cosy blue carpet that made the sea extend into the living rom which was spacious and well equipped with TV, DVD and stereo. Kitchen was fully equiped also. Bedroom was very spacious with a massive comfortable bed and TV and DVD player. Bathroom was nice with shower and bath. This room made our stay - really felt like a 2nd home - so comfortable. The hotel pool and jacuzzi are small but in a good way as they were quite and intimate. The neighbouring hotel has a bigger pool that sounded more fun - but for a couples holiday - the Mahana fits the bill. Beach access is good - although not really for swimming right out the front - but is better a short walk down. Location is great as there is a supermarket across the road.

Garrett was awesome and even gave us several choices but the first condo we looked at was enough for us..it was beautiful. I wish we had spent less time in the car and more time enjoying the outdoors. We did snorkel off the beach there and saw alot of beautiful fish even though it is tough to get in and out of the water due to the coral and rocks. Black rock is a must for snorkeling as we saw spotted rays and turtles. We used the grills most nights for cooking fresh fish and they were always clean. We did eat at Dukes one night and it was excellent. The one activity we planned which didn't work out well was the trip to Lanai on the \"Paragon\". It was very windy and the water was choppy and I don't think the trip should have taken place. By the time we actually got to Lanai to snorkel there wasn't much time left to eat lunch. It seemed very rushed. If you plan on going to Lanai ..which is beautiful I would suggest to take the ferry. It is quicker and you can decide which time you want to leave and return. We watched sunset most nights and even saw turtles swimming close to shore. It was breathtaking. The staff was great especially Garrett whom we had the most contact with.

Susan, the Expedia concierge is a very informative, intelligent and a personable lady. Although we did not book any tours, we prefer to explore on our own or just relax at the pool, she has become a good friend. Always a hug when we arrive and willing to help in any way possible. The units are well maintained and furnished like home. There are wonderful Weber BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the property, if you wish to prepare a meal. There is also a grocery store right across the street to purchase groceries, although their prices are a little higher than Safeway or Costco (closer to OGG airport). The Mahana also installed a gate with code for residents. You can exit at the gate in the parking lot and take the beach walk all the way down to the Marriott. There are wonderful craft shows on the way, Thursdays at the Westin. The beach walk jogs around the Sheraton, and you can even stop and visit the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village for shopping and meals. Stop at the Sheraton beach area about sunset to watch a daily ritual of a diver that enters the beach to honor all the deceased people, lights torches while climbing the black rock, chants in memory of loved ones, and then dives into the ocean at sunset. Amazing!!! Dukes restaurant, is right next door on the beach by the Mahana. They have the best fish, chicken and nightly entertainment. Happy Hour is 3 to 5 with delicious drinks. The ambience is worth the trip. We have always rented directly from the Mahana. Many benefits in doing so. Any issues whatsoever from a light bulb out to faulty air conditioning is attended to by an in house technician quickly. Beach towels are provided clean every day at front desk. A 2 night deposit is required when you book, and the balance is paid WHEN YOU CHECK OUT. You get the CODE to the gate to use, coffee at front desk for 1.00, TIDE for 1.00 and daily cleaning service. Beds are made, kitchen and baths cleaned daily, fresh towels, fresh sheets every 3 days. DVDs are also available for 1.00. Anything goes wrong, simply call the front desk. You can also obtain a safe key from the front desk for 2.50 a day for use in your unit. I always left my laptop out on the desk and never had an issue. If you have an issue with your room, simply call the front desk and they will attempt to relocate you. This is all first class service only provided when you rent directly from the Mahana. I would recommend the Mahana to anyone traveling to Maui. The location is excellent, about 45 minutes from the airport and very close to Kapalua. You are about a 10 minute drive to Lahaina/Front Street for shopping, tours, snorkeling, restaurants. There are great craft shows and swap meets on the Island. Every Saturday all the locals are at the Community College near the OGG airport from 7 to 1. Thursdays are at the Westin right on Kaanapali Beach. Weekends in Lahaina around the Banyan tree. The best thing about the Mahana is that the people you meet at the pool, BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or on property turn out to be great friends. A lot of people return and faces become familiar to you.

Most hotels are on either side of the Mahana so location is great. Another must dinner is at Kimos in Lahana.

We would have only been able to afford mountain view or partial ocean view rooms at most resorts. Refusing to give up, I continued to do research and found the Mahana. We found a great rate for flights + condo through the Aston website. We were so excited to be able to afford a room with a full ocean view! I was nervous about getting a room that wasn't very nice (based on some tripadvisor reviews) so we booked a premium studio. Upon arriving, we were able to view two separate rooms and choose between the two. The room we chose was on the 9th floor with the most AMAZING view! The bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom were all beautiful and suited our needs very well. We slept with the lanai door open every night and enjoyed falling asleep to the sound of the waves. We ate at several ocean-side restaurants during our trip, but we agreed that the sunset view from our condo's lanai was the best of the entire trip (we purposefully stayed in one night to cook dinner just so we could see the sunset from the comfort of our own condo). I never felt like I was wasting time by staying in the room during our vacation, all I had to do was look out the window and take in the breathtaking view! Breakfast on the lanai each morning in our pajamas was so relaxing and enjoyable. We used the DVD rental service included in the resort fee and it was easy and hassle free for us. We also appreciated the free beach towel service. Although the pool is much smaller and less impressive than other resorts, it suited our needs well. We always found it clean and it was never very crowded. We also enjoyed using the hottub. On our last day in Maui, we were able to use the pool and hottub after we checked out of our room - we had 5 hours before we had to leave for the airport. The staff even provided us with clean towels for our showers in the pool's restrooms. As other people mentioned, you can't swim in the ocean directly in front of the hotel, but we never found this to be a problem. It was a 2 minute walk to good swimming. Snorkeling was also good near the hotel. When we didn't have activities planned we usually walked from the Mahana down the beach to Black rock to snorkel and swim. We enjoyed this walk, but it is further than I had originally anticipated. If I am fortunate to return to Maui I would certainly stay at the Aston Mahana again! I would also recommend it to all of my friends and family.

This is a vacation rental condo \"hotel\" where the properties are managed by Aston as if it were a hotel. They are located on site and have a front desk with a friendly staff. Other condos in the same building are privately owned and may or may not be managed by the same company. Our studio room was beautiful, and the view was stunning! It was cool and comfortable at night, and we slept with the door open to the balcony. All rooms are oceanfront, and all rooms have a secluded balcony so your neighbors can't see onto your balcony. It all felt very private. The beach directly in front of the hotel has coral formations right in front, so it's not ideal for swimming. However, a quick 1-minute walk down the beach in either direction and you've got perfect sand beaches and great snorkeling. We actually thought the fact that there wasn't much activity directly in front of the hotel was a plus because it was so quiet there. We enjoyed the full kitchen and made breakfast each morning so we could sit on the balcony and enjoy the ocean. It was simply beautiful and so quiet just listening to the waves. The room even had a stackable washer/dryer. We're not big on laundry on vacation, but it was nice to pull out clean beach towels from the dryer each morning. The staff provided clean sheets, coffee, dish soap and laundry detergent and cleaned our room each afternoon. There was wi-fi service and we were able to stream HBOgo and Netflix on the Mac whenever we wanted. The location was perfect and about a 15 minute drive south to Lahaina. (Renting a car is recommended on the island.) There's a grocery store across the street about 1/2 mile away if you want to buy food or alcohol to keep in the room. We're absolutely spoiled to this ocean view now, so we can't even imagine staying anywhere else on our next trip to Maui. If you need room service and high-touch service you may want to book at the Ritz or the Westin instead. We don't enjoy that level of service--mostly we want to be left to ourselves, and this property suits us perfectly. The entire experience was just perfection.

We didn't have much interaction with the staff because we were out and about, but when we did, they were very nice and polite.

Super location, excellent and well appointed rooms (I recommend going for their Premium rooms if you like more upgraded newer looks), and you really feel like it's your home away from home...with daily room service :-). Good service from the front desk - he upgraded me to a larger room as there were some empty room available...and I didn't even ask. There is a good sized market across the street that also has prepared food and food ready to cook (I bought some marinated fresh ahi tuna steaks for about $4.00 that was good enough for two people.).

Your reviews are why we chose this place so Thankyou! I'll try not to repeat what others have said, but I'll add some context...The views are simply spectacular! The pics on the hotel website do not lie. From your patio, you have a view of the island of Lanai to your left and the island of Molokai to your right. You are literally 30-40 yards from patio to the ocean. There is a rocky reef directly outside your room. Swimming beaches are 100 yards to your right or left. There is a sandy beachfront to walk on - you are just not able to swim directly behind the hotel. While some may view this as inconvenient, what it really means is waves continually coming in and providing a soothing backdrop during your entire stay. We were on the 6th floor and left our sliding doors open which provided a very relaxing and soothing backdrop throughout the stay. Sunsets were incredible!! The other thing is there is never any people on the beach unless they are walking to the swim areas. So the beachfront is always quiet and with minimal people, which makes you think you are the only one there! On the beach, we walked 100-200 yards down the property and went snorkeling. A wide and large assortment of colorful fish provided a very nice experience for us. I had 2 different people tell me they went to Molokini Island and the snorkelling right there was as good as Molokini!! We didn't do Molokini, but that's what they said!! The beach area stretches quite far, and although there are other condos and resorts, there is more than enough beach area to handle all the people, which we never thought were large amounts. The pool area is small, but we never saw a lot of people there. Jacuzzi area got crowded in the evenings, but that's probably how most spots are. We used the free DVD service, which was convenient. We used the gas grills one night and grilled steaks, and had a sunset dinner on the patio. Kitchens are fully stocked with everything you need, and then some.... We shopped at Times Supermarket (short walking distance) and stocked the frig. If you want to go out for a nice meal, Duke's has a very good menu (we walked through but did not eat here - we went out to Lahaina instead (3-4 mile drive away) a couple times). There are also several counter service restaurants (ie: Subway, Ono' Kau Kau, L&L Drive Inn) within short walking distance also. If you're on a budget, but don't want to cook, that is another option. Wireless internet for us was great. No problems at all. Staff were fine, but we didn't really have a need to engage. Room was very clean and beds and trash were taken care of each day. Slept great in the beds also. Concierge (Susan) is helpful. We attended the continental breakfast presentation (1 hr) and this is worth it, especially if you know nothing of Maui. There are no pressure tactics. Its an overview of the island, and what services/tours/shows are available. We did not need anything here, but Susan was still helpful in giving me some tips for my journey to Hana (that's another post for another day!) One thing I need to emphasize. This is not a resort!! If you're looking for the 'resort experience,' you may or may not like this place as you will need to make some effort for meals, etc. But if you're looking for a fanstatic place to kick back with incredible views, and don't mind putting in minimal effort for meals (shopping, walking or driving to restaurants), the Mahana is the best. And the pricing fit our needs. There are many resort-like amenities, but do your research and you shouldn't be disappointed. I would recommend this to everyone - Newlyweds, Families, couples, groups, etc. I'm sure there are lots of similar places on Maui, but we were very happy with this place. It just all depends on what you want to do. Do your research and figure out what you want to do, what's important to you and what your budget is.....

Its a quiet property and not the place to stay if you want to party all night. No bar on site, but right next door is Duke's and is only a 5 minute walk. We used the room amenites, ate breakfast and dinner on our lanai and lucnh out each day. The new grills are very clean and nice. The concierge was very helpful and so was Garrett at the front desk. The ladies at the front desk a bit snotty and I would recommend that management discuss their customer service/friendliness with them. From reading past reviews, I can see I'm not the first to notice this. Our unit 1105 was is reasonably nice condition with remodeled bathrooms. Could use some improvements, new blender, AC unit in main living room has hard time keep up while the master bedroom was freezing. The unit was cleaned each day and the maid service was helpful and friendly. Overall, the entire property is very clean and well maintained. You absolutely cant beat the proximity to the water and every room have ocean front views. We watched mantas, dolphins, sea lion/seal and other marine life swim right out front. The snorekling is just so-so right there. I would highly recommend driving about 20 minutes north to Honolua bay...the snorkeling was superb....nearly as good as diving. Snorkel Bob's will say not to go there...I think they just want to keep it a secret for the locals because we snorkeled all over and Honolua was the best.

This condo was part of the Mahana program so we received daily maid service, a newspaper and use of the movie rental program in the lobby. As everyone has previously stated the views are incredible. On our second morning we saw dolphins frolicking right outside the window. It was amazing. The condo is also very quiet. We have stayed at other condos on the ocean but closer to the road so you sometimes get that road noise. Not at the Mahana. It is tucked far back from the road so no need to worry about any noise other than the crashing waves. We attended the free orientation given by Susan Ramos on the first morning. We were so glad we did. Susan helped us find a massage therapist who came out to the condo. We had amazing massages on our actual anniversary right on the lanai. It was so wonderful to be able to hear the waves crashing and the price was better than any of the spas nearby. The massage therapist even commented that she had never been to the Mahana before on an outcall but it was now her new favorite place. Susan also arranged a sunset dinner cruise on one of the Pacific Whale Foundation's boat. That was also wonderful. Susan is great, I highly recommend using her if looking for excursions. She tries to get the best deal for you rather than trying to talk you into going with more expensive packages. She does not pressure you at all, just give you information and helps answer any questions you may have. All of the public areas of the Mahana are so well taken care of. I felt like I was at a high priced resort. They recently replaced the bbqs from what I understand. The new BBQs are very nice. We did not get a chance to use them but it seems that they scrub them down every evening because they all looked brand new. It is nice that the Mahana is on Kaanapali beach. One night we walked down to Black Rock to see the sunset torch lighting. It was a bit of a walk but very nice that you can actually walk there without having to go near the road. Georgina helped us initially with our reservations and she was the best. She was so friendly and very patient with us. I highly recommend staying at the Mahana.

Big mistake! Yes, we can all agree that the view is amazing at this hotel (all rooms have an ocean view) however, that does not make up for its extreme shortcomings. \u00c2\u00a0I will list these so that it is easier to read.\u00c2\u00a0 1. Attitude of the staff. \u00c2\u00a0On arrival, we were greated by Karen at the front desk. Karen displayed none of the attentiveness one should expect out of a front desk employee at a vacation resort. Karen was all business and didn't seem to care how much paperwork she threw at us so long as she could get back to her lunch, which she chewed on throughout our check-in, and get us out of her hair.\u00c2\u00a0 2. Housekeeping. Housekeeping came to our room everyday but we are not quite sure what they did. \u00c2\u00a0Sometimes our towels were refolded, sometimes they were left on a wet heap on the floor. Sometimes our duvet was placed back upon the made bed, sometimes it was folded on the couch other times it was left on the floor in the corner of our room. \u00c2\u00a0Some times we were left tide detergent other times we were not (that was included in our $10/ day charge.) one thing that was extremely consistent is that \u00c2\u00a0housekeeping never cleaned/vacuumed or mopped our floor. \u00c2\u00a0We were forced to walk around in socks and sandals due to the amount of sand on our floor in an effort to keep our feet clean. When you are in a tropical enviornment where people are constantly at the beach and in the sand, cleaning tile floor seems only reasonable, \u00c2\u00a0 3. Maintaince request response time (never). We stayed in room 1012 and the shower leaked and drain was partially clogged leaving a pool of water whenever we used the shower. \u00c2\u00a0We informed the front desk but nothing was ever done. \u00c2\u00a0There was also a brown stain on the wall next to the shower....may be mold from a possible leak. \u00c2\u00a0The drain in the bathroom sink was also broken. \u00c2\u00a0We informed the front desk about that as well, and per the usual, nothing was ever done. \u00c2\u00a0The room was shabby and dilapidated.....with holes in the curtains, tears in the sliding screen door, marks, scratches, and chips in the walls. The usual things one shouldn't expect in a resort-style condo. 4. Facilities. More of a warning than anything else. Expect to have the crummiest pool in the neighborhood!\u00c2\u00a0Also, the high Speed Internet was a joke. It was almost impossible to get a signal. For what we paid and what we saved by not going with slightly more expensive accommodations, this place was not worth the price and not up to our standards or expectations. We loved Maui in spite of this place and will not be returning to the Aston Mahana at Kaanapali.\u00c2\u00a0 Oh, and before the resort's general manager responds to this with promises to fix the problems and help us find a more appropriate room, we suggest he read a review of our room from October 2010 on Yelp that lists many of the same complaints and fix room 1012 before he offers to assist us or any other former guest!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Choice for Us\u201d", "Author": "LovinLife-027", "ReviewID": "UR114580674", "Content": "NOTE: Not all of the rentals at this location are as fully-appointed as the unit we booked. Some don't have kitchens at all. And, in some of the 2Br/2Ba units, one of the baths is just a powder room, with no shower or tub. So, be careful and very specific about your needs when making your reservation! We traveled to Maui for a family wedding in June with several must-have requirements. First, since we were bringing another couple with us (relatives), we needed a 2-bedroom, 2 bath suite. Second, we absolutely HAD to have air-conditioning, which many accommodations in the area of Maui that we needed to stay in (Ka'anapali / Napili Bay) do not offer. Had we gone by ourselves, we likely would have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for its proximity to the wedding venue but the cost of the 2Br/2Ba suite there, if available, would have been prohibitive. The condo we found at the Mahana was absolutely spot-on perfect for our needs. It had the required A/C, plus two spacious bedrooms, each with its own private bath, as well as a nice living/dining area (with wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling windows and breathtaking views) and a big kitchen with granite counters, stainless appliances and a full complement of dishes, glasses, cookware and utensils. It also offered a stacked washer/dryer that came in very handy for wet bathing suits and towels. As it was an owner-rented condo, the furnishings and artwork made it feel very home-like and warm. It had every amenity you could think of: Flat-screen TVs in the living room and both bedrooms - which we actually never used but it was nice to have the option - a stereo, CD and DVD players, nicely appointed bathrooms, plenty of closet and drawer space and a veranda big enough for a patio table and four chairs to watch sunrises with coffee and sunsets with a MaiTai. The Mahana is configured so that every room has an ocean view but our view from the 6th floor was truly spectacular. The condo itself was spotlessly clean, well-maintained and the daily maid service was accommodating to all of our requests. The pool/spa area looked to be clean and well-maintained as well, although we never used them. The ocean itself was too inviting! The beachfront at the Mahana was a bit too rocky for swimming but just a short walk to either side provided perfect, sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters for swimming, snorkeling and boogie-boarding (two of which were also provided in the condo). The staff were super-friendly, cheerful and eager to please. The only downside at all was that there was no restaurant on-site and, therefore, no room service, although there was a nice little snack bar down by the pool for breakfast sandwiches and light lunches. But, between the numerous other hotel restaurantsand free-standing eateries in the immediate vicinity and the convenient full kitchen in our condo, which we stocked with food upon our arrival, that didn't prove to be a problem for us.

A major plus to most of our stay was watching the whales from our balcony, hundreds of them during the week we were there. However, I wished we'd decided to stay instead at one of the nicer resorts just south of this dump, even if it meant cutting our stay by two or three nights to compensate. Here's why. When we first arrived, they placed us in a garden room. Guests were on lounge chairs on the grass just inches outside our sliding glass window. We begged them to move us at the front desk, and they said there were no alternatives because the owners were occupying most of the available units. I was in tears and since our stay was prepaid there was nothing we could do. Props to one woman at the front desk, I believe her name is Rose, for eventually moving us to another room, on the 8th floor with a view and privacy. However, the front desk staff for the most part are a nightmare. Any transaction involved an interminable wait, even for such a simple transaction as exchanging a beach towel. The lobby is uninviting and while some rooms are remodeled (our garden room for example) others (like the room we moved to) are extremely dilapidated and dingy. Maybe it's worth it to some to have the convenience of a kitchen and in-unit washer and dryer, but there are simply too many other drawbacks for us. Don't believe their claims to Internet access; it is spotty at best and completely unreliable. The worst part for us I think, aside from that horrible garden room nightmare, is that you cannot swim in the ocean in front of the hotel due to the rocks. Nor can you sit on the beach because it is so narrow. If we hadn't paid upfront (nonrefundable) we would've moved to another hotel, or left early.

Nicely Remodeled kitchen with everything needed to prep & cook. Beautiful bath with Huge walk-in/sit-down shower. Big Bedroom with mirrors to reflect the AWESOME view. King bed was pretty comfy but would have been better for restorative vacation sleep if it had a thick foam mattress pad. The in-room safes are small and won't hold a midsize laptop but are OK for small stuff. The wi-fi was weak and I had to a sit by the window for a signal. The grounds are nicely kept up. The pool and hot tub are small, but clean and a great retreat when the wind is blowing sand on the beach. There is a gorgeous grassy area between the resort and the beach that is only for Mahana guests. There are lots of lounge chairs and palm trees and no music or cell phones are allowed. IT IS PEACEFUL LIKE IN A HAWAIIN MOVIE!!! The beach is steps away, great boogie boarding and snorkeling within 100-200 feet. Mahana is WONDERFULLY PEACEFUL WITH A SPECTACULAR VIEW.

The previous trip (a mother/daughter one) two years ago, and this trip was with DH, our two children and their spouses. I was anxious to return to the Mahana and was hopeful that the rest of my family would like it just as much as I did ... it turned out to be a hit with everyone (our ages range from mid 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) ... all agreed that it was ideal. We had 3 condos amongst the 6 of us (1218, 818, both one bedrooms, and 1213, a studio) . We rented privately, with all 3 units in the mid-price range and all in good condition,with many updates. DH and I stayed for 14 days, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for 8 days. (On my previous trip, I stayed in 611, a 2 bedroom, which I also really enjoyed.)

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very quiet complex; the pool area was never crowded, and the loungers on the lawn facing the beach is a nice area for R&R. The bbq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are excellent quality and spotlessly cleaned every day. The tennis court is in great condition too. Snorkeling out front of the Mahana is really good ... beautiful coral and lots of fish. It was easy to get into the ocean for swimming or snorkeling at the beach between the Mahana and Honua Kai. The boardwalk (which goes for about 1.5 miles towards Black Rock and beyond) starts at the Mahana parking lot. Dukes restaurant is next door ... a 3 minute walk. We did most of our grocery shopping (other than a Costco stop) at the Times Supermarket ... a 10 minute walk, or 1 minute drive. We really like West Maui for the convenience of getting to some of our favourite places for swimming and snorkeling (Honolua Bay, Kapalua Beach, Napili Beach), for walking the Kapalua Coastal Trail and driving the scenic road to the blowhole.

The first thing I saw was the SWEEPING ocean view (we'd rented an ocean view room) from the living room, lanai, and the bedroom once the amazing stained glass sliding doors were opened. Unit 407 is very funky and bohemian in decor--a perfect fit for us. The kitchen cabinets were a very modern cherry wood with granite counter tops and contained all that you could need in a kitchen. The vibe at the hotel, and with staff, was very comfortable, friendly and cozy (no pretentiousness here). The pool/spa area had a bbq area and there were other bbqs on another end of the property. Parking was easy. There are no restaurants on site, however Duke's is within walking distance, and there is a coffee cart on the property serving snacks, coffees, smoothies and shaved ice. I booked a massage and although there is no spa on site, the massage was booked at the Kaanapali Shores (a less than 10 minute walk away through a nicely manicured parking lot). I will definitely look into staying at this property the next time I go back to Maui. The only con I can think of is that the mission style bed in the bedroom was substantially squeaky. The bed was very creaky when getting in and out. If you call to specifically rent this unit, I would suggest asking if the bed is still very creaky.

Everyone was really nice about it and they offered to have someone come spray but since I'm pregnant, I had to decline and request a new room. The new room they gave us was beautiful, completely renovated and on the 5th floor. The only problem with that was the palm trees blocked our view of the water so it was hard to see whales, sunsets, etc. We enjoyed our stay at the Mahana and I would recommend it to others. The wireless didnt really work unless you were in the lobby. One major perk was free parking. Also there is a Times grocery store right across the street. We thought the prices were the same as they were at home, very fair. No need to go to Costco unless you will be there for more than 2 weeks (Costco is near the airport). We really liked the restuarant Dukes next door at the Honua Kai. We also found this really good japanese noodle restaurant called Star Noodle. It was close to Lahaina and probably our favorite meal (plus not expensive at all!). Also I recommend going to Warren and Annabelles magic show and doing the road to hana.

Lovely place!\u201d", "Author": "mrsmponds", "ReviewID": "UR100307047", "Content": "As with most condo complexes on Maui, these are individually owned. I don't think I would ever go with a package where you have no say in which condo you get. Have to go with VRBO where you can see pictures etc. One of the biggest pluses I loved about the Mahana vs others is the buildings face the water, not each other. I loved being able to walk out on the lanai in my jammies (or whatever-no one could see up 12 floors!). We were not looking into someone else's bedroom. So much more private! We rented 1204 vrbo 15244, a 1b/1ba sleeps 4. Gorgeous! Plenty of living space. Do not be afraid of the building facing the sun-yes it's very warm in the afternoon but the entire apt has central air (unlike some that only have a unit in the front living room so you burn up in the bedrooms at night). You get a great cooler breeze once the sun goes down a little. Also, there are heat/light filtering shades/screens most people have there. Again, check the pictures and/or ask the owner. Great breeze off the water, fantastic water views, water color sunsets. There were a couple ants in this condo but not in the kitchen. Have them at home too so it didn't phase me. It was not an invasion-they are in the building so will travel to where they find food-just be clean and don't leave a mess! (did not encounter any flying roaches here as we did in 3 other places that were short buildings) All the kitchen appliances are new. Liked the window in the kitchen by the ceiling in this condo-helps to ventilate the heat out when you cook. The owners were wonderful to work with, very prompt in responding to email. They stay here too and it shows. Kitchen supplied with spices, lots of gizmos and electonics. Beach towels & toys in the closet. Plenty of closet/dresser space in this condo. Pool area is really reallynice-updated last year-new slate from one side to the other. Almost empty every day when we went in June. The hot tub is HUGE! Unlike another place we stayed-my 4 yr old did not get fussed at for having a pool float ring (even in the hottub-we were the only ones in it at the time). Used the grills a couple times-they were cleaned daily and very easy to use. A table and sink are available. The bathrooms are nice-showers available, plenty of room to dress. If you are catching a later flight, you could bring your change of clothes after packing up the car and spend the rest of the day at the beach or pool, then go shower before you go. I felt very safe here having things in the car. Oh yes-parking is free, not like the charges put on you just to the south on the main Ka'anapali beach. The beach-while IMMEDIATELY in front of the building has some flat rocks, a very short walk takes you to sand. Was not an imposition at all. Actually we really enjoyed the rocks at low tide-made tide pools and saw tons of little tropical fish and critters. My 4 yr old loved it. Speaking of-we had no problem with my 4 yr old son and being on the 12th floor. The lanai railing is a solid plexiglass-no kids falling through bars or getting stuck. There is a camera on the building if you want to check out the beach etc-http://67.53.48.2/CgiStart?page=Single&Language=0. Supermarkets-don't bother with the one across the street unless you just have to get a bottle of milk or something. Go down to Lahaina to the Safeway. We don't have a Cosco membership as we usually get fresh produce instead of prepackaged stuff. There is also a Walmart on the island. I'd advise stopping on the way in to get dinner/breakfast items for that day and next morning so you can take stock of what's in the pantry/fridge already. Most condiments, coffee, sugar and the like was already in this condo. Also some wine, beer, alcohol. The beach walk starts next door in front of the Honua Kai. Bring water! We stupidly started out right after lunch and baked after an hour. It does take you through the middle of a couple of resorts-kind of cool to see what you didn't rent and be thankful. Beach got crowded the further south we went (never went north past next buidling). There are bathroom facilities and water fountain on the way before you get to the Sheraton blackrock. We didn't go beyond that...just too pooped! We actually never went on that side of Ka'anapoli beach. Heard a lot of how there was little public parking and the beach we had was just fine. I do prefer this beach, and the ones in Kihei that we went to-Kamaole 1 I think, to the one up on Napili Bay. We went one afternoon and there was hardly any where to park. Glad I saw one review that said the beach dropped quickly. Boy did it! You must watch your kids at Napili Bay-a few steps out and I was over my head! It wasn't as bad further down the beach in the corner but we didn't feel like walking that far. There was a public shower to wash off before getting in your car-but it was broken when we left. The larger public beach a little north at DT Fleming beach was ok-still the drop off. The afternoon tides were too strong for us. Also noticed in the 3 wks we were there that the winds were really strong in the afternoons-like getting your legs sandblasted. Some locals said it was unusual for it to be that bad. All in all-we were very pleased with this condo and this building. Are looking to go back and rent here, then for a week down in Kihei.

My wife, 3 year old son and I stayed at the Aston Mahana for 8 nights in late November, early December. It was a great place for us to stay during our trip to Maui, which was a combination of just relaxing and taking a few day trips (Blue Hawaii helicopter tour, the road to Hana and up to the summit of Haleakala). The Mahana is not a typical hotel such that the rooms are individually owned condos which are managed as hotel rooms by Aston while not being used by the owners. It is not a timeshare property. Our unit was great. Had a separate bedroom with a queen sized bed, a large bathroom, washer and dryer, full kitchen, living room and a nice, screened in balcony. Having the washer and dryer, as well as the kitchen really was handy, especially as eating out can quickly add up. Food was more expensive than in Honolulu, even the groceries were quite a shock when compared to the prices back home. One tip, apply for the Safeway card that can really save you money on your groceries. Another tip, if you are only going to stay for a short time, you should consider bringing some basics with you if you can, unless you want to pick up some $5 aluminum foil. As a guest, you have access to a number of bbq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, both out back as well as out front, first come first serve. We never had a problem getting our turn.

The guests, at least when we were there, were mostly families and older couples. If you are young and looking for a place to party, this area may not be the best one for you. If you want a tasty meal at a close by restaurant, head out to Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is right next door. The place is really popular though so you should try and make reservations. The only real negative in my opinion is that the Wifi only works really well in the lobby areas.

The staff is supurb, Karen at the front desk, Mark the manager and Susan the Expedia Guest Services representative. All went the extra mile to help us during our stay. The view is breathtaking and the grounds are very convenient to all activities on the island. The best new thing is the beach walk opened in 2010. You can go through the condo parking lot and walk 5 miles all the way to the Hyatt. Dukes a great restaurant is right next door. There are many beach facilities along the walkway if you want to stop and swim, walk, whatever. Great jog in the AM. There is no much to do on the island or you can do nothing. The units are updated yearly and my fav unit, 915, had many upgrades next year. I always rent from the condo itself, NOT VRBO, because of the personal assistance. The deposit is small and balance is not due until you check out. If you need anything, call the front desk and they are right there for you. Parking is free, there is a great grocery store across the street and a great pizza place in the same complex. You are about 15 minutes from Lahaina, a great place to shop on Front Street, restaurants, etc. If you go, you must try Kemo's and Ruth Chriss Steakhouse. They are wonderful. Had a great lunch at Cheeseburger in Paradise. This town reminds me a lot of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. Overall, you will not go wrong with this location.

I was hard-pressed to find any negative comments and now I know first-hand why! Although a little tricky to find (once you're on the Kanaapali stretch of highway, and you pass through the intersection with the Budget Car Rental outlet on your right hand side, take the FIRST left-hand turn lane that comes up and follow the road down until you see 3 hotel signs on your left side, one of which is the Aston Mahana - follow this road - the Mahana is the last of the 3 hotels). Because we were there pre-Christmas, we got to delight in the outrageouly fragrant, massive Christmas tree set up in the foyer - no one could tell me what kind of tree it was; it looked like a pine tree, but smelled like a hibiscus... that was our first impression, and things just kept getting better. We dealt with lovely people at the front desk, and then made our way to our gorgeous studio room on the 11th floor.... truly stunning views, and the room itself was a beautifully updated haven at the end of each day. The sub-zero fridge, and well-appointed kitchen (all new stainless appliances) all made for efficient and easy use (tip: we stopped in at Costco en route from the airport and stocked up on some easily-prepared meals: at $4.99 for a huge roasted chicken, you can get creative for lots of great lunches and simple dinners. Oh, and 100% Kona coffee - Costco seems to be the best place as far as I could see for value. For last minute meal prep needs, the Times grocery store, a quick 5 min walk across the street provided great variety.) Arriving just at the onset of whale season, we were treated one morning to a 3 hour show, right off of our lanai, to an incredible dance of whales breeching and playing. Our camera's zoom lens, and daughter's steady hand provided for some incredible keepsake images. Whales, surfers, sunsets, people watching, and general tranquility were enjoyed at all times of the day on that lanai. It is incredible that every single unit offers the same beachfront opportunity, although perspective would be different on each floor; I'm sure that each holds its own charm. Apparently, building codes no longer permit construction that close to the beach so it is truly a decadent treat to reside there. In terms of proximity, the Mahana is very well-situated. It's true that the beach directly in front of the hotel is not great for swimming due to the reef, but steps in either direction affords easy access for snorkelling or general surf play. You can also walk the boardwalk up to the Sheraton (about a 30 min walk), passing gorgeous private residences, and beachfront restaurants along the way - we had a lovely breakfast at the Castaway one morning, and have heard good things about Duke's but didn't get to it ourselves). A quick 5 min car ride north to Napili beach was another lovely outing with great meals available at the Gazebo, also right on the beach. We didn't get to see them ourselves, but apparently turtles like to hang out here. We attended the complimentary breakfast that the activities co-ordinator, based out of the Mahana, invited us to, and if anything it was a good crash-course on what is available to do on the island. We had already read up on most things (I did say I liked to research... and would highly recommend the book Maui Revealed, which is available at Maui Costco, and has a great companion website). We booked a couple of activities through the activities co-ordinator (the Molokini snorkel was really great!) and by agreeing to take in a time-share presentation through another company, saved a WHACK of cash on the luau we attended. I must say, those time-share presentations are NOT for the weak of conviction or financial means! Old Lahaina town is about a 7-8 min drive south and full of character, restaurants (Cheeseburger in Paradise and Bubba Gump's were quite good), and retail, retail, retail! You must see the Banyan Tree - quite magnificent and truly magical when done up with all of the Christmas lights. The ONLY negative experience we had at the Mahana was in relation to their \"No-Smoking\" policy in rooms and on the lanai. Apparently, if you're a visitor, you can face harsh fines upwards of $400 for disregarding the rule.... HOWEVER, if you are an owner, the staff (as lovely as they are) feel that their hands are tied and cannot enforce the rule... a double-standard to be sure. We were only in Maui for a week and didn't want to exhaust ourselves running about from one activity or location to the next, so found our location to be the perfect mix of all that we were looking for. I know that many of the neighboring resorts had fitness facilities and much more extravagant rooms and ammenities, but truly, being beachfront was FAR superior for us than having a goosedown duvet! Falling asleep to the sound of the crashing surf and a night sky FULL of stars (no city lights to compete with), and waking to brilliant blue sky and endless ocean is all we needed to feel COMPLETELY satisfied and refreshed by our selection and experience.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pickering, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSimply Paradise\u201d", "Author": "Crossborder_10", "ReviewID": "UR90849057", "Content": "Folks, my wife and I stayed at the Mahana from Dec 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 14 and had an absolutely wonderful experience in every way.

However, we shouldn't have worried at all, when we arrived we were simply blown away by our whole experience. We reserved a premium one bedroom unit on the 9th floor and it was simply stunning.

I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to other units but this one was fabulous. The view was incredible and our timing was great because the Humpbacks were just arriving from Alaska and coming into the bay out front of the condo.

We asked to be moved and the Mahana accommodated our request. The newly remodeled room was awesome, granite counter tops, flat screen televisions, nice decor. Because the Mahana is older, it is right on the beach, like fifty feet max, hence the fantastic views from the rooms. Most newer resorts are set back 100yds or more. The only problem is you can't swim at the beach. You have to walk 100yds in either direction. The staff at the Mahana were very nice. The place is kept very clean. We would definitely go back. We only had one bad experience and that was with a business called MVP Photography. They have fliers at the front desk and offer a free 8x10 portrait. We decided to have family photos made and give them as gifts for the holidays. It has been six weeks since the photo's were taken and we have not been able to contact the business.

Everything in Hawaii is very expensive- $4 Gas, $4.50 Gal Milk, $25 a night to park your car at an Oahu hotel, etc... When you stay at the Mahana you don't feel like you were ripped-off, or nickel and dimed. We're not wealthy people and have been hit by the economy like many of you. It takes us many years to save up for a trip like this. On our first stay here we did not fully utilize having a well-equiped kitchen in the unit and several beautiful gas grill downstairs. This time we went to Costco on our first full day and stocked up on groceries & beverages. I was eating cereal and drinking orange juice on our balcony while watching whales-every morning! We would take steaks down to the poolside grills, bring them back to the room, whip up some Mai Tai's or Pina Colada's in the blender and have a sunset meal on our balcony. We really dug our heels in and relaxed here. There's also a nice beach boardwalk that goes south. This path seems to go for almost a mile (though down further it snakes through some off-beach areas) and you can take it down to the Sheraton Black Rock. There's also a nice beach about midway that has restrooms, picnic tables and sandy shorelines (the water at the Mahana is rocky).

The two living room chairs were soiled yuck! We requested sheets from housekeeping and covered all three pieces and I felt much better that we did not have to sit on dirty furniture. When inquiring and making reservations the aston staff at the 1-800 location mentioned that they almost always upgraded and asked if we had any requests. So I requested an upper floor away from the elevator. Upon arrival we were slated for the 5th floor I requested a different room and ended on the 8th floor and we never did receive an upgrade. This condo bldg. was quiet mostly age 40 and up saw one family with a small child. The cleanliness in the rest of the condo was quite clean. The king size bed was heavenly but the sleeper sofa was well a sleeper sofa really not good for teenagers but there own room was going to be another $100.00 a night. We did research obtaining this condo through Costco but found the cancellation guidelines costly. Since we were in Hawaii before (second time to Maui) we were prepared for sticker shock in the grocery stores. My husband eats cream of wheat, which is $2.88 in Cleveland was & $7.00 there. Although this is a vacation we did prepare by packing a few items which we did find expensive which gave us more room for souvigners. We of coarse love our Costco membership and it came in handy on both islands where we shopped, bought gifts and ate several times both on Ohau (Nov.27- Dec1) and on Maui. Both stores have Hawaiian items. Let me tell you about some great tips for shopping there and go over a few prices: Gal.

I could kick myself for not buying more. It is the most delicious coffee. They also had very fresh leis. On Maui there are no fuel pumps to gas up your rental car. The Costco is about five minutes from the Airport and the Mahana is about a 45 minute drive away. Close by to the Costco is a Walmart and K mart In all the Mahana in Kaanapali was nice I was told that condos further up the road were more reasonable. Also check your private individuals who rent out their condos at the Mahana on the VRBO website. The accommodations may be more updated for the money.

The kitchen had granite counter tops, really nice white cabinets and stainless steel appliances. The living room/ dining area was larger than I anticipated. The bedroom had a king bed (mattress was just ok - I have back problems so most mattresses are just ok for me). The main bathroom had a tub with sliding glass doors and beautiful tile work, again it looked new. The second bathroom was a tiled walk in with a two wall glass enclosure. Absolutely gorgeous. we went across the street to Subway for sandwiches, ate and called it a day. We could not believe our eyes the next morning when we woke up. Since we couldn't see anything when we arrived due to the rain and darkness, we didn't know what the view would be. One entire wall in the livingroom was a window. There was nothing between us and the Pacific Ocean. The laini was off the master bedroom and the living room with a table and 4 chairs as well as a chaise. We used it often for reading, sunning and snacking. If you go to Maui for a view, you would never need to leave the room. We also were surprised when we left the room. We opened the door and had another fabulous view: mountains , other condos and could still see part of the ocean. We used the large hot tub most nights and did get into the pool a couple of times. You couldn't do better than this hotel for your stay in Maui. Also, the best grocery store was a 10 minute walk (next to the Subway) called Times. Good prices and variety. We did go to the Safeway about 4 miles away in the Cannery Mall but it was a little more expensive and crowded. also the best palce to find affordable souviners was Long's Drugs on the Cannery Mall.

Larissa gave us information on the restaurants near by and the supermarket, Tymes, which is right across the street from the hotel. You can walk there. Where Tymes is at there is a strip mall there with some fast food services. When we went on the Road to Hana we bought a styrofoam cooler from Tymes and walked to the Subway down the strip for sandwiches to take with us. We stayed 6 nights. They went fast. Helicopter ride, luau, road to Hana and beach fun was all we can fit in. The hotel pool area was very relaxing. We have to admit that we liked the pool area better than the beach. It was shady and sunny and relaxing. My husband loves to lounge in the shade. I love to lounge in the sun. Best of both worlds. The hotel grounds were Hawaii all the way. Beautiful.

After much research I gave up and found a travel agent who has been living on Maui for 20 yrs so she knows Maui inside & out. Kay Ryan has a warm & friendly personality & provides helpful tips. Her website is mauikay.com. Also, buy the book Maui Revealed by Andrew Doughty which is a great resource of finding restaurants, activities, etc while staying in Maui. He also provides maps. The book costs less than $14 if you order online. Kay found us this condo right on the beach. Eating out can be very expensive so we wanted to be able to cook some meals in and we could also pack fewer clothes with a washer/dryer right in the unit. We chose a studio with a King sized bed on the top floor. With 2 adults the space was adequate as most of the time you'll be out sunbathing, sightseeing or shopping anyway. The view from the lanai was fantastic! There really are floor to ceiling windows looking which gives you a view of the ocean & mountains. While there we saw three rainbows. Awesome! When you arrive at the condo go down & check out the pool area which has 4 grills for barbecuing. If you ask Kay she can recommend a seafood place where you can purchase fresh seafood which is not too far from the condo (get the crab cakes which are wonderful). We also snorkeled at Black Rock which is near the Sheraton Hotel which you can see from your lanai if you lean out slightly & look to your left if you're on one of the higher floors. There are snorkeling tours but why pay for something when you can do this for free with the exception of renting your snorkeling gear. Also drove the road to Hana in our convertible Mustang which we enjoyed. Again you can pay to take a bus tour or can drive yourself & not be a slave to their schedule. Driving the road is 44 mi long & we only made it a little over half way because it's a long & winding road. Pack a picnic lunch because places to eat are few & far between. There's a Safeway grocery store near the condo where we purchased an insulated cooler & food for the trip. There's also a Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where you can rent gear. Two activities you that are a must do are the luau in Lahaina (most authentic) & if your budget allows take the helicopter tour which was well worth the money. Kay can help with booking the luau & book early to get the best table. We booked the helicopter tour from the Expedia desk which is on the 1st floor of the condo. We selected the hour long tour which the hour goes by very fast.

There were many things - stereo, big screen TV, VCR player, alarm clock, night stands, but dust on them wasn't nicely controlled. Also there was not enough space on the drawer to put your everyday stuff as the stereo occupied the space. We have NEVER seen a bug in the unit during our 9 days of stay but there was a guide note that implies there had been bug problems before. But I believe they are taking an intense care for that as I think of their intention of note and the fact that I haven't seen any. (Of course I put extra care for keeping everything clean and sealed) The disappointment actually came from the small bathroom with an old bath tub. Spots on the bottom of it made me uncomfortable.

The location is north of the black rock that divides Kaanapali beach but is close enough such that it is a short drive to Whaler's Village Shopping Center. We were in room 315 in the Lanai tower and the view is spectacular! Every room faces the ocean with a private lanai that is accessible from both the living room and the bedroom. Our bed was spacious and the mirrored wall in the living room allowed you to see the ocean from almost anywhere in the condo. At the entrance road to the resort there is a strip mall with a Times Supermarket that has reasonably priced groceries if you want to save some money and eat in from time to time. We chose to buy fresh pineapple and other fruit and eat it in the morning on the lanai while watching the waves. There is also a coffee/bar called Java Jazz, which has a great atmosphere with pretty good Kona coffee. About a block north of the entrance road is an ABC store (Hawaii's version of general store) with a gas station which is always less crowded than those in the shopping malls in Kaanapali & Lahaina. So, the location of the Mahana is very convenient to all of the needed supplies. There is a gate that leads to a nice walkway across the parking lot that has a cipher lock. Just ask the front desk for the combination and they will give it to you. The walkway leads behind several neighboring properties and behind the dunes leading to the larger beach area. Also along the walkway is Duke's Grill and several access points to the beach. The beach in front of the property is very narrow but is a very short walk to the larger beach areas where you can stretch out for a tan or snorkel/swim. You can hear the waves gently break against the rocks all night long and makes for a very restful sleep. My wife and I both loved this! The swimming pool was nice and clean, plus the staff is great. Even though we didn't use it, Expedia has a concierge on-site to help assist with booking events. There is also a small stand in the lobby next to the pool that sells smoothies, snacks and hot dogs. Housekeeping will not bother knocking if you have the Do Not Distub sign on the door but they will call you after a couple of days and ask if you need anything. We found this to be great for us because we don't like housekeeping entering our room without us being there. There is a safe in the room but it is an extra $2.60 per day, which is a very small price to pay for piece of mind if you have valuables with you. I used it to lock up a 13\" Macbook (too small for a larger laptop), a couple of ipods and a digital camera when we went out to dinner.

We snorkeled along the reef and found many fish and a turtle. Our favorite beaches were Napilli and Kapalua. They both had beautiful sand and calm waters. D.K. Fleming was a fun beach for body boarding. Honalua Bay is a black rock beach where many of the snorkling excursions stop at. I suggest getting there early in the morning 8-9 A.M. for a good parking spot. Many people parked on the side of the road and returned to find a ticket, so be careful. All four beaches are just a short drive north of the Mahana. We also attempted the Road to Hana trip. We only made it to mile marker 32 which ended up being the best place to end the day. Twin Falls at mile marker 2 (beginning of Road to Hana) is a great place to stop and hike to three different waterfalls. You can swim in all three spots. Mile marker 32 has the Waianapanapa State Park. The park has a black rock beach, a lava tube, and a cave you can swim in. Not to mention the view is amazing.

And I probably have snorkeled most all known spots on Maui. You will need to walk up or down the beach to get in the water but the sea life out on the reef in front of the complex is awesome. Well worth the effort. The BBQ facility here is first rate. New, clean and right next to the pool. Our 2/2 room was a premium unit. Premium unit I believe means gutted and remodeled. All 2/2 units also are on the ends of the blds with wrap around views. Some 2/2 rooms have double Lanais as ours did. One off the master and one off the living room. Some have their Lanais converted to indoors. I'm not sure who owns or rents those units. The view from the 2nd bedroom is mainly mountain. Our unit had.....Granite counter tops, Travertine floors. Custom baths. Upscale furnishings, New hd tv's, Upscale appliances, and AC's in each room that will freeze your a*s off. Our unit was under $500 a night with all the fees. Try to find 2 hotel rooms ocean front with all the fees under $500 in June. I couldn't. Be careful though if you rent a unit from someone other than Aston. While some owners might have better units, some might not. We peeked in to a unit here that looked like a dump. Maybe in the midst of work being done. Not sure. I don't think it was an Aston rental however. I was told that all Aston managed units have been remodeled.

The combination of the spaciousness of the units, the incredible unobstructed ocean views (try finding anything else like it on Maui in this price range - you won't!), and the quiet location near Lahaina and Kaanapali keeps us coming back. In addition to the rooms, the pool, BBQs and landscaped grounds are excellent. We actually like that it's not a swimming beach in front of the property, as it keeps it a little quieter than Kaanapali beach just a few metres down the shore. The only drawback is that some units are definitely nicer than others - many have been renovated to a high quality, but some are still 1980s vintage. On two occasions we have been disappointed with the quality of the first unit we were assigned, so we asked for a different room and both times were very happy with what we got. Although in the past we have always booked directly with Aston, in the future we are going to try to research and book a specific unit directly through its owner, so we know exactly what we'll be getting. We definitely recommend staying in this part of Maui versus the busier Kihei area. You can always go to Kihei for the day but you will appreciate returning to the beauty, conveniences and peace and quiet of the Mahana. And if you're here sometime between January and April - you can watch the whales jumping from your lanai every morning. Does it get any better than that? Tip: If you stay here, definitely make the little extra drive to the Lahaina Cannery Mall Safeway for your groceries instead of the Times Market in Honokowai... better quality, selection and prices. Check out Sansei near Kapalua on the north shore for great sushi.

We had an amazing time and kept on pinching ourselves that we stayed at such a perfect place. We booked a studio directly through Aston (as we didn't want any \"surprises\" by renting from an owner). The studio was great - exceptionally clean, updated (granite & tile), large flat-screen tv with cable, well-equipped kitchen, air-conditioning (we didn't need to use it), modern & clean bathroom - and the view was incredible. We were on the 8th floor and had a perfect view of every gorgeous sunset. At night, we slept with our window open and could hear the waves lapping the shore. The lanai was a lovely place to unwind after a day of sightseeing - a glass of wine in hand - and it was very private... you can't see any other units from the lanai nor can you be seen. We missed any whale-watching (too late in the season) so we plan to go back earlier in the year in the future. I really loved that this place was so mellow and low-key. There weren't a lot of kids, people were quiet and content to hang out around the small pool or on the lawn, and the staff was very friendly but unintrusive. There is no on-site restaurant but there is a Duke's restaurant just a short walk away and it was delicious. (The Mahana does have a very small cafe that serves smoothies and sandwiches.) The Kaanapali boardwalk ends at the Mahana so you can take a walk down the coastline and see the other resorts and try out all the beaches. To me, they seemed very posh but they still couldn't beat the Mahana's proximity to the water. One knock is that the beach directly in front of the Mahana is not a great place to swim or snorkel but that is easily remedied by a VERY short walk to the left or the right of the property to more swimmable beaches. We also enjoyed staying in the north end of Kaanapali (really it was closer to Honokowai) where there were less crowds, but still a short drive to Lahaina for evening entertainment. We saw Ulalena there and HIGHLY recommend it. We also went to the Hyatt Luau but would like to try Lele's next time. If you stay at the Mahana and want an awesome Hawaiian plate lunch, just go up the road to the Honokowai Okazuya... yum! In summary, if you want a laidback vacation at a hidden gem, then BOOK a condo at the Mahana.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a very warm and gracious clerk at the front desk who got us into our room in less than 10 minutes. We had a studio unit, about the size you would expect, but the room was very clean, had granite countertops and a marble-tile two-person shower, and a comfortable bed. The view from the 12th floor was spectacular! Exactly the view you find on the virtual tour site, except no palm tree trunk, and the room was pretty representative as well. Beautiful blue ocean and sky, with a nice breeze and 82 deg. The balconies are staggered and designed such that you really can't see anyone else's balcony, so I assume ours was private too(hope so...). Just you and the ocean, and a couple songbirds at times. The first morning my husband was treated to a humpback breaching offshore directly in front of the Mahana during his morning coffee on the lanai. Incredible site the first time you see it. Soon you realize that you can see many whale spouts in the channel, and this was late April. Must be really busy in January! We experienced very little noise from other units or the pool; just the sound of waves breaking on the shore 60 feet from the bldg. The Mahana is closer to the water than any other hotel/condo we saw during our stay. And the beach was not crowded like Kaanapali south beach( a handful vs hundreds, no kidding). Many guests appeared to prefer lounging around the pool, which meant there was always a lounger or beach chair available on the grass or the beach; and little green lizard friends to keep you company if you look closely. The beach really isn't as nice just a short distance north of the Mahana, we wouldn't recommend going farther north in Kaanapali unless the beach doesn't matter to you. We enjoyed using the BBQs available near the pool on two occasions, and they seem to be popular with many of the guests; but I only waited 5 min one night for a grill. They are really nice grills too. The smell of steaks cooking at dinner will draw you in from the beach. The whole property looks much newer than it's age, being well-maintained, updated, and clean.. We found that the WiFi worked very well in our unit, as did the cable TV, airconditioning and laundry. In the afternoons the breeze is off-shore, which will ventilate a hot room in just a few minutes with the front and balcony doors open. The beachwalk ends at the edge of the Mahana property which is a nice way to check out some of the nearby restaurants at some of the hotels, or walk all the way to Kaanapali south beach if you're up to it. There are many shops and small restaurants within walking distance, and it's a five minute drive to Lahaina. The sunsets are incredible in west Maui, and the Mahana is front and center. We found that the guests were mostly adults looking for a calm place to relax. Families who want alot of activities for the kids onsite may be happier at one of the other resorts, yet a family still might find the Mahana a good base from which to explore Maui. We toured the entire island, including the road to Hana and beyond, so although not centrally located, it is still doable. We recommend renting a convertible to see the island, we went everywhere with the top down and got a great tan! Don't be afraid of the road to Hana or the road north of Kaanapali, the drive isn't as bad as some make it seem, and there is fantastic scenery the faint-hearted will never enjoy; like discovering private jungle waterfalls within walking distance of the road to Hana. We loved everything about our stay at the Mahana. The room was very nice, the grounds were nice, the staff was great, and the room rate is a bargain compared to other 4-star properties in Kaanapali. And while we were once offered an opportunity to attend a breakfast timeshare meeting, we didn't get a high-pressure sales pitch and it wasn't brought up again.

Since we were returning in the month of February, the ultimate in high season in Hawaii, we made our reservations through a travel agent last September since our trip this time, in addition to some much needed R & R for my husband, was specifically to have a front row seat to the whale show. We had seen whale activity on previous trips, but they were usually at the tail end of the season, and whale sightings were usually spotty. After traveling for 16 1/2 hours, door to door, we walked up to the front desk at the Mahana very tired, but with huge smiles on our faces and greeted with a very warm \"Aloha\", then handed an envelope and told that since they were overbooked and had no room for us, we were \"given an upgrade\" at a resort just two properties north. We both snapped back to attention rather quickly and said that this was unacceptable, not only since we had never even considered staying anywhere else on this trip, but that we had years ago stayed at the other property, which is a huge timeshare resort, very attractive with great suites, but still a resort \"hotel\", full of families with children, not the great oceanfront \"home away from home\" condo units with non-stop views that you get at the Mahana. The gentleman at the desk finally called for the Manager, who assured us that if we checked out the next morning and returned to the Mahana, she could put us into a great unit on the twelfth floor, which she did. The next eight days were like being in Heaven and fullfilled all of the expectations we had upon our return. To Aston Hotels, shame on you for overbooking. We really don't understand how this can happen, what with modern computer programs and such. It seems like a blatant disreguard for their customers, many of which have saved long and hard for trips to destinations like Hawaii. We will definately return to The Mahana on our next trip to Maui, whale season or not, as it is a wonderful property, totally ocean front on a great part of Maui. Next time, however, we plan on booking directly through an owner which can be done on many different web sites, such as VRBO. This property is generally very quiet and very well maintained. The units in these two buildings are owned individually, so furniture and decor will differ, but from what we've seen, most owners take pride in their units. Make sure to buy groceries from either the Safeway in Lahaina (don't go in the evening - it's a disaster) or the Times market in the strip mall right across the road from the entrance off of Lower Honoapiilani Hwy. I was leary about the latter, but it's a great store, much better than when it was owned by another company previously.

We heard drilling & pounding all day (Monday-Friday.) The only 2 days we actually spent at the hotel and tried to take a nice afternoon nap, we couldn't because of the noise right next door.

Neither of us has really travelled outside of Canada before so planning our honeymoon was a bit intimidating, how do you decide on where to stay? Our decision to stay at the Mahana was pretty much soley based on the reviews I read on TripAdvisor. So hopefully this review can help others. We booked directly through the hotel and were given room #218, a one bedroom condo. When we checked in and walked up to our room (late in the evening after a long flight) and seen a crooked door knock, my heart sank.... until we opened the door and turned on the lights. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!! Tile floors, granite counter tops, floor to ceiling ocean facing windows, beautiful kitchen the list just goes on. We couldn't have picked a more beauiful room if we tried. The service was great and everyone was smiling. When we were looking at location the only thing that we really cared about was an ocean front room, and this met out expectations. It was great just waking up and looking out the window to the clean blue water and the sea turtle swimming by! The beach front was awesome and the views fantastic. With no resturant on site that didn't really bother us at all, there are plenty of places to eat in Lahaina or smaller places across the road within walking distance. We did go to the neighboring hotel for supper on our last day and one thing we noticed was the amount of children at that location. At the Mahana we hardley noticed any children at all (which made the place quite and relaxing for us) Our tours we booked through Susan (the Expedia travel gal located right in the hotel) who helped us plan our week. We did the trip to watch the sun rise at Haleakala (which we didn't get to see because clouds moved in) but that trip was totally made worth it by our awesome tour guide Koa. We also did some snorkeling to Molokini (which we also didn't get to go too due to rough waters) but the great crew at the Pacific Whale Foundation took us to another location where we seen 6 sea turtles and got to touch an octupus. We were lucky enough to go whale watching (only because the whales came back early this year) and hung out with 3 humpbacks for a while. A lualu was a must and we went to the one at the Hyatt. The food was great, and so were our seats (we just paid for a standard ticket) and the open bar was always enjoyable. The road to Hana... we had every intention of driving it on our own until we booked our tours and thought the tour would be the good choice. Apparently the first part of the trip is called honeymoon alley and the later part of the trip is divorce row. I can now see why, book the tour!!! The driver doesn't get to experience the trip at all, with the 617 hairpin turns their eyes are always on the road (we hope). Plus the guides are awesome and can answer all your questions about history, plants or where to go to eat.

Each evening we left the bedroom door which opens onto the Lani open and slept to the sound of the Pacific lapping at the beach just below. Another nice feature here is that on site parking is free while most every property in/near Kaanapali charges daily for parking, often as much as $20 daily. A big plus to us was knowing how quiet this complex is; no noise from people above, below, or on either side as this building was so well constructed. The pool is inviting, yet smallish. One closet is full of beach gear to your use and plenty of beach towels for use as well. The kitchen has all the utensils needed including the all important cork-screw.

What have I done? I've gone and spoiled myself for life. No hotel room after this will ever measure up, I'm afraid. Now, it's not a PERFECT place, but the \"Con\"s are most definitely outweighed by the \"Pro\"s. Pros: (1) 100% OCEANFRONT ROOMS! No paying through the nose for upgrades! Only a few feet of sand from the water! Waves washing up on the shore all night long to soothe you to sleep! And I will NOT apologize for using so many exclamation points! (2) We stayed in a studio room on the 9th floor, so we had a completely unobstructed view of the ocean. There are a lot of tall palm trees out front, so if this is important to you, ask for the highest room possible. Of course, the tradeoff to this is that you might get a more dated-looking room, which seemed to be the case with us. It definitely wasn't bad, but the ambience was much more 1992 than 2009. But other than the floors (see #2 in Cons), it was clean and pretty. Nice pictures on the walls throughout the unit (though I'm not a fan at all of silk plants, but that's probably just me). Frankly, for the location, we didn't give a hoot that we might have had marble countertops if we settled for a third floor unit. (3) It's RIGHT ON THE OCEAN. The sound of the waves at night is sooooo soooooooothing. We actually kept our screen door open all night just to hear it (76-degree lows are deceptive to the unaware - it's REALLY breezy in Ka'anapali/Honokowai). (4) FREE PARKING. w00t! In West Maui - actually, Hawaii in general - you must never, ever take this for granted. After coming in from a weekend in Honolulu (where free parking at a good hotel is nearly impossible), we were soooo grateful for this. (Oh, and be prepared for downtown Lahaina parking fees, and the fines if you're late getting to your car. I've been told it can get uuuuugly.) (5) Down at the end of Ka'anapali Shores place and across the street, there is a strip mall with a Snorkel Bob's, a few restaurants (mexican, pizza, coffee shop), and a supermarket. Quite nice to stock up on some essentials (although prices are probably a little bit better at KMart or Walmart around Kahului Airport, if that's where you're flying in). (6) An Expedia Local Expert on staff during most of the day if you put off scheduling all of your excursions until you arrived. We only booked a tour for Road To Hana, but were glad we did because it took us ALL around the island (which you cannot do in your rental car - you have to turn around at Kipahulu and go allllllll the way back around, or else risk making your car company VERY CRANKY). (7) A pool and hot tub on site. Yes, the pool is relatively small, but it's not bad. And I didn't swim in it anyway; that's what having an OCEANFRONT HOTEL is for. (note: bring reef shoes, as the oceanfloor right in front of the hotel is rough from coral and such) (8) Friendly front desk staff...most of the time. (The night staff tends to be a tad less enthusiastic, but they're still nice and helpful.) (9) Only 15 minutes from old Lahainatown, which has some of the best lu'aus, restaurants, sights, and shopping in all of Maui. (10) A full-size kitchen with an electric stove, dishwasher, fridge, and most importantly a WASHER AND DRYER. Had I known this, I wouldn't have packed nearly so many clothes. Darn it! ;) (11) ...Have I mentioned that this hotel is TOTALLY OCEANFRONT? And how wonderful the ocean sounds? :) Cons: (1) No restaurant on site. However, you can take your room key to the Aston Ka'anapali Shores (a relatively short walk down Ka'anapali Shores Place), eat breakfast there, and charge it to your room at Mahana (as both facilities are Aston-managed). We didn't actually do this, though; we went across the street to Pizza Paradiso for their big-as-your-head breakfast burritos, which can easily be cut in half and stored in your fridge to reheat the other half the next morning when you're dashing off super-early for Haleakala. (note well: there's no food or gas at the Summit - go prepared!). For lunch, we ate on the run, and dinner we were usually in Lahaina. But I know for a lot of people, no on-site restaurant can be a deal-breaker, so thought I'd mention it. (2) Ceramic tiles in our room were FILTHY. We were there for eight days, and I doubt they were given a proper mopping at all for our entire stay. I'm a person who loves to be barefoot (especially on a hot day on a cool floor), but even from our very first morning, I couldn't walk from the shower to the lanai without the soles of my feet being caked with grit/dirt. GROSS. I swept the floor myself several times a day, and we only made one beach trip (on our second-to-last day) and shook out everything before we went inside, so we weren't bringing THAT much dirt in. I got by with laying damp hand towels throughout the unit and occasionally wiping off my gritty feet on them (or rinsing my feet in the tub and rubbing them on the bathmat). Blech! (3) Constant renovations going on, sometimes starting as early as 8AM and going until 3PM. Sanding, chopping, nailing, drilling, sawing, UGH! If you're someone who likes to have your lanai open while you take a leisurely mid-morning or early afternoon snooze after you just got back from your 2AM Haleakala sunrise trip...well, don't expect to get any sympathy from the staff. \"They have to get work done.\" Yeah, well, I have to relax and enjoy my vacation, too - I mean, I'm certainly not staying here for free after all! To their credit, they did contact the worker in the next room who was drilling holes in our shared wall to install a mirror in that unit, and verified we wouldn't hear anything more *from that unit* for that week. And these are condos after all (where some actually live here), not hotel rooms...not like it was any less irritating. I suppose the logical solution is then to turn on the A/C and shut the lanai door, but I thought they wanted to try us saving on energy costs? Hmm. Anyway, the construction only seemed to happen during the week, not the weekend. On the other hand... (4) Parking becomes a bit more of a headache on weekends. I don't know if residents just have more people over, or the weekend we were there was just before Thanksgiving, but we noticed a LOT less parking spots beginning Friday night through Sunday afternoon (we'd arrived the previous Sunday night). We still could find parking, just not as easily. But most of the time, you can find it very easily. And have I mentioned that it's FREE? (5) The ocean is too loud. Haha, just kidding. Honestly: WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE OCEAN BEING TOO LOUD? Isn't that why one elects to get an oceanfront room?! If it bothers you, perhaps you shouldn't stay at an oceanfront location. :) Two quick tips: (a) From the road, the sign is only labeled \"MAHANA\", along with the Ka'anapali Beach Club and Maui Kai. It doesn't say anything about Aston until you get inside - so if your exhausted jet-lagged self driving in the pitch black didn't know this, you might inadvertently end up driving into Aston Ka'anapali Shores in the next driveway and then having to explain to the gatekeeper, \"whoops, wrong hotel\" and getting a pass out of there. Um, not like we did this or anything. :) (b) Although the NAME of the hotel says \"at Ka'anapali\", the hotel is actually just across the north border of Ka'anapali in the town of Honokowai. Just in case your GPS or map directions have a hard time finding it (which, by the way, a GPS is strongly recommended to get anywhere in Hawai'i). The hotel is still considered to be on Ka'anapali Beach. A downside of staying in West Maui (in general), as opposed to South Maui (i.e. Kihei/Wailea) is that it's a longer drive to Ma'alaea (for snorkeling and the Maui Ocean Center), Kula (for Haleakala), and the road to Hana. You can't probably do snorkeling AND Haleakala AND Hana all in one day, so you're adding on about 20-30 more minutes each way with each excursion that you could be saving yourself staying in South Maui. On the other hand, you're much closer to Lahaina (VERY fun dining/shopping!) and the better lu'aus (South Maui is really NOT known for its lu'aus, if your research hasn't already indicated otherwise). After a lu'au, trust me, you want to be as close to your hotel as possible because you are going to be very tired. Plus, South Maui towns aren't nearly as picturesque. And remember: You're on vacation, and in Hawai'i no less. So stop worrying about the time, and just enjoy the rides and the scenery. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING to have a great vacation. If we stay in West Maui again, there is no question that we would stay at the Mahana again - even with all the prickly little annoyances. Because at the end of the day, that's all they were. And even with the longer drives aside, as nice and convenient and beautiful as the Mahana is, I would still put up with the commutes to stay here again. It was an absolutely amazing experience staying here, and I'm so glad that we did.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIf you love the ocean, this is your place!\u201d", "Author": "Visit Your National Parks", "ReviewID": "UR49612728", "Content": "Beautiful studio condo (#1113).

The views are stunning, with the island of Lanai on the left and the island of Molokai on the right. The view you get on the hotel's webcam is exactly what you'll see in person (although much clearer, of course, and with sound). My wife and I snorkeled about 300 yards or so south of the hotel (to the left, if you're looking out at the ocean) and conditions were fair. Kaanapali Beach's Black Rock area provided much better snorkeling; it was as blue and clear as a swimming pool. A Snorkel Bob's (very good service) is right across the street in the plaza near Pizza Paradiso, which was pretty good. The Mexican food place was so-so at best; if you're in the mood for Mexican food, traveling south to Lahaina is probably a better bet (and it's not that far). You're also close to the Farmer's Market on the Lower Road, and that's definitely worth a stop. Good produce and free samples. It's a fun place to spend some time, and a good chance to buy local. They offer a first-day in Maui breakfast with a chance to purchase some package tours at a discounted rate (we didn't attend). The concierge and front desk staff seemed very nice. The pool and grilling facilities were very nice, and beach towels may be checked out at the front desk. By the end of our four-night stay, my wife and I were picturing ourselves retired in Maui, living in the Mahana, listening to the ocean. What a way to go! We highly recommend the Mahana.

New kitchen, Stainless steel refrigerator and dishwasher, tile floors, bathroom shower, kitchen table, granite counters, wall coverings, flat screens in living and bedrooms and the AC is definitely working. The kitchen is fully stocked to with pretty much everything you need to whip up a tasty island meal. Towels, chairs, umbrellas, snorkel gear, beach stuff all available too.

This unit is legit. Left the sliding doors open every night and let the surf put us to sleep. There are amazing sunset and island views from your balcony too. We ate out on the lanai almost every day. Pool at the Mahana is nice and has outdoor grills available for guest use and a lawn area with loungers between the hotel and beach. The facilities do not compare with other hotels on this strip though, like the Westin, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying $350 per night either. Lobby is beautiful though.

This condo really exceeded our expectations, they have numerous pics posted on the website of each room that will not disappoint. The location is perfect--everything you need is close by. You can easily snorkel right off the beach in front of the resort, nice swimming pool and whirlpool, numerous grills, small shopping center across the street and anything else you need close by.

First off, just a quick bit about us to offer this in context. My wife and I travel a lot for business, and, though we do not take a lot of pure vacations, we have been around A LOT,,, and we know the difference between a good and a great hotel. Call the Mahana a condo, resort or hotel - it doesn't matter; it's a little of all of the three, and it's a great place to stay. My wife and I play between both mild and wild sides. We appreciate peace and quiet, but we are also extremely active people, so we were looking for the best of both worlds with our hotel. The Mahana is a beautiful resort. Though certainly big enough, it is not as large as some of the others in the area, but it has unique character and a real personality of its own. I have to specifically thank all the people who reviewed the Mahana as perfect for cleanliness and asthetic beauty because they were spot on and absolutely right! So, here's my own details of review: The Mahana's web site is very accurate. The actual rooms look EXACTLY like the pictures on their site, and, yes,,, they are absolutely gorgeous. The view cannot be described in fair justice. Honestly, if it's ocean view you want, there's no way possible to top this hotel. It's incredibly close to the water. The other islands are easy to see in the distance, and, when you look out your window, all you can see is ocean. The hotel is so close to the water that you honestly cannot even see the shore unless you look down (first couple floors excetion, of course...). As for what's in the view, well, the water is a touch rough right in front of the hotel, but there are very nice swimming areas within 100 - 200 yards away on either side. We tried snorkelling 125 yards to the West, and only about 30 feet from the sand shore (very soft sand by the way, far less rocky feeling than Waikiki Beach on Oahu) we saw hundreds of little fish and a few other things. One word of advice (for any Hawaii beach really) the water socks really made such a nice difference. Though there are several clear areas, it was so much nicer to not have to worry about gouging a foot on something with the water socks on. I would suggest that further as I viewed at least a dozen sea urchins while snorkelling - wouldn't want to step on one of them!!! My wife and I bought water socks, boogie boards, and snorkels, and we had a blast. Sometimes we just floated around; sometimes we snorkelled. All was very fun. The beach near the hotel is terrific. There are enough people, but it is certainly not crowded. The water you will swim/play in by the hotel can be rough, but it is not too deep. I am not a strong swimmer, and I had no trouble at all. Everything can be found in the area, but Kaanapali is nowhere near as busy as areas like Wailea. The Mahana has unique situation because of this. Again, the area directly in front of the hotel is not the top spot for swimming, so,,, that meant there was never any noise on the grounds right below us. On the other hand - 100 yards away, it was prime beach area. As for shopping - quite easy; the grocey store in the area is expensive, but it's extremely close to the hotel, and it does have everything. The famous Pizza place right behind the hotel lives up to its quality reputation. I prefer more formal meals on vacation and rarely eat pizza, but I found the other items at this place to be of excellent quality. I cannot remember the name of the place, but there is also a very nice Italian restraunt just a few blocks away. There's also the other hotels. I found it odd that the Mahana did not have it's own diner, but it really does not need it. Regarding other shopping, Lahaina is very near and has the coolest of the little shops on the island. Now, for what you probably REALLY want to know - the rooms. I'll be more brief here: The Mahana has big beutiful rooms, and they are very well kept. If you really look, you can tell that the hotel is at least a couple decades old, but everything is treated with excellent care, and it is so easy to see that everyone is trying to keep this resort at its best. When we looked at reviews, the two things we valued first were cleanliness and location. The Mahana is tops for both. We stayed there for 5 days and, \"did I find any insects?\" Quite honestly, yes, but ONLY one or two tiny little fly like things that were noticed on a small crack in the brick work by the bathrom mirror (right besde the outside wall). I'd challenge anyone to stay in any room on that beach and not notice at least that. I demand total cleanliness out of any hotel I stay at, and I have no problem rating the Mahana a complete 5/5 for that. It's clean - no funky smells - no mold - no major bug issues. Did I mention that the rooms are absolutely beuatiful too!?! The air conditioners are excellent quality - not the cheap outdoor wall units so many use. These ones work off interior walls (outdoor intake of course...); they are quiet and they work very well. I don't like strong air conditioning, but these were excellent if you just wanted to take the hote edge off. It's all ocean view, and the widows all have semi tranparent pull-down mesh privacy blinds. You can open them right up or leave them closed and still see through. There are additional drapes in any areas with beds if you want them, but nobody can really see into the rooms anyhow as they are so close to the water. The Lenai's are really nice. We had a one-bedroom unit, but I know the lenais are exactly the same for studios or 2 bedroom units as we checked out comparable rooms just for our own reference. My wife and I loved cuddling up on the lenais watching the waves rool in at night. In daylight, we often watched the massive sea turtle that seemed to live right outside our window. The free parking is a major plus, and though we really never used it (used the beach instead) the pool area was exceptionally clean. There are very nice outdoor shower stations to rinse off salt water right as you approach the Mahana's beach grounds, and there are walkways everywhere along the beach. Unlike many that charge in Hawaii, the Mahana has free wireless internet. They state that you need to use their hot spot on the first floor for that, but I had no trouble picking up the signal 8 floors up. If you want to print something, you'll need to acces their business center stations which charge 20 cents per minute for internet use - quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. The tennis courts on the grounds are very nice and offered a great additional experience. Expedia conducts some sort of 'introduction' deal in the mornings for new guests, but they won't hastle you to attend. I don't know if they talk any type of time share deal or not, but I do know that nobody ever pressured us to attend (and we didn't go). The front desk simply let us know that it was offered. There is a concierge who seemed quite friendly in the lobby. Personally, use this site, do the research, and book what you want, but, if not, she can hook you up with just about any tour. I am interested in trying Wailea just due to curiosity the next time I'm in Maui, but I cannot imagine another hotel/resort nicer than the Mahana. My wife and I will certainly look forward to our next stay there. PS: We stayed on the 8th floor in a one bedroom unit. We also saw untis on the 4th and 12 floor just for comparison. All rooms are very quiet and quite beautiful. The only noise you'll here at the Mahana is the waves.

I know that many people buy CD that plays wave sound to soothe them to sleep, but maybe since I am a \"city\" person and light sleeper who is not used to the sound of wave, the wave get pretty loud especially at night when it is high tide. I have to wear ear plugs in order to fall asleep. I just wish that they have installed a better soundproof balcony glass door in the bedroom. The glass windows in the living room has much better soundproof. Also I was glad to book through the owner instead of using Mahana. I find the people at the reception area not too helpful. The owner told us to bring recycling glasses/bottles to the reception area when we checked out and so we did. However, when we talked to the receptionist, she doesn't seem to know why we brought the recycling bottles down. And when I pass them the bag of plastic bottles, she does not want to take it at all with the attitude that as if I was passing her some dirty/stinky trashes and asked me to just throw on the floor... One thing I have to praise is their cleaning staff, I saw them always sweeping the floor and keeping the hotel area very clean and well maintained. Another limitation is the shore right in front of the hotel is pretty rocky and wave pretty strong when it is high tide so it is no suitable for swimming at all. Also the supermarket nearby is not really within walking distance especially if you are carry heavy groceries. So everytime when we need to go get something we have to drive although it is just less than 3 mins drive... They also claimed to have Free High Speed Internet maintained by hotel not individual owner. However, the speed is no where near High. There is one day we had to stay in to log on to the internet to do some work, and throughout the day the signal strength was either low or very low.

It has a kitchen and a laundry so it made life a little easier but we really chose this place for the views.

The rooms were very nice except for the outdated A/C controls which did not work very well. The bathrooms only have showers which lacks the romance of what a bath would provide. The elevators are extremely annoying, almost as equally as the noise from their renovations as they beep constantly for no reason. Most elevators beep to let you know that they have arrived at your floor and that they are going to now open, well these ones beep regardless, and it is not a quiet, subtle beep but a decently loud and sleep deprecating beeping. Mahana staff, if you are reading this, PLEASE STOP THE INCESSANT BEEPING! The maid service is whatever as they only change the sheets every 3 days, and they do not clean the floors, so a few days in we had sand all over the entire floor to where you had to wipe your feet off to get into bed. The last complaint would be the in room safe...they charge for it?! I have never been to a hotel that charges to use the safe. It is also the most outdated safe that I have ever used at any vacation establishment. Most are digital or card swipe, nope this one had a good old turn key that if you lost you owed them a bazillion dollars for(WOW). If you are going to stay here just go for the view and the fact that it is equiped with a kitchen and perhaps the price. Other than that there are some much more centralized, and happening places on Maui that would serve you better than the Mahana. Either way enjoy Maui!

We have nothing but good things to say about our stay. The resort staff were friendly and helpful. The grounds were very well kept. Out condo unit (1209) was a two bedroom, beautifully decorated, and very up to date... stainless appliances, granite countertops, tile floor throughout, beautiful decorations and paintings, with three flat screen TVs, a DVD, and stereo sound system. Of course, the best thing about staying at the Manaha is the view. Ocean front, in fact I mentioned to my wife that while sitting on the balcony or looking out from the living room or bedroom, you would think you were on a cruise ship because all you see is water and the islands. The sunsets were outstanding right from the balcony. As you've probably read, the beach directly in front is not for swimming, but you can walk a very short distance in either direction for a great beach and we liked the lounge chairs in the grass area. We used those often too. Do not be concerned about the construction. They are working on the balconies, but only between 8 and 3, Monday through Friday. It did not bother us at all. Do not book your activities until you get there. Susan, with Expedia, will help you book whatever you want. You get the Expedia discount and if you have an AARP card, you get another 10% discount. I booked some things in advance and I wish I had waited. I could have gotten a better deal from her and she is fantastic.

The rental process was seamless and the owner was very accommodating. The price of the condo was a fraction of what you would pay for an equivalent unit at a big name hotel on Kaanapali. It was a 1 bedroom OCEANFRONT with a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and living room. I couldn't find a standard room with a view of the parking lot at the main resorts for the same price. The unit had two 42\" plasma tvs. We barely watched the tvs but it's a good gauge of the quality that was put into this condo. The furniture and decor was elegant and beautiful. The unit was as clean as could be. As I'm sure everyone knows, the view is ridiculous good. All the units are oceanfront and you can just stare out at the ocean for hours if you wanted. The side of the condo that faces the ocean is all glass windows and a balcony. The balcony was a good size and we spent many nights out there with drinks watching the sunset between Molokai and Lanai. We saved a staggering amount of money because of the condo. We went grocery shopping the first night at Star Market just down the road and picked up stuff to make breakfast and alcoholic beverages. Yes groceries are expensive, but not nearly as expensive as it would be to go out for every meal. Somehow they have found a way to charge $80 for breakfast for two in Maui at the hotels. We cooked breakfast at the condo every morning before we went out. We did carryout for most lunches when we were near the condo. Again, a huge savings over sitting at a restaurant with a beautiful view of the ocean. You are paying for the view and location but if you're staying at the Mahana you already have that view....plus you have privacy plus the booze is a fraction of the cost because you got it from the grocery store. There are a lot of places to pick up fresh fish or whatever you want right on the main drag that the Mahana is on. We loved The Fish Market Maui, went there twice on our 4.5 day trip. Get the ono burrito. The only downsides were very small issues for us. We had to drive and pay for parking when we wanted to go to Black Rock for snorkeling plus we just really liked the beach right in that area. But then again we didn't have to pay for parking at the Mahana or internet as we would have done at a hotel so we still felt like we were still ahead. The beach in front of the hotel is not good for swimming but you can go a little further down each way for better beaches. Once again we just drove to Black Rock because the main part of Kaanapali beach really is awesome. The pool is small but then again I really feel like the ocean water is too awesome to be sitting in a pool. I understand kids like pools so maybe it's worth paying a lot more money if you have kids to stay the Hyatt or Sheraton. I used to be a pool person but when the water is as clear and warm as in Maui and the beaches so soft and inviting you're wasting your time in the pool. Our flight out was not until 8:40 pm and the owner allowed us a 6 pm checkout. How many hotels will allow that? Not many unless you pay for another day. It essentially gave us an extra day in Maui since we were able to have a base of operations the whole last day and clean up before we headed to the airport. Hey if money is no object by all means go with a 1 bedroom oceanfront suite at one of the swanky resorts but for the rest of us the Mahana is a great way to enjoy Maui and save enough money to go back again next year.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin CA", "Title": "\u201cNot bad, good view bad location\u201d", "Author": "masgharnia", "ReviewID": "UR42973328", "Content": "The room was very clean and the view was hands down amazing!

I love to get in the water so this was a downside for me, but you could walk down the beach in either direction for one that was swimmable and those were fantastic! I could see the bottom even when I wasn't able to touch the ocean floor. Being there in April from our Lanai (that's what everyone calls your balcony) we were able to see turtles and whales out in the ocean (Season typically runs from Dec-April I believe February being the best month for whale watching). And nothing compares to watching the sunset. We slept with the windows open so we could hear the ocean all night, very peaceful. The windows are full length and provide a beautiful view. The kitchen is also full of utensils. From what I understand each room is slightly different, but where we stayed was excellent and I wouldn't expect anything less from the rest of the place.

I knew Maui was the best place to go but wow- staying at the Mahana made our trip the best it could have ever been. Before I begin to tell you every reason you should book this place I think by you knowing that we paid only about $160/night vs. the $250-300/night other people pay to stay in a \"patrial oceanview\" room in a crowded resort is enough to get you excited. We stayed in Unit #412 and we booked through the condo owner herself (mauibeachvacation.com). Sue was extremely helpful and made sure we had everything we needed to make our vacation memorable. The room...- how do I begin- IT WAS AMAZING! Everything from the decor to the wonderful fully stocked kitchen to the amazing bathroom to the comfy bed to the convenient washer/dryer and best of all THE VIEW WAS LITERALLY BREATH TAKING! Waking up and going to sleep to sound of the ocean literally outside your window was enough to say- WE are coming back. The room even had a boogy board, beach towels and snorker gear! You could really tell Sue puts lots of thought into the decor of the place and includes everything and anything you may need. We had never stayed in a condo in the past and we loved it! Being able to cook your own breakfast and eat on your own lanai right in front of the ocean was incredible. And not to mention the greatly appreciated privacy since this place is no where close to being overcrowded and there is no swimming allowed right in front of the building so that's another plus. Even though you are away from Kaanaplai beach- this beach and all other great beaches and activites/food is very close by. (maybe like 5-10minute drive and there is also a shipping center right across the street from the hotel). The pool isnt avery spectacular but you can always go pool hopping if you want - OR GOING SWIM IN THE BEAUTIFUL OCEAN- YOU'RE IN MAUI.

Maui is more expensive than Oahu (Honolulu). We rented the condominium based on the reviews posted on Expedia. I would recommend the place because for the price we paid we had reasonable comfort (kitchen included, with stainless steel appliances in our room) but with a five stars view and a beach basically to ourselves. POSITIVES: The view is breathtaking: the ocean is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneath \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the balcony. Basically, sitting in the bed you look at the ocean... and at the other neighbouring islands, Molokai and Lanai. The beach is almost just for you. Not too many people around, as in the resorts crowded with hotels (picture attached: the view from the balcony). The location: On Maui, you need a car to go around. The Condo is located into the west side of the island. Within walking distance of the Condo, there is a big store for food and other places to eat. I would highly recommend the Pizza Paradiso. One of the best pizza I ever ate and, definitely, the best Tiramisu ever. It is a casual, family friendly place (looks more like a fast-food) where you buy your stuff from the counter. The people are extremely warm and nice. We ended up eating there every night. I felt like I was going to see my friends. They won numerous awards for their Tiramisu and pizza. If anyone wants to buy food, there is also a Costco located near the airport; the cheese selection was absolutely great and half of the price we regularly pay in Canada at the same store. They sell good wine as well. Amenities: kitchen, washing & dryer machines in the room; pool, barbeques, sauna, towels, free parking and free Internet which worked better outside, on the beach chairs... which was great! Recommended places on Maui: Haleakala Volcano and then coming down, go inland towards the Kula area. Visit the farms and the small shops . We liked the Tedeski Winery and the Lavender farm. The Hana road. The Wailea in south, with the Four Seasons and other luxury resorts. There is a shopping mall (a luxury one) in the area where you can park the car. Then head towards the hotels/beaches. Great place for weddings. If you go north, DO NOT DIVE on the KAHEIKILI Hwy, between Poelua Bay and Waiehu. The road is plain dangerous (one lane cliff-hanger road, no space to turn, no space for incoming traffic, lots of blind curves!). We used a map from the rental agency . The Hana Road drive is nothing compared with that portion. Absolutely crazy, and did not understand why there is no sign to let people know of that dangerous road prior to entering it. NEGATIVES: After staying in Hilton Prince Kukio in Honolulu, the room in this condo looked sad and outdated: dark brown colours with artificial flowers. Once I did some changes, and moved the plastic flower on the balcony, the view and the ocean brought back the spirit of Aloha inside.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGood snorkelling just down the beach.

We ended up staying in two different rooms (1 bedroom units), 817 in the South tower and 404 in the North tower. The unit on the 8th floor was just above the tops of the palm trees and had incredible views. We had seen pictures of some of the rooms and were hoping to get a unit that was similar to what we had seen. Our unit had been updated at one point, but it seems they overspent on the bathroom and kind of ran out before really doing everything else right. The room wasn't bad, but just not quite what we were expecting. I think the rose colored carpet, linoleum flooring and laminate (granite looking) counter tops in the dated kitchen threw us off. There were no ceiling fans either, but luckily we found a portable fan in the closet. It was still a comfortable place to be, but after seeing picture of other rooms, we were hoping for more. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read other reviews about this room that described it as a great room to be in. I guess we just had different tastes than some. We did ask for another room, but the only available room that day had about the same decor as the one we were in and it was on a lower floor. We were ready to relax and enjoy ourselves, so we decided to not worry about trying to get another room. Just a warning, there is a new time share complex being finished near the South Tower. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the construction from our room, but I do think it upset some of the other guests. Unfortunately for us there was also needed repair work going on in the South tower at the Mahana. They had a movable platform rigged up, the kind they use to wash windows, and were working on the beach side of the building. By day 6 of our trip it had moved to our section of the building. I went downstairs and let them know we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hear or see the repair work going on for our last 2 days of the trip. Luckily there was another unit available right away. It took us about an hour to move our belongings and transfer the food from one refrigerator to another. It was an inconvenience, but worth it in the end. Our new room was in the North tower on the 4th floor. Overall it was a much nicer room, very nice bathroom and updated kitchen with all granite countertops, new cabinets and just overall better d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The only complaint I had was our new bed was really hard and was only a double (we had a King in our first room). The view was still spectacular, just below the palm trees so we could still see everything. Having a full kitchen was a huge plus for us. We bought the bulk of our food and drink at Costco and we're able to save money on breakfast, lunches and a few dinners (we used the saved money for activities). We also bought some small items at the Star mart nearby (expensive). I would recommend taking a collapsible cooler with you. It was perfect for packing a lunch and drinks for our day trips as well as just hanging out down at the beach. The pool area was nice, never over crowded. There are plenty of lounge chairs around the pool and on the lawn, so plenty of places to lay out and enjoy the day. We rented snorkel gear and went out right in front of the Mahana almost everyday. There are areas you can enter near the Mahana that are sandy so you don't step on and destroy the coral. It was crystal clear while we were there and was a really great place to snorkel! We had an 8:45pm flight home and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what we were going to do with a noon checkout. The front desk told us we could store our luggage with them until 4pm and continue to use the facilities all day. We packed our cooler with drinks, bought some take out and hung out at the pool until around 3:30pm, cleaned up, then headed out to make our dinner reservation before our flight home. They have showers available to use at the pool restrooms. The Mahana provided us with towels for the pool as well as for the showers. It ended up being a very relaxing last day. If you have a late flight, plan for it. If you are really picky about the room, the only way to guarantee what you are getting is to rent directly from the owner. We went through expedia and took our chances. Could have been better, but overall still a great place to stay.

We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. The staff was always pleasant with an Aloha! on their lips, everyone from the desk to the pool to the housekeeping staff. Every room is facing the ocean so you always have an ocean view! We were given a room on the 7th floor with a breathtaking view of the ocean and the two islands Lana'i and Moloka'i. As we stepped through the foyer to the room we were taken aback by the exquisite decor. The comfort of this room made our stay that much more pleasant to return to after our excursions on the island as tourists! The bed was heaven at night, with the sound of the waves to lull you to sleep. (The first night they kept me awake as I was unused to the sound, but slept soundly the following nights!). The beach is right there just a few steps from your room. A short 150-200 yard walk towards Black Rock brings you to one of the best snorkeling spots on the island. We walked the beach daily in the morning and snorkeled every morning! The variety of fish is amazing! We saw several we had seen in the Caribbean and many others that were new to us. We even saw a moray eel. We actually saw more fish from the beach than on the snorkeling trip we took the first day out to Molokini Crater. The pool was a nice respite from the salty ocean. My husband appreciated the BBQ grills next to the pool that were kept spotlessly clean. He would grill a steak for him and Mahi-Mahi for me which we would eat out on the lanai with a glass of wine, while listening to the waves and watching surfers with chutes, kayakers, and strollers on the beach. If you prefer to pay for your meals it's a very short walk next door to the Maui Kai or 3 doors down to the Ka'anapali Shores where you can charge your meal to your room. You can walk across the street to shop at the Star Market or drive 4 miles down the road to Lahaina and shop Safeway. The washer/dryer in the room made it so easy to only bring carry-ons on the plane since we didn't have to bring tons of clothing; and bonus of no lost luggage by the airline! All the amenities one would need were supplied by the owners of the condo and the daily housekeeping staff kept us supplied with fresh towels and linens, also doing a quick cleanup every day.

Both of us are in our early 50s and wanted a relaxing trip without all the hubbub and distractions found at the major resorts. To say that we're happy with our time at the Mahana would be the understatement of the century! In fact, we can't imagine coming back to Maui without staying at this wonderful place! So, here are our thoughts on the Mahana and what other travelers here should expect: - First of all, we booked our entire trip through Kay at Maui Vacation Consultatants. Kay is local, is known at the Mahana, and made sure we got a unit that was upgraded and in splendid condition. She was also a valuable point of reference for things to do and places to go on the island, and kept us from falling prey to the deluge of \"activities dealers\" who are really just hawking timeshare deals in disguise. Be forewarned: Maui is LOADED with these types, who if you give them the chance will absorb hours of your valuable vacation time for a few dollars discount off of a tour. My wife and I would like to strongly urge anyone planning a trip to Maui to try to use a LOCAL travel agent (such as Kay), who can help you find the most suitable accommodations for your needs and budget, and assist with activities planning based upon your personal likes/dislikes. Her website is: www.mauikay.com. - The Mahana is a peaceful condominium complex with all units directly facing the ocean. The water is so close, you actually have to lean close to the floor-to-ceiling windows or over the balcony railing to see that there's a beach down below! The sound of the waves crashing at night is one of the best sleep-inducing tonics we've ever experienced. The building and grounds are spotlessly maintained. Having our own fully-equipped kitchen saved us a TON of money on this trip -- we ate out a few times (see recommendations below), but often just enjoyed making our own Mai Tai's and watching the sunset from the privacy of our own balcony. - A few things about what the Mahana is NOT. In our opinion, this is NOT the ideal place for families with little kids, or couples expecting lavish room service. There is no Disney-esque kiddie pool, no restaurant, or strawberries and chocolate in your room at night. If you want any of that stuff, you'll need to stay at one of the several resort complexes down the beach a ways. What you do get here is an exquisitely comfortable condo with most of the creature comforts of home, in a very romantic setting that's perfect for couples who prefer more peace and quiet than the carnival-like atmosphere at most of the major resorts. - The most memorable highlights of our stay at the Mahana include watching the whales while eating breakfast on our balcony, watching the windsurfers and boating activity in the afternoons, and the gorgeous sunsets. - Activities: we drove up to Haleakala but elected not to go for the sunrise view. In our opinion, the trip was just as enjoyable and there was a lot less traffic to deal with. We drove the road to to Hana, to the \"Halfway to Hana\" stand (which has excellent banana bread, by the way), and then drove back. We took driving trips around the North loop, and to the southern remote area to where the road became unpaved and impassable. We do plan to take a helicopter tour (Kay recommended the Sunshine Helicopters Hana/Haleakala package), but that will be later this week. We also drove to the \"Enchanting Floral Gardens\" -- it was pretty, but seemed in decline so we can't really recommend it to others. The Tedeschi winery is worth visiting. We also went on a sunset sail -- on the Gemini -- highly recommended!! Don't bother with the sunset \"dinner\" sails -- most of the food is just so-so. The Gemini \"champagne\" sail offered an open bar and plentiful appetizers for a lot less than a full dinner sail. - Shopping: early in our stay, we went to Costco and loaded up on the basics. The Costco is located in Kahului, near the airport. Well worth the trip. In between we'd suggest the grocery store at the Napili Market rather than the Safeway at Lahaina. The Napili Market also has a DVDExpress rental machine (similar to Redbox), which made renting movies cheap and easy. $1 a day. Lahaina is an interesting place to stroll around in, park at the far end near the old Prison for free for 3 hours. Most of the shops along Front street in Lahaina sell variations on the same beachy stuff. Avoid Lahaina if you see a cruise ship floating nearby -- the town will be overrun with tourists. - Eating out: In our opinon, there are two \"must do\" eating experiences on Maui. Both are pricey, but you can make up for it in other ways. One, Mama's Fish House near Paia. Two, Nick's Fish Market at the Kea Lani resort at Wailea. Either place will set you back about $150 for a couple, but the experience is divine. The service at Nick's is an experience in itself. For Luaus, do the Old Lahaina Luau -- it's legendary and the best on the island, the food is quite good as well but we wouldn't put the food in the category of \"five star\". For breakfasts out, a short walk up the beach from the Mahana will take you to the Castaway Cafe, which offers excellent omelets and specialty pancakes. The Gazebo at Napili shores is a short drive away, and worth going to once, but expect a long line to get in. We waited about a half hour. They had outstanding omelets and pancakes. A hidden gem is the Okazuya takeout, just down the street -- great for lunch and dinner. There's no tables there, you just order and bring it back to your condo. All this being said, we didn't lavishly eat out for most of our two-week visit here -- we enjoyed the privacy of our condo at the Mahana. Buying our wine and cheese at Costco made for a much better evening than constantly shelling out the $10 - $15 per glass that many of the restaurants and resorts demand.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mill Creek, WA", "Title": "\u201cUnit 1204 - Million dollar view!\u201d", "Author": "AlohaGirl8", "ReviewID": "UR29410926", "Content": "We stayed on the top floor in Unit 1204.

Chocolate and coke in the fridge, detergent for the dishwasher and washer/dryer, sunscreen etc etc. I'd say you do need a car if you want to get out and see more stuff (we actually booked a cheapo economy through Alamo from Australia before we left, and they upgraded us to a jeep when we got here :D).

We had friends that stayed in Unit 618 (they book through Vacation Rental By Owner- and I wish I would have looked into VRBO before I booked) Anyway- their room was nice, our room was nicer... I can't imagine this place having a bad room because Maui's laid back attitude and peacefulness is infectuous!! More about our unit: bed was comfortable; kitchen was nice and fully stocked; bathroom was nice with good-size shower- clean and modern; washer and dryer was great to have (you may want to slip a couple of travel-size detergent into your check-in luggage and don't overpack like I did); sitting area was nice-although I sat on the couch once just to look at a phone book; dining area right in front of the floor to ceiling windows that gave an amazing view of Lanai'i and Moloka'i and WHALES!!! The views were SPECTACULAR!!!!! We arrived in Maui at night and worn out. Restaurants around this area close kind of early. Stay away from the Mexican shack across the street... may have been just bad timing- but it was awful. We went to bed early and woke up early. We went out on the lanai to see our first view of the Pacific and saw whales blowing and jumping in the ocean!! I was so excited and it never got old- the whole time we were there we saw them playing in the ocean and they seem so close!!! Everything is more expensive in Maui- but since I knew that before we went, it didn't seem so bad. The grocery store across the street is more expensive than if you go to the Safeway in Lahaina (get the Safeway card/ coupon card thing at the Customer Service desk- it's free and saves you some money). I'm glad I read the reviews on this site because I almost booked another hotel. After reading the reviews, I realized that this hotle/ condo-type is more my style!! I liked the separate bedroom from everything so you don;t have to stare at your luggage, you can cook, keep munchies and lunchmeat, etc. I don't like the fancy, pampered stuff so why pay more for it? Other suggestions: The book 'Maui Revealed' was a huge help for the Road to Hana, restaurants, maps, shopping, etc. We also got one for another island we went to on this trip. I highly recommend to rent a car ( a Jeep for the more adventurous). Going to Hana was amazing- I couldn't believe my eyes and the drive wasn't that bad, although pretty windey. Getting married on Maui was awesome and easy if you contact one of the tons of wedding coordinators. I can't wait to go back!!

For many years we enjoyed a unit at the Maui Kai (next door to Mahana), but ownership changed hands and the new folks imposed a price increase that moved it out of our reach. Fortunately, after much searching, we discovered studio #803 (an individually owned/VRBO listing 108165); currently priced at just over $200 during peak season. The arrangements were made through a delightful Lady named Sophie and everything went extremely smoothly from reservation to checkout. Unlike many neighboring condos, Mahana is steel'concrete constructed; no \"ceiling thunder\" intrusions and the elevators were never much of a wait. As is commonplace at Mahana, #803 includes a much appreciated washing machine and dryer, as well as central air conditioning (seldom needed in February) and all the furnishings were up-to-date; including a very comfortable King bed right next to the lanai. For a single person, or couple, preferring reasonably valued ocean front condos over hotels, Mahana is difficult to beat. About the only generalized caveat being that the nicely landscaped grounds include beautiful palm trees that, in some instances, partially interfere with the view between floors 4 through 7; # 803 has no such drawback. We're already in the process of 2010 dreaming and Mahana #803 is certainly in our thoughts as well as having recommended it to a number friends. We've experienced problems with .com links in past Trip Advisor reviews, but vrbo dot com/108165 (with the necessary . substitution) should take you to the listing.

My favorite part of the trip was having coffee in the morning as we watched the whales from the lania or the floor to ceiling windows. Bring binoculars for the best viewing, although some of the whales came very close to shore. We saw some dolphins one day as well. Made many of our meals and ate on the lanai which was so relaxing. Susan, the Expedia trip person was very helpful. We went to the Feast at Lele, which is a luau but you are seated the whole time and don't have to go thru a buffet line. It was wonderful! Ask for a Lava Flow drink. Did the helicopter ride to Hana and then rode in a van to come back. We thought it was fun and I didn't have to be afraid for my life on the twists and turns on the Road to Hana. That was an expensive tour, but worth it. One thing that is a MUST is the Warren and Annabelle show in Lahaina--so funny and entertaining. Order tickets before you leave home since they sell out many days in advance. I must warn you not to do the time share presentation!! It is promised that it will only be an hour and a half, but this is not true. And you are pressured to buy. It is not worth the $100 discount on your tours. Food and restaurants are expensive on Maui. Bring along things that you can fit in your luggage like snack bars, peanut butter, nuts, etc. We liked Java Jazz and Ruth's Chris Steak House, but thought that Kimo's was not worth the price we paid. Cheeseburger in Paradise is fun and worth it. I suppose everyone has different opinions on restaurants, but I enjoyed eating at the condo most of all. We rented snorkeling gear at Boss Frog's right down the road from the Mahana. Rented it for the week and then were able to use it only once since it was windy and the water was murky. The fish market in the little strip mall about a block away from the Mahana has the best mahi mahi sandwiches ever!

I had requested an upgraded room and Tommy at Blue Hawaii had even called a few days before our visit to ensure we got an upgraded room. It did not happen. The first night we arrived around 1 a.m. after flying for about 24 hours, we just took the room they gave us #215. The next day they did offer us another room, it was even older than the one we had, and the view was not as nice due to the palm trees. A couple of days later we had ants in our kitchen, I called the front desk and asked for help. When we returned that night I could tell nothing had been done. When I called the front desk again they said they would check on it and call me back. Never got a call back. The next day I was told that because it was Saturday the company they use would not come out and there was nothing they could do. I was very upset! At that time I asked to be moved to a different room. Both rooms I was shown were in worse condition than the one I was already in. My choices were to stay in the room with ants and buy my own bug spray or change to a down graded room! My advice to anyone staying at the Mahana, do not go thinking you will get one of the FEW upgraded rooms. Everytime I walked by the front desk I could hear people asking for a newer remodeled room. The view from our room was amazing and the cleanliness was average. The pool was very windy all of the time but heated and that made it nice. The spa was broken the entire time we were there. The beach in front of the hotel is not good for swimming but was good for snorkeling. Walk down the beach about 5 minutes to one of the other hotels for swimming and you can also rent a chair and toys there. One of the most amazing things we did was the Pacific Whale Foundation cruise. It was one of the highlights of our trip. The crew was fantastic and the boat was very comfortable. We had an unbelievable encounter with some whales and I think the crew was as excited as we were. I felt like these people love there jobs and were happy to help us with anything we needed. We loved the Road to Hana, beaches were the best there. The drive is difficult, but worth it. I would not take the tour, that way you can spend as much time as you like. The other beach we really liked was Big Beach. The only problem is no showers, no restrooms, no chairs, no food. There are two parking lots, the first gets very busy, drive down a little ways and you will see the next one. Be sure to take what you need, but it is a must see.

We were amazed *how* close the beach/ocean was to our room. By the end of the trip, we midwesterners were a little freaked out by the loudness of the ocean. The room was kept immaculately, and in relatively attractive decor. It was for the most part quiet, with the exception of some occasional noise from the upstairs condo (sounded like people kept dragging chairs across the floor). We were well equipped with a full kitchen, including all of our dishes and utensils. We even decided to make ourselves a steak dinner one night. We also had a washer and dryer (to allow us to do our laundry there on our last day, rather than when we got home) and dishwasher to easily keep our dishes and utensils clean. The beach is excellent for walking, and very scenic as you are able to view the islands of Lanai and Molokai in the distance. For swimming, it's recommended you hike down the beach 150 - 200 yds. to avoid any sharp coral, as there is a reef directly in front of the hotel. This makes for amazing snorkeling though, and the water is crystal clear. There is considerable wildlife near the resort (we saw and heard *many* types of birds, geckos and snails), and since we were there in January, saw an infinite number of humpback whales from our room. Some even ventured 300 - 400 yds. from the beach. The pool area is cozy with a heated, well kept pool and a relaxing hot tub; both which provide a stunning view of the beach. There is no bar in the hotel, for those who enjoy sipping a frosty libation near the pool or beach. There are no dining facilities on site, which may be bothersome for some less-adventurous travelers who weren't planning on leaving the resort. But if you planned on coming to this captivating Eden without exploring all of the island's beauty, you're probably not cut out for travel in the first place. We strongly recommend checking out Chowhound.com for recommendations on the best places to eat (and please check out The Gazebo restaurant). Finally, if you're like us, and concerned about the price of eating on the island for a few days or more, there is a Star Market just outside of the resort.

The carpet was disgusting (very dirty and stained) and the kitchen was probably the original and space was extremely tight. The bathroom was newly remodeled, but very small. Beyond that the view was wonderful and I enjoyed sitting on the lanai and enjoying the view. The waves at night lulled us to sleep and were occasionally loud enough to wake us up. We never quite adjusted to the 5 hour time difference. Lots of wonderful things to do and see in Maui. Loved Haleakala (drive up is a little scary) and glad we did the road to Hana, but would never do again unless we plan on staying in Hana. Great restaurants, good food, love Lahaina and the atmosphere. Enjoyed the Old Lahaina Luau, and highly recommend Ulalena. Stayed on Maui back in 2001 in Wailea and loved it. Stopped back to visit and I would definitely recommend over Kaanapali. Beautiful beaches, nice walking paths along the beach, great shopping and restaurants. As per the recommendations on Tripadvisor, I highly advise anyone to go for breakfast at the Gazebo, a short drive from Kaanapali. There's usually a line, but it's well worth it! I would stay at the Mahana again if I could experience an updated room.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Mahana\u201d", "Author": "aktumbleweed", "ReviewID": "UR23062018", "Content": "After carefully researching and planning our 25th wedding anniversary trip, we decided to book the Mahana through Resort Quest for December 1st - 6th, 2008.

We booked through the resorts web site, although we really did want to book a specific room through the owner. The problem we encountered with doing that is that most owners require 50% minimum down to hold the reservation and if for whatever reason you need to cancel/change your reservation you loose the money. By booking with the resort directly we had up to 48 hours to cancel our reservation with absolutely no penalty. The room we received was a studio (#313) that was recently renovated. Bathroom, kitchen and most of the suite was excellent. I did leave the owners a note to seriously consider updating their bed linens (old, tattered comforter) and to remove the rug in the living room. The rest of the suite was beautiful ceramic floors, easy to keep clean and fresh smelling. I would suggest that this is probably one of the most beautiful views in all of Maui, and it is right from your room/lanai! The Mahana is the closest building to the ocean anywhere that we saw so the beach is rather narrow and the noise of the waves is unbelieveable! One of the reasons we chose this location was for snorkelling, but forget it. You really need to go either to Black Rock in front of the Sheraton which has a great beach and all the amenities, or our favourite the beach in front of the Ritz Carlton. The one at RC had way more variety of fish, calmer water and a good deal of shade if you wanted it. However, no beach chairs/umbrealls for rent so come prepared. So, if you;re looking for good value, good service, consider the Mahana. We paid about $1500 for the week, but when we were checking out I heard someone at the front desk quote a walk-in $1100 for the week, so its worth asking for a deal! The pool is fine, in the shade most of the afternoon, BBQs spotless and plenty of free parking....have fun in Maui.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wenatchee", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!!\u201d", "Author": "cindylou421", "ReviewID": "UR22925243", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Mahana 12/2/08 - 12/13/08 in room 516.

The overall experience was just good for me. The hotel is in a very good location, next to the kaanapali beach, the most popular and one of the best beaches in Maui, after visiting a few other beaches in the island. There is also a good grocery store in walking distance (5 minutes) called star markets (prices a bit more expensive than Safeway, the most popular grocery store in the island, but groceries in Maui are expensive anywhere). The best feature of this hotel is the view, all condos face the ocean and they are very close to the water compared to other hotels nearby, so you can intensely listen and feel the ocean from your room. The beach is terrible for swimming, as many other beaches in Hawaii, because of the shallow reef areas. I also found the sand in the beach a little bit less clear compared to some other beaches I visited. The hotel has a nice area by the pool with clean gas grills and a great hot tube (spa) for guests. The pool was just OK, since it's small and shaded most of the day due to the proximity to the hotel buildings. The staff was friendly until they demand us to move to a bigger condo because the studio we booked and spent the first night was for 2 guests only, including our infant. It was not our fault, I booked through cheap tickets, and there was no note saying we should get a bigger condo when booking, so we assumed everything was OK, but when they realized our party had 3 people, they suddenly changed from nice to unfriendly. Once we decided to stay and move to the bigger condo and pay the difference, they got back to the \"nice mode\" again, so not very professional in my opinion. I believe most condos, if not all, are privately owned, therefore, they are all different as far as updates and decoration. Our big condo was a one bedroom apt with living room, kitchen, and 2 baths, room 515. That unit was highly recommended by the guest leaving it that day, but it was just OK in our opinion because it had only basic furniture/appliances and decoration was just good, no major updates or features. Parking in this hotel was good because was free and mostly shaded (we like shaded parking). In your first day, there is a 45-minute presentation from the concierge service lady with complimentary breakfast. The food is very unimpressive (just a few sweet treats with coffee) but the lady does present good suggestions and tips for activities nearby. I believe this hotel is also cheaper than the resorts in the kaanapali beach (a 10 minute drive from this hotel), but the beach there is much better. So, overall, if you want to stay near where this hotel is, I would recommend checking the rates of other hotels nearby for a possible best value.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cNice experience\u201d", "Author": "ftp1234", "ReviewID": "UR22425110", "Content": "4 nights stay.

The views were amazing and the condo was very comfortable as living quarters and office space. We did not miss having a restaurant on site, as there is a Safe Way grocery store right across the street and we cooked breakfast most days. (We did stop at the WalMart near the airport on our way in, but it wasn't necessary with the Safeway across the street). There is also a small sandwich and drink cart by the pool, for snacks, smoothies, coffee, and sandwiches which we used one day. It was tasty and not too expensive. The staff was accommodating but not overly friendly. The pool and hot tub were very nice and the grounds pretty, also. There is construction going on at a new resort in front of the Mahana, but we could never hear any noise from it and all our windows faced the back (ocean) so there were no problems there.

The lady at the front desk told us the room was supposed to be ready that morning and it wasn't. What a lie. I think you would know a couple days before if construction wouldn't be done in time. That's when I became upset. If they just told me they messed up, then okay. The lying part is where I just had no respect for the place after that. They did tell us their sister property Kaanapali Shores would let us stay there. I had looked on trip advisor to research that condo before booking with the Mahana. It wasn't what I wanted.

After many hours of research, we decided to stay at the Mahana. We booked our room in Feb 08, using the Entertainment Card which books through ResortQuest. We told staff it was our anniversary and wanted to have a special vacation at the Mahana and requested an updated room on a higher floor. Based on other reviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences on TripAdvisor, we knew would be well taken care of. Our stay was from Sep 27 to Oct 9. Our flight arrived late so by the time we got to the hotel it was about 10:30pm. Check-in was fast and we were assigned to unit #817. I could have cried. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Taj Mahal, but this unit was awful. There were bugs on the walls, bugs on the carpets and on the tile. The carpet was stained, very well worn and frayed in some places. The furniture was old and mismatched - to top it off, the unit smelled musty and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It was disgusting. My husband called down to the front desk to ask if we could change to a different unit and the front desk person, Lana, said no, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to do that. We were about ready to leave to go to another hotel. My hubby took a couple digital pictures of the bugs and took the camera down to the front desk to show Lana and told her we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even want to put our luggage on the floor, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how filthy it was. A short time later, Lana called and was very apologetic. She said she called her manager for help and then gave us another room on the 5th floor and gave my husband a couple of coffee mugs and box of mac chocolates. This new room was very clean, but not updated and not what we expected when we had booked our reservations way back in February. We would have settled for this room, if what we requested wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available, but the next morning before 7am, Lana gave us unit #218. This room was gorgeous with granite and tile throughout, stainless steel appliances, and very nice furniture. This was what we expected when we first checked in, despite the unit not being on a higher floor. The view was exceptional. There were no beach towels, but we picked up a couple from Costco, so that was ok. Prior to arriving, I had enquired about noise from the construction site and was told that we could be put in the building located furthest away from the construction noise, which we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Noise from the construction site was not noticeable except for the occasional beep beep from trucks backing up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which you could hear with the balcony door closed, but it was no big deal. Noise from renovations to units inside the Mahana, however, was a different story. I think they were grinding tile or something like that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever it was it definitely got our attention. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother complaining at this point, because quite frankly we had had enough with complaining\u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was supposed to be a holiday, so we just put up with it. Besides, this unit was really nice and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to move into another nightmare, like #817. The pool area at the Mahana was good, and we both liked the windiness of the area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c kept the heat of the sun to a comfortable level. New barbeques were also appreciated. As noted before by several reviewers swimming 100 yds to the left and right of the building was excellent, although there was a noticeable sewage smell to the left close to construction site, so we went swimming to the right. Black Rock and Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village was a nice easy walk along the beach on several occasions for us. We booked an extra day because our flight was leaving at 10:50pm and when we were checking out, noticed that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge for the extra day, which we thought was nice of the Mahana and made us feel a little bit better about the crappy unit we were first given. A couple days after arriving home, however, we received an adjusted bill with the extra day tacked on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. Now that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some time to reflect on our stay, we both think that we would probably stay at the Mahana again, but would go through VRBO to rent directly from an owner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c viewing photos of the unit ahead of time so we would know exactly what we were getting. Lana of RQ staff was extremely helpful, and other staff were pleasant and efficient to deal with. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who assigns the units, but I think they definitely dropped the ball in this case.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, ca", "Title": "\u201cUnforgetable view....not so good service\u201d", "Author": "pattynlandon", "ReviewID": "UR21306851", "Content": "Well, let me just start off by saying the view from our condo was AMAZING !!

We were told there was nothing they could do. Unfortunately we spent the first few hours of our vacation arguing with the staff. Finally after a couple of hours our travel agent called and talked to the manager. She was able to get us a $300 refund and after staying at the Shores for 2 nights we could stay the remainder of our vacation there. At first we didn't know if it would be worth moving back. But I'm sure glad we did. We stayed in 817. Very nice condo. We left all the doors to the patio open at night and just listened to the waves crashing.

The hotel room was pretty nice although not as amazing as some of the photos I have seen. It had Hawaiian decor with wicker furniture , updated bathrooms and amazing views. We were able to sit outside and enjoy meals and we barbecued more than once outside. We did have a few problems but I think it is just random. 1. Our second bedroom had a view of the parking lot and the construction next door. Unfortunately this meant that when Mahana had to repair the plumbing in the middle of our stay, they worked all evening in the parking lot with bright lights on the site. That and the sound kept me up all that evening. 2. During the repair they shut off the water from 10 pm to 5am . This meant no air conditioning and no toilet etc. I think this only really bothered us because we were getting up at 3 to see the sunrise on the volcano. Luckily we know how to rough it and just used bottled water to wash up. 3. Our air conditioner blew water in the room all night the first night. We had to call to get it repaired and it took all day. Then we had to have a gigantic fan on in the room for two days. 4. The second bedroom had twin beds ( we were not expecting this) which we just pushed together to make a full bed. The cleaning staff actually changed the sheets to accommodate us, which was unexpected and greatly appreciated. Like I stated above, I think these were just random problems and the staff was quick about getting us the help when we needed it. Two things I should mention - there is no safe beach at the hotel and you need to walk a little way to get to a safer area, and while the pool area is very pretty and new it is almost unusable because of the WIND. The wind is almost unbearable at all times of the day . Shoes become flying projectiles after 4 pm ! BUT we were in Maui for the beaches so we spent most of our time in the ocean.

It is always hotels and resorts for me. But, this I admit, was alright. My wife and I stayed at the Outrigger Keauhou Beach Resort on Big Island, and yes, we did the laundry service once, and it was pricey. The next time, we did the coin laundry room option, like we did in on another stay. Yeah, sitting, and check in on the laundry is not that fun, even for 1 1/2 hour. The condo in Maui had the standard stacked laundry unit in the suite, which was great. The kitchen, was nice and had all the tools we needed to stay in and have a nice cooked meal when we felt guilty eating out all the time. And, it was a nice meal in the condo. The super-market is 2 min driving up the street, and has all the ingredients for even a high-end meal if you want to cook one. We (meaning I) made a nice dinner in the condo, and the view was great, and it was private. The condo was really nice. Since it is a condo, there are some rules that are different than a resort/hotel room, but it isn't too much trouble. The main rule, is respect, as this is a owned living space. The condo is kept nicely, since people do live there. The one pool is small heated, and they have plenty of Weber Genesis BBQ's for use. The beach is there, the sand is nice, but the grading of the beach is very steep and with the coral nearby and the strong waves, I don't recommend it as a swim/snorkel spot, although I saw someone try it. Definitely, the beach behind the resort and beside the resorts next door, I would not recommend for kids, for safety reasons. If you are going to hang on the beach, I would recommend walking up closer to the next resort, where the beach is wider. There are some great resorts in the area, but if you are going to be on the island for more than a week, I would consider the condo. The beach club hotel next door, I was really envious, from the look of it; it has everything. But, as we spent most of the time sight-seeing, and not hanging around the resort, it wasn't an issue. The first night in, to find the Mahana, is a little tricky; you need to look out for the one little sign on the main street. No hotel/resort food, only a snack bar and vouchers to the resort next door, which can put your meal on your room if you eat there. This resort charges for all phone calls, even 1-8xx, which we didn't care for. Also, a warning regarding the Expedia reps. We use them extensively, but if you can find exactly what you want to do, and who you want to do it with, you can save some $$$ by booking directly. You might as well take the discount rather than having the rep take it. The reps do want to sell you the big trips, so beware. They do offer good advice and insight, and we use them to book, but, you should do your own research. Also, we don't care for the time-share selling job. It does save some $$$, but we didn't want to waste our vacation time and have someone do a sell job on us.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cCould not have been happier!\u201d", "Author": "JConner17", "ReviewID": "UR19340106", "Content": "My boyfriend and I (mid 20's) stayed at the Mahana 08/16/08 - 08/23/08 in Unit #1017 (10th floor - 1bd/1ba), which we booked directly through the owner (www.stayonmaui.com).

I was hesitant to book directly through an owner (this was my first time!)... but I wanted to ensure we were going to have a room with an unobstructed view.

We were amazed that we were almost alone, and felt sorry for everyone packed along the fronts of the big resorts!

We booked unit #804 direct from the owner www.mahanarental.com. He was super easy to work with and the condo is absolutely gorgeous. Recently remodeled in 2005 with bamboo floors, granite countertops in the kitchen, stainless steel appliances and a beautiful walk-in shower. The kitchen was fully stocked and the grills by the pool were immaculate. We grilled twice and were able to eat leftovers too- something we really missed when we got to the Moana on Waikiki. We went grocery shoppnig at the Star Market right behind the condo the first night, and there is a Safeway grocery store ~10 minutes away. It is windy, but it didn't bother us as it made the heat bearable. The smoothie cart by tthe pool was nice. While on Maui, we drove to Ka'anapali Beachwalk daily to run in the mornings and were able to find free parking near the Westin (there was a small lot that fit about 11 cars, and we were there around 7am when it opened and always got a spot). Then we'd eat breakfast back at the condo and set out for the day. We spent one day at Ka\"anapali Beach near the Shearton and snorkeled around Black Rock, then went back that night to the Hula Grill for dinner- had good seats to watch the sunset. Drove to Haleakala to watch the sunrise and left the condo at 3:00 am- glad we didn't leave any later as by the time we got to the summit (~5:15) the top lot was nearly full. Went back to the condo and spent the day by the pool, then went to the Old Lahaina Luau at night. We parked right at the Luau and had traditional mat seating- I booked this several months in advance and we were literally the first two seats by the stage. A great night. Sunday we drove ~25minutes north of the condo to the Nakalele Blowhole and Honolua Bay to snorkel, then went to Napili Beach for the day. We grilled out that night. Monday we drove the Road to Hana and left the condo at ~5:30 so we were on the Hana Hwy by 7am. We didn't have any traffic pressuring us from behind this way. Stopped at the Black Sand Beach and several waterafalls on the way, got to 7 Sacred Pools and were able to get in briefly before we had to get out as it was raining further up the mountain and the rangers were warning of possible floods. Didn't have to tell us twice! Then we hiked the Pipiwai Trail ~1hr 15min to the 400 ft waterfall at the end, and also saw the Infinity pool feeding another waterfall about half way in to the hike. Beautiful bamboo forest. Take your ticket from Haleakala Sunrise as this is part of the same park and you won't have to pay again, but only good for 2 days I think. That night we ate from Okazuya (sp?) take out right down the road from the Condo and had great Ono and Maui Onion Burger. Tuesday we went to Molokini with Four Winds II- great experience on the boat, but snorkeling a little disappointing after Honolua Bay. Very little variety in fish species and not many to see period. Stopped at \"Turtle Town\" on way back ot the harbor and saw several turtles near the boat. Went to Big Beach (Huge-but kind of bigger shore break- knocked me over a few times!) from there past Wailea for the rest of the day, and grilled out that night at the condo. Wednesday we stayed a tthe Mahana byt the pool, then left for Lahaini around 2:30, walked around and shopped, saw the Banyan tree, and went to Warren and Annabelle's Magic show. Very funny (clean) and great magic. Worth it for an evening out. Ate at Cheeseburger in Paradise after for a late dinner ~9pm and didn't have to wait at all. Thursday was our last full day in Maui and we went to Wailea Beach, walked around the shops at Wailea, and then went back to Big Beach. Ate our leftovers that night and packed to go to Waikiki that night. Overall, we loved the Mahana and would love to go back again when we make it back to Maui someday.

We booked through AAA and made sure to request a room higher up (to get an unobstructed ocean view) and one that was recently remodeled. Our unit was on the 10th floor but most floors are fine except for maybe the 4-6th floors where the palm fronds block the view. If you're interested in ocean views than the Mahana is the place for you as both buildings directly face the ocean and all units have ocean views. The livingroom and lanai have the views. We were lucky our unit was remodeled - we saw another unit that had an open house and it was not as nice. Very basic white and a little used looking (but had that great view). So make sure to request a remodeled unit. The staff at Mahana was nice and requests for additional shampoo, dishwasher detergent were easy. There were a few days that the timing of the cleaning of our unit was not the most convenient but if you're out all day, that shouldn't be a problem. We stayed in a one bedroom unit with 2 young kids (under age 12) so the arrangement of the sofabed worked well. Our kids were fine with the small pool and hot tub here. Older kids might want more action which is close by at the Resortquest Kaanapali Shore, just 2 resorts north. You could probably walk on the beach to this other resort and use their very large pools with waterfalls. Also you can go there to get a drink and listen to music as the Mahana does not have any of these amenities. We used the very clean bbq grills several times and it made for a quick dinner with little clean up. The grill area is nice with a sink and counter area behind. One warning about the Mahana is the tradewinds which were more breezy than I liked. Our kids still loved getting in the pool and didn't care but I didn't really like lounging by the poolside with all the wind. It seems less windy farther south by the main area of Kaanapali. The Mahana is a quiet resort and that's what we wanted. If you want more and don't mind walking or a short drive, there's always the Resortquest Kaanapali or southward, the whole Kaanapali Shores complex to get your fix. But if you want that action where you stay, than the Mahana might not be for you. Also onsite at the Mahana is an Expedia agency where we booked a boat trip to Lanai (through Pacific Whale Foundation) and a luau at the Royal Lahaina. The luau was better than expected but the boat trip was really rocky. The boat staff was really great though and very helpful as my son got really seasick. I would recommend both activities. Good places to eat in Lahaina - Lahaina Mai-Tai Lounge, right on the water Lahaina Grille and Oyster Bay Different place to check out - Makawao Town, cool little town with shops Also stock up at Costco before going to your condo. It's on the way from the airport. Although Safeway is pretty close (about a 10 minute drive) so that's convenient enough.

As I write this review, I'm noticing that the three most frequent admissions to this review site where staying at the Mahana the same time we were. And I agree with everyone that the Mahana IS the place to stay. Quit looking around and wasting anymore of your time - trust me, you have found \"the place\". Just know which unit you are reserving because they are not all the same. As best I can piece together, each unit is individually owned and not all the units are \"rental managed\" by the ResortQuest people. We reserved throught the ResortQuest website directly secondary to several reviews stating difficulty dealing with the front desk in regards to \"non-pool\" units. But to that I can only say this: (and it is the moral to my story). We booked months in advance (as you'd better do for your luau at the Old Lahaina or the Feast at Lele). We requested a renovated unit on a high floor away from the elevators. Upon arrival, we were given #703 which, while nice and clean enough, was not one of the spectacularly renovated units seen on TripAdvisor. And it is right next to the elevator. When we discussed this with the desk clerk Alana (my savior and a true angel!), she arranged for a transfer to #1016 the next day. And what a new day it was in this incredible, unbelievably beautiful unit that is actually a one bedroom converted to a studio with a drop-down Murphy bed (which was truly a comfortable bed, surprisingly). Now, I've stayed in some of the nicest hotels all around the world and I will tell you that this unit #1016 was possibly the most impressive of all. Tile floors and shower (with bench), new everything, a most impressive kitchen with the newest of everything, etc, etc, I can't impress it up enough - it really was the very finest of accomodations available on the island. Everthing nice you have read in the latest reviews are true. I personally wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else. The location is great, the people are super, the clientele is adult with well behaved children (read: upper class; well-educated; disciplined and mannered children - No thugs). The moral is: go through the reviews and choose which rooms are the sweet ones and which are not. #1016 is sweet! #703 is clean but not a recent/big-time redo. You still are getting your $250.00 worth in #703, but you get a $700.00 a night pad in #1016 (and similar) for the same $250.00. I mean, it's really that good. The Mahana is my highest recommendation. O.K., now that we have that taken care of let me recommend some of what was fantastic on our trip. Breakfast was awesome at The Gazebo restaurant at the shore line of some hotel up the road (ask the front desk at the Mahana). They open at 7:30 A.M. and the line started at about 7:00. We did a Blue Hawaiian helicopter ride and can recommend a 45 minute ride. We booked this and they upgraded us to the hour long ride. At about the 45 minute mark we both got the queezy's. The next day we did the Haleakala sunrise which, unfortuantely, was too cloudy to see - BUT, after most people left because they didn't see the sunrise we stayed and watched the sun start breaking through and burning off the clouds which afforded us some of the most heavenly pictures you can imagine, so hang out and chill. On the way down we ate at the Kula Lodge where they had the best fruit plate I've ever eaten. Their garden is spectacular! I think we took 70+ pictures of flowers there alone! Mama's Fish House is the best. It's very close to the most famous \"kite-surfing/wind-surfing\" venue in the world. Those dudes are awesome. Watch for free. Mama's is really fantastic but expensive (naturally). Everything is super tasty, so a reservation is a must for dinner. (Eating at the bar would allow instant seating as it is not sat by the hostess - It's personally my favorate place to eat because of the instant service available at all time by the bartenders). If you only do one restaurant, this is it. The next day we did a Trilogy snorkle trip to Molokini crater/turtle town. I recommend Trilogy highly, but not the Molokini trip. It was too crowded with boats and snorklers. The Trilogy people are the best, though. Read my review of them separately. Snorkle Honolua bay, then Kapalua bay, then Kaanapali by the Sheraton/black rock. Do not park in the Sheraton's garage -- three hours was $20!. Use the Whaler's Village parking. Yes there is currently construction going on right next to the Mahana property. Yes we could here the \"beep-beep-beep\" backup alarms on some of the trucks, but it wasnt' too bad. Obviously not enough for me to tell you anything other than, \"stay at the Mahana - you'll be glad you did\". I tell you of the construction so that you are best informed.

I have to say that I typically don't write reviews, but I use them to make my decision. I was so impressed with this hotel I had to share my thoughts. I booked 2 rooms through Travelocity so I wasn't sure which room I was going to be getting, but I had contact the staff prior to arriving and requested 2 rooms on an upper floor near one another. We were assigned room 902 and 903. Room 902 was modern with a king size bed and the view was spectacular. Room 903 was fine but it had a smaller bed and wasn't updated so the staff offered us room 605 which was excellent (although considered a studio because only 1 bed it had 2 bathrooms a living room, dining room, and a sizable kitchen-902 had a full kitchen but small). We stocked our fridge at Star Market (just outside the large parking area) and had breakfast daily in the room. The kitchen had everything but the food itself (coffee maker, coffee, pots, pans, plates, dishes, silverware,...). I travel often and had always heard about the outrageous prices in Hawaii so I packed a small suitcase full of food also (pancake mix, cereal, snacks, ....). The prices weren't outrageous except the dairy items seemed to be significantly higher. We had pre booked our luau, The Feast at Lele and I would recommend it to anyone. It was $110/person plus tip but each group had a private table and the food and entertainment were excellent. There was 1 vegetarian in our group and they were extremely accommodating. We booked most other activities through the Expedia tour desk in the hotel. We opted for a 45 minute helicopter ride over Molokai, kayaking and snorkeling with South Pacific Kayaking, zip lining with EcoTours (booked separate), and I can't remember the name of the surfing company (booked separate). I wasn't impressed with the Expedia rep at all. She told us zip lining was fully booked (1 location was but when I called on my own they had openings at the one at the base of the volcano) and tried to talk us into biking down the side of the volcano. I told her I wasn't a great biker and she said it would be fine but when we went to the volcano to watch the sunrise and saw the bikers coming down the mountain on the same road with us on tight curves some of which had no guard rails and steep drops I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't a serious biker. We combined the sunrise with the zip lining (we went down the mountain and had breakfast at a cafe in between). After the helicopter ride we had lunch at Milagros in a town called Paia. It was great so we went again after zip lining. The hotel was great about letting us take towels to the beach, and their pool area was very nice. They don't have a ton of amenities but with the kitchen I wasn't bothered. When I return to Maui I will without a doubt return to this hotel. Since we rented a car we just zipped off to wherever whenever, the location is very convenient. The only travelers that I wouldn't recommend this hotel to would be people looking for serious nightlife. In addition, I wish somebody would have told me to bring a hat, scarf, and gloves to the volcano. We took the extra blanket out of the closet it just wasn't enough to keep us warm.

Since I knew beforehand EXACTLY which room I was getting, I didn't have to worry about what kind of room the Resortquest mgmt would give me. The kitchen had all the utensils one could need and there was a new washer and dryer as well. Kitchen and bathrooms were all up to date. This unit also had beach towels/chairs stored in a closet. The fold out bed in the sofa also had a real mattress. Check-in was very smooth. Parking spaces are narrow ( this seems to be the norm in Maui ). You can also take a nice stroll on the beach in either direction - going to the north you eventually get blocked by a rocky beach and a fence, going to the south you can walk all the way to the Black Rock. The beach immediately in front of the Mahana is very rocky and you are warned about this. To enter the water they recommend going north or south on the beach. In conclusion, an owner-managed Mahana condo is a perfect place to stay if you want a awesome, nothing-but ocean view and if you are not interested in paying higher prices for a full resort plus the endless add on fees. You can also save on food costs ( and calories ) by making some of your own meals. Grills are provided on the ground level of the Mahana for all guests. It may not be a good choice for families with little kids if the pool/resort scene is important for them. Side trips: For the 'Road to Hana' experience, I would recommend taking a tour rather than driving. The driver won't get to enjoy it as much. The roads are narrow and most bridges are one lane. We took a tour that included a lunch at the fancy resort in Hana.

The food was ok, not great. The drinks are watered down. The meat was dried out -- probably because it had been cooked many hours before. The restaurant next door, Aloha Mixed Plate, is so close that you can hear the entire luau from there. An interesting way to 're-live' it, if you have previously enjoyed it. We went to the Kupahana Magic Show at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. The food was decent for a banquet style dinner, drinks were limited to just a Mai Tai and/or soft drinks. The show itself was entertaining - it was a combination of magic + hawaii history. At times though the magician did seem to rush through his lines. Also drove to Haleakala crater (not for sunrise) but it was fogged in that day. Even though we couldn't see very far, it was still a surreal experience. Don't forget to bring a jacket.

Even had some extras we didn't expect. The bathroom was really nice with large shower. Nice bedroom with a very comfortable mattress too. We loved hearing the waves come in at night from the bedroom. This place made our vacation perfect. I did alot of research before we stayed here and read some negative reviews of the Mahana so I was a little skeptical. I know some of the rooms here aren't as updated as others. The Mahana itself is a beautiful hotel. It's on the other side of Black rock, on North Ka'anapali Beach which in my opinion is alot less busy and more quiet. The beach itself is nice as well, you can't swim directly in front of the Mahana due to coral, but you literally walk a min down either way on the beach and it's fine. It's great for snorkeling with all the coral right there, tons of fish. We saw a few turtles from our lanai as well. The pool area is nice, they just put a nice new hot tub poolside and also a bbq area with a handful of new grills and tables to grill out. They were also updating the bathrooms by the pool while we were there. There is also a litlle smoothie/snack bar by the pool which is a nice touch for the guests. No alcoholic drinks though. We went and bought a collapsible cooler for $12 and took our own drinks to the beach and that worked out fine. The staff at the Mahana is also very nice too. They were always helpful if we needed anything. The Mahana is in walking distance from a little plaza with a grocery store and some restaurants too which is convenient. We loved the Mahana!!

Go to Lahaina with 10min drive south of the hotel, there you'll find lotza tour vendors. Luau: We went to the one at the Hyatt. It was nice. They did dances from around the pacific. The food sux. Open bar though. The fire torch guy kept on dropping his batton. We heard that the old Lahaina luau was the best but it was booked up. Food: Expensive!!!!!......Don't buy anything from walmart. Buy everything from costco. Maui pineapples are super sweet. You have to try mama's fish house and kimo's, awsome food. Hana: Drive to Hana was dangerous. If you are not a good driver, don't do it.

I know the rooms are sometimes the luck of the draw with condos, but ours had granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, washer and dryer, a huge tiled shower, and updated decor. Not to mention the view!! We watched whales from the family room! Both the bedroom and family room have floor to ceiling windows that face the ocean so you constantly see sailboats, surfers, and wildlife. I woke up to see a rainbow over the ocean the first morning I was there. As for the rest of the Mahana, the pool and hot tub are gorgeous. They were just updated and look brand new. It may have been the time of year but the pool and hot tub were never crowded and there were always plenty of lawn chairs to choose from. We walked to the neighboring hotels a couple of times and noticed that their pools were really overcrowded. My husband and I are in our early 30's and thought we might miss some of the excitement the bigger, more crowded resorts offer, but we realized that we really loved the relaxing atmosphere of the Mahana.

I booked this condo based on the reviews from Trip Advisor and have to say that I was not disappointed! We rented a Studio and got exaclty what we were expecting. It was a very cozy room with a full kichen, washer/dryer...everything that you need. Each condo has an amazing view on the ocean, a decent size lanai and most rooms have recently been renovated. We were hoping not to be on the 6th floor since some reviews said that the view was partially blocked by the palm trees...and we got a room on the 6th floor!!! We tried to change room but to no avail. However, the view was still spectacular, we could even observe humpback whales playing and feeding from our lanai! There is no restaurant nor bars in the hotel, however, there is a small coffee/smoothie bar opened during the day by the pool/jacuzzi area. The pool is kind of small but with a property right on the beach, we chose to swim in the ocean instead. Even though some reviews said that it was not recommended to swim in front of the hotel, we had no problems swimming right there. It is obviously not the best place to snorkel, but I snorkeled 50 metres from the beach and observed a variety of beautiful fish. However, I would recommend that you bring swimming shoes since it is a little rocky in front of the hotel. The beach goes for miles each side. We rented a car but there is a bus stop 5 minutes from the hotel that takes you to the Whalers Village and Lahaina. There is a little strip mall with a pizza place, a mexican restaurant, a Subway and a 24 hour grocery store 7-10 minute walk from the hotel. Other family members were travelling with us and some of them rented a one bedroom condo through VRBO web site and it was great . My wife and I will return at the ResortQuest Mahana but next time, we will book the condo through the VRBO web site. The big advantage is that you can actually see pictures from the owner and know exactly the condition that the condo is in, you might even be able to obtain a better price than by booking it with ResortQuest who manage 70% of the condos. The only negative thing we experienced during our stay is that it can be noisy during the day as they are building a big condo complex behind the Mahana.

Altogether there were about 21 people who traveled to Hawaii for the wedding and majority stayed at the Mahana. My family (my husband/me/15 yr son) were in Unit #107 and my inlaws were in Unit #106 -- ground floor. It was nice being able to walk to the lobby/pool area/front desk/Expedia (very nice having Expedia right at the hotel to book last minute activities) without worrying about an elevator but we lost some of the \"view\". Next time I would like a higher floor to get a better view of the ocean. It would have been nice to open the sliding glass doors with the screen and listen to the ocean waves all night but being on the 1st floor we didnt want to take the chance. Our rooms were clean and well maintained. We had a problem with our shower sliding glass door but maintenance came and fixed it right away. Maintenance did shut off water for 2 hours and they were doing work on the A/C system but we really were not inconvenienced since the work was done during the day and we were out. Internet connection wasnt that great, very slow and sometimes would not load at all. We were told to use the computer by the balcony . It was great having a kitchen well stocked with supplies and having a unit washer/dryer--I packed less clothes (although you had to pay for any additional Tide packets $1 per box). The pool area is smaller compared to other hotels but we really didnt use it that much-early morning, later at night.. You're mostly out in Maui enjoying tne sun, water, and sightseeing--for $287 night, it was perfect! You can use the hotel next door for restaurants--very close. My husband and father-in-law often walked to the shopping center for quick supplies early am--very close 10 min walk. Mahana was in a very convenient location for us--town of Lahaina short drive 20min and lots to do (restaurants, shopping, Atlantis Submarine, Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba, etc). It's about 45 min from the airport (shuttle cost $66) but we rented a car for the rest of the week. My son and I walked to Black Rock at Sheraton and it's not a 10-15 min walk, more like 45min or longer! But we stopped along the way at another hotel and had a great lunch at Castaway Cafe, rented snorkeling equipment and had a great time. For beginners in snorkeling (me), def go to Black Rock (the ocean waves are really rough when you're trying to snorkel for the first time). BR may be alittle crowded but its calmer water and you can really practice -- I actually swam at BR with a sea turtle!!! Our other activities included Aquarium (nice/small but if you have 2 hrs to spare which we did before the wedding its worth going); Luau at the Hyatt--wonderful food/drinks/show; Oahu--while we were in Hawaii we booked our 1-day flight thru Go Hawaiian (inter-island flights, $100 per person) and saw Pearl Harbor--I loved this trip--the tour of the Arizona, USS Missouri and the Bowfin was just terrific, I thoroughly enjoyed this day and highly recommend you make it a part of your trip. (I dont usually like to do history-type activities but this one is a must-see).. We also booked the Atlantis Submarine and Mauiscape Helicopter tours thru Expedia last minute (on Wed/Thurs to do on Friday). We did not get a chance to drive the Hana Road--Im told it takes almost a full day (5 1/2 hrs longer) and we just couldnt devote a whole day to it so we booked the Helicopter Ride which I loved.. First time in a helicopter and it was just fantastic to be in the clouds looking down at the volcano and the ocean. I thought it was too expensive to do but you know, you're in Hawaii, when will you get the chance again... We also booked with Blue Water Rafting 5 1/2 snorkeling trip -- highly highly recommend--it was awesome!!! the captain Jeff and tour guide Dante were just the best.. We felt like one big happy family even though we were all strangers!!! We stopped at 3 diff places to snorkel, saw a sea cave and spent time studying \"rock formations\" in the ocean.. Its a very fast raft trip and they warn you thats its not for pregnant woman or people with bad backs--you most def get wet on the boat going to/from the diff sites.. It's alot of fun though.. By mid-April, the whales are starting to leave for Alaska but Jeff thought he spotted one so although our tour was not a whale watching tour, he took the time to stop and look for it. We spotted a momma and baby whale.. All of a sudden the baby whale went under our raft, blew bubbles on the one side, turned around and came back under the raft, blowing more bubbles then swam off to join his mother.. Both whales then popped out of the water not far from our boat so we could see them perfectly. It all happened so fast.. Apparently it's rare that the whales come that close to the rafts and even more rare for them to blow bubbles so close. Our captain/Dante were just amazed, beyond words!!! lol They said we were \"mugged\" (when a whale comes close) and \"bubble blasted\" lol This was the best trip and highly recommended. The entire wedding party did the 2 1/2 hr whale watching/snorkeling tour and saw the same ones we did but at a much farther distance, calmer boat ride, and little time to snorkel. If you're looking for more excitement do the longer 5 1/2 tour. they take you to Molikini Crater/ front and back wall, Turrtle Town and the Kanaio coast.. I loved our trip--always wish you had more time (and money, Maui is not cheap.lol) but I think we accomplished majority of the activities. Next time, I would like to drive the Hana Road, more snorkeling and perhaps spend more time relaxing on the beach. April tends to be windy and it was very very windy esp at the beachfront Mahana resort.

Without a doubt, this hotel was a highlight of our stay. There was no way to be prepared for the view from our room - #1013. As soon as we opened the sliding glass door and stepped onto the lanai, we had a 180 degree panoramic view of the ocean- with Molokai and Lanai hanging out like old friends. We spent a lot more time on the lanai than expected- I ended up sleeping on the comfy patio lounge chair every night. Blissful. Whale watching from our lanai was equally as good - even late in the season, we were treated to dozens of whales breeching and enjoyed the calm sound of the waves breaking on the sand all hours of the day. I know I'm elaborating on the lanai- but we spent time searching for a better lanai in any of the hotels.... couldn't find ANY. This hotel is very special- with EVERY lanai having 100% privacy (no way to see any one else's lanai), and it was THE CLOSEST to the ocean in all of Maui. At least everywhere we looked in west and south Maui... what a treat. The pool scene was mostly kid-friendly, but the hot tub was a generous size, was empty often in the later evenings, and allowed for a lot of relaxing downtime after dinner. Parking was easy and fun- we were overachievers and out til late night many nights, and there was always a reasonable close spot to park in. Accomodations: A+ Staff: A+ ( we checked in 3 hours EARLY!

In 2007 and 2009 we booked through a private owner. This year we were there from March 22nd to April 2nd and stayed in Unit 815. It was wonderful. This is a 1 bedroom 2 bath condo. The Owners have kept this unit up very well. Very well supplied with all the essentials you should need or want while there. Snorkeling equipment, extra sheets, blankets, laundry detergent, etc. The kitchen had a full variety of spices, salt, pepper, paper towels, coffee, creamer, tea, even water and diet coke in the refrigerator when we arrived. Very clean, nice decor, and the view was unbelievable. We enjoyed sitting on the lanai watching the whales, sunsets, and just simply listening to the tide. The new whirlpool hot tub down in the pool area is awesome. They did a wonderful job. We had great weather. Our girls aged 13 and 14 had a wonderful time as well. Try the Atlantis Submarine, we enjoyed that very much as well as the surfing lessons in Lahaina. We did alot of snorkeling each day just South of the Mahana and it was great. We seen lots of creatures, fish etc. Down by Black Rock is one of the best places to snorkel. We also went out to Molokini and Turtle town on the Mahana Nai'a. What a wonderful Captain and crew work on this boat. We fished on the way out there and caught an Ono. We stopped and watched whales - they were very laid back and really showed us a good time. Will definintely do that again in 2009. The fish market just a little North of Mahana had a very good selection of fresh fish. We went there a few times and cooked out on the grills at the Mahana. I hear they are going to be putting in more grills back by the pool area again which will help. Alot of people like cooking out on the grills and it's a good time to meet alot of new people staying at the Mahana and their adventures on the Island. I miss the Mahana and cannot wait until we return next year. We have made the Mahana our annual vacation location. I also have to give a great applause to the Coffee Cart located by the pool. We enjoyed an Americano each morning and simply loved it. Good snacks too. We like the quite atmosphere the Mahana has to offer at night. We went down to the other big hotels by Leilani's and Whaler's Village but were happy to return to the Mahana. Just too busy for us at those other properties. I have stayed once at the Kaanapali Ali' - it was nice but just way too many people ALL THE TIME. We found the earlier in March you go the more Whales you will see. I give the Mahana a A+ - they have really done a good job keeping up with the grounds. See you April 2009.

We booked through vrbo for a privately owned-condo and we got everything we expected. The view was spectacular and our condo was updated with granite and a great shower too! The folks checking us in were pleasant, but not overly so. The pool had been redone and there was a large wonderful hot tub. We went to the pool a few times, but then the WIND kicked up, and we couldn't stay down there. It was actually humorous - the pool towel just blew across the ground. We asked around, and evidently it is very windy at times of the year. That meant that the beach near us was also too windy. Therefore, we just went south to Kihei one day and near Whaler Village on another, and were fine. There were cranes in front of the condo for a new condo being built. We couldn't hear the noise inside - good soundproofing. The last time we were in Maui was during the summer and we didn't experience wind like this. Also, the traffic near Lahaina has increased and it crawls for about 20 minutes. There is a lot of construction and you see construction cones and those road barriers all over the place. It's easy to overlook it, however, when you are in Maui! We liked the location being near Kaanapali and Lahaina for meals. We also went north to Napali for dinner at the Sea House, which I heartily recommend for atmosphere and great food. We rode the Kaanapali zipline which was accessible from the golf shop just down the street.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m living proof that you can get the Un luck of the draw booking through a private owner! After returning home I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read reviews of praise about the units at the Mahana, and a lot of them deserve that praise. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed here on 3 previous occasions and have had awesome units each time! I even emailed the person from Elk Grove Ca who gave a good review of UNIT 1219 if they would be willing to give me insight on the conditions they experienced in 2006, and they did. THANK YOU! She replied telling me that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why she left her email address, so that she could be honest if someone did email!! I booked through the VRBO site, and read the comments. Knowing they were old reviews, a lot can happen in a year if the owner does not take proper care, or in this case, the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management Co who has been ripping him off! I normally read reviews with a grain of salt. Important to me is the accommodations! Mahana states wifi? We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any connection anywhere! On the top floor, we SHOULD have had the best reception right? Desk said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Have you tried the lanai, or out by the pool?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mon\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Hawaii, and expect to sit by the pool to use my laptop Now on to the review: CONS We had to wash the towels before we could use them. I also double pillow cased my pillow, I saw how the extras, were full of slobber/sweating stains! Some of the things that need attention are not pictured. Here is just a sampling of the shabby conditions! Main bedroom: Light fixtures above the main bathroom sink were full of bugs (shows shabby house cleaning or infrequent) Loose ceiling light fixture in toilet area, loose faucet handle in shower. Guest bedroom: Stained curtains and luckily I had a safety pin, to pin them closed. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even want to lay on the beds (btw husband and I had to sleep on TWIN beds) type of bedding was not listed in description. Couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put them together, a huge dresser was between. The box springs covering was ripped and hanging on floor, floor was filthy. No closet space here either, owner had 2 huge boxes stored in that one also. Living area: Ripped chair, other chairs just looked dirty, worn and very out dated. A lamp sits on top of a stereo??? TV sits on some huge antique buffet of some sort? Curtains are pinned up. A beautiful chandelier over the table is in desperate need of cleaning. Again, all floors were filthy! My feet were black 5 minutes upon arriving and that was BEFORE I went out on the lanai! (Outdated old patio furniture there too) Kitchen: Lots of dishes and utensils to use, but were just a mix match of stuff and when I opened the cabinets, again, we could tell no activity has been around there for awhile. In here also, one whole section of cabinet was stored with a bunch of junk! PROS The ONLY thing this place has going for it IS the view, but the Mahana has nothing but ocean view units anyway. This corner unit didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you any more view needed, than the other units! I called Peter when we returned home, and told him of the condition of his unit, in case he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware but sounded a little shocked at what I told him. Had it not been for the abundance of whales to watch, awesome whale watch tour and great weather, staying in this unit would have almost totally ruined my anniversary celebration! In my opinion private owners that do not keep up their units are hurting the reputation of the MAHANA! If we had not rented previously, and this was my first time at this hotel, we definitely would NOT be back! Oh one last note. I usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let a review about the staff sway my opinion. Well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I can say without a doubt someof the staff at the mahana the 5 days we stayed there were NOT particularly helpful, especially Karen, who seemed like she could care less.

It had a very nice bathroom with a nice big walk-in river rock shower (no tub). It was so enjoyable to sit out on the lanai and eat our breakfast and have our morning coffee.

It was our first trip to Maui and to the Mahana, and what a stay we had. Booked directly with Resortquest, which I wouldn't do again (see my review on Kona by the Sea on Big Island for that explanation), but we got lucky with our unit #205 in the Molokai building. The views are incredible, and even though I had requested upper floors and were given second floor, the palm trees didn't detract from the views! I believe this unit is privately owned (not sure, but it had a guest book to write notes in), and could use a bit updating, especially in the master bath, but everything else was great. New LCD screen tvs, CD/radio, microwave, and pretty well stocked kitchen. Daily local newspaper as well, which we appreciated. As others have stated, the beach here is pretty steep, and not that great for swimming, but my husband did venture out with the snorkel gear and saw a few turtles and some other fish. The grassy area with chaise lounges is fantastic, and no sand in your shoes! The pool area is small, didn't go in, but did use the new jacuzzi, which seemed nice. The only bad thing I would comment on is the construction. We didn't notice the new condo building noise behind the Mahana, but there was loud tile cutting around the pool area every day, not sure what they are doing, but maybe finishing up a few areas that are on the outer edges of the new patio. Also, one or two of the units within the Molokai building were having some construction work done on them, and it could get very loud while they were doing demolition on the outside tiles. This didn't seem to be a problem for the many people lounging on the grass, but it got irritating for me and my husband, so we moved down a ways to get away from it. I would have been extremely loud if you were next door to that! I didn't notice if this was happening in the Lanai building, but I can't imagine that other properties aren't having some sort of construction going on too. The area seems to be growing fast!

Abundant low traffic jogging areas, a grocery store, deli, fish market and everything else you need is about a five minute walk. There is a shuttle to Lahaina. The pool is small.

Some of those may have granite counters and plasma TV's, but that is not important enough to me, for a week of vacation, to pay a lot extra. Our room was VERY spacious, approximately 1400 Sq. feet (don't know exact measurements). The master bedroom had a king bed, two bedside tables, closet, dresser and TV. There was a large picture window/sliding door to the lanai. The bathroom had a separate toilet and shower. The water pressure was excellent. There was a washer/dryer combo between the bathroom and bedroom with a linen closet. There was another large closet with iron, board, vacumn and other items. We also left a styrofoam cooler. Hopefully, others will use it and leave it as well. There was a hairdryer, but I always take my own. We could hear the ocean waves every night, even though we were all the way up to the 11th floor. Very soothing! The second bedroom had two twin beds and faced the mountains, also an awesome view. There was a TV in there and dresser, bedside tables. The bathroom had a tub/shower combo. The shower and toilet were also separate from the sink area. There was a linen closet and another closet. It also held beach chairs, boogie board, tennis racket and balls, fins, beach umbrella, and some other things. There was an ample supply of towels in each linen closet and they left 6 large beach towels for the 4 of us. There was pretty much any needed item in the kitchen for cooking. We cooked all breakfasts there and a couple evening meals. Made sandwiches, etc. There was dishwasher powder provided, as well as liquid hand soap in the kitchen and baths. Bar soap as well. You will need to bring shampoos. We took laundry detergent, but I saw small sized boxes at the ABC store, which is right up the same Rd. as the Mahana (Lower H.) on the left, just a few blocks. There is a nice table and chairs in the dining area. The living area is very spacious and has a sofa bed. We did not use that, so I cannot comment on it. The best feature of this room was the large picture window of course. You looked right out at the ocean, it was awesome! There was also a door to the lanai. There was a round table and 5 chairs on the lanai. Nice to eat out there and watch the whales blow! There was a TV/VCR/DVD in there as well as CD player. We did not use any of those items. In the drawers are books, several travel guides on Maui, games, cassette tapes, videos, etc. We were able to watch the whales daily. They actually came up pretty close one day and we could watch with the naked eye. Most days, we could see them blow, but needed binoculars to actually see the whale good. We also had surfers out almost daily, fun to watch. One day, there were about 7 wind kite surfers. We did not swim, because for us personally, the water was too cool this time of year. We are from the south and the winter Maui temps, were about like our spring temps. here, water a little too cold for us. A wetsuit probably would alleviate the issue. Other people were in the water down to the right and left of us, especially kids! As has been mentioned in many reviews, so should not be a complaint, swimming right in front of the condo is not advisable because of coral, however, better areas are only a few steps away in either direction. There is a pool and jacuzzi (which is new, I have picture but for some reason, can't find it for this review and don't want to start all over. I can email to anyone who asks). I didn't see too many using the pool while there. Probably used more in the true summer months. It was also windy many of our days (also a product of Maui winters) which kept things cool. people were using the jacuzzi the days it was open. There were plenty of lounge chairs at the pool area and down on the lawn near the beach. It was nice to lie out in the sun, not too hot, though the sun would burn (sunscreen!). You could find shady spots too. After you leave the condo lot & pass two other condo entrances, the shopping center is right across the street. There is a Star market (expensive), pizza/ice cream place, subway, Maui Dive Shop, and other shops. Travel down that road to the left for ABC and other restaurants, shops. You don't have to go too far. If you go back out to the main road, HWY 30 and go right, about 5 minutes away is Whalers Village, turn right on Kaanapali Parkway (I think is the name??), village is on the left, with shopping. Many resorts down here as well. If you stay on HWY 30, about 10 minutes away is Lahaina Cannery Mall with ABC and Safeway, a less expensive grocery alternative. You can fill out a safeway card at the customer service desk in less than 5 minutes. We found them much cheaper than Star. We did not go to wal-mart until we were headed back to the airport (mother wanted pillow for flight). We noticed some of their items, such as the macadamia candies, were more expensive. It was also a madhouse of people in there. We waited in line about 30 minutes. We drove from the Mahana up to Kapalua Bay, awesome waves and the surfers were really putting on a show for us. This bay is calm in the summer months for snorkeling, swimming, etc. Not this time of year!! We also drove the road to Hana. Took bonine first and thankful of that. It is a hairy road and can be stressful to drive, but the views are incredible and worth it at least one time. We also stopped at the Garden of Eden. It was nice, but not as many flowers as we expected to see, maybe because it is winter. Nice peacocks though! We also did the Pacific Whale Foundation Discovery Whale watch and it was awesome! Whales came right up to and under the boat. I wish I had taken a video camera. It was more than worth the money and I wish now we had gone a second time. Lahaina was nice. We found the most reasonable parking down Dickenson St. The first day, we parked in a lot next to PWF shop and it was $15.00 no matter how short/long you were there. The Dickenson lot was based on the hours you were parking. All were self-service lots. You put money/card in machine and then put ticket in your window. We did hear (and saw police out one day) that anyone parked too long in free spots got a $75.00 ticket. The most free parking we saw was for 3 hours. Also attended the Old Lahaina Luau, also incredible. Much more professional and much nicer setting than the one we attended elsewhere several years ago. They do not give discounts & sell out every night, so that tells you something. It was well worth it. We were disappointed with the ReefDancer, saw absolutely nothing. Now that I have come home and read reviews, this seems to be a common occurance. There's no indication in their advertising that visibility may be too poor and only rainchecks are given. May be better in summer, I don't know. They should close down in winter I personally think. Unless they just like taking people's money. The Mahana was a great condo. We did not experience any problems with the front desk staff at check-in or check-out, even though we were not ResortQuest guests, so to speak. We could not use their pool towels (had our own in room) and there was no daily maid service, which did not concern me. I prefer privacy and not worrying about getting out of the room, etc. The owners were very easy to deal with, answered all emails promptly and answered any questions. I would not hesitate to stay here again. For those who book, please realize this is a smaller condo complex, not a hotel resort, large condo complex, etc. There is no restaurant. There is someone in the lobby area with a cart (alcoholic drinks, drinks, breakfast foods, snakcs, etc.). This condo does have something many others do not and that is direct ocean front rooms and awesome ocean views. I did not see too many places that had ALL oceanfront views like this one. The condo complex two doors down was large, had nice pool area with slide and falls, but only a few rooms actually front the beach and many don't even have a view of it. Most have view of that nice pool or garden areas. I'll take the beach view over that nice pool any day, but I realize everyone has their own preferences. Just realize, if that is what you enjoy, and you also enjoy nightlife, pampering, restaurants, etc., the Mahana is not the best choice for you. If you do want peace and quiet, relaxation, awesome ocean views, cocktails on your own lanai, in private, watching that beautiful sunset or the whales, then the Mahana is for you!

Some mornings I was able to see a few whales frolicking from the lanai. The beds were HEAVEN...like sleeping on a cloud. On the downside, it was extremely windy there. All night the wind literally whistled under the front door. The Maui mountains are outside one bedroom, and fog and rain constantly rolled in from that direction. The beach was usually too windy to walk, and the water had lots of whitecaps by afternoon. We asked around and discovered that that area has the worst weather at that time of year due to the location. (When we went into Lahaina the weather was great.) To be fair, I heard they had been having very weird weather.....they had had heavy rains and flooding the week before we arrived.

As a previous reviewer pointed out, if you book through the management company that runs the resort, you take the luck of the draw. Our unit was a one bedroom which was clean. The furnishings and bath/kitchen were not stellar, but frankly who really cares. I believe all of the units at the Mahana are oceanfront and have simply amazing views. The pool is rather small for a two building 12 story complex, but just walk another 10 feet and you'll be on the beach. The beach itself isn't the best - not very wide / fair amount of debris (rocks, branches, etc.), but the snorkeling just south of Mahana was VERY good - you can explore there for days.

Tools and supplies for the various construction projects (fence-building, hot tub tiling, bathroom construction ) were left out in orange-coned areas We asked at the front desk about getting permission to use their sister hotel pool facilities down the beach and were told that since there was water in the pool, we had to use the Mahana for \"liability reasons.\" We found that ironic because the real liability seemed to be the tile cutter, screw drivers, and debris left out on the pool deck 24 hours a day. The pool area is and continues to be a working construction zone, not a place to relax, enjoy the pool, and listen to the sounds of the ocean. We had read other tripadvisor reviews since booking this accommodation through Chasin' Rainbows Realty back in August and thought surely the pool rennovations would be complete by Christmas.

The chances of us staying at Mahana on a future trip to Maui are slim.

The last review was very negative, so I felt compelled to share my experience. There are two ways to book at the Mahana and one is better than the other in my opinion. The Mahana is comprised of two towers of privately owned condos, all oceanfront. ResortQuest operates the property, but the rooms are all individually owned (I believe), so that leads to drastically different styles and renovations in each unit. Some units are awesome, with stainless steel appliances and granite kitchens/bathrooms, while other units sound old, outdated and in need of an upgrade. So how do you get around this? Well, if you book through ResortQuest directly, you get the luck of the draw. Whatever happens to be open, you get. It could be a nice newly renovated unit or it could be a terrible old unit (see last review). My recommendation is to go around ResortQuest and book directly through the owner. When you go this route, you typically get to see photos of that exact unit and you can be sure that it meets your satisfaction before you book. I booked a unit through [-]. There are a number of websites like this and any of them work. This way I knew I was getting room 814 and it was newly renovated. The room was great! Sparkling clean, new appliances and great views. Avoid disapointment and book direct! ResortQuest probably won't like me making this recommendation, but it's there own fault for offering a product that leaves so many people unhappy. The property is great. Right on the beach, but far enough away from Kaanapali's main hotels, so it isn't overly busy. The pool renovations are definitely still ongoing, but the pool is open and can be used. The showers and the hot tub are still under construction. There are nice new Weber BBQs for guests to use in the garden and lots of free parking. DO NOT think of this property as a hotel though, as I think the last reviewer did and was disapointed. There are no bell hops or room service, just your own condo for the week. If that is ok by you, you'll have a great time! If not, you are better off looking at the Sheraton, Westin or Hyatt.

The hotel was booked as a package with Air Canada Vacations. After reading all of the rave reviews, I picked this property. We were pretty disappointed once we checked in. I think if you know of a good unit first hand and are able to secure that specific room, then the Mahana may be a 5-star experience for you. If you leave it to luck of the draw, you may be extremely disappointed with the unit that you get stuck with. We stayed in a studio on the 5th floor that had a murphy bed. The bed was extremely uncomfortable - no support. The calming sounds of the ocean were definitely not enough to cure our sleepless nights and sore backs. The unit also had some mold in the laundry closet which made the unit smell musty and feel dirty. Thanks to the helpful front desk staff, we were able to switch to a unit on the 9th floor which had a real bed and was much cleaner. But the actual unit itself was fairly outdated and not nearly as nice as some of the pictures posted of other units. The ocean view aside, I would rate the room itself as a 2.5 star hotel.

They gave us a 10% discount for our troubles + a goody basket upon arrival, which I felt was fair compensation. We still had access to the pool at their sister property, the RQ Kaanapali Shores, which was within walking distance just a couple of doors down. When the pool is finished, I'm sure it will be fine. Nothing fancy, but fine for most people who aren't going to be in the pool that much while in Maui anyway. If you're looking for a \"resort feel\" this is not the place. It is too small for that & lacking in resort amenities. But if you want a quiet \"home away from home feel\", book the RQ Mahana.

I booked a 1 bedroom/ 1 bath condo last February to make sure I was able to get what I wanted. A few weeks before we were scheduled to arrive, I received a phone call from the Mahana about the pool closing. I was very disappointed, but Georgina ended up giving us a discount that made up for it. I was able to use a pool a few resorts down the beach and that was fine. I was also surprised at how warm the ocean was. It looks like the Mahana pool will be lovely when they are finished with the re-tiling in November. We had wonderful weather and good rates, which is a good reason to vacation in October. However, it may also be a bad time for encountering construction problems. We were given condo # 916 at first. It is a lovely condo with granite counters and a comfy king size bed. We were happy there until the neighbor upstairs began a construction project and we could not take the pounding. We requested a move and were given # 1005. This condo is absolutely wonderful; even better than 916. It has granite counters, stainless steel appliances, two bathrooms, and a great king sized bed. The bathroom off of the bedroom has a large two person shower and big showerheads. The views from both condos were breathtaking. We loved sitting on the lanai until around noon when it would get a bit hot. We appreciated the air conditioning in the afternoon. Then, after watching a beautiful sunset, it cools down and we would open the doors and sleep listening to the waves. The Mahana is a clean, quiet place with a pleasant staff and plenty of free parking. I loved having a washer and dryer too, that was so convenient! We walked down to the neighboring resorts for a drink by the pool, to play in the waves, and once for dinner. We checked out the area by the Whalers Village as well. The resorts there look nice, the walkway by the ocean is lovely, and there are plenty of restaurants, but.....it is soooo congested!! My husband and I were happy to get back to the Mahana. We ate some of our meals in the condo and this made our trip much less expensive. We did a little shopping at the Star market nearby (which is a full size grocery store), and some at the Safeway in Lahaina (we applied for a card there which only took a few minutes). Safeway is a little less expensive I think. We also rented DVD's for some nights at the place near the Star market. I guess you can shop for groceries at the Costco near the airport, but we didn't have a membership and that would have been $52. We want to return to the Mahana soon, we miss it! Restaurants: We ate at Bubba Gumps, Kimo's and Pioneer Inn in Lahaina. Breakfast was good at Pioneer Inn. Bubba Gumps was fun, but we really liked the outdoor seating at Kimo's. We liked the food at both places. Tried Lelani's in the Whalers Village. I liked my dinner (fish) but my husband didn't care for his prime rib at all. We watched the cliff diving ceremony at the Sheraton from the Lagoon Bar. That was nice but you could get an even better view down at the beach. Keep in mind that restaurants validate the parking slips but it is for 3 hours only. We also ate at Charley's in Paia a few times. I liked the breakfast, and my husband just loved the tuna sandwich (lunch menu only). We visited the Maui Ocean Center and enjoyed that, especially the walk-through tank with the sharks and the jellyfish tank. We ate lunch at the restaurant there, but can't recommend it because the flies drove us crazy. Shopping/ dress: Lahaina is a fun little town to visit, but if you see the cruise ship on the water it will be crowded! The ship was there on a Thursday. Lahaina has a great selection of sun dresses (\"island dresses\")!. Most of them were $20 - $30. Hilo Hattie's has a selection that the other stores don't have. I bought one and wore it to the Old Lahaina Luau. You can wear shorts there, but it was fun to wear the dress and many of the women did so (I suggest packing a strapless bra in case you find a dress that needs one). Women also wear island dresses out shopping and at many of the restaurants we went to. I picked up some dresses for gifts too. Luau: The Old Lahaina Luau was great (including the food). You get a beautiful lei, a great selection of food, and an open bar (try the \"lava flow\"!), in addition to the show. A couple at our table was in Maui visiting friends who lived there and the friends recommended this luau. Other places of interest: Iao Valley is beautiful, easy to get to, and free (we did not end up needing bug spray), and we did the \"road to Hana\". About this - we are from the midwest and are not used to driving in mountains. The scenery was gorgeous, but the driving was hideous. I don't usually get car sick, but I was feeling sick only 10 miles into the drive when we stopped at the Garden of Eden. The garden is lovely, and I grabbed a diet 7up from the cooler that I was glad we brought. There are so many turns and one lane bridges! It is slow going, but the locals drive like crazy people. A teenager came around a corner in our lane and almost hit us head on. Later, a local in a pick up truck did almost the same thing. We wanted to stop at the Pua'a Ka'a State Park for the waterfalls and the restrooms, but it was all fenced off when we got there. I don't know why. The Ke' anae Peninsula is an amazing sight. The banana bread at the stand there is very good too! We pushed on to the black sand beach at Wai'anapanapa State Park. Fabulous scenery and a wonderful park. We were glad that we had sandwiches and drinks in our cooler to eat at the picnic tables. I wanted so much to go to Ohe'o Gulch (7 Sacred Pools), but we couldn't take any more of that road! I really wished we didn't have to drive it back again. We encountered a big truck on the drive back and my husband, along with two cars behind us, had to back up along a stretch of that curving road with only a short stone wall at the edge of the cliff to allow the truck through. We were so happy to reach Ho'opika Beach on the way back. The waves were huge and we sat watching the expert windsurfers for two hours to de-stress. We would recommend doing this if the windsufers are out! Also, if you can handle the road it would be nice to take your time for stops and not worry about driving back the same day. When I looked into it, a lot of places in Hana had a two night minimum and no air conditioning so I didn't book them. We did see lots of Roberts Hawaii vans around. Maybe taking the tour or booking a room in Hana would have been better than driving it ourselves in one day.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWhat great place to stay in West Maui\u201d", "Author": "bgraboski", "ReviewID": "UR10472437", "Content": "What a great place the Mahana is for a weeklong stay in West Maui.

The pool area was under renovation when we were there but we are not there for the pool (in two weeks we never stepped foot in a pool). The other common areas are nicely decorated and not tacky in the least.

We had a two bedroom, two bathroom condo for our week stay. I would highly recommend calling ahead of time and requesting a newly remolded condo and placement on a higher floor(although all of the rooms are ocean front) Not sure how the other condos looked, but ours was more than we expected. Spacious living room, flat screen television, full kitchen with supplies, washer/dryer, dishwasher, balcony, etc. All of this for the same price of a hotel room! The hotel staff was average, and housekeeping services are provided. Be sure to ask for extra towels however as they seem to provide the bare minimal. As for the condition of the condo, no complaints here. But as I said before, this may be due to my request of a newly remolded condo. There are a few cons however to the Mahana. There are no on-site restaurants. This isn't a big problem however because mostly everyone rents a car and there are a couple of restaurants located in the hotels next door if you chose to dine there. I would recommend going to a grocery store and purchasing a few breakfast items to save money. There is a grocery store Star Market located across the street, but be warned that prices in Hawaii are much higher. Also, the crowd at the Mahana is a little bit \"older\" so don't expect a party scene at night. This was perfect for us however since we were celebrating our anniversary. We simply took a 15 minute drive to Lahania's Front Street at night for the bar scene. Also, the beach in front of the Mahana is not suitable for swimming(it's very rocky). This also was not a problem because we simply walked 3 yards down Kaanapali Beach to a strip in front of the next hotel that was perfect. There is one pool at the Mahana also that was average. It never appeared crowded, as I believe everyone opted for swimming in the ocean. The Mahana also had a couple of activities during the week which is why some people chose a big hotel chain.

(All rooms are owned by someone, some rooms are very very nice, same room next door to you just plain.) 4: Go out and talk to one of the many activity booths, to get deep discount on snorkel trips, hana trip, heli trips... they sign you up to do a 90 min time share, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, Just do not ask questions, we spent 60 min at one, had a nice lunch, and my daughter swam in their pool. Saved about $120 on snorkel day trip for 4 (Pride of Maui was a nice boat) 5: Get snorkel gear in the town of Lahaina ($9 week at snorkel bobs) just south of Mahana, we snorkeled every evening right out in front of resort. 6: We used BBQ most days it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice. 7: Tour to hana then heli back. 8: Get underwater case for your digital camera before you go.

Due to an early flight, arriving at 9:00 am, we decided to head on over to the Mahana just to find out where it was and see if there was a possibility the room was available - and it was! The front desk was very nice (as they always were throughout our visit) about letting us check in early. The lobby was very cozy looking with a view straight out to the pool & ocean - oh how breathtaking! We stayed on the 5th floor in a comfy studio condo. The condo living quarters were a bit dated, carpet looked old and worn, furniture & pictures were very old as well - but, the kitchen & bathroom all had updated cabinetry, countertops, faucets, etc. Then, there was the view....oh how magnificent! DH was in heaven listening to the ocean waves every night (I would prefer silence, but hey, we're at the beach)! There's a couple of minor issues: first, our dishwasher didn't work, but a morning visit to the front desk had it repaired when we returned that afternoon - no problem! Secondly, the lighting in the bathroom was not great - the sink is quite small & the counterspace is very deep (long distance to the mirror). So, if you decided to apply makeup, you'd practically have to sit on the sink & lean on in there to make sure you don't come out looking like a clown. Oh, and something else the Mahana can't be faulted for....I despise those oh so nasty critters - cockroaches (I lived in the South for 20 years, so I'm quite familiar with them!). And they do have them at the Mahana (a dead one in the sliding glass door frame definitely proved that!) So, I had a little tension sometimes, worrying about if they were going to come visit us, but they never did - thank goodness! So, needless to say, that was something I needlessly stressed about.! The Mahana is in a great location, close to stores (Star Market just down the road), coffee (Java Jazz down the road as well), restaurants (you're offered a dining \"card\" to go to neighboring condo restaurants & charge it to your room, which we didn't partake & downtown Lahaina is about a 10 min. drive), etc. A fun thing we liked to do every night was walk thru the main lobby entrance & lobby itself and look for geckos. One night we even saw about 4 or 5 on the entrance ceiling! Plus, many more inside on the ceilings. I felt better that they were there, dining on my dreadful enemies - insects :) All in all, it was a great stay. Our condo was very comfy, offered everything an apartment would, was close to everything in West Maui and had good customer service.

One of the BIG negatives I had with the place was I could hear the people staying in the ROOM ABOVE ME. Not good if you are a light sleeper or want to relax in quiet. Also, the condo's are right off the beach, but you must walk about 5min in either direction of the hotel to get somewhere swim-able because of rocks in the water in front of the hotel.

Nothing but good things to say. Check in was a snap. There's handy luggage carts by the elevators to use to haul your stuff up. The condo we were in was just fine. Furnishings and decor were a little on the \"hotelish\" style, but that's ok. Plenty of storage space and dressers, armoires. Having the full kitchen and laundry was great. There's free high speed wireless internet in the units, although the signal could get a little flaky at times. Parking at Mahana is also free. Be sure to stock up on food at the Costco in Kahului. The Star Market across the street is fine to pick up small items and condiments, but be prepared for sticker shock. The view, I can't say enough about. We sat on our lanai alot and just soaked in the view and the sound of the waves. They have a breakfast orientation for those wanting help scheduling activities. We are pretty self directed so if you're like that, just pick up the latest copy of Maui Revealed and book your trips on-line, usually you get a discount that way. The grounds are very well kept. There are plenty of lounges either by the pool or on the grassy area in front of both towers. Be sure to bring or buy a beach towel, there is not a towel service by the pool. Two barbecues are available for grilling on. My only real complaint about the Mahana is that I wish they had more afternoon shade - we are pretty fair skinned, so we had to constantly move around to find some shade. It would be nice if they had some palapas or umbrellas around for those seeking shade. The beach in front of the Mahana is extremely rocky which makes for great sound of pounding waves, but no one went in the water there. There's excellent swimming about 100 yards south and pretty darn good snorkeling about 100 yards further. It's a bit of a hike to Black Rock. My husband hiked down one morning to snorkel there and he said it took about 20 minutes each way, but the snorkeling is fantastic there. There's a Maui Dive Shop in the little shopping center across the street from the Mahana's driveway. You can rent snorkel gear and boogie boards there. This was our second trip to Maui and we didn't schedule as many activities as we did on our first trip. This part of Kaanapali is much more relaxed than when we stayed south of Black Rock on our first trip. Still its handy to go down to Whaler's Village for shopping and dining. For activities, I do highly recommend the Four Winds II snorkel trip to Molokini which leaves from Ma'alea Harbor. This trip was fantastic, and if you're prone to getting sea-sick, this is probably one of the better boats to be on because its bigger than alot of the other catamarans. And they do a good bbq lunch instead of the cold deli lunches that you get on some of the smaller boats.

It was clean and everything was in good working order but it wasn't first class by any means. The property doesn't have a restaurant or food service of any kind. The pool is average size (not heated) and there was no jacuzzi. The beach right in front of the hotel, although beautiful to look at was not swimmer friendly, as a matter of fact you couldn't swim right in front of the resort except by walking about 150 yards or more to either side, there was coral that made walking in impossible (they said you could do it with water shoes but we didn't try it). Quite an inconvenience. The elevators gave out once during our stay and we had to go up and down 10 flights of stairs, the staff didn't seem very concerned when it happened: I wondered if they had any disabled guests staying there that had to use the stairs that evening. The elevators were running when we got up the next morning. We used the activities desk to book all our activities (luau, helicopter flight, magic/dinner show, etc.), the lady was very nice and I think we got a good deal on our purchases: the desk is owned by Expedia (as are a lot of activities desks in Lahaina). Overall our experience was OK. We were a family of four (son aged 6 and daughter aged 2) and we had a marvelous time on our vacation, but it was the things we did away from the Mahana that made it wonderful, not the property itself.

The secluded location of the hotel is also a plus unlike the nearby properties ---somewhat noisy and boisterous. The surroundings were well kept and maintained.

I guess I have a very sensitive nose cause my husband and son didn't smell anything but it was enough of a smell to be really distracting to me.

The next morning we woke up and went outside and noticed they were cleaning the condo next door #107, I went in there and noticed that there was no smell. Realized it has a tile floor and figured out that the musty smell was most likely from water that had seeped into the carpet over the years. The kitchen was great and the furniture while similar in style to 108 was newer and smelled fresher. The bedroom also had a nice sized king. We went to the front and they changed us to that condo, no hassle at all. Ended up loving being on the bottom floor. The other condo did not have a lock on the screen door and one of the things I was looking forward to was being lulled to sleep by the ocean. 107 had a lock and really it seems to be generally safe anyways.

What a tremendous condo we had. We stayed in room 614 which was extremely elegant, had upgraded amenities and a wonderful ocean view. We took a peek at some other rooms when housekeeping had the doors propped open and our room was much better than others! Ocean views right when you walk in the door were breathtaking. Rarely has a hotel lived up to expectations like this one did! The pool was nicely groomed, very clean and offered a nice way to cool off. The grounds were constantly being maintained and kept very clean as well. The only drawback was that the staff seemed to enjoy chatting it up on the phone or taking extra long to talk to other patrons about non-work related activities rather than helping us when needing towels or assistance with something. The exception to this was the concierge desk where the lady there hooked us up with some fantastic things such as massages on our patio, tickets to Warren and Annabelle's magic show and a helicopter tour of West Maui. She didn't even need to be tipped! Very friendly and while events were expensive, she did a great job in doing the legwork for us in a short 10 minute session. I can't say that the rest of Maui lived up to the hype as our stay was riddled with some bad dining experiences and the fire that shutdown HWY 30 on and off for a couple days. That was no fault of the Mahana and we just decided to spend our last day or two around the condo and enjoyed the beach, activities and sunset walks right at the Mahana. Please make sure to read the signs as to where this is good swimming. They make no bones about that fact that there is coral right outside the Mahana and that you either need to go slightly North or South to find good swimming and snorkeling water!

The extra bath was nice and unexpect and were great!! We loved the small pool which was never crowded. We loved at times being the only people on the beach. We did have to walk a little ways to play in the water, but it was not a big deal. We also got smoothies and sandwiches which were sold by the pool. The guy who worked the cart was very nice and gave us a lot of information on things to do. We also liked that a supermarket was across the street for groceries. We also bought watershoes there at the supermarket for $10. We took the Triliogy snorkeling tour to the island of Lanai. It was beautiful there I loved the tour. We also did a day excursion to Oahu to see Pearl Harbor. It was nice but we had to wake up very early to catch the flight. I am glad we went, however I don't that I would go back. We did not care for Oahu, kind of reminded us of New Orleans. Our tour guide was very good. We booked with Polynesian Tours and Nappy was our driver. We also drove ourselves to Hana. Hana is beautiful going up, but not going down. Pretty much everyone was sick but the boys on your trip. It is definitely worth going once, but I don't know if I would repeat the road to Hana. We drank coconut milk straight from the coconut from a guy on the side of the road on the way to Hana. The banana nut bread he has is delicious. We will definitely be going back to Maui. There is so many other things to see and do. I will say that the majority of people that lived there were extremely friendly. I felt like I was back home in Louisiana. We also loved the Old Lahaina Luau and recommend booking early. We booked about 6 months in advance and had the best seat in the house. That luau is definitely worth a repeat when we go back!

Before we left, we spent numerous hours checking up on hotels in the area. These were the reasons we chose to stay at the Mahana: 5. It is in a good area, close to Kaanapali Beach and Lahaina. 4. The reviews we read on TripAdvisor. 3. Reasonable prices. 2. All rooms are ocean front. 1. The view of the ocean we saw in pictures. The pictures and most of the reviews we read built up the excitement for us and the Mahana did not disappoint. We had actually booked a studio room, but they had run out so instead, we were put in a one bedroom on the second floor and it was gorgeous! We got there on a cloudy night, so we couldn't see the ocean, but we could hear the waves crashing against the shore. The first night we just sat out on the lanai and enjoyed the sound! The next morning we woke early to a beautiful view of Lanai and Molokai. It was incredible. We never got tired of the view from both the lanai and the huge floor to celing window. Every night we watched the sunset from either the lanai or the lawn chairs infront of the Mahana. The beach in front is a great beach to take a walk on early in the morning. We did this every morning we could. The beach in front of the condo is not great to swim or snorkel, but we just went down the beach to the south about half a mile and it was great. We pretty much had this part of the beach to ourselves most days. It's definitely worth the short walk. The snorkeling is great there, and we even saw a group of dolphins swimming nearby. Here are some places we went: 1. Teralani cocktail cruise-great 2. Napili Bay-nice in the morning, but got crowded 3. Feast at Lele- awesome luau! a real cultural experience, great service 4. Sunrise at Haleakala- very beautiful, but a nauseating drive, we left at 2 am! 5. Road to Hana- we loved it, road was good up until Hamoa Bay, there were too many people at 7 pools-get there early, road was closed past 7 pools due to earthquake damage 6. Four WInds II snorkel cruise- molokini was only stop, got to stay there longer, good lunch, saw turtles on the way back 7. Iao Vally- very beautiful, we went here on our last day, well worth it 8. Big Beach- very beautiful beach, golden sand, clear, blue water 9. Kaanapali Beach- pretty crowded when we were here 10. Kahekili Beach- on other side of Black Rock from Kaanapali, less crowded, nice beach, right next to Mahana We had an awesome time and it was always nice to go back to the Mahana every night.

The pool was fine, never crowded (which we like) and there were chairs set up along the ocean in front of the place to get out of the wind in the afternoon.

We vacationed in Maui from May 26th through June 2nd. We selected the Mahana because it looked good on the website and we liked the price. Our package included airfare, accomodations, and a Jeep Wrangler. I read impressive reviews on trip advisor before we made our final decision on accomodations. I have to say that this was the best vacation of my entire life. I LOVE Mahana. We stayed in unit 608. Our condo was gorgeous! The view from our balcony was incredible. Since the condo is right on the ocean, we heard the sound of the surf all night long. The employees were friendly and helpful. We had daily maid service and the the decor was very tasteful. I had a problem with the bathtub within the first two days of our vacation. I reported the problem to the front desk and it was repaired when I arrived back at the condo that evening. I have to say something about the swimming pool. In other trip advisor reviews that I have seen, visitors have complained about the swimming pool at Mahana. I read from previous reviews that many people walk up the beach to the Kannapali Beach Club to utilize their swimming pool. That is exaclty what we did. It worked out perfectly for us. The problem was solved. I already knew that the beach in front of the Mahana had a lot of corral because of previous reviews. We walked down the beach a short distance and had a beautiful swim beach. I liked it because this beach was practically empty. There were about five or six people using the beach. For visitors that have traveled a lot, you know that going to a beach with about five or six people doesn't happen very often. There are usually about 100 people on the beach. Other people on the beach were snorkeling so I walked back to the condo and got my snorkel gear. I saw some beautiful fish, lots of corral and sea urchins. I do have one negative thing to say about the concierge desk. I utilized a book called Maui Revealed so that we could get the best of the best on all of our activities. That included a laua for my birthday, helicoptor ride, road to Hana tips, snorkel trip and dinner cruise. The person that we spoke with at the conciege desk talked us out of going with the Maui Princess for our dinner cruise and into going with the Pacific Whale Foundation dinner cruise instead. That was a very poor decision because the food quality was very bad on that dinner cruise. In spite of the issue with the level of food quality, we still enjoyed ourselves and the sunset from the deck was wonderful. However, we received first class service on all of our excursions, except for the dinner cruise that this employee persuaded us to take. We met and spoke with many people during our vacation. Everyone said that the Pacific Whale Foundation dinner cruise does not compare to the Maui Princess dinner cruise. Keep that in mind when you are talking to the staff at the concierge desk. I loved our excursions. The Old Lahaina Laua was fantastic. I went to the laua for my birthday. A few of the staff greeted me with happy birthday upon arrival. Every employee was friendly, and energetic. The dancers were beautiful and very talented. We had several portraits taken by professional photographers and we were able to purhcase them for about $5 each after the show. The helicoptor ride was spectacular. I saw many beautiful waterfalls that are only accessible by air. It was outstanding. Our pilot was very polite and informative. He told us lots of interesting facts about Maui and Molakai during the entire flight. We took out helicoptor ride on day two of our vacation and it was fun to get an aerial view of our island paradise. I will be coming back to Maui and I will be booking the Mahana for my next trip! If I elect to go to another island the next time I return, I will be looking for a ResortQuest property since I was so happy with Mahana. Thank you to the Mahana for the perfect vacation!

We stayed here from May 28 - June 4 and everything was perfect. It felt like home and not a couple of rooms. There were four of us in our party so we had reserved a 2B/2B condo. I had researched extensively on where to stay and this certainly did not disappoint at all. We were in the Molokai Wing #701. Words can't express how wonderful this unit was. Updated everything with marble counter-tops, a flat screen tv, a 2 person shower in the master and a stocked kitchen that even included a spice rack. Something that I wasn't expecting at all. We rented this directly with the property so it also included daily maid service. We used the Entertainment Book to get a discount of 50% and that just made this place even better. We had breakfast most mornings on the lanai and walks on the beach afterwards. As has been mentioned before, the beach directly in front is not a swimming beach. However, that didn't detract from it's beauty at all. We just walked south about 150 yards and there was a nice sandy entry. We also snorkeled out there and saw lots of fish. Since this property is all oceanfront, going to sleep with the sound of the waves was wonderful. The other bedroom faces the mountains and also had a wonderful view. We often saw rainbows out the back windows in the late afternoon. All of the staff that we encountered were very pleasant and they called a couple of times during our stay to make sure everything was going well. We weren't looking for a big resort with lots of activites. This is a nice quiet place with a nice pool and BBQ grills to prepare dinner with, should you want to. The whole area this condo is in is very convenient. The Star Market across the street had everything you would need in the way of groceries. There are also lots of places close by for dining and shopping and Lahaina is only 10 minutes away. We had a wonderfully relaxing family vacation that included hitting the highlights of Maui with enough down time at the condo to really relax.

Mahana unit 307 exceeded our expectations! From location, to design of the unit, to the furnishings, it was absolutely wonderful. I dealt directly with the owner, Jan Buckmaster ([--]). Jan was great to deal with, and really made us feel like welcomed guests. (She even added a muffin pan to the unit when I had inquired as to whether or not it had one.) While dealing directly with the owner kept the cost lower, the reason I ended up going that route was because I wanted to know the particulars about the unit we were renting. (When attempting to book through a management service or an agent for this or other properties, I had difficulty finding out how the unit was furnished). This unit has a king-size bed, with both the bedroom and the living room ocean-front, with a connecting private balcony (lanai) with table and chairs. Most properties other than the Mahana seem to have the bedroom away from the ocean, which would not have allowed me to enjoy the sound of the surf from bed. The view was amazing, with palm trees just out the window (off of the balcony) and two sister islands in the background. Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch the best possible sunsets (because of cloud cover on the horizon), the sunsets were still quite enjoyable. The unit was well furnished, including 2 beach chairs (although they could use upgrading) and coolers. The building complex was very nice as well. The biggest negative (other than the fact that we had to leave) was that the beach is not a good swimming beach, because of rock and coral. But, we were aware of this upfront. And, there is probably a plus side to this in that there were no crowds and there really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any noise. Although not good for swimming, it is a sandy beach that I found okay for some barefoot runs. (Not an extremely long beach - I estimate that the running / walking beach is about 1 \u00c2\u00bd miles long, or 3 miles for a round trip). We found the location to be very convenient. We really liked the Old Lahania Luau (lots of good food, and first-class treatment), only about 10 minutes away. We also enjoyed the trip to Hana and beyond. We thought the sunrise bike tour down Haleakala was overrated. If we were to do it again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d drive up to see the sunrise, but skip the biking down.

I had higher hopes for this place after reading the reviews. I saw that the condos varied so after booking, I called and requested a room on a higher floor, with a king bed, and updated. We got a room on the 12th floor and the view was stunning however we weren't happy with the condo. The furniture and bedding looked somewhat new but the rest of the place was really outdated. The king bed was actually 2 twin beds put together. I hate that!!! So we requested a different room with a true king bed and updated. We were given room 414. This was better but still not what we hoped for. The kitchen, shower, and bathroom sink all looked newly updated and very nice however for some reason they didn't finish updating the rest of the place. The tile throughout was an old baby blue and did not look good. The furniture was older with a big tear in the couch and the bedspread looked to be at least 20 years old. I'm not one to typically complain so we just decided it was good enough. The view really was amazing. There were floor to ceiling windows in the bedroom and living room and as others have said I don't think there is another place this close the water. The only other problem we had were with some bugs in the kitchen. They had a note on the counter that warned of this and said to keep all food tightly closed. We thought we did but came home one day to find a ton of bugs all over the counter. We cleaned it all up and threw out some of the food and only had few more bugs throughout the rest of our stay. The beach is not swimmable but they have lounge chairs in the grass along the beach to relax. We saw a few whales from there. The pool was nothing special but it was nice to be able to cool off in there. It was very windy. The pool is between the two towers of the condos and it seems to create a wind tunnel. There is a beach 150 yards on each side of the condos. My husband said the snorkeling was pretty good there. There is also shuffleboard by the pool which we enjoyed.

After a 50 min drive, that was really awesome ,I was glad to see the Mahana, pictures just don't serve this place justice ... Checked in, no problem, staff were real nice and pleasant. Lobby was nice and grounds too, alot of beautiful flowers/plants at entrance.. Was orginally given room 213, asked for a higher floor room, and was given Studio room 513, wanted a higher view then 213. Room was nice, standard room, except for alot more extas, fridge wash/dryer, stove, microwave, ect... The carpet was a little worn, with some stains, defenitly needed replaced, however this didn't bother us, we come to expect this from alot of Beach ocean front rooms, kind of hard to keep carpet like new.. Maid service everyday kept the room nice and clean..Now the best part of the room, \"THE VIEW\", Words can't describe the view from this room, it was picture perfect! Palm trees, ocean, and beach, just great view, at fraction of the cost you would pay for at the resorts just a little up the beach.. All rooms are OCEAN FRONT, not view or partical, but right on the Ocean! We checked out most of the resorts in this area, by far the best views out of all the reorts and hotels, the only one that had a closer one was the Maui kai, but hotel, looked out dated to us, plus alot of the rooms there did not have the lanais. The pool was ok, didn't use it, too busy at the beach, would have like to have a hot tub though... The beach infront of the mahana has alot of rocks/coral in the water, not good to swim in, but great for snorkal, however if you don't like to snorkal, if you walk either way a few minutes, you'll find better swim areas. This beach is a great walking beach, about a 15-20 min walk to black rock, saw alot of sea life just walking the beach, water is really clear and warm.. There was very few people out on this beach, which was perfect for us, very romatic, and peaceful. Wife an I tried to conquer the road to Hana, Unfortunally, it conquered us, wife got really sick, alot of turns on this road/narrow, got to mile 18 and turned around, the water falls/sceenery we saw were really beautiful though, especially the 200 ft water fall(forget what mile marker/ see maui reveal book). Defenitly worth the trip, if you have a strong stomach, for the drive. Ate at several restaurants, Aloha Mixed Plate(local food(alot for $, decent taste/price), Bubba Gump,(same as all bubba gumps only better view), Hula Grill ( seafood was ok , nice location, price was adverage for location), Kool Cats( great Hamburger, best I ever had, decent $, worth the stop), Kimo's( seafood good food, great location, decent $$), PIONEER INN (only ate breakfast here, good decent $), Rusty Harpoon, (nice location, got the prime rib specials, good decent $) Ruths steakhouse(excellent steak, too much money though, went on our anniversary 6th may). MOOSE MCGILLYCUDDY'S(nasty hamburgers, wife liked the pork tacos, I loved there onion rings), soup kitchen by Mahana(over priced, food was ok, no view at all, decor was intersting though). Sunrise Cafe(breakfast only, little place, food was ok good $) also ate at the Embassy and K. shores next to Mahana, both were good, K shores, has some killer seafood linguine. Of course we had to drink our Lava flows. Also had to go to the grocery store right across the street from the Mahana and get some POG, great drink, really good! All in all, I really enjoyed the Mahana, and recondmend it to anyone that wants a nice loacation/decent price for Maui, close to most activities, don't like to be around alot of crowds, romance, and Outstanding views/best in area, we hope to be back soon..

Advice: Don't over buy food for the condo. Try Cheese Burger in Paradise. Don't buy pearls in Maui, they are very low quality. Check your gas tank before you venture up to Haleakala.

The two bathrooms were also redone with all new fixtures, travertine floors and walls. The bedroom's bath was a walk in shower with two large shower heads. Wonderful! We did find the bed too firm for our backs. The views were great and it was fun to spot the few remaining whales of season splashing their tails and sounding. Breakfast on the Lanai became a morning ritual and a Honolulu Star newspaper is delivered to your room every morning as well. We did have an opportunity to inspect some other rooms and it should be noted that not all the rooms at the Mahana have been renovated by their owners. You might want to see the room before checking in. The staff was very friendly and our housekeeper always had our room done before 10:00am. The bath towels were large and soft and the lotions/shampoo/soaps were high quality. It was extremely windy for the 1st part of our stay and the Monkey Pod trees did shower down their pods in the parking lot and were sticky but this is Hawaii. We did see the grounds keeper sweeping and hosing things down. We had booked the 2 for 1 Luau package and went to the Hyatt Regency Luau down the road. We had been to several Luaus over the years and this one was sure not worth the $91 we paid.

It was great. The view was unbeatable - a whole wall in our living room and another wall in our bedroom were windows, and we had a great balcony with a table and chairs. On our first morning there, we woke up to the sound of the waves, and saw a seal, spinner dolphins and whales within 20 minutes of each other. That alone made our stay there more than worthwhile. If we'd have known what to expect, we might have packed a little differently. We knew we'd have a kitchen and that Maui is expensive, so we brought a few things to eat (bagels, snacks, etc.). We also brought a lot of clothes, and found that we had a washer and dryer in our suite. If we'd have realized we'd have free, convenient laundry and that the groceries at the Star Market across the street literally cost four times what we pay at home, we probably would have packed fewer clothes, a small box of laundry detergent and more groceries. I definitely recommend staying someplace with a little kitchen if you are in Maui on a budget and/or don't want to have to eat out every time you're hungry (I am pregnant though, so not only do I eat a lot, I'm very concerned about where my next meal's coming from and don't want to scout something out and wait for it every time I'm hungry!). We had a lot of exhausting days in the water and sun, so it was nice to be able to come home, throw together a sandwich and hit the sack. Also, it made packing a lunch to take to the beach or on the Road to Hana drive easier than having to stop to pick up sandwiches somewhere. For what we paid for the room, we thought the Mahana was great. Honestly, I wouldn't have wanted to stay in the more upscale, more corporate hotels/areas (like around Whaler's Village). I thought the Mahana had character and the people who worked there were very nice. It is very windy in that area, but it wasn't a problem for us. On a side note, we worked with our jet lag and got up very early in the morning. It was a good move. We wanted to do a lot of snorkeling and because of the wind, it's better to do it early in the day anyway. The only thing we didn't love at the Mahana was that the pool area is small and kind of boring (it is clean and perfectly fine for a quick dip though), so we went to the pool at the hotel next door. The shuffleboard at the Mahana is fun. The other thing I'll do differently if I go back to Maui again is I will spend a night over in Hana to break up the Road to Hana drive, have more time to check out more of that side of the island, do one of the longer hikes at Oheo Gulch and get a break from touristy West Maui.", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hinsdale,NY", "Title": "\u201cThe best vacation we have ever had.\u201d", "Author": "Michien", "ReviewID": "UR7344809", "Content": "We stayed at the Mahana from March 24 through March 30, 2007.

The only disappointing thing that happened was are fight between HNL and Maui. We always have flown Island Air into the West Maui (JHM) airport because of convenience. Our flight was cancelled two hours after it was supposed to depart. The agents kept giving us conflicting information \"it's in the air\", it's in the hanger\", \"it's landing shortly\", etc. After two hours we decided we'd book through GO Airlines ($29 ea) and cancel Island Air. When we told them to retrieve our luggage they announced we were being transferred to Aloha Airlines that would land in Kahului (OGG). They supposedly gave everyone shuttle vouchers but we declined and said we'd make our own arrangements. Then came the next problem, our car was scheduled for pickup in Kaanapali and Budget refused to transfer the rental agreement to Kahului at the same price. They wanted to charge us $600 for a week! So, we took our chances and booked through Alamo upon arrival. On to better parts of the trip.... We have been to Maui and the other Hawaiian Islands many, many times but this was our first attempt at renting a condo directly through the owner ([--]). Our unit was on the 10th floor and the views were fabulous. The owner was a joy to work with and everything in the condo was exacty as pictured on the website and as promised. The unit was a little on the small side..more like a large hotel room, but this was a studio so it's what we expected. Next time I think I'd like the extra elbow room and go for a 1-bedroom. We loved watching the whales from dawn to dusk and sometimes we didn't even need binoculars to view them as they were just that close. We watched two kayaks get within 20 feet of a a mom and baby whale, then they got out of the boat and tried to swim with them. That was amazing! We loved going to The Fish Market which is about a half mile away. We bought fresh fish which they seasoned for us, put it in the pan and all we had to do was bake it. It was the best ever. And, they have great Ono Burgers there too which we ate twice during our stay. They're large enough for two.

We loved falling asleep to the sound of the waves crashing, being able to cook some of our own meals and snacks, eating out on the lanai, whale watching from the living room, and having a DVD player in the condo when we just felt like staying in. I know a few people have complained about not having a swimming beach right in front of the property, but we found this to be an advantage. It was nice and quiet and the beach was never crowded because people have to go farther down to swim or snorkel. To us it was perfect! We loved the location of the Mahana as well. Very close to Whalers Village & Front Street in Lahaina. It was nice not having to drive very far to do the things we wanted.

Front Street in Lahahina town was a neat place to shop and grab something to eat. The Old Lahahina Luau is something to see, but book it before you leave. The Road to Hana was incredible. If you get the cd for the Road to Hana, it is very helpful on finding things to see and the waterfalls. Wear good shoes. I was not warned of this and only had flip flops with me, which as we were climbing to a waterfall, I slipped and fell. The next time we go to Maui, which will be next year, we are doing the Road to Hana again, but this time staying in Hana, so we don't feel rushed in having to see everything quickly. There are lots and lots of turns and curves, so if you get carsick, i would recommend taking some kind of medicine. We also did snuba while we were there on a boat called Maui Magic and this was a ton of fun. We saw a ton of dolphins, whales and sea turtles. We were in Oahu in February 2006 and loved it, but we loved Maui even more and could relax and enjoy ourselves as it wasn't as fast paced.

We were taken aback with our unit (#709): a corner unit with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, and it was absolutely gorgeous! Marble flooring, granite counters, cherry cabinets, tastefully decorated, etc. There was plenty of room for the 5 of us and we felt very comfortable there. The oceanfront view was breathtaking, and it was so relaxing to enjoy the view from the lanai that spanned the width of both the living room and the master bedroom. The lanai had a table and chairs, loveseat and armchair, with plenty of space leftover. We cooked several meals in the condo, and the kitchen was roomy enough and very well stocked. I'm very picky about the cleanliness of hotel rooms, etc. and our unit was spotless. The daily maid service to make beds and provide fresh towels was greatly appreciated. We also enjoyed the tennis courts. Walking 10 minutes took you to a little strip shopping center that housed Java Jazz -- a cozy little coffe shop with eclectic decor -- a great place to have a cup of coffee and maybe a baked good. I bought some cookies that the counter clerk said were baked that morning by her mother -- you can't find that at franchise coffee shops! The location of the Mahana was great: just a 10 minute drive to downtown Lahaina. We had a rental car for the week, and took day trips to Haleakala and Makawao. We also did the Road to Hana, but spent the nite (our last nite in Maui) in Hana -- which we would highly recommend. It would've been too much time in the car doing the round trip in one day. We loved our week in Maui and would definitely stay at the Mahana again.

The problem with using a company that manages condos is that the room decor and upkeep differs on the owners of the condo. The condo we stayed at was on the 8th floor and was just the right size for my husband and I. The decor and upkeep of the condo itself was not great. The decor was dated and the maintenance wasn't the best. One of the kitchen cabinet doors kept falling off, the shower stall had some mold growth and a sheet was covering one of the windows. The view was hard to beat, though. We were right on the ocean and could listen to the waves at night. We could see Lanai and Molokai from our room. The beach area in front of the hotel is nice, but you have to walk about 100 yds in either direction to be able to avoid the reefs. While the restaurants were very easy to get in and out of in December, there were some strong trade winds. It was windy all but one out of 6 days that we were there. We lost power one day to the wind gusts and were not able to take a snorkeling trip. We did get to go ziplining, which was fun and drove the road to Hana which we would also recommend. Some great restaurants to try were Kimono's and Roy's. My husband and I have been to Maui, Oahu and Kauai and Kauai wins hands down. For anyone heading to Hawaii, we would recommend going to Kauai versus any other island. The island is quiet, not a lot of traffic and tons of things to do. If you enjoy nature, there are tons of things to see and do, without wearing yourself out sightseeing.

The living area boasted a sofa and loveseat, coffee table and end tables, and an entertainment center with flat-screen TV, DVD player, and a bookshelf stereo system with cd changer. Not to mention floor-to-ceiling windows with a unbelievable view.

The bedroom and living room shared access to the lanai, with a lounge chair, and a table with two chairs. We ate all of our breakfasts and most dinners on the lanai, and we viewed most of the sunsets as well. I miss that lanai! The air conditioner struggled to cool the place, but we spent most of the time with the sliders open listening to the ocean, and the two ceiling fans cooled the unit off quickly once the sun went down.

We appreciated the fact that the front desk was manned 24 hours a day, allowing us to experience a friendly check-in. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful.

If you ever feel like you need to be around more people or fancy a change of scenery you can always walk over to the Embassy and sit around their pool as we did on a couple of occasions. On the evening you have the option to take the pleasant walk over to the Embassy and Kaanapali Shores for a meal or a few drinks and Whalers village is only a 5 minute car journey away and Lahaina 10 minutes away. This makes the location perfect if you a couple on honeymoon or just there to relax and you are only a short distance away if you wish to be amongst the crowds.

Had to stand in line for over and hour, and they to be seated at huge tables and then have to stand right up again and stand in line for the grossest food you will ever eat. We did eat at a couple of great restaurants that I would recommend, one being Longhi's in Lahaina, and Cilantro's in Lahaina (mexican fast food - but very good) and Lelaini's in Whaler's VIllage. We also did a snorkeling tour out to Molokini - I highly recommend this. Hopefully this review will help someone save their money for something more exciting!! The Luau cost us $170 and we were in line most of the night. The dancers were amazing but they only danced for about 20 mins half and hour. They have free shows around so watch for them if you just want to see the dancing.

After reading more reviews than I care to remember, the one place that kept popping up to the top of the deck was the Mahana. As others have said, the Mahana is not a fancy five-star resort like the Westin, Maui Prince or the Grand Wailea, and all I can say is thank goodness for that! If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for, keep looking, because this place is probably not for you. However, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a relaxing condo with all the amenities of home and a view to die for, keep reading. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a fancy pool with waterfall jacuzzis and water slides or any on site restaurants. For swimming laps or just jumping in to cool off, the Mahana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gets the job done. And it does have a tennis court, but none of ever tried it out. We booked two rooms; one for us geezers, one for our three kids, all over 21. But looking back, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident a two bedroom would have handled all of us with no trouble. I called the facility about a week before our trip and asked them if they could put us on one of the higher floors, and they delivered; booking us in rooms 1116 and 1118 in the Lanai tower. The places were unbelievable. I had read some reviews about some condos having funky outdated furniture, but 1116 is amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has granite counter tops, an entertainment center with a great selection of music -- from Hawaiian to jazz, (OK it was on cassette instead of CD, but big deal), updated appliances, including a stackable washer and dryer, dishwasher, coffee maker, blender, new fridge and even a George Foreman Grill. The king size bed was big enough to get lost in, and the free wi-fi worked without a problem. The first thing you see in every room is the ocean. There are floor to ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom and sliding doors from either room that lead out to the lanai, and make for outstanding views. The island of Lanai is on your left, Molokai to the right. I dare you to find anyplace closer to the ocean on Maui than the Mahana, short of camping on the beach. Other people have mentioned the lack of swimming directly in front of the facility, but there are places to the north and south. The snorkeling is amazing. The water is clear and the fish are plentiful. We even followed a couple of huge sea turtles. From our rooms we could see fish playing in the coral directly below us. And the sunsets were out of this world. I probably took at least 100 pictures of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all from the comfort of the lanai. Since the wind blows A LOT on Maui, keeping the sliding doors open gives you a nice breeze that helps cool things down, especially in the morning and after sunset. We slept with the sliding doors open every night and the soothing sounds of the waves crashing on the beach helped put us to sleep. The A/C shuts down automatically whenever the sliding doors are open. Just remember not to have the sliding doors and front door open at the same time. The result is a nasty wind tunnel effect that can blow things off the wall and wreak other havoc in the condo. The concierge is staffed by an outside company, so the people behind the desk rotate between the various hotels on the island. We dealt with a very nice and helpful woman, who set us up with good deals for parasailing with UFO and kayak rentals at Dig Me Beach. For renting snorkel gear, Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. We stocked up on groceries at the Star Market across the street and had breakfast and at least one other meal every day in the condo during our stay. We also found a cooler in the front closet, and filled it with beverages, fruit, sandwiches and ice from the ice maker for the Road to Hana drive. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely the way to go. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an ABC Store just a couple of blocks north. I think they sell gas, too, but I could be mistaken. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it all the way around the southern end of the island, stop at Charley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Paia on the way back for dinner. Speaking of restaurants, the one place I would not recommend is the Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina. I hate slamming anything in Maui, because we had a truly magnificent time. But the place is understaffed, the service is slow, and the food, while some of it was tasty, was cold and stringy by the time it arrived.

Just got back from Maui and couldn't wait to write a review of the Mahana. We were originally booked in a suite, but, after a day, we decided to ask for a 1 bedroom. They were able to let us see 2 rooms. One was pretty funky with alot of dolphin tiles, etc so opted not to use that one. However, when we opened the door to the second one, WOW, that was it. It was unbelievable. One of the newer renovated condo's. The owners have incredible taste in furnishings and decor. Beautiful granite countertops in the kitchen that complimented the cherry wood. It was supplied with everthing you needed. I loved cooking in there and serving breakfast/dinner out on the lani. The bed was so soft and comfortable and it was so nice to wake up to the view and the waves of the ocean. We saw lots of rainbow's from the lani and fed the birds bread. Watch out, they are not shy. The condo was wonderful to come home to after a full day. The pool was quiet and nice, the beach not good for swimming, but walk in either direction and it was fine. We took advantage of the Embassy buffet a couple of times. Great omlettes and POG juice. The staff was friendly enough but didn't really go out of their way. We had to ask to have our room cleaned one day as it had not been cleaned and here it was 4:30 in the afternoon. I would recommend the Mahana for those looking for relaxation and quiet. If you are looking for entertanment, crowds, etc. you can drive to Whaler's Village where all the resorts/resaturants are or Lahania. Go to Kapalua Bay for great snorkleing and less crowded beaches. There is even a free parking lot if you get there early enough. We rented snorkel gear and boogie boards from Boss Frog's. Lahania best for shopping and eating. Cheeseburger in Paradise has great breakfast and views. Other restaurant's recommended would be Kimo's, Leilani's, and Pacific O's. Ate fish as much as we could while we were there. Up the street from the Mahana is a little farmer's market. This lady there is very nice and her fruits and veggies are so sweet. Worth taking alittle walk. I would say stay away from the Star Market across the street as the prices are extremely high. Go to Safeway or Long's. Definitely take the Road to Hana. Start out early in the morning. CD was worth purchasing as it described everything as you drove along. Yes, it is a long day, but the views are incredible and waterfalls were all over. I took dramimine as I had read there were alot of turns and people getting sick, but really, it was not as bad as I thought. You go slow, stop when you want so not bad. We took a turn on some road and wound up at a beautiful beach with a handful of people and a local selling fruits and she had just make banana bread which was still warm - it was delicious. We had an 11:00PM flight back and were not able to book a late check out so we booked ourselves into the Pioneer Inn in Lahania for the day. We checked in at noon, went to the beach, shopped, rested, showered, had some dinner and left for the airport around 8:30. It was perfect. I would definitely recommend doing that. Didn't have to worry about luggage and it was a great beach day. Had a beautiful full moon driving to the airport.

I asked if we could have a king size unit instead. The front desk quickly gave me 2 room keys so I could make my choice (very nice of them). I opted for room 703 (granite countertops in kitchen, updated throughout, tiled shower, new toilet, mirrored side wall) It was perfect. I thought being at the end of the elevators was going to be noisy, but the doors are thick or something. Never heard any noises( which is a plus for me). I liked having the kitchen in there because we made breakfast in the morning and sat out on the balcony listening to the waves, feeding the birds bread, and watching the sailboats. We did a few loads of laundry in the stackable washer/dryer. If you want to snorkel, go rent some gear at Kaanapali Shores Resort and snorkel by Black Rock ( can get crowded there though). Be careful walking in the sand..I was stung by a bee who was buried in the sand. I have to say, waking up to the sound of the waves crashing is the best way to wake up. Our view was spectacular!

Well, this year marked mine and my wife's 25th anniversary so what better way to celebrate than to return to our favorite vacation paradise. We booked a 1 BR this time since the kids weren't with us. When we arrived, we were placed in 1005. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was a 2 bath condo. The condo was beautifully decorated. The cabinets and carpet both looked like they had recently been replaced. The kingsize bed had a fantastic mattress, even better than ours at home. Of course, the view was spectacular. That was the primary reason we returned. Everything worked as it should and the only two times I went to the front desk was to check in and check out. I can't imagine there being a better place to stay on Maui. We drove down to Walea but much prefer the Ka'anapali area. If you walk down the beach towards Black Rock from the Mahana, there is one of the most beautiful, uncrowded beaches on the island. If you are interested in a quiet, tropical atmosphere and amazing views from your room, the Mahana is the place to be. Who cares that it doesn't have a bar or restaurant. There are so many wonderful places to eat within a 10 minute drive from the Mahana. As for alcohol, we purchase a bottle of rum and mixers and blend up our own daiquiris and mai tai's. A typical day for us would be to have breakfast in the condo, go find a beach to enjoy in the morning, come back and have lunch in the condo, then lay out in the grassy area between the buildings and the beach and drink frozen drinks, read, etc.... For dinner, we always went out to a restaurant and never had a disappointing meal. Our favorite meals though were Mama's Fish House (most amazing atmosphere and best fish preparation), Canoes (I can't understand why more people don't eat here!), Ruth's Chris Steak House (best Filet Mignon I have ever put in my mouth), and Leilani's on the Beach. We also enjoyed Bubba Gump and Lahaina Fish Co... Of course, in addition to hitting the beaches, we also drove to Hana and visited the Io State Park. We love staying in a condo versus motel because of the full kitchen and washer/dryer. It really cuts down on packing when you can wash your clothes. It also saves some cash and calories since you don't have to eat at a restaurant for every meal. I have no complaints about our stay whatsover.

When we first opened the door to our unit, we were a little freaked out by the 80's \"wicker\" decor, but after an hour or two, it became our home away from home. We can't wait to go back. - The Unit: Like I said, the decor is a bit out of date, but other than that, the unit was fantastic. Huge shower, stackable washer/dryer, huge lanai overlooking the ocean, living room with entertainment center, sofa, and dining table, and best of all, the BEST VIEW ON THE ISLAND. This property literally backs to the beach. - The Property: High speed wireless internet made emailing pictures super convenient. The pool is kind of small, but there are beach chairs all around the building, so there's always somewhere to get some sun. Because of it's proximity to the western high country, the tradewinds can be very strong, so keep this in mind when planning on laying out at their pool. It can get very windy. - The Beach: Very rocky and mostly reef. The beach itself is great for putting on your mask and fins for snorkeling, but that's about it. The snorkeling in front of the Mahana is fantastic though...don't skip it for some of the others up north. If you want a beach with easy (swimming) ocean access, go north or south 1/2 mile. - The Location: There's a Star Market, dive shop, and a handful of restaurants directly across the street. It's also close to Old Lahaina and Kapalua Beach, which are must visits. Great location, if you're the \"touristy\" type, or more the \"off-the-beaten-path\" type. There are spots around for both types of travelers - The Service: We were greeted and lei'd on arrival and given keys to our unit. The front desk folks were always very accommodating and friendly. No complaints at all. - Our Complaints We're non-smokers, and the Mahana rooms are all non-smoking. (They even make you sign a waiver saying you won't smoke in the room) However, people go onto their lanai to smoke, and the smoke drifts over to your lanai and through your screen door.

We stayed at the Mahana in October 2005, but wanted to add my experience to this site. We stayed for 5 nights mid October in a one bedroom on the 12th floor. I read many great things from other people about the Mahana and almost everything is true. I would recommend to rent from a private owner to save money and to know in advance the accommodations you are receiving. We paid $150 a night for a well kept, clean and nicely decorated condo. All Mahana condos guarantee an ocean view and beach front(no partial view, beachfront, etc.) I don't believe any other condo in the area offers floor to ceiling windows in the rooms offering a spectacular view. We actually felt like we were on a cruise ship when looking out the window, seeing nothing by blue ocean. Both the bedroom and living room offer a full sliding glass door accessing the lanai. The floorplans are smart (over 900 square feet for the one bedroom). It is true the beach immediately in front is rocky, but if you walk a couple of hundred yards you have sandy beach. We walked both north and south of the Mahana on the beach each morning. There were not many children during our stay which was great for us for a romantic honeymoon. We only used the pool once, but it was clean and just large enough. There is a mini mall within walking distance with a market, great pizza and mexican food. We actually got take out twice and ate on our lanai. Our kitchen was fully stocked with cookware, plates, glasses and dishwashing supplies. The building and the grounds were clean and well kept. We saw facility crews actually cleaning and maintaining the grounds every day. The parking lot was quite full, but not too far to walk to the elevators. The location is right next to the Maui Kai and Embassy Suites. Just a short drive to the other large resorts and restaurants. We enjoyed the fact that we could enjoy the shopping, restaurants and amenities nearby, but not pay the resort price. We had a rental car and would recommend it if you are planning to do a lot of activies in other cities (golf, dining or the road to Hana).

Have been to Maui about a dozen times, but this was first time in a condo. Nice, but.... Place was nice enough, but don't expect much in the way of facilities. No restaurant (yes, others mention walking to nearby places, but they aren't REAL restaurants -- more like pizza shops and fast food), you can't swim at the beach (must walk a distance and still have no facilities like chairs), and the pool is tiny for the number of units there and it's mostly in shade for the better part of the day. Parking (as others have mentioned)can be a real pain, especially when you come home in the evening. We also were hassled when we asked for 2 beach towels per person. We were told at the front desk that their policy is \"1 towel per person\". I guess they never heard of anyone wanting 1 for the chair and 1 for their body! With all that said, yes, the unit was very nice (furniture looked nice, but not the most comfortable) and the views were terrific. Pricing was certainly competitive. Be aware, though, if this is your first trip to Maui and you're looking for something very special, you might want to reconsider the Mahana, or a condo for that matter. You certainly do not get that same \"tropical resort\" experience as when you stay at a hotel. Hotels have restaurants, lounge areas to sit and listen to music or have a drink or even just listen to the ocean. Hotels (most of them anyway) have beaches you can actually swim in and pools that aren't nestled in between buildings and shaded most of the day. At a hotel, (unlike a condo) you also can treat yourself to a Mai Tai or Blue Hawaii poolside. It's also nice to be able to treat yourself to breakfast on the property if you're so inclined. If, on the other hand, you're just looking for an inexpensive option to a resort/hotel and aren't too concerned about the lack of facilities or extras, the Mahana is certainly fine and probably better than many.", "Date": "February 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "soxgal78", "ReviewID": "UR4449258", "Content": "I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers who described the Mahana as a great base for your Hawaiian vacation.

We weren't bothered by the construction, even though it was being done in our building (the Molokai tower) - probably because we were up and out early most days. If you like sleeping in, I could see how it might be disturbing. We were in room #203 -- a recently renovated studio with a murphy bed. Not tons of room, but plenty for the two of us, and all new appliances and counters in the kitchen made it a little more fun to eat in (which we did, often -- we used the grills downstairs too). The pool is smaller than the resort-like one next door at the Embassy Suites, but it suited us just fine -- there was hardly anyone ever in it! We spent some time at it, or in it, almost every afternoon. (Though the palm trees tend to shade it as the day goes on.) The beach in front of the Mahana is great for walks, and just a 10-minute walk toward Black Rock brings you to a good swimming/snorkeling beach. It's about a 5-10 minute drive to Kaanapali and Lahaina, and another 10 minutes or so north to Napili/Kapalua, which made it a great location. A couple other pluses: Star Market and a Maui Dive Shop in the shopping center across the street, ABC store a 5-minute walk away, and a couple of farmers' markets nearby on Lower Honopiilani Road. By far, the best thing about the Mahana was the view, though....breathtaking sunsets, and we could see the whales playing from our lanai!

The Mahana is very quiet and not \"busy\" like some of the other beach area hotel areas. The pool is nice, and warm and was not crowded. BBQ's allow you to cook out right near the pool. There is a market across the street (about a 10 minute walk), or there is a Safeway up the street toward Lahaina.

We had unlimited ice, laundry detergent, dish detergent, dishwasher detergent, plates, soap, shampoo, lotions, etc. all provided. We immediately did a load of clothes and turned off the AC to sit outside on the lanai. Every night was a different sunset - pinks and golds, clouds and rainbows. I never heard one sound from the surrounding units or from outside. The staff were the most friendly and accommodating I've ever encountered. One of them actually took the time to get a map and show us a restaurant he takes his family to for breakfast (the Gazebo -- and it was wonderful, also -- topped off the only sea turtle I've ever seen in the wild!!). The maid was thorough and sweet. Our room was spacious and we did not see any bugs (another fear I had). The bed was a queen with the softest sheets and nice, fluffy pillows, and we ate every meal on the lanai.

We are a retired couple married 42 years. Owners had only recently renovated and upgraded the studio aparment. It appeared that only about 4 or 5 previous guests/families had occupied this unit since it was renovated. Everything was very nice! It had everything we needed from the range/oven, dishwasher, refrigerator (ice maker too!), washer/dryer, television, VCR, AC, King size bed, etc. etc. Just like a real home. Daily maid service was great too providing fresh towels and guest supplies like a regular hotel. Only difference was that complete changing of bedsheets was done only every 4 days...no big deal. The unit/room was perfect. The outside hallways, lobby, gardens, pool area etal were excellently maintained. Everyday someone was picking weeds, trimming bushes, etc. And then comes the beach.. Short wading distance on this beach due to low underwater rocks about 30-40 feet out. But it looks just like all of Kaanapali beaches...lovely! Walk 100 yards right or left and you'll find plenty of fine places to walk, sit, swim the surf without those rocks. Watching those sunsets nightly from the lanai got us some great pictures. I even got \"moonlight\" (it was full moon on several nights) on the water pictures. Get ready for the sound of crashing surf..all night long! As many other reviewers have pointed out...you are 10 minutes walking distance from a major large grocery store (Star Market) and a 10 minute or less walk to restaurants at either the Embassy Vacation Suites (a timeshare and a BIG one!) or ResortQuests Kaanapali Shores. The entire area is condominium after condominium and all seem in good repair. Some construction re-facing the Mahana oceanside walls is continuing. We were in the building which was not being done during our visit. Be sure to ask for a unit not near the construction. They could be a little noisy. All in all this is a great place to stay during a visit to Maui. Prices are reasonable based on a really \"overpriced\" Island of Maui. I guess you've got to pay for paradise, huh? Just a quick footnote...you might wonder just what one of these units at the Mahana might sell for. I am a retired Realtor. During our stay one Mahana 2 bedroom unit was having an open house. We made the visit. Asking price for 1300 sq. ft.= $1,950,000. I asked the Realtor how much a one room studio would sell for (if one were available...Not!) . Answer: Approximately $650,000. Remember this is a 100% beachfront condominium. I think we'll just rent through ResortQuest Thank You! I could ramble on more but I think it best that YOU go and find out for yourself knowing that The Mahana has this couples' 5 star rating.

First off, the management does read and respond to these reviews, as we found out. I've read a few reviews from unhappy vacationers that the management responded to, so I thought the vacationers were a rare exception to a usually nice stay. Well, I found out I was way wrong. My wife and I came here for part of our honeymoon - 4 beautiful nights in Maui. Maui was great, but this hotel was horrible - from the rooms, to the management. The management even lied to us. Let's start with our first night there. They knew we were on our honeymoon, yet the management decided to put us in a room where they pushed 2 twin beds together to make a king size. My wife slept about 2 hours that night because she kept falling in the crack. This crack was in addition to the horrible creaking from the headboard that maintence said \"there's nothing that they can do to fix\". So, the next morning, we switched rooms. Don't get me worng, the views from these rooms were amazing...but not worth this hastle. When we went to the front desk, they blamed our travel agent on them giving us this room because \"they can't guarantee a certain room\". They knew we were on our honeymoon. Why would you push 2 twin beds together for honeymooners? Our next room, was the same room type (a studio) and it was enough. The rooms had everything we needed, but....they were remodeling the room next to us. It wasn't the noise...we went snorkeling in the morning of our last full day there and we were going to a luau that night. We wanted to come back to the room to relax between the events. That must of been our mistake. They were painting the room next to us and the fumes were coming right into our room. Right into it. I called down to the front desk and they simply told me to open the door on the lanai. Brilliant solution as the odor got worse. My wife and I got raging headaches from the fumes. I called the front desk again - keep in mind that their only solution to this was to open our patio door. This time, they told us they would call up tp the next room. 20 minutes later, I call the front desk again. What's going on? Well, nobody in that room answered - SO THEY DID NOTHING ELSE. We wanted to take a nap and relax but we couldn't because the paint fumes were so bad that they guy doing the painting had to leave the room every 5 minutes. We went to the front desk and they told us that there was nothing they could do because they can't stop people from remodeling their condos. How can there be nothing for them to do? Finally, after arguing with the front desk for 15 more minutes, they finally got the manager to call back. My wife talked to the manager and they finally reached an agreement - they would move us - into our 3rd room in 3 nights so far - and comp us the room on our last night if we stayed there our last night. So that's what we did because we didn't have much more time to relax before our luau. Well, half an hour into our relaxing, the manager calls up to our room and asks us if we've found a new hotel yet. What about our agreement? She also blamed us for opening the door to the lanai to air out the room as her front desk attendant told us to do. Well, she refused to comp us the room or do anything else for us. We were both furious. They lied to us. My favorite thing about the place was when we left. If you're remodeling every single room in the place, why not do it a floor at a time? Oh, and by the way, the reason the paint fumes were so bad in our room (I found this out on the way up to our next room) is because they were painting right outside our air intake for the AC. In short, don't read the management responses - they lie. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, and they ruined 2 nights and a day of our honeymoon. Their front desk staff was horrible with customer service. They call to the room that is being remodeled because my wife is high on paint fumes and do nothing else? We have 3 rooms on our 4 night stay and they don't offer to comp us. Oh, and we had to fill out more paperwork with them when we checked in than we did when we got our marriage license.

It is quite beautiful to sit on your lanai each evening and watch sunsets. The rooms are each different, thus some rooms are very nice and some need refurbishment. In general though, the rooms are quite comfortable and with a tropical feel. Beware of ONGOING DAILY (except weekends) CONSTRUCTION in the south building. We originally had a studio in this building that was very, very lovely (view of the tops of palm trees, the beach, and ocean; with granite countertops, new appliances, ice maker, comfortable queen bed, and lovely rock-tiled shower)---yet beginning on Monday morning, hammering and saw-sounding shrieks began. The staff will tell you this will only last in the morning. However, the workers arrive at 8 a.m. and get on the several scaffolds attached to the building and for the first hour, do quiet work (e.g., painting) and then beginning at 9 a.m. very loud construction noises may reverberate through your condo (depending on your location---reverberated through ours to the point that we left our condo early). If you privately rent a condo, then you have to deal with the owner, to see if you can make other arrangements (and I'm not sure the outcome; a guy was at the front desk trying to figure this out, since he was in the middle of construction too). If you make arrangements not through a private owner, you may be able to switch to the north building (which is very quiet). We had to wait two days until we could switch and therefore, spent two days of our vacation avoiding our condo from early morning until late afternoon. The workers are on the scaffolding from 8am-3pm or so; don't believe otherwise---we watched this for a week. And it looks like renovation/refurbishment work on the outside of that building will last for quite some time (months). Check before you make reservations!!! When we were finally able to get a studio in the north building (move), we could get up in the morning, enjoy the lanai and a slow breakfast, read the paper, watch the ocean, and then leisurely leave the room---rather than *have* to clear out of the room early, to avoid such disturbing noise on vacation. It was lovely from then on.....and we can then recommend this property. Otherwise, it's a lovely, lovely place. Great staff (very friendly and helpful, in general). Great location. Wonderful beach for swimming and snorkeling. Wonderful accomodations, if you get a place that is not too in need of inside refurbishment nor near construction.

Tried some of the restuarants. Since we had a rental car it was very easy to get around. Travelled quite a bit between Lahania and Kaanapoli. We liked to eat breakfast on the porch and enjoy the view. We also grilled dinner a time or two at the pool area and ate on the porch watching the sunset. Absolutely breathtaking. There is a Star Market a little ways from condo and there is a huge Safeway about 10/15 minutes up the road. Made one trip and had everything we needed for the week. Make sure you get some of the Maui gold pineapple, delicious. Drive to Hana, definitely an all day trip, but nice scenery, my parents really enjoyed this part of the trip. If you don't want to use a whole day - this trip is probably not for you. Went to the Old Lahania Luau. It was nice. You must book this WEEKS/MONTHS in advance. Saw the Warren & Annabelle Magic show.

Awaken every morning to the crashing waves on the beach, breakfast on your own Lanai. We stayed in 817 and it was great..everything you need right down to the filter for the coffee maker!! Only draw back was some construction while we were there..understandable and commendable (place looks great) but hammering can get a little beat when you are on vacation This will be done eventually,.. but you may want to request not to be near any ongoing contstruction. Sunsets are unbelievable and I am told during the season the whale watching is as well ( we were a little late for them and didn't get to see any during our stay May 3-13). Great restaurants nearby if you don't feel like cooking..hitting Costco just outside the airport is a great idea for stocking up but there's a Star Market within walking distance from the Mahana that was good too ( a little pricey but then everything on Maui is!!) We snorkeled every day and the absolute best spot was 200 yards south of the Mahana toward Black Rock..beautiful Blue coral reef, tons of fish and the Green Sea turtles start feeding about 10 or 11 am every day.. If you find my watch there enjoy it!! Remember don't touch the coral and leave the turtles alone they'll come to you, if they are curious and they often are! Did the Hana trip..be sure to eat at Polli's Mexican rest. on the way Yum!..long but worth it for the views..the driver doesn't get to see as much because you have to pay such attention every secong to your driving!, Haleakala is a must see..will do the horse trip next visit....We drove the west end/north shore all the way and found it absolutely stunning..many guides say to avoid it do to the hazardous roads etc...think they are just trying to keep us tourists out of there though!! ( don't blame them) Highly recommend the Hula Grill$$$( Whalers Village) at least one night for the sunset..great food and great staff . Just strolling Lahaina is great,..tons of places to eat etc, and the Warren and Annabelle show is a must..the guy is riot!! Its so popular you will need a reservation before you travel just to get in.they have a web site! ( brush up on your Andy of Mayberry trivia before going and you may win a prize!!) The Trilogy Lana'i Experience trip is fantastic and well worth the $.. we did the Molokini trip with them as well but frankly the Molokini site is too crowded for our tastes..you see more people than fish!

We place them in the rental pool when we are not using them. I have been to the mahana too many times to count from the time I was a toddler up through a adult, and I only appreciate it more each time I go! It is not a loud resort with pool slides or organized activities- so if you are looking for that, try somewhere else. There is however excellent sunset views, and you can't get any closer to beachfront without getting in a boat :) The beach is not as large as the one down by the sheraton and black rock, but you can take nice long walks all the way down and at times you may be the only ones on your stretch of sand which is nice if you are looking for privacy. We like going for walks down to black rock and then you can hike around black rock to the sheraton beach... around black roc we have had some great snorkeling expereinces- sea turtles,,,but it can get a little crowded there sometimes. The staff at the Mahana are excellent - some of the staff has been there since I was little. They are very accomodating. One time my fiance and I ran out of gas down the road and walked back to the mahana to ask them to call us to cab to take us to get gas...the front desk person had her husband and kids bring us some gas and drive us to our car! Talk about hospitable!! We thanked them over and over and before we left we got them a card and gift certificate for a nice dinner in Lahaina. As far as things to do... Trilogy has a great all day excursion to Lanai, a nearby island - you get to snorkel in crystal clear water, then have a huge bbq lunch- then they gave you your own jeep wrangler and you caravan through some fun trails up into the mountains for some amazing panoramic views...one tip- don't wear white- the red dirt will stain it!!! ON the way back we followed a pod of dolphins and had champagne. That's my favorite tour. Another favorite we've done a few times is a kayak/snorkel from makena landing- TONS of sea turtles to swim with all times we've gone. When my fiance and I last went in september, we were the only two with our guide since that is the off season- it was amazing!! I think that one is by Ecoadventures or something. We thought the Trilogy sunset champagne sail was overrated and not worth it... We also did a horseback ride through Haleakala crater and that was definitely one of our highlights- to me that was better than the times I have gotten up at 3am to wac h the sunset on Haleakaa but you gotta do that once in your life :) Also, at least once you need to experience the road to hana - if at all possible, get a guidebook and drive yourself rather than going on a bus. My favorite guide book is Maui Revealed- it has some great tips- even for the seasoned visitor. The pool at the mahana is nothing special, but it is warm and rarely very crowded which is nice. If you are dreaming of huge resort style pool and hot tubs- Embassy suites is next door and we have used their pool several times- you can't use their waterslides unless you are a guest though... Also, we have walked down past black rock to the hyatts pool several times and swam there with the caves andd waterfalls... very cool pool- and then we caught a cab back after. My fiance and I stopped at Costco on our way to the mahana form the airport and got a ton of food - so we didn't eat out a ton- to save money- but there are some fabulous restaurants in LAhaina and right around the mahana as well at the embassy and kaanapali shores. Towards Kahana there was a really good little takeout place- Okahana Grill or something- EXCELLENT mahi mahi- we'd get takeout and then go home and put it on real plates and watch the sunset on the lanai. The mahana also has a couple of poolside bbq's which they will clan and stuff so we did that alot too. If you are looking for a luau- the best one hands down (and I've been to most of them over the years) is the Old Lahaina Luau - it's alittle pricy but well worth it- book early because it's always full- even in the off season. You can sit in chairs or traditional style on mats. It's all you can eat and all you can drink and it's all good! Be adventurous and let the bartenders mix you up some different tropical concoctions. Take a cab back to the mahana or get a designated driver :) As far as the rooms you will get and their condition- I'm really not sure- since most of them are owned by someone- decor is left to them and how they care for their unit- but all theones I've seen have looked great. Ours has a very tropical motif and many others do too. If you are considering booking the mahana- you will not regreat it. There are not a ton of kids here, probably due to the lack of kid activities and waterslides and stuff- but that is great for adults :) Families may be interested in more of a resort type property. Partiers will be disapointed too- there are places nearby- but no party mood at this property. Very quiet, peaceful, lots of couples and retirees too.

When arriving for the first time, the access almost seems hidden \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you bear left from the entrance to several properties (The Embassy, the Kaanapali Shores, etc), onto an almost hidden driveway. A short distance down that drive is the Mahana parking lot. We always found ample parking available. The location is ideal, situated on the edge a complex of condos, hotels and a shopping plaza. All are in easy walking distance. There are restaurants and shops in the hotels. The shopping plaza has a number of touristy-type shops, some restaurants, and a grocery store. While all of this is not technically \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on site,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd most can be reached by a short walk along the beach or through the parking areas (with sidewalks in most places). The walk is typically no longer than the walk from your room to a restaurant in most large Vegas hotels. The lobby area is not gargantuan, but is spacious and attractive, with lots of wood and stone. As you enter, the reception desk is to your left, a window wall overlooking the pool and ocean is straight ahead, and an open area with couches and tables is on your right. There is wireless internet service available in the lobby, and I never had trouble getting access or finding a comfortable place to sit. There is also a tour desk off of the lobby, in the Molokai wing. Access to the two towers (Molokai to the right and Lanai to your left) is through automatic doors flanking the pool area. Like much of the architecture in Hawaii, inside flows into outside with little distinction. The pool area is between the two towers, with the lobby behind and the beach and ocean literally a few steps away. The feeling is like being in a quiet cove, right on the ocean. To one side of the pool is a sauna, and on the other side there are restrooms and very nice gas-fired grills. Between the towers and the beach are stretches of lawn, sprinkled with lounge chairs. These come together at the pool, where open-air showers and faucets are conveniently located to rinse off sand before entering the lobby or pool. The lawn areas provide a very nice place to lie in the sun \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ocean is just a few yards away, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like being on the beach but without the sand. The grounds and facilities were beautiful and well maintained. The lobby floors and windows were always spotless, and the landscaping was well manicured. There were some pockets of renovation work going on around the property (mostly painting and stucco repairs) when we were there, but it was being done as unobtrusively as possible. Since there are no restaurants or shopping on-site, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of staff, but the staff we met were all friendly and nice. The daily housekeeping may not have been perfect, but it was adequate and it was done every day. The beds were made (if a bit sloppily at times), the floors vacuumed, the bathroom cleaned and towels replaced, the kitchen was cleaned and the trash removed. The air-conditioned units are roomy and well laid-out. A one-bedroom unit totals over 900 square feet, with a full master bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen/dining, and lanai. The floor plan is awesome. The living room has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the ocean, with a sliding patio door leading to the lanai to one side. The bedroom is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the lanai, also with a patio door access. This makes for a continuous field of view along the ocean side, but maintains the privacy of the bedroom from the living room. On the other side of the unit, when you walk out the entry door, you are greeted with a beautiful mountain view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pretty enough to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153draw\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in other places, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an afterthought here! Decor and furnishings are another area where the condo-vs-hotel debate heats up. Reviewers will warn you that condos are individually owned, so the individual units are furnished by the owners and therefore unpredictable. True. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessarily bad. McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s burgers are predictable wherever you may go, but the local burger joint, while unpredictable, is usually much better. My compliments to the owners of unit 408. It was beautifully decorated with sturdy, attractive, bamboo and wicker styles. The kitchen had beautiful countertops, nice cabinets and modern appliances, and was well stocked with cooking implements, dishes and cutlery. There was a nice bamboo-and-glass dining table with four swivel chairs. The living area had a comfortable couch, and two comfortable high-backed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chairs along the windows, which swiveled to either face the windows or into the room. There was a good TV with cable, a stereo, and even a nice selection of paperbacks on the bookshelves. The bathroom was great, featuring a large walk-in tile shower with a fantastic multi-adjustable/hand-held fixture. The bedroom was nice, with a TV and a good-sized closet. My only complaint was the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I expected a king size bed and this was a queen. I am tall and prefer a larger bed. We were traveling with another couple, who also had a 1-bedroom unit in the other tower. They had a king bed, but their shower was a standard tub with a shower curtain. The rest of the unit was comparable -- the Mahana clearly has good standards and guidelines for furnishings. We loved having the space to sprawl out. If one of us was sleepy before the other, one could go to bed and the other could watch TV, or sit on the Lanai and watch the stars. The lanai itself is the unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best feature. It is roomy enough for a table and six chairs, and has a fantastic 180-degree view of the ocean. You can clearly see Molokai to the north and Lanai to the south, with wide-open ocean straight ahead. The water is just below you, with the soothing sounds of the waves lapping up on the shore. And best of all, we were able to watch the whales every day, in the morning and in the evening, playing in the waters nearby. The sunsets were awesome, and the nighttime stars were magnificent. These views are one way the Mahana distinguishes itself. In other condos and hotels, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean-view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means that the ocean is visible from your room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but how good that view is, is just the luck of the draw. No such problem at the Mahana. The architecture is such that every unit has an identical 180-degree view. I've included some pictures from the lanai with this review, but they don't do it justice. If I sound enthusiastic about the Mahana, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only because, well, I am! We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at resort hotels in other places, and we own a timeshare condo at Disney World, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m familiar with both. I also know people who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at other condo properties in Maui, in Kaanapali, Napili and Wailea. All were good, but all things considered (especially the location and the views), I can enthusiastically recommend the Mahana. The key question in evaluating accommodations is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would you stay there again?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For us, the question is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And the answer is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not soon enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd", "Date": "April 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island", "Title": "\u201cSounds of the Surf.....and Whales\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3233735", "Content": "Feb 6 2005 we arrived to room 303 in the Mahana.

I spoke to the owner, Evie, several times, especially after reading the concerns about he noise of the construction. I always felt reassured by her. As soon as we drove up, I knew it was going to be unique and it was...the condo itself was on the first floor, which I LOVED as no matter if it was 7 in the morning or 2:00 in the morning, we just opened the french doors and walked out to walk on the beach. The condo itself had everything we needed, from foil, coffee, spices, etc. etc. All we did was purchase the food we wanted. The pool was delightful! it was always the right temperature, and quiet. I ususally started out there in the morning reading and having my coffee and then moved to the lounge chairs on the lawn. We did not have maid service, but didn't need it. I was able to wash all of our clothes and pack them, no hassle when we got home. I hesitiated about writing this, due to the fact that the unit 117 will probably be unavailable 265 days a year now. Luckily for us, we wer able to purchase a 12 week a year timeshare at Sands of Kahana.....but IF mahana had been available, wewould have chosen that. PLEASE dont be afraid to rent at the mahana.

After an 8 hour plane ride and a 45 minute ride from the airport, I was happy and pleasantly suprised that our studio condo was so nice. We weren't expecting the Ritz. We just wanted a comfortable, clean room for our 7 day stay. We got so much more - a dishwasher, a washer and dryer, a DVD player, a CD player, a great view of the ocean and 2 other islands and pleasant staff. We didn't need any more than that. The reviews made me very nervous about the condo. I really don't know what people were complaining about. We really only needed a comfortable place to lay our head which is what we got in the Mahana. If you are extremely particular about your surroundings, if you plan to stay on the property the majority of your time on the island, if you want glitz and glamour, and if you want to be in the heart of the action, then the Mahana may not be for you. If you want a quiet, comfortable place to lay your head, then definitely stay at the Mahana. The person who complained about the lack of restaurants, the lack of houskeeping and the location of the condo is so wrong. There were many restaurants in the surrounding area and 1 or 2 in walking distance. Most of the restaurants and activities were only a few minutes drive away. My husband and I saw the housekeepers a few times during our visit. We didn't really care whether our beds were made or not because \"we were on vacation.\" We were usually gone most of the day and our room was cleaned by the time we returned. My only complaint would be that the dining table and patio table did need to be wiped more often. We never saw a roach or any other bugs in our room. We didn't hear much noise from the construction. The hotel doesn't have a nice beach, but we didn't really care because we wanted to check out as many beaches as possible while on the island. We found 2-3 other much nicer beaches only a short distance from the Mahana.I kept my swimwear on at all times just in case we bumped into a nice beach. If you don't feel like driving, there is a decent beach a short walking distance to the right of the condo. A few other suggestions: Definitely check out the Old Lahaina Luau. Reserve well in advance. We went to the Drums of the Pacific Luau. I wasn't too crazy about it. It was too packed and we missed a lot of the activities because we were the last table to eat. Don't miss the \"Warren and Annabelle's\" show. It was a delight. Make sure you arrive on time. The \"Road to Hana\" wasn't as difficult as we thought, but it is really taxing and it definitely requires the whole day. We did the back road back and though it was beautiful, I wouldn't do it again. It was a super bumpy ride with much more sharp, narrow turns than the regular road. Lastly, if you plan to cook, bring your own seasonings and foil, plastic wrap, etc. for picnic lunches. Maui is beautiful, but well overpriced!!

After doing months of research on where to stay and reading reviews on this site, we decided we wanted a condo and a place that wasn't chaotic, so we thought this sounded like a good fit. When we got there, I was EXTREMELY impressed after reading some negative reviews that were completely inaccurate. Knowing that some of the condos were outdated, I made a point to ask if we could have an updated room. She obliged and put us in rm 712. We bought a vacation package online and paid for a studio, so I was worried about the room, but she definitely put us in an updated room! It was VERY nice with granite countertops and ceramic tile floors. We had a king bed and not that this is a priority to folks, but had high tech dvd player and radio, etc... the table and chairs were updated yet hawaiian style as it should be. The appliances and paint looked brand new (not sure if it was updated recently or what, but it looked great! Not a single bug or dirt problem whatsoever. We had shampoo/conditioner and the amenities. Yes, maid service came throughout the 8 hour day, but it didn't bother us at all as we were gone all days but one and that's why we know they came late. Falling asleep to the ocean waves was terrific! We weren't into swimming in the beaches but were more about walking along the beach. The Mahana's extremely convenient for midnight strolls. As everyone else has said, the beach is only down a ways toward the Embassy. The construction didn't affect us at all. We left every day to explore the island so we had no idea if it was noisy or not. Those who stay in and don't explore are the ones who probably get most annoyed. The lobby looks like it's going to be nice! We spent most of our time in Lahaina shopping, dining, doing sunset cruises and whale cruises. We took the road to Hana and went to the Haleakala Crater as well as took a day trip to the Island of Lanaii snorkeling and dolphin watching. We saw three pods of dolphins on that trip! They just swam with the boat! The spinner dolphins would jump out of the water a lot and it was very neat to see. We also saw a whale breach itself twice right in front of our eyes on a whale watching cruise. It was great! So, overall the Mahana was fabulous. My recommendation is to ask for an updated room right away and then you have no hassles in case you get an outdated room and want to switch. It's better to be proactive than reactive:) In addition, a side note... there really are a lot of restaurants around that area. We didn't eat at any of them as we went to Lahaina for dinner almost every night, but if you don't go out, there are several close by. I don't know where that review came from!

I've studied so many of these reviews on this place so was expecting a lot. We were not dissapointed. The WOW factor of walking into the room for the first time was sensational, better than we could have imagined. It's simply beautiful as we arrived just before sunset on our first day. We had room 1004, a one bedroom condo with one bathroom. It wasn't the most modern room but very clean, pleasantly decorated and had all the amenities we could have expected plus a few more. I'll throw out a few nits that were minor annoyances overall, but worth mentioning. I had requested two separate rooms in order of preference a week prior to arriving as the agent told us to do. We arrived and they had no record of my requests nor were we given either of the two rooms I had requested despite an encouraging conversation with them over the phone. I had requested either room 1015 or 715 based upon reviews here. Nonetheless, our room was quite nice so we got over that one. Then there is the maid service. You never know when they are going to come. They would knock on our door at 9am some days, then not get there til 4pm on others. That is a bit annoying when you come back from a day at the beach and still have no towells. They even asked us what time would be a good time for them to clean the room. I told them 10 or 11am. It virutally never happened during that window. Minor nit, but again, worth noting since THEY ASKED US. The sofa bed also broke on my son one night and sloped down at the head. He just dealt with it since there apparently was nothing anyone could do with it. He slept like a rock anyways so no biggee overall. Hey, we loved this place so don't get me wrong. You just can't believe how nice it is to have the sound of those waves every night in bed. Slept like a baby. Our king bed was extremely comfy. The bedroom was a good size. We never felt cramped. We cooked up some marvelous meals in the well stocked kitchen. The lanai was large enough for meals out there over the ocean. Saw whales while eating (and other activities) on several occasions. WE loved the fact that it's removed from the hustle of Whaler's Village in Kaanipaali but still within walking distance when the woman needed to shop. I've stayed in the Whaler before and really like that as well, but this place has the advantage of having the washer dryer right in your room. What an enormous convenience! The walk between Mahana and Black Rock is gorgeous with some nice trees along the way with plenty of birds and natural life to take in. Imagine, no monster hotels along the beach walk for a change. We awoke at dawn several mornings and snorkelled black rock before breakfast. It doesn't get any better than that! We spent several days just hanging out at the hotel as it was pleasant enough to boogy board by the Embassy, snorkel and scuba dive at a couple different spots within easy walking distance, or just hang out on the beach and read a book. It's an awesome place to just relax. The construction was never an issue for us. Other days, we explored up country, did the bike trip down the volcano, scuba dove Molokini and Lanai with Ed Robinson, checked out Paia, and drove to Hana. The Mahana was a fine launching point for all our activities while secluded just enough to give us the peace we desired. We loved the Mahana and will go back in a heartbeat. I knocked off one star on the rating system just because of the minor complaints I mentioned. To me, they were all avoidable with a little effort.

It is crescent shaped with some shade trees and is perfect for swimming, snorkeling and boogie boarding especially if you are going with kids. Also, take a snorkeling trip on the Four Winds II to Molokini. Even though it was very early in the season, we did get to see a humpback whale with her calf and a school of dolphins.

They were busy with the remodeling of the office but we were never bothered by any noise. The use of only one elevator in our tower made it a little slow and full but no real trouble.

After visiting Oahu and the Big Island, we ended our trip by staying at the Mahana from October 22nd through November 2nd. I had made reservations at the Mahana back in January, and after doing so became somewhat uneasy after reading many unfavorable reviews. I am happy to say that we were all pleasantly surprised. One factor may have been that we rented our 2 bedroom/2 bath condo from a private owner and not from the property. It was well appointed, recently updated with tasteful decor, and very clean. Our 6th floor view was beautiful and we took advantage by drinking our morning coffee and watching sunsets on the double lanai. Since our bedroom had double sliding doors to the lanai, we fell asleep and woke up each morning to the sounds of the ocean! As stated in nearly all of the reviews, the beach is NOT a swimming beach. But, that was perfect for my family who snorkled the coral reef nearly every day! As far as the renovations, we were not told that there would be construction during our stay, but it never bothered us. I was happy to see that they were updating and making the resort more appealing. The pool, as other reviews have stated, is neither large nor elaborate......but, it was never crowded either. (There were more than enough lounges around the pool and privately arranged in the grassy area overlooking the ocean.) We spent much of our time beach hopping to other parts of the island so the size of the pool did not concern us either. The staff was very friendly and helpful to us...a concierge was also provided to help make arrangements. After pricing ocean front condos at other resorts, the Mahana is a true bargain. We vacation to escape the hustle and bustle of every day life. The Mahana truly measured up. It was uncrowded, quiet, and very relaxing. We are beginning to make plans for our return....and it will definitely include a stay at the Mahana. Only the next time, we will stay between December and April as the the Mahana would be the perfect place to whale watch from the lanai.

When I booked--nooone told us that construction would be going on and I was also told that it had a swimmable beach. When we went up to our room we found it to be clean but very dated. I called the lobby and asked if there was a more updated unit and they said that there was not one available. I have to say though that the view was great and that saved our visit there. We spent early mornings and evenings on the deck watching and listening to the water and the view of Lanai and Molokai was very beautiful. We did not stick around there at all during the day as the noise from the construction was very disturbing. Also--there were two elevators and only one worked the entire time we were there. I felt that most of the staff was less than friendly or helpful with questions we had.

It's very romantic. The beach is not big and you can't really swim in the water in front of the hotel, but you can go down several yards and swim. We snorkeled everywhere. There are so many places to snorkel all over Maui. The lanai was nice and big and we had sunset dinners there. Oh yeah, we highly reccommend the Haleakala bike ride downhill for the adventurous and unscared and snorkel to Molokini crater. We also took a sunset cocktail cruise and what a difference it made on the water!!!! Also, if you have lots of money, go to Mama's Fish House in Paia. It was expensive, but worth it!!

This was my first time renting a condo on Maui and not staying in an actual hotel ( my other trip to Maui I stayed at the Hyatt Kaanapalli- which is absolutely amazing and left pretty high expectations for the next stay). The first night we were there they put us in a newly remodeled studio room with breath taking views, good size room and kitchen (room702). I was absolutely amazed at the view, when they say oceanview boy do they mean it! The condo's are right on the water with a couple of feet of grass leading to the sand. The balcony had a lounge chair along with table and chairs to watch the sunset from or just relax and have a nice glass of wine... You can see the island of Lani to the left and the island of Molokai to the right from any of the rooms. The second night I asked to be put on the bottom floor studio where we would then be able to just walk out the sliding door and onto the sand..( keep in mind that there in not enough room in front of the condo's to actually lay out in the sand, since the water breaks so far up, but a beach area can be accessed by walking about 300 ft in either direction). This room wasnt nearly as nice as the first room... It seemed smaller in size and was in need of some interior updating, none the less it was still nice, espically being able to just open the sliding door and walk outside. On the 5th night we were moved once again to room 305 a 1/1 (for the same price as the studio) and once again was amazed at how nice the room was as well as the views. We initally were only supposed to stay for 4 nights and extended the stay to 7 nights since it was such an awsome place. Never went to the pool area so cant really comment on it only that I've seen better and was told that there is currently no spa but there was construction going on and that a spa was being added as well as a remodeled enterance area/ check in .

If you walk for about 10 minutes alongside the beach to the south, you'll reach one of the best snorkling areas, and a few meters further down one of the best beaches and waters for swimming. If you don't want to take the walk along the beach(which is great, some times dolphins perform for you) you can take a three minute drive and park right in front of Kahekili beach park.

After reading so many reviews of so many condo properties before booking, I was nervous about what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. The room was a large one bedroom, fully equipped kitchen, lots of space and well kept. While it did have seafoam green carpet and some dated looking florals for decor, all was in great condition. The appliances were newer, we had everything we needed right there. The other thing you cannot beat is that all rooms are ocean front. You can sit on your patio every morning, have a cup of coffee, and enjoy the ocean. Since there is a coral reef directly in front of the hotel, you have to go down the beach a little to play in the ocean (not very far). This keeps it very quiet outside your patio door. I would stay here again, without a doubt. The pool is small (as mentioned), BUT, we never got crowded out. We always found a patio chair and there was always room to swim and play in the pool. We noticed at the large resorts (Hyatt, etc) that the pools were very crowded with people and that the patio chairs were three deep around the pool. That was not a problem here. The trade winds are nice right in this area of the beach as well, as soon as you go south to Lahaina they are almost non-existent. The breeze keeps things very nice. The location is good, it's only about ten minutes to the main beach activities near The Whaler and a bit further to Lahaina. There is a market, an ABC Market (this is your best value for anything) and some small eating establishments right at the hotel driveway entrance. Eat at Java Jazz, the food is wonderful, and very reasonable. The service is questionable, but that seems to be consistent in Maui unless you are in a chain restaurant. The pizza place is also good (Pizza Paradiso I think), you can buy a slice or a whole pizza. Loved the Mahana though. Don't expect luxary and high end amenities, but well worth the money. Also, the Embassy Suites is right up the beach, you can eat there, get sodas, etc there for your time on the beach, and also rent boogie boards, etc. One comment, the tourists are not too friendly, at least not when we were there.

The Mahana has a great location near Kaanapali but not on it. It is just north of all the crowded (and expensive) Kaanapali beach resorts, in an area called Honokowai. Being from San Diego, we wanted to get away from it all yet still be within reach of some activity. At the Mahana you are closer to Lahaina than Kahana, Kapalua or Napili. A grocery store is conveniently located nearby along with a strip mall including a video rental. The Mahana was the place for us. Peaceful, quiet, smack dab RIGHT ON THE BEACH, amazing views and ocean waves to lull you off into dreamland. We stayed in unit 1015 which was tastefully decorated and comfortable. The bedroom has a decent king size bed and the living room has a sofa/sleeper. There are two full baths and the master bath has a tiled tub. We (my boyfriend, myself and his 10 year old daughter) appreciated having 2 bathrooms All the appliances work, the AC works, the washer/dryer are great, and there is a CD player, a DVD and VCR along with a few books. The view is outstanding! We closed our drapes whenever we left for the day (the unit gets hot in the afternoon sun) and kept the doors shut with the AC on and always came back to a cool place. We used the safe every day so we didn't have to worry about hiding money or jewelry. They even have maid service! A few notes about the island and whatnot: Get the book Maui Revealed. It will become your bible while driving around and will assist you in your plans for the time you are there. We went snorkeling every day and went in the ocean 2-5 times a day. We went to all the recommended snorkeling places but right in front of the Mahana ended up being our favorite place because it wasn't crowded with tourists and you could just cruise around, looking up every now and then to keep track of where you were. Getting out there could be a problem for some, but we just walked a few yards south to airport beach (where the sand begins) and got in the water there. When we wanted to come in, we usually swam in on the north side of the Mahana because the current tends to pull you north. You just have to be careful, look where you are going and head for the Embassy (the big pink resort just north of the Mahana). They have a sandy beach also. We liked snorkeling at Black Rock in front of the Sheraton because we saw a turtle there, but it was crowded with alot of tourists. The snorkeling at Honolua Bay is good but conditional, depending upon what the wind is doing and how the weather is. The rental car is not a good place for anything valuable. We talked to people who had a vehicle break-in while they were at the beach. We were careful not to carry anything we couldn't part with and left everything else in the safe worth stealing. Going to Lahaina is a must because there are the local botiques, shave ice and the banyan tree. We went to Whaler's Village to park when we went to the Sheraton (where Black Rock is). We didn't like the shops in there - too expensive with high end shops like Tommy Bahamas which is on the mainland anyway. We liked Paia which has some of the local flavor of Maui. Kind of a trippy artsy place in a hippie kind of way. We liked the beach south of the Mahana called Kahekili Park (sp ?) with it's sandy shore, showers and grass area for a picnic. We packed lunches and cool beverages in our colapsing coolers we brought from SD. Good idea if you want to save money. We also brought our beach towels - you can dry them in the dryer at the condo. The drive through Kapalua is beautiful - check out the course if you want to play some golf. Worth the price! Windy and challenging. Go to the Nakalele blowhole up north on your way to Honolua Bay for snorkeling/sightseeing. Good day trip. The park called DT Fleming isn't worth swimming at but has a fair picnic area. Another must is the drive to Hana. Read the book Maui Revealed. You could get car sick. Just stop alot. I sure have blabbed away. Hope the info helped. We have no regrets whatsoever with this place.

Upon arrival we were assigned a first floor room with no view and sunbathers right outside our patio. We asked to be switched to a higher floor and were told this was not possible. When we said we would just go to another hotel, a room suddenly became available. The room we got on the 5th floor was not attractive at all. Worn, broken cupboards, worn carpets and dreary wallpaper. Driving back from touring all day we both dreaded going into the room the next evening. The 2nd night when we got to our room the place was infested with bettles so we had to move at 11pm to a 12th floor room. They were actually spaying for bugs the next day so we had to vacate our room for a couple of hours then too. The 12th floor room was even more poorly furnished that the last but we tried to remain positive. The sound of the waves was nice but we found it so dark outside our patio at night we wished our room viewed the Embassy pool grounds next door instead. The final night when we came back from dinner in Kaanipali, there were 40 to 50 little bugs on our ceiling and on our bedspread, several dead from the spraying. There was no way we could sleep in there (by the way, no windows or doors were left open) but the front desk told us again there was nothing we could do but get bug spray at the store! They told us they had already moved a family because of bugs an hour before. My dear wife finally convinced the front desk that sleeping in the room was not an option so they somehow found another room for us on the 5th floor again - so we moved once more at 10pm and finally found the nicely furnished condo several trip advisor users must have stayed in. 4 days too late for us though. I've been long, but to sum up - I expect bugs in Maui but not what I saw at the Mahana. You are also taking a big chance on the quality of the rooms there. Maybe we just had bad luck but we saw 4 rooms, 1 nice, 1 ok and 2 poor. On the positive side, the pool area is nice, the place is quite tropical and the location is pretty good. However, we've seen the last of the Mahana for our lifetime.", "Date": "May 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, Ca", "Title": "\u201cThe Best\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2071957", "Content": "What a wonderful vacation we had.

The Mahana was not one of her choices. I went online myself to check out her recommendations. I found the Aston Mahana myself and the description of the hotel from Expedia sounded like just what we were looking for. I was a little nervous because I asked my travel agent about the Mahana and she had never heard of it. And she was the expert, right? I then stumbled onto the Tripadvisor website, and all of your comments confirmed that this was the place for us. If you want an ocean front room on Maui, this is the place. Our room was literally feet from the ocean. You can hear the waves from the room and the sunsets were spectacular. We did see some whales from our room as well. The staff was very accomodating. When we first checked in, they assigned us a room on the 1st floor. I told them I wanted a higher room for the view, so they told us to check out the room on the 1st floor and also gave us another room key to go check out. We decided on room 516. The views were to die for and it was a very, very nice 1 bedroom condo. Very modern. We will without a doubt be back at the Mahana. You cannot beat it for the price. It's quiet and does not have a crowded resort feel. If this is not for you, then you should stay at some overpriced resort hotel and expect to pay through the nose for a room with ocean front views. Thank you Tripadvisor and for everyone's positive comments on the Mahana!!", "Date": "May 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, IL", "Title": "\u201cMahana: Magnificence on Maui!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1835697", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Mahana. I relied on this site when choosing this place, and I'm sure glad we stayed there. All the reviews are correct. We started off in room 208 which was beautifully decorated (1 bedroom suite) but we wanted a higher up floor to see the whales better, so we moved to 1214 (top floor 1 bedroom) This suite was still nice but not nearly as nice as 208. 208 was newer, all tile floors, new appliances, dreamy comfortable big bed! 1214 had kind of dingy carpet, the wallpaper was peeling off at the bottom in several places. The bed wasn't quite as comfortable, but not bad. But all in all, we totally enjoyed the suite. We overlooked the \"small imperfections\". The view is amazing. We enjoyed the cable TV with all the mainland shows, satellite delayed for Hawaii time zone. You WILL see whales. Be sure and take binoculars. We were there April 17-22 which is late in the whale season and it wasn't unusual to look out and see a group of 4 at a time. Look for their blows along the water surface (kind of hard to see when there are white caps) but they will come up, maybe even a jump every now and then. We saw lots of whales. Several per day. The safeway grocery is cheaper, you sign up for a card when you check out and save a little. Expect to pay over 6 bucks for a gallon of milk! Wow! We were happy to find an Outback steakhouse in Kahana up the road a couple miles towards Kapalua. Played golf at Kapalua and it was the windiest round of golf but worth it! Beautiful! Great shape! Saw a great evening show/magic/comedy show at Warren and Annabelle's in Lahaina! Got this advice from the \"Maui Revealed\" book and tremendously enjoyed it! Amazing sleight of hand and comedy, along with tasty drinks and fancy appetizers! Great place, you should check it out. Drove up to Haleakala to see the crater. Amazing views of the valley between East and West Maui from up there. Just amazing! Have to do it! Didn't drive to Hana because it was too long. Did drive up the northeast side of the island past Kapalua and towards the Kahakuloa (sp?) point. Amazing photo ops. Also the nakelele blow hole. Windy here but so amazing! You can walk right down to the blowhole but be careful not to fall in! There's no sign but it's 1/2 mile past the 38 mile marker, you'll see some rounded boulders at the pull off parking area on the left side of the road. You must walk down and see it! Snorkeling at Molokini I think is over-rated. We didn't see that many fish. But it is still a fun trip. We took the morning trip from Ma'alea harbor with Pride of Maui. Great breakfast on board, BBQ lunch and open bar. approx $70 per person. I've seen more interesting snorkeling in Jamaica and Cancun. Did see some cool turtles at \"turtle town\", one of the stops on the snorkel trip. We chose not to swim with them though. But you could. It was fun to watch the huge sea turtles swimming around by the snorkelers. Well, I've given a lot of info. Overall, the Mahana is an amazing value for all the space you have. The grounds are beautiful, it is conveniently located. Only 15 min drive up to Kapalua and down to Lahaina town. No problem at all with parking. We came back at all times of the day, even later at night around 10 and never had a hard time finding parking. Great accomodations, wonderful views, pool is great (even heated for cool nights) some condos in better cosmetic condition than others, but still great! Accomodating, friendly staff! We will be back! I can never stay in a hotel again! This was TOO wonderful! Thank you Trip Advisor for telling me about the Mahana!

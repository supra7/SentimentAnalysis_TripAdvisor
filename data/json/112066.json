You can tell that you have entered a special hotel from the moment you enter. It is very hip and minimalistic without being unwelcoming. It's rooms are especially small (even by my New York standards). The club downstairs Whiskey Blue is very 'in' but for the VERY young during after hours. Otherwise, it's a nice place to have an expensive cocktail (although I prefer to go across the street to the Bull and Bear at the Waldorf Astoria for that drink). It's service can be so-so. I once had a disagreement about a room that was handicap accessible (that I did not request) and the bathroom kept flooding. I asked to be moved (\"no\") and upon departure asked for some sort of compensation for a miserable stay from the manager and he said No but would offer me some extra Starpoint Reward points. I was late for a flight so I dropped (but clearly have not forgotten) the incident. I would still recommend the hotel for it's quality and great location (almost across from Grand Central Station).", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location!\u201d", "Author": "Ann K", "ReviewID": "UR126732404", "Content": "This is the second time to stay at this hotel.

The bathroom was spotless - and remained spotless for all 4 days of my stay - and as I didn't face Lexington, no noise issues for me. The AC was rather noisy though, luckily I always pack a pair of earplugs, and if you're a light sleeper, I suggest you do the same, cause otherwise it will keep you awake. It can be turned off though, as opposed to what I read in earlier reviews. The lobby, as has been mentioned before, is a nice place to have a cocktail at the start or end of the evening and the free Wifi a bonus. Free apples and cucumber water are available for all.

Cleanness: OK, but not the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. There was a lot of minibar stuff on the bedside, and all of this seemed a bit dusty. Bathroom was clean and fresh.

I had tweeted that I would be arriving shortly and they asked me to DM them my information so they could insure the room was ready. I did in fact DM them, and reiterated that I had called a week prior to request a hypoallergenic room due to a feather allergy. Upon my arrival at 5PM on a Friday, I was told at check in that this request had not been specified in the computer. They comped us two drinks at the bar and enrolled my husband in the SPG program as they stated it would make it easier to track my allergy in the computer. We were told to enjoy our drinks at the bar and the room on the 16th floor (which I believe are larger \"Wonderful\" rooms) would be prepared without down bedding and they would deliver our keys to us at the bar. When 45 minutes passed, I returned to the check in desk to see if there had been any progress with our room as we had dinner reservations and I wanted to have a shower and get dressed before then. The helpful gentleman who originally helped us was with another customer so we were assisted by a very rude man who kept cutting me off when I was trying to explain what I needed. When I started to say \"I wanted to check the status of the availability of my room\" he cut me off and said \"YOU ARE ALREADY CHECKED IN\" as if I didn't know. He then told me that we were going to be in room 923, on the 9th floor. Due to the discrepancy I reconfirmed that this was the down-free room, not the one we were originally assigned. I'm not going to allow the actions of this one gentleman to taint my view of the whole establishment as everyone else was super friendly and very helpful. I've noticed that a lot of people who have stayed at the W on Lex in the past have complained of small rooms, but in honesty I have stayed in about 10 other NYC hotels and they are mostly comparable. Our view was of the top of a parking garage, but at least it was quiet.... except when a car alarm started going off at 4AM. The bathroom had an acceptably sized shower with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. The toilet had a good solid flush. The mirror was very well lighted. We were supplied with Bliss Spa bath products which were amazing. You can buy full size varieties at the shop downstairs. The frosted glass door, however, did not have a latch and the door had a tendency to open whenever it felt like it. Though I love my husband very much, there are certain things I don't want to see. And vice versa, I'm sure. When we first checked in, the room was quite hot and stuffy. I couldn't quite figure out how to get the A/C to the right temp, it seemed to always be running. I managed to get it to turn off then just opened the window a crack and everything was fine. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, but there wasn't much on the bed in the way of blankets. Luckily the room was always a little too warm anyhow. On the last night of the stay, we arrived back to our room to a cheese and berry plate and a split of Coppola's Merlot. A very nice little treat.

On the positive side the location is very good for business in mid-town and convenient to the subway on the East side. After week 2, I decided to write to the manager, Edward Maynard(that was always leaving me automated voicemails welcoming me). I kept track of problems and issues to help him improve the hotel. Here's the highlights: Week 1 - AC/Heat didn't work. Froze my bottom off trying to sleep. Week 2 - Drain is clogged. Staff turned off heat and I returned to freezing room. Week 3 - Sliding bathroom door in suite doesn't work so you have no privacy if you are sharing the room. $200 in random mini-bar charges in one day (that were quickly reversed when I pointed them out) Week 4 - Dirty bathroom - Urine on toilet seat when I first entered the room. Only one wash cloth and no drinking water (supposed to be free from me as a Platinum Starwood member) At least it's not risky staying at this hoel. Risk would mean uncertainty in whether or not your stay will be good. There is no risk - you will have to call downstairs because of something that didnt' get taken care of by the maid or someone else that should done it. Something will be broken. If you like that type of certainty, the W is your place! On a very different note, when did W begin to stand for \"Wines of Walmart\"? I swear they have the most over-priced and least interesting wine list in the history of NYC hotels. If I recall they sell wines by the glass for $12 to $15 where the bottle retail is about $ 10. If they are going to charge 5x retail, they should at least have the courtesy to serve wines that are not quite as widely available as Columbia Crest, Jacob's Creek and Mondavi Central Coast. I'd like to at least be able to fool myself that I'm not being totally ripped off by drinking a mystery brand. Oh I sent Ed Maynard (manager) two notes on the above problems. No response. As I mentioned I am a Starwood Platinum customer and even so, I can't get service at this hotel. Perhaps you'll have better luck, but if you're not willing to bet your on luck at a $300+/night hotel I suggest you look elsewhere in Manhattan.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Meath", "Title": "\u201cSo-So experience\u201d", "Author": "NonieLove", "ReviewID": "UR125478683", "Content": "Decided to treat myself and my boyfriend to a 5 star holiday in New York from Ireland. Our agent advised that the W was a young hotel suited to our age and lifestyle and booked straight away. We were in New York for 5 nights, however due to crazy weather we were snowed into the hotel for a couple of days, and I got the flu for the first two, but we still managed to have a brilliant time. The first morning we decided to have breakfast in the hotel, which was not included in the price. We ordered scrambled eggs and they were absolutely disgusting, water floating around the plate and obviously cooked in a microwave as it was still in one large lump, the eggs were full of bizarre herbs and some veg and we just left, I'm embarrassed to say we instead found an Irish pub that served yummy rashers and sausages and ate there instead, something I never do when I leave Ireland as I like to try more native places but without decent food in our bells we would have been useless. The hotel was very very quiet, the girl at the bar hit on my boyfriend, though he was delighted and I found this hilarious but it wasn't dry professional. The room for the 5 nights was about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1000 USD, and it seemed overpriced. I found the boxes of grass growing for decor around the hotel particularly hilarious. The cleaning staff were absolutely amazing, so friendly, and when I was I'll the first few days they kept checking I was okay and left me extra robes and towels just in case despite not asking for these. I was excited to visit this hotel to make use of the Bliss Spa, however this was closed while I was there, not sure why. The shop downstairs although tiny, I managed to dent a hole in my wallet buying myself shoes and jewellery when the weather was too bad to leave. The room bill at the end was enough to induce heart failure, almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1000, we got a film, and had some stuff from the minibar but was unprepared for that, the water I was drinking when I was sick turned out to be over $10, which is daylight robbery but I was grateful for it at the time. The location is quite good, nothing too exciting in the immediate vicinity but you never had to walk far to experience New York at its finest. All in all despite everything this is still my favourite holiday, However for my next trip I think I'll stay somewhere less 'chic' and somewhere with a bit of an atmosphere as aside from sleeping (in the tiny even for New York rooms) there wasn't much else going on worth staying in for. Just to mention consierage were fantastic, anything we needed we got before we finished asking for anything. We had some bizarre requests all met with professionalism. We mentioned we were visiting music shops to buy an instrument and before we left consierage had printed us addresses, numbers, maps and details of all music shops in the city.

The hotel lobby is nice and welcoming. The check-in could be much faster, queued for 30mins to check in. We stayed in a Cosy Room - which to be honest is too small, there wasnt anywhere for us to put our clothes. There seem to be no surfaces to put anything on, the snack bar and mini fridge take up the only storage in the room and you cant move the items, as they are all plugged in and auto billed to your account. The AC vents take up the whole window cil so you cant put anything here either. Our first night was terrible, the bed had a duck down topper and this poked in your body and was uncomfortable. The guests at the hotel are there to party and we had a couple next door drinking, laughing and talking very loudly til gone 4am! Also the air-conditioning is a nightmare. One minute its cold and ten minutes later its blasting out hot, you feel like you are under a hair dryer. We woke up sweating in the night. So in the end, forced the window open. You cant turn the ac off, and it has a mind of its own, also very loud. We both bought ear-plugs for the second night! We isnt really acceptable in a hotel. We then moved rooms to a standard room and there was more space here! We could put clothes down in piles, which was an improvement. However, the hotel staff offered to move our bags - only to lose them for about 4 hours. So we came home after a night out with no bags, nothing to change into and no bathroom products. They apologised but it wasnt acceptable, we had been out for 4 hours, plenty of time to move 2 suitcases. The bar area of the hotel is way too small for the amount of guests, you never get a chance to sit and have a drink. In the evenings a DJ plays loud music which is okay., but gets tiresome.

The first time was fine, though the room was small, we understand it's NYC and that's often what you get. This time was different though. First it started with the half-hour lines to check-in. I arrived early - 1pm, so I wasn't surprised when they said a room wasn't available. When my friends arrived about 2:45pm and were told that there still weren't any rooms available, it became annoying. We didn't actually get into our rooms until after 5pm. This is unacceptable - especially since we had dinner and theater plans for that evening. The service at the hotel was terrible. One of the bellmen actually tried to pick a fight with my friend. It was noisy in the lobby (as always) when the bellman asked my friend if he needed help. My friend replied \"what?\" and then then bellman proceeded to ridicule him and then got into his face. This was amazing. My friend is a marathoner and in great shape, but really? This is SERVICE? We ended up just walking away. Getting a luggage cart brought to the room took about 25 minutes. No reason given, just typical lousy service that one gets here. The walls of the rooms are paper-thin. I could hear everything from the rooms and the hall around our room. I am not a particularly light sleeper, yet was awoken 2 nights in a row by a couple fighting in their room down the hall. I finally called security after 2 hours of them screaming and it being 4am. The hotel security did a good job in getting up there quickly and taking care of the situation. Of course, the maids start chatting in the halls at 7am, so that doesn't allow for a whole lot of sleeping time. (Not that it is the W's fault for the bad behavior of their guests.) Then there is the half-hour wait for check-out as well. Anything that required service always required at least a 20-minute wait - getting luggage out of the storage area, even getting a drink of water at the bar.

Too bad it was too cold to spend lots of time out there, but we did get great photos. The management bent over backwards to accommodate us. The beds were super comfortable with nary a bedbug in sight (and we checked, as one member of our party was scared by some reports on this and other websites). The bathroom had a tub with jacuzzi and a walk-in shower with waterfall head, plus it was supplied with toiletries from the Bliss spa, AND cozy bathrobes. I can't say enough good things about the hotel, its location, the attentiveness of its staff, its cleanliness, its security, and its overall vibe. There are a few little things that kept me from giving it an \"excellent\" review. One is the continental breakfast. The choices are lovely but there is really no place to eat. I hate trying to eat at something other than a proper table, and while the lobby area is lovely and the chairs and sofas are comfy, where do you put your cereal? We did have a proper Sunday brunch in the hotel's restaurant and it was just lovely. Also, the electronics in the room were impressive but there weren't any instructions. I know the \"W\" line prides itself on appealing to the hip and wired crowd but some of us still need guidance. Plus the lighting in the rooms was wholly inadequate. There were no hooks on any of the doors, and with three women in the suite, the one little closet filled up fast. And, of all things--not a single full-length mirror!

As a first rime tourist to New York this hotel was close enough to times square and rockerfellar centre and central park that you could walk to each, but also far enough away that it wasn't overbearing. The hotel is conveniently placed between two subway stations - each on different lines- so getting to downtown, meatpacking district, soho was fairly simple. One of the stations is also on the Jamaica line which connects with the airport train so we didn't have to change train lines to get to/from JFK. When we arrived at about 8pm (December 18) there was a large line at reception and only two staff working on the desk. When we were assigned our room, we took our suit cases upstairs ourselves (I was surprised there was no luggage assistance- at both other W hotels our bags were taken to our room for us as soon as we arrived). Once upstairs, the key to our room didn't work. My partner waited upstairs while I went downstairs and had to join the 15 minute long line at reception again. She sent me back up with new keys, but again they didn't work. I went down to reception again (this time skipping the line, thank god!) and she sent us to a new room on a different level. This time the key worked, but someone's things were already set up in this room!! She gave us access to a room already in use and if I wasn't a decent human being I could have easily gone through their things. So I went to the desk a third time, and after an hour of going up and down the elevator we finally had our room. (all we got to compensate for the hassle was 4 drink cards for the bar). The main part of the 'Wonderful' room was good- nice soft bed, good tv with lots of sports channels which my partner enjoyed. The bathroom was aged and worn- ugly shower curtain and pretty small, but knowing the building wasn't new andin new York everything is tiny, we had expected this. Don't go expecting a 5 star marble bathroom (as per my experience at the W hong Kong and Koh Samui, thailand). The first concierge (male, 30s, dark hair) was rude and when I asked when the Boom Boom Room at the standard hotel was open he said, without looking up from his computer, \"Tonight is gay night, you probably won't get in if you're not on a guest list, you'll have to line up for about 2 hours, and you'll have to dress nicely\"- as though I wasn't going to dress nicely? Turns out getting into that bar was easy anyway and nothing like he explained! The concierge Lauren, however, was FANTASTIC- booked us a great restaurant - Illili - on Christmas eve and was happy to help with all my questions. The free Acura car service was wonderful and we used it a few times- including to get to maddison square garden on Christmas day which was a huge help and money saver for cabs, just make sure you book a fee days in advance. Didnt try room service but the bagels and pastries and juices downstairs were really good because we could get them in a take away bag and eat as we were exploring. About $6 for a yummy juice and a bagel or croissant. Slept really well, rooms nice and dark, cleaning service staff were very polite- even gave me some extra bliss products when I asked! Love that the bar downstairs was always busy at night, always people around which I enjoyed but might not be to your taste. All in all, the W New York was about what we expected, just don't go expecting a 5 star bathroom or 5 star service.

Whatever/Whenever WHAT-A-JOKE\u201d", "Author": "matarsakzendeh", "ReviewID": "UR122744958", "Content": "I've waited a while to write this review, as this hotel was such a bad experience, I was simply trying to block it out. I've stayed at more than thirty of the four stars in Manhattan by now, and I generally don't care for most of them - New York is a city where you seem to have to pay the dollars to stay at a five star or a boutique hotel to get an exceptional service and comfort experience, and if you are hardly in the room, it doesn't seem worth it. Still, there are plenty that give you a clean, functional room that allows a comfortable stay. I needed one extra night when I extended my stay for the US Open and the Marriott I was staying at the second week was booked, so I used priceline and was quite surprised when I was given this hotel which I mistakenly imagined was higher than the priceline four star bid level (based on W hotels in other cities). Well, from the moment i checked into the rude, horrifying desk, I was treated according to my priceline-station-in-life. The woman could not muster a smile or a welcome as she pushed the room key toward me. The room I was given was simply a disaster. First of all, there isn't anything special about these rooms. Cheap \"trendy\" furniture, and what is supposed to pass for a modern look, which is actually dated compared to the equivalent hotels elsewhere in the world. I wasn't concerned with the decor, however. My first and foremost concern is that many parts of this particular room had not been vacuumed in what must have been years. I'd lay in bed and look down below the side table, and never mind the whole candy wrapper, the nail clippings, and other filth, the thick layer of grey fuzz dust was astonishing. The edges of the desk, the shelves, but most appallingly, any area of the carpet that was not easily accessible to the vacuum was totally filthy. One large oily stain on the mattress sheet. Stains on the pillow cases. I have not experienced this in a four star, what is more a W. The bahtroom tiles cracked in more places than I could count. A big black dent in the tub. The toilet didn't flush, and I called downstairs. They fixed that. The toiletries were nice, and thats the only good thing I can recall. The lighting which is the mood lighting that perhaps appeals to a certain younger clientele (god knows why) was depressing, nonfunctional, and simply a joke. I've stayed at art-tech hotels around the world and maybe this place is trying to emulate those. They should not try. Get a lighting expert in, and fix the placement of the bulbs to garner the same effect, but in a functional way. I was too tired from the US Open to care to make a big fuss, but the next day upon checkout I asked for a receipt. I was refused a receipt showing a zero balance, because I had used priceline. Three rude women, one a manager, kept telling me I could not get a receipt. I've used the same service for maybe a hundred hotel stays and have always been able to get a printed hotel record of my stay. But no, these ladies could not be bothered. I got so tired of being ignored as they went about their business behind the desk, I even left for a few hours and asked that they figure it out upon my return to retrieve my bags The checkout was so horrifyingly inefficient, with one individual ATTEMPTING to handle all the bags people wanted to store for the day, and not managing at all - and piles of tourists standing around in the lobby cursing or complaining about the bad service. It took 35 minutes to hand a tiny bag to this man, who seemed angry the whole time he tried to take bags to storage. It took almost as long to retrieve it upon my return. The idiot desk-folk had still not figured out how to print a hotel receipt documenting my stay upon my return. This was the final straw and I asked to speak to a manager. I listed the problems in my room, and the state of filth in the room, as well as the checkout fiasco and all i got was \"I assure you, we vacuum the rooms\" with a blank stare. And this was the manager. Had I not been so tired from that weekend, and wiped out by moves between hotels and Flushing Meadows, I would have insisted on a room inspection. But every request at this hotel took so long, I would have missed my flight. The place was a zoo, and a poorly run zoo. Chaotic, noisy, unfriendly. Finally, and most irritatingly - a pet peeve of mine is when hotel staff treat guests differently, based clearly on what the assume their station in life is, all in the span of minutes. This is an idiotic asinine habit that you usually find in slightly higher end hotels (but not in the very best hotels), among poorly trained staff. You can find them lavishing one hotel guest with attention,respect, welcoming smiles....while not spending a second in attending to another moments later. I observe this from afar, and in this particular case, near - and find it appalling. These surface judgements of merit and worth have no place in the service industry, and any place that doesn't value all their customers equivalently deserves a zero rating. You can't judge a book by its cover. A person's clothing, luggage, sunglasses or nail manicure are not the basis for your hospitality. Learn what it means to provide service. This hotel was certainly one such place, all pretense and with no substance. I've never been treated so poorly, in visiting NYC six or more times annually. Train your staff. Clean your rooms.

Went to have a sleep but couldn't as the air-con was so loud. Tried to turn it off but there is no on/off switch. The next morning l raised the matters at the front desk. No apology was offered.

I went down to the front desk and told them that the sheets had not been changed (i didn't didnt tell them what l found on the sheets as l was too embarassed and sick at the thought). Once again no apology was offered. They said they would send someone up to change my sheets. On 2 occasions my room was not serviced.

If you do drink at the bar and need to visit the restroom you need to go to the 2nd floor. How inconvenient and stupid is that????????

From check in to check out it a was a great experience. The lady at the Welcome Desk, Nadia, made sure that we had a great stay! We arrived at 2pm-ish and was upgraded to a room on the 16th floor. The room was not ready yet but Nadia put a rush on it and assured us that it's worth the wait. She gave us some water (we don't drink alcohol so we declined the offer of free drinks at the bar) and breakfast coupons. It wasn't a long wait - 15mins later we were in the room :) The first thing that hit me once the elevator doors opened was the sweet scent. It could be lavendar or jasmine but it was such a nice smell. The smell was in our room too and our clothes smelled lightly the same way. It was very refreshing. We went out for dinner and when we got back, there was a plate of cut fruit and a bottle of Perrier in our room with a nice note from Nadia :) She made us feel so welcome! The decor in the room is minimilast and stylish (umbra dustbin in the toilet!). The toilet is admittedly small, but hey, no one's gonna sleep in the toilet eh? The bliss spa amenities were great and the housekeeping always kept it well stocked. The housekeepers were always very nice, saying hello/how are u whenever we pass in the corridors. The bed was comfortable with plush pillows. The location of the W at Lexington is fabulous! It's located a mere 5 minutes walk to either Grand Central Station (turn left from the lobby) or the E,M & 6 subway (turn right from the lobby). It's located on a quieter part of mid-town but still a close 10mins walk away from 5th Ave. I went for a facial at Bliss spa - loved it! And you could charge to the room too which was a convenience. Overall - i'll be back for sure! Loved the ambiance, the staff and the location.

The first time was with my adult daughter for a week over New Years. Since, a few more times with friends who come to the area and I want to impress them. The W never fails to impress. I've stayed everywhere from the Waldorf to the Ritz and absolutely love the W. Ask for an 08 room if you want to see a phenomenal street view! Unfortunately you'll never see towards the ball side of Time's Square, only towards the back end (against traffic) but it's still amazing! Fantastic for people watching. The other rooms have little peeks of the Hudson, and buildings, etc. The doormen are warm and welcoming, as are all the staff. The relaxing living room is separated enough for privacy for each 'party', yet open enough to feel spacious. The decorations are amazing and the water walls and ceilings really set these hotels apart from most in the area/on the East coast. The bar/living room area is very comfy with plentiful yet warm lighting. There is at least one street cam which can be watched on a decent sized flat screen near the bar. Blue Fin is a great restaurant located on the bottom floor of the hotel and we had dinner there one night, it was very good so you don't have to go far! Bliss toiletries await you in the glass enclosed bathroom as do other items which are available for sale, including bottled oxygen, t-shirts, snacks wine and shot bottles of liquor. The concierge also oftentimes has promo vehicle use, just ask if you don't get a coupon upon arrival. I really enjoy the W. It is a little costlier than your average hotel, but this IS NYC, and it IS worth it. The time we stayed for New Years, we were given several free drinks, additional free Bliss products, exceptional service, baggage hold, etc. We were also happy to find out that the police had a sub-station located at the entrance and so the main part was blocked off and only hotel guests could stay in the roped off area (hence it was quite empty) which was THE BEST for New Years and beating the crowd!

When I made the reservation I said I needed a rollaway for a child. When we arrive, they said the room was TOO SMALL to accommodate the bed. We had to go to Bed, Bath and Beyond to buy an inflatable mattress for $99 plus tax. Strike One...I had called reservations, that could look up my room on their system when they reserved the roll-away for me that the front desk subsequently said was too big for the room. Their solution, extra sheets so the child could sleep on the floor. Wife and child complained about headaches while in the room and finally realized they were allergic to the down comforter. We went to the concierge to ask for a hypoallergenic replacement who called housekeeping. The latter reported that the hotel was booked and they didn't have any. A hotel without a single extra blanket. Amazing. Strike Two. Housekeeping did come up by the way, and sure enough, they had a new, in the package, synthetic comforter. Strike Three for communication again. Why two stars? Failure to communicate, frayed scratchy towels, and a room size appropriate for a turn of the century Lower East Side tenement. So much for the W experience they seem to have spent so much marketing money on, perhaps they should divert some of it from foo-foo soap and shampoo to training staff on listening skills.

Rooms were made up daily and we particularly liked the free Bliss Spa products we received in our bathroom each day (they charge $25 for the same set down in the spa so hang on to them each day!) The bed was really comfy, plenty of floor space for all the shopping bags and our cases. The staff are so attentitive, every time we called down requesting something (i.e more towels, ice bucket, bath robes etc) we always received it moments after calling down. THEN 5 minutes later we were always called to see if we received whatever we had requested. They are just so nice! We also requested a dvd (they are free to hire) one evening but later realised that our room type didnt have a DVD player. So, because they are so wonderful, for the 'inconvenience' (gotta love the yanks!) we were given a free movie from the box office which was taken off our bill at the end of our stay! If thats not good customer service then I dont know what is. The location is perfect, around 5 blocks from Broadway which I think is a great location to be in. I dont mind walking a little bit to get to places so suited us fine. The door men always hailed cabs right away and even on an incredibly wet evening when there was an hour and a half wait for cabs (and we had tickets for a show starting in 15 minutes!) the door men managed to get us a taxi and sent us off to the show with smiles on our faces! The Living Room bar downstairs is great (the 1 hour free wifi was also useful) and the Whiskey Blue bar was great fun too, drinks are strong though so if you dont want a fuzzy head in the morning then take it easy ;) The Bliss Spa is well worth a visit, its not cheap but you pay for the experience, they definatley know what they are doing in there and as I mentioned before the products are A-MAZ-ING!

Do NOT stay here if you are over 30. Our room was miniscule even by NYC standards. We had twin beds! I haven't slept in a twin bed since I was a child. The room was so small we had to crawl over the beds to get around from one side to another. The mattress toppers kept slipping off the twin bed so you felt as if you were going to fall off the bed onto the floor. The pillows were hard and the sheets had holes in them on more than one occasion. One of the robes also had a hole in the sleeve. A giant cobweb hung from the ceiling the entire week we stayed there. There was a hair in the tub when we checked in....yuck. Our room looked out on the garbage pickup area of another hotel. They picked up garbage starting about midnight and continuing through the night, the noise was horrendous. The lovely lobby they call the \"living room\" is not ever solely for the use of the guests. They have loud, booming music playing 24/7, during the day it is filled with people who are attending business meetings in the hotel conference rooms. They fill almost every seat and attempt to talk to each other and into their phones by screaming over the music. Starting on Friday night the \"living room\" is turned into a club. Loud and obnoxious music and a loud, drinking crowd. We checked in on a Sat. night and had to literally scream over the music for the desk clerk to hear us. My daughter had an important conference call across town, they messed up our reservation and she had to straighten it out before she could leave for her meeting. The shorter, older male desk clerk with the glasses started screaming at her that she should respect him and no one is allowed to get upset and not respect him.......I am not kidding. The manager witnessed the end of this and promised to speak to him and gave my daughter 500 points, seriously???? The desk clerk should have been pulled off the desk immediately. Trying to check out our suitcases were already in the taxi and the desk clerk was making a personal phone call and refused to acknowledge our existence. Finally my daughter left the key on the counter and we left. The only positive things I can say about this hotel is that it is in a good location, but so are other hotels and you would have to be treated better than you will be at this hotel. The maintenance staff is wonderful, we did not have ANY hot water for the first 2 days and they worked until it was fixed. The food is also very good but ridiculously high priced. Between the garbage trucks, the thumping music of the club that we could hear in our room and the beds being twin with slipping pads we never got a decent night's sleep. Also the room was boiling hot and we could not get the air conditioning to cool it down. To top off the entire experience I could not get on the internet the last night we stayed there.

I do not sleep well when I am away from my own bed and the conditions need to be \"just so\" in order for me to have a good experience at a hotel. The W definitely surpassed my expectations and I had a wonderful night. My boyfriend and I spent the night here as part of his father's birthday celebration. Form the outside, you can barely tell that the place is a hotel because it is so anassuming except for the large front doors and the W Hotel flag in front. Immediately upon walking in, you forget you are in a busy city because it is so serene. The lobby is spacious and interestingly decorated with grass by the check-in desk. There was a fresh pitcher of iced tea at the desk, which I thought was a nice touch. The staff are accomodating and efficient, making check-in a breeze. The elevators are a bit scary since it is an old building, but it adds to the experience. Overall the room was awesome. It was spacious and very clean. It was so quiet, we did not hear any street noise at all. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the TV was large and modern. In fact everything about the decor was very modern and pretty. A housekeeper came and asked us if we wanted her to turn down the bed. She was so sweet and said she would come back later. (She did, and she left us little chocolates on the pillows!) There is an attention to detail in the hotel. There are small writing pads and pens all over, as well as plenty of towels and toiletries. When we called the front desk for something, they knew who we were and greeted us by saying \"Hello Mr. __, How may I assist you?\"--very professional! I was impressed. After we put our stuff in the room we went down to the bar to have cocktails before we got ready to go out. The bar was nice, and it was crowded by the time we got there. We were able to get seats on the main floor of the bar. The servers were attentive and efficient. The next morning we met up for brunch. The food was great, but the service was quite slow. I guess it depends on the time of day. Before we went out we walked around the area a bit and went to the farmer's market in Union Square. There is always so much going on in this area and the hotel is in a great location. You can walk from the hotel right into the heart of Union Square and find a ton of things to do anytime of the day or night.

We anticipated getting one of the small rooms (Cozy Rooms in W parlance) because of our discount booking and having read other reviews here thought we were prepared for the room size, but seriously it was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. The room is cleverly designed to fit in everything a hotel room should have and was very clean but honestly seemed designed for one (small) person not two. If we had ended up staying in that room for our 2 nights we would have probably just put up with it but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it would have left us with a glowing impression of the place. However, just after we arrived, staff from building engineering knocked on the door to replace the light in the room (which as other reviews have noted, was blue and made it extremely difficult to see in the room). We weren't unpacked yet, we told them just to come in and go ahead. We chatted a bit about the room while they worked, and they offered to find us a larger room due to the problems with the first. The second room we were given was very large and comfortable, with a great view over Lexington. The bed was very comfortable, the room quiet and the curtains seemed to be made of something magic that kept any light from getting into the room. We slept extremely well both nights we were there. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make much use of the public areas of the hotel. The lobby is big and open, there is a nice lounge area with a bar and comfortable couches. It is quite clubby at night and this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really our scene, but we were impressed that despite the loud and bustling lobby, the halls and rooms were quiet. All of our interactions with staff were positive: everyone was very friendly and helpful. Our flight to NYC arrived in the morning and we were allowed to check in very early (before noon). In particular Kenny from engineering was great: super friendly, funny and helpful (he even carried my bag from the old room to the new one.) Oh, and he mentioned that the aforementioned blue lights are being replaced throughout the hotel. The location is very convenient: there are two subway lines very close at hand.

The positives definitely include the location, the cleanliness, quality bed and pillows, a good restaurant for breakfast (with healthy choices), and at least one concierge who is wonderful (as in great last minute tickets to a hot Broadway show). As for the negatives, I would agree with other reviewers that the rooms can be extremely small. If you book the cheapest room (which is not cheap), be prepared for Tokyo-sized surroundings, tiny bed, and a small wardrobe where you can hang about 4 things. This may work if you are a single traveler - for two it is very tight. (On the visit last week, I experienced two different rooms - I had a second booking for the weekend. The second room was bigger and much more tolerable.) There are also times when the W aesthetic gets in the way of the practical. The sliding glass doors for the bathroom means that if someone uses it in the middle of the night, the whole room lights up. When you need signage on a lamp to tell you how to turn it on, perhaps you need to rethink what design really means. Two final complaints: (1) the air system in the hotel seems crazy - if you are on the lower floors, you may have a loud white noise from the vents that can't be turned off (it gets better on the higher floors, but the temperatures are erratic); (2) because the hotel brand is geared toward attracting a younger, \"hipper\" demographic, be prepared for those guests who are oblivious to the basics of \"Miss Manners.\" On our last night, we returned to our room around midnight and heard a couple hours of loud music and talking from a group in the next-door suite (and I mean just about every word that they said) until at least 3am (OK - they appeared to take at least an hour break to go clubbing). The hotel apologized and gave us extra points, but it hardly seems worth it. In short, when I want to stay in this location next time, I'm going to work hard to find an alternative.

I traditionally utilize Priceline for my hotels in NYC. I have been extremely successful at securing a four star hotel for less than 50 percent off the regular room rates. On this trip, the W Hotel took my bid. This was one of the BEST experiences from any of the hotels I have stayed in throughout Manhattan. The staff is seriously dedicated to the W theme which is whatever, whenever. When we arrived and the room was better suited for a married couple than a couple of friends, they immediately worked to get us a larger room with a roll away bed. Since it would take them a bit of time to get the room ready, they let us use the smaller room to freshen up and provided a few free coupons for cocktails. The new room was large by NYC standards, had the rollaway for no extra charge and was very quiet. I didn't hear a peep from the other rooms. This particular weekend they were offering a car from Lexus. You could book the car for free to take you where ever you needed! We utilized it for a trip to lower Manhattan for shopping. While in the car, the driver mentioned that there was another W just blocks from the store where we went shopping and that we could book a car through that hotel to take us back to our W on Lex. How amazing is that? If you book your hotel through the W, ask about this opportunity and book well in advance for trips throughout the city which will save you time and money. The bellmen were extremely sweet. When there was a shortage of cabs running they hailed a private car for us. More drink tickets came because we had to take the car instead of the cab. We had cocktails multiple times in the lounge which had a live DJ. Very fun, young atmosphere and couches made you feel like you were hanging at home with friends. The food in the lounge was excellent and served promptly with a smile. The bartenders were extremely friendly and fun to chat with the couple of times we sat at the actual bar. My only personal negative is the location of this hotel. For me personally, I prefer staying on the west side of Manhattan, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make for a bad stay, just a side note as you are planning what your activities are and where they are in the city. I have to tell you that I am a platinum rewards member with another group of hotels. I had stayed two nights on points at one of their properties on this same trip and had a negative experience. I moved to the W for the remainder of my NYC stay and I have to admit that my experience at the W made me become a rewards member with Starwood. I signed up before I left the hotel. I will search for W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now whenever I travel.

The room was not ready, and we were given vouchers for the bar to wait while they prepared the room. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and polite.

Perhaps if you were a light sleeper, than a different view would be better for you, but for me this is so perfect. The air conditioning in the room works really good, and some people complained about the noise, and i have to ask them, WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Have you never heard an air conditioner before. It is NOT particularly noisy. Some people will complain about anything. Our room is lovely with a writing desk and the most comfortable chair I have ever sat in. The rooms are dimly lit with very trendy, modern lighting. My daughter and I had no problems applying makeup or getting ready to go out. It is summer, so it is light out late. Oh and the beds and the pillows are the most comfortable EVER. The hallways are also dimly lit, and if I was here with my hubby, I would imagine that it could be very romantic. The are dimly lit, for atmosphere, but not dark. We feel perfectly safe in the hallways and in the elvators. Matter of fact, there is security at night that checks your room key, to make sure you are a guest here, before you enter the elevator. Then in the elevator, you cannot get to any floors without inserting your room key. I think this is so great. I was actually a bit worried, two women in NY together, but not here.

Many features were offered but not managed in its entirety, for example, the complementary water near the elevators was a nice touch but always empty... In addition, when points were raised regarding the room's fixtures to reception to be resolved, I was still awaiting a fix by the time I checked-out of the room. No sense of urgency or communication with the guest on potential steps to resolution. The room was a 'Cosy Queen Non-Smoking', which was adequate for my needs and as a base to see the sights of New York. The phrase 'shabby-chic' comes to mind given the fixtures were worn and missing parts. You are engulfed in the room by the TV but the real issue was the air conditioning unit. It is the equivalent of sleeping next to a major flight path! Loud, useless, and dirty: do I need to say any more? The bathroom was small but more concerning was the cleanliness: have the white tiles seen a deep clean since the renovations? The TV had a very grainy picture and kept reseting itself to the hotels promotional clip on in-house entertainment. Given the size of the room, a pink sticker is attached to the window and mirror which states that they understand it is a small room; therefore, would like to offer 500 Starwood points and free Wifi. So, if you are not a member of the loyalty scheme and have no need for the Wifi: the gesture has no real benefit. As an alternative, why doesn't the hotel offer complementary service at the bar or breakfast in the restaurant? In short, the hotel is in a great location for the Manhattan must-see attractions; however, I fundamentally believe that the management need to review the services offered from a back-to-basics approach. I left believing the hotel had 'all style and no substance' to their claims. A disappointment given it could be a great hotel.

This is absolutely unacceptable. Also, the line at the reception was so long. At any time we went to the reception, we had to wait for 15minutes. The previous occupant obvisouly helped himself in the minibar. The pack of Vitamin C was left on the minibar as untouched, but it was empty. I had to ask not be charged for this. The room was very styled and clean. Yet, the bathroom was not optimal. Very poor light, making it impossible to put make up on. The shower has no door, so that the floor is completely wet. We asked to be changed room for the second night to avoid the loud fan. They did it. That's cool, thx!. Hoping to get some sleep, there was still a fan on this side of the hotel, but less loud.

The uber trendy euro design was so over the top that it was not a place of comfort, despite their furry pillows and low lighting.

The W on Lexington appears to be a hastily updated and spruced up hotel, where the existing small rooms have been 'pimped' with a lick of paint and new wallpaper, and a queen size (or larger) bed, a 37\" TV and a fancy expanding desk. As as result, the rooms feel very small indeed - the TV, for example, has to be mounted on a pole rather than be placed on a unit or mounted to the wall. Check-in was fine and I was assigned a room on the 3rd floor. A shame not to be on a higher floor with the chance of a city view, I thought - but I considered that I'd bought my stay here on Priceline, at a small discount from the W's own publicised prices, so it'd probably be fine. How wrong I was! I was given room 326, which is directly opposite the elevators. Strike one. It features a view of a multi-story car-park and the rear yard of a Chinese restaurant, complete with dumpsters of festering food. Strike two. I noticed the window sticker others have commented on - saying, basically, \"Hey, we know this room is crappy, but, here, have free wifi!\". Big deal. It's also a fairly shallow gesture as the wireless didn't work at all reliably - certainly not well enough to load webpages. Still - I figured, I'm paying bottom dollar, what can I expect? So I stuck it out and stayed the first night. I pulled a bottled beer ($9 - same price as the lobby bar) from the mini-bar... no bottle opener. Rang the front desk, who firstly treated me as if I was some kind of simpleton that couldn't work out how to open a bottle, and eventually said they would send someone up with a replacement opener. 45 minutes later it still hadn't arrived, and I had places to be, so I left it. Next morning, the handle came off the cold tap in the bathroom sink. No biggie - rang the front desk again, who once again seemed to think I was making this up (\"What do you mean 'the handle has come off of the faucet', sir?\") and eventually said they'd send someone up. I went out, enjoyed New York and returned 10 hours later. Tap still not fixed. Hell, bottle opener still not present - enough! Marched down to the front desk to complain and was moved, and was comped 'breakfast' for my remaining days, as some kind of apology for the inconvenience. I was moved to the 14th floor, room 1430. This room had its own set of problems (including the missing bottle opener!) - specifically a heating and cooling problem. The room has a boxed-in cavity running down one side of the room, next to the bed - I suspect this contains several hot water pipes, as it radiated heat like a furnace. As a consequence, the air-conditioning in this room is set to compensate - which means, the very, very noisy air-conditioning is running, full pelt, all the damn time. If you turn it off, the room quickly becomes a sauna. Great for cohesive sleep. Not. Tried to cash in those free 'breakfasts' given by the desk staff, looking forward to some nice eggs, bacon and pancakes - only to be told that my account was only allowed to have a cup of tea or coffee, a single pot of yoghurt and/or a piece of fruit...

Overall, the W is in a great location and is a beautiful hotel. The Whiskey Blue bar is a fun night spot. I saw some reviews where people complained about how expensive the drinks are, but I think one needs to realize that this is NYC not the midwest. We had a Wonderful Room with twin beds, which was kind of small, but again, it's NYC. It was quiet though and you could barely hear the traffic. (We were on the 10th floor) My friend and I also went to the Bliss Spa, which is in the hotel. All I can say is \"AMAZING!\" The front door staff are very helpful and nice about getting cabs....even if it means standing in the pouring rain. One thing I was a little annoyed about was the wait time it took for our room to be ready. I had called ahead requesting an early check in and was told it would be noted in the system. The woman I spoke to said it would not be guaranteed. I was ok with that but hopeful we could be accomodated....especially since the hotel markets themselves as a place where they will bend over backwards to accomodate their guests. We arrived around 11AM and was told the room was not ready. The front desk did offer us a room with a queen size bed, but since there were two of us, we elected to keep our Wonderful room with twin beds. I was told they would call me when the room was ready. Again, no big deal because we had a day at the spa planned anyway and they stored our bags for us. We came back to the front desk around 2PM and was advised again how the room was not ready. Again....understandable considering the early check in wasn't guaranteed and and check in time was 3PM. I returned to the desk again at 3:15P and was told my room was ready. This time I was annoyed. I am a seasoned traveler and have never been told my room is not ready after the designated check in time. I advised the front desk person about how it was my third time asking and we need to room to change because we had plans. She called up to housekeeping, but did not seem all that concerned that 1) we had a deadline and 2) the guest was unhappy. She also expected me to wait in line again, which by the this time was out the door. I advised the girl that she had half an hour to get the room ready and also I was not standing in line. She did allow me to bypass the line to give me my keys when the room was finally ready.....after 4PM. Once we were in the room, we were getting settled and changed.....only to have the housekeeping supervisor barge in on us while yelling \"Are you finished with this room? Are you in here?!\" The woman was apologetic, but it was a little unnerving to suddenly have your room door fly open. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would probably stay again. I do hope they work on getting the rooms ready in a more timely manner or perhaps change the check in time for later.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGetting on a bit\u201d", "Author": "tanseaway", "ReviewID": "UR105003857", "Content": "Stayed at the W Hotel recently.

We had a queen size bed with down comforter, very comfortable, 37\" flat screen TV, nice. Very modern, clean updated. Nice bathroom with a rain shower head. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I booked the room on Priceline, so I paid $150 per night. It is usually more expensive. My complaints about the hotel were the expensive room service, expensive restaurant, $17 for internet per day, parking almost $100 per day, and the bathroom door is a little weird. The door is made of thin white glass that slides but doesn't latch. Anything you are doing in the bathroom is known to anyone else in the room. All said though, it wasn't that bad. As far as my other complaints, I didn't bring my car. I went to the Starbucks around the corner for free internet. I went down the street to the drug store and bought some snacks and dry cereal really cheap and just paid them for coffee and yogurt at the breakfast bar of the hotel. Put the yogurt on the Cheerios and tada...breakfast. The excellent location makes up for the little problems, and there's always a way to deal with those things. I would stay there again. It is right behind the Waldorf Astoria on Lexington Ave. and down the street from the Chrysler Building. it's also only a few blocks to Rockefellar Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral and several subway lines. Down the street was a cafe called Raffles. It was very good food and not as pricey as many of the other restaurants in the area. Oh yeah, there is no refrigerator or coffee maker in the room.

Incidentally don't worry about taking toiletries - the Bliss products are so lovely I was searching for where to buy the facewash when I got home! Hairdryer, iron, lovely big telly with lots of stations if you want to chill late evening or early morning! Go along the road and you will reach Grand Central Station (look at the glass and chandeliers and the marble - it's a lovely space); plenty of delis in the area to eat, a small McDs along the road, several small Starbucks in the area. Not too far to walk to find all the shops of 5th Avenue, the Rock, Chrysller Building, etc. If you turn right out the front door keep along Lexington and you will find yourself walking up the side of Central Park/Upper East side - look out for the posh little doggies going out for a walk with their little coats on! New York brings something new to discover every time you visit. If its your first time - probably all the tourist sites, tours, movie sites etc. Second time round we ventured on the subway (easy! and cheap!) and went to Chinatown, Chelsea, West Village, Seaport as well as all the Midtown sites and Central Park, the Times Warner centre (the basement deli is a must - collect and weigh your food then find a seat in the cafe and enjoy!). Oh, can't wait to go back and although we may try another area to stay in the next time (we stayed Midtown the first time and then the W this time), I'd have no hesitation in recommending the W.

We lucked out because the corp travel agent tried to put us up at another hotel, but once I discovered that hotel was listed in the \"NY Bed Bug Registry,\" we were able to convince the Finance Director to allow us at the W, instead. It was pricey, booking that late, and were it my own money, I'm not sure I could have afforded 2 nights there. I think we paid around $350/nt. I know, however, you can get better deals by booking in advance. At the time of booking, the hotel was very full (I think we were only booking about 5 - 6 days ahead) and the only rooms left were higher-priced. My confirmation said I had been booked into a \"Queen Suite,\" but when I arrived in my room, it was really just a large room (there was no sofa or additional room). I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, however, so I was given a room on the 17th floor -- far above the crazy streets. The room was lush and modern and our my massive picture window, I actually had a view of the balcony of some glorious 2-story suite. As it was very snowy during my visit, no one was ever out on that balcony, however. The bathroom was large and perfectly outfitted with fluffy towels and bath mats, robe and Bliss products. My one complaint about the bathroom was the shower. The shower head was very nice and the quality of the actual water pressure and temp were wonderful, but due to the design of the shower stall, water goes EVERYWHERE all over the bathroom. I actually had to use both bathmats + an extra hand-towel along the edge of the shower in order to make sure pools of water didn't end up all over the bathroom floor (i.e. in front of the sink/vanity). This is a design flaw and should probably be figured out, since wet tile can be very slippery. The bed is out of this world. I have not had a night of sleep like that in years! The mattress itself is incredibly comfy and it's topped with a featherbed. The pillows are fluffy and squishy in the best possible way and you literally feel like you are sleeping in a cloud. I never wanted to leave that heavenly womb. The room was very quiet, despite being located near the elevator (which, honestly, I had specifically asked to be away from). I didn't partake of the bar or restaurant, so can't really comment on them (other than the massive amount of trendiness each one oozed). I was in NYC...why the heck would I stay IN the hotel for my drinking/eating pleasures? NYC has some of the best restaurants and bars in the world. You can literally walk, subway or cab to ANY of them within about 10 - 15 minutes. I would never \"knock down\" a hotel because of their bar or restaurant when in a city that offers the best-of-the-best, anyway. That's just silly. As an aside, someone mentioned this hotel being \"downtown.\" It isn't. It's at 49th/Lex, which is midtown. \"Downtown\" is traditionally anything below 14th Street (or, maybe, you can stretch it to 23rd). Midtown is a lot more corporate office buildings and culture, so the amount of \"hip\" places to go are limited. That said, as mentioned previously, you are close to the subway and can usually get a cab just about anywhere. It's a quick trip downtown, if that's where you want to be. If you have the coin and need to stay in midtown, I cannot think of a better place than the W.

The wardrobe hardly had space for any clothes and the bathroom was also cramped. The lobby bar and 'Whiskey Blue' were quite busy and if being in a trendy location is of primary importance, this may hold some appeal (but in NYC there are many bars and clubs available rather than needing them in your own hotel).

I had personally negotiated the rooms and while NYC is expensive and the W is no exception, this hotel has a great location in respect to our office and we didn't want to risk being farther away in winter. I didn't get to the hotel until past 3am due to delayed flight, but there was still someone to bring in my bag, check me in, etc, immediately. They didn't mention they had upgraded me to a mega room, but it was a pleasant surprise. There was also a message from the GM on the phone welcoming me, as well as a few amenities and a note. Very nice touches. The room was larger than I expected, thanks to the upgrade and was a solid size for the city. I'm never a huge fan of the W bathrooms as there's never much room to put your stuff, but this one was slightly better than normal. The soap tray in the shower never held anything though, anything i put there would immediately fall off. The shower was a bit awkward with just half of a door, but it worked out okay. The bed was very comfortable and the TV has a guide on it which I love compared to just having to scroll through. There are plenty of plugs near the bed which is always a plus and all the normal amenities like a safe, etc were there. They seem to always be doing road work in NYC at night, so bring your ear plugs no matter how high up you think you'll be staying. The heater in my room sounded like it was taking off when it started, but it seemed like just the first time was bad and then it wasn't so loud. The food from room service is always great at Ws and this was no exception. In fact, besides the room service I had once at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, this is the best I've ever had for dinner. Miso Halibut with a side salad and a glass of wine, plus they give you bread and a chocolate. Don't get me wrong, $65 for this meal is beyond ridiculous and is it really necessary to have a delivery fee, processing fee, tax and 20%+ gratuity? There's no way I would have done it if I wasn't exhausted and at least had a per diem from my work. The next night I went to the bar with some colleagues and the drinks were good, but expensive, and the bar was definitely a happening spot. What I appreciate most about this stay is that everything was done exactly as quoted -- there were some rooms on our group that were supposed to be charged directly to the guest, internet was included, etc and everything came out exactly as it was agreed to (this seems simple but trust me, I've had horrible experiences elsewhere).

I arrived with my wife in our 'mainland' car as we own a home out in W. NJ. My back has been in disrepair as we had been doing some crazy chores at the house and I had tweaked it, not to mention recent surgery. As we drove up to the door, I got out an asked the bellman (aka 'ambassador') if he'd give me a hand with our baggage. He just stood there looking at me with his hands in his pockets, rocking on his feet! I was obviously feeling the pressure to move quickly, due to the midtown traffic, and as I strode toward the trunk to grab the bags myself I mumbled audibly 'I guess I'm on my own here....' Still no response! Another 'ambassador' was struggling with other bags but he came to help me after I hauled my bags to the revolving front door. When I checked in, I informed the manager on duty (aka 'coach') of the snub, and then we went to our room. It was 90 degrees in there and my wife couldn't for the life of us both get the thermostat to work. The phone rang but when we tried to answer it the handset wasn't working. I used the speakerphone to listed to the VM, which was the young 'coach' telling me the snub was because the ambassadors rotate customers to equitably balance out their tip money. Not what I wanted to hear. Engineering came to fix the phone first. The first 'engineer' couldn't get it to work and aid he needed to replace all the room' base units. Okay, I thought. Before he came back another engineer came to look at the units again. He did something and they started to work. The previous engineer solved the heat issue by opening our bedroom window, fully. I think good help is ust hard to find :-) The second one couldn't fix it either. I sent an email to yet another 'coach' expressing my feelings about the ambassador situation. I called again to express my feelings about the thermostat/window situation not being a good long-term fix. Now, I jockey between several hotel loyalty programs. I think Starwood's Platinum membership is one of the best. I almost always get an upgrade to a suite. So, inasmuch as I sound like I'm down on this property, I'm not! Before we went to the lobby for a drink, the Whatever/Whenever person I was talking with had sent us a bottle of wine and cheese as an amenity. How wonderful! Then, when we decided the room too hot, we headed down to the lobby where we were intercepted by the second 'coach' who game me a luxurious soaking bath product from the Bliss spa for my back! To boot, the manager moved us out of our already upgraded suit and into an 'Extreme Wow Suite'! He must've noticed I had a next-day reservation for W Union Sq. (I was headed to CT and unsure I'd be able to get back to city so planed to check out-in and wanted to see the Union Sq. Hotel while i was here anyway.) But it was such a big upgrade and he offered to let us continue on in that lovely room for two more days, so we agreed! I looked up the rate for that room and it is $3400 a night with taxes! We were paying about $220! Now that's what I call a to-notched crisis management solution if I ever saw one! Many hotels will just put some dummy on the phone with a scripted response to virtually anything. Not W NY.

I stayed at the W New York October 2010 for about 4 nights in one of the Suites. I did not want to stay at this hotel but a friend had already booked his room via expedia because it was on sale, and I had no choice but to follow suit. I knew the rooms were going to be tiny so we opted for a suite. My friend had the \"wonderful\" room, and they barely had space for their luggage. It was TINY. Our room in terms of space was fine (because it was a suite). But, the rest of the amenities were just ridiculous. The bathroom mirrors were too high (i'm 5'3) and I could only see my eyes. And to think we had called in advance to verify this as judging from the pictures taken here on tripadvisor, I thought it would be too high. The lady we spoke too said it was actually abnormally low (she said she was also 5'3 and could see her whole waist)-- i think they were actually referring to a disabled room come to think of it. The room lighting was too dark which made applying make up and fixing my hair an obstacle. Btw, I had to use the mirror next to the bed to get ready, which meant plugging and unplugging the phone. Plus their bathrooms had a really annoying sliding door that if left slightly ajar, the cold air would quickly seep in and you would actually freeze in the shower, since the shower lacked a shower door/curtain/whatever-- only a tiny glass partition to keep the water spraying out of the shower stall (see: PICTURES). I thought that the hotel was trying too hard to be trendy that they actually ignored the most basic necessities (like mirrors and lighting!!). We had the same elevator key card problem as mentioned in the reviews here. But we didnt have any problems getting it fixed at reception. Service was not great. Getting out of the cab with my luggage, i had to go inside and ask for someone to help me. We also had to call several times for the espresso machine to be brought up. but we shouldn't have even bothered because the mugs they provide are actually not compatible with the machine (the machine would work if it felt the weight of the mug in place-- but the mug was too big and it basically didnt fit).. and when we found a way to make it work using our hands to press on the machine for the 'weight to be right', the coffee tasted like crap.. haha! it was pretty funny actually, but what a major failure. Location: nothing great for shopping or dining. although maybe about 15 minutes to an h&m store. But on the positive side, the beds were very comfortable and the air-conditioning worked very well. But all in all, I dont think I would be back in this hotel even if they went on sale on expedia. definitely not worth the $$$$.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "WasagaBeachPlayers", "ReviewID": "UR95315192", "Content": "In New York for business and in classic W style, excellent service, affordable price, stylish company.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cThe brand is strong with this one.\u201d", "Author": "latrell1", "ReviewID": "UR95106040", "Content": "I've always wanted to stay in a W hotel, but my lack of spare $100 bills has precluded me from doing so.

Even though the hotel gave me a \"complimentary upgrade\" upon arrival, the upgrade was really just from their smallest room (\"Cozy\", 180 sq. feet) to their second-smallest room (\"Wonderful\", 200 sq. feet). The work space for the Wonderful room on their website is defined as \"daring\". I dared to plug my laptop in and had a hard time because the desk is so close to the wall. A minor nitpick that was overcome by the presence of four available outlets and extremely effective wi-fi ($15). The room itself wasn't exactly large, but the layout was superb and everything was functional. Bed was very comfortable. Flat-screen TV was either not HD or didn't have HD programming available. Doormen and staff were very helpful, even if the whole \"We make wishes come true!\" motif was a little much. Room service prices were a little absurd, even for a hotel in New York -- their equivalent to a grand slam (oh, hangover) cost $22 w/ a $5 delivery fee, enforced gratuity, and NY sales tax pushing it to $34 or so. Minibar can of soda was $5.50. Late checkout was provided with no qualms.

The location is also within 2 blocks of 3 different Starbucks and a big variety of quick lunch spots as well as nice sit down restaurants. However, the hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant, just a breakfast place. From the moment we stepped out of our car, the service staff let us down. My mom and I had to unload our bags on our own, stack them and make our way through the multiple doors into the hotel lobby. There was no one outside to help us so that a random bystander helped hold the doors for us. We then proceeded to make our way across the lobby when finally a bell hop greeted us with an apology. At this point, we didn't let this bother us and moved on. We checked in without a hassle and our room was ready early. As we got into our room, things started to go downhill. We wanted to make some hot tea so we tried to call down for mugs but the phone wasn't working. I headed down the elevator to the lobby and brought this up with the people there. They apologized, placed our mug order and said someone would be up to fix the phone. About half an hour later, someone did show up. The engineer looked at the phone and said it's not programmed and that he would go find us another phone and replace it. We waited around for 20 minutes and then we had to go as we had to meet my dad as he was getting out of recovery. We didn't get back to our room until about midnight as we had to eat a late dinner. When we got to our room, the phone was still not working. We noticed it was chilly so we upped the heat from 72 to 74, but 10 minutes later it was still chilly so we upped it to 76 and then realized the heater was blowing cold air! In the mean time, we started washing up for bed and realized that some of the towels had dark stains on them. They were washed but the stains were set and just looked unpleasant. As it was late and we were both tired, we decided to just crash for the night and deal with stuff the next day. When we tried to lift up the window shades in the morning, they kept getting stuck. At this point, I was pretty furious. We chose to pay extra to stay in a nice hotel so that we wouldn't have to deal with this sort of crap yet here we are!! When I went downstairs to complain they said they could move us to another room in the afternoon. They apologized and offered to do the move for us but as we were already unpacked, we didn't want them touching our personal items. So in the late afternoon, we had to come back from the hospital to the hotel just to pack up and move for one more night. The new room we got was better but the heating unit was still loud and the sink was leaking some dark liquid by one of the handles that turns the water on. Overall, it was a total disappointment and I'm definitely not staying there again. But what really took me aback was the fact that when I wrote a letter to the GM after they gave us a letter stating that if our hotel stay was anything less than a 10, to let him know personally, all we got was a sorry and thank you for letting us know.

I had emailed in advance to ask for a nice view if possible as it was both mine and my husbands birthdays, we were nicely greeted on arrival and told of complimentary breakfast in the room on the morning of our birthdays which was a very nice surprise. We had a very enjoyable stay, the Cosy room was very small however clean and well done so did not feel cramped. On the 20th we were told our return flight was cancelled due to snow in London and the next available flight would be the 26th December!! Very sad that we would miss Christmas with our family back in the UK we called to extend our stay however the best available rates were almost double what we had initially paid per night, however we were told the website offered lower rates and indeed it did, almost 50% less than the rate given over the phone (thank goodness for the iPad!). We extended our reservation online, and were given a complimentary upgrade at the desk as we were there for an additional 5 days (we did have to ask for it). We then spoke with the very helpful concierge team who reccomended some ideas for Christmas day and booked everything for us. We had a very comfortable stay, the upgraded room was a lot more comfortable and the daily bliss products were a very nice touch, the only let down was that all of the rooms overlook each other so you have to be careful and always close the curtains which many of our neighbours had not realised! On the 26th, we were advised of yet another cancellation this time due to the Snow in New York, what a nightmare! Again we extended our stay and was told we could keep the upgraded room. We checked out on the 27th to face yet more cancellations and delays at the airport and finally arrived home on the 28th December, a very long and expensive weekend break in New York. The W on Lexington Avenue certainly helped to make our extended stay more comfortable. We did have to ask for certain things like the larger room or WI-FI password which under our difficult circumstances it would have been nice if they had acertained our needs such as offering say $20 of complimentary laundry as we had run out of clothes, but as I also work in hotels maybe I see things slightly differently. The lobby bar was very comfortable and the Whiskey Blue bar were both very nice serving up some delicious cocktails.

It just was like no one was working. We eventually learnt that to get a hold of anyone, ring the whatever whenever service and they would assist us. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was because it included a continental breakfast daily for 2 which not many other hotels in NYC offers. What't the point??? The continental breakfast is served at the bar where there is hardly any room to sit. The food selection was very basic. On our last day, as we had done for the last 5 morning my partner got her coffee and confirmed our room number with the attendant while i got my juice and walked off (as there was no room to sit), I was told I was stealing. I couldn't believe it but the juice wasn't even included in the continental breakfast, it was an extra charge. It turns our hardly anything is included in the 'continental' breakfast. Just coffee apparantly. W offers a complimentary car ride for its guests so we decided to make use of it one morning only to be told they don't start until 10am. Yes - rooms are small but I feel the designers have made good use of the space but what lets this hotel down is its service.

W hotels in general have a good (if expensive) reputation, so value for money is really a difficult measure in that context. So while high charges for in-room Internet, mini-bar items, room service and generally everything else are a given, it is the experience that really became the lasting measure of this hotel's quality. I arrived almost 24 hours late due to an unexpected snow and ice storm in Denver. When I arrived, I was exhausted but had an event I had to dress for and get to in less than an hour. I said as much in casual chatter to the very pleasant young woman checking me in, and she made sure I got right into my room and had everything I needed, including having a car waiting for me to take me to the event. On such limited notice in New York City, that was so helpful. The room I originally had was a Queen, and while the room was small, that's to be expected in a NYC hotel. The decor and layout of the room was smart, fashionable and very cozy, with luxurious down and high quality cotton linens on the bed, a comfortable work chair with desk, and a bath/shower combo. It was quiet and I was able to sleep very well as I was also at the end of a corridor and away from the elevators. I had been so tired upon arrival that I forgot I actually should have asked for a two-bedded room as my friend was going to meet me for a girl's weekend after the conference concluded. I called in a bit of a panic the day she was to arrive and even though the hotel was quite full, they found me a room with two twins, had staff go in and move my luggage from room to room and made the room generally welcoming so when my friend arrived, it was just like I'd never forgotten to get the right kind of room! The folks at the W are smooth. They go the distance and get the job done, and done well. When those lovely down comforters began to cause a serious allergic rash in my friend (who always forgets she's allergic to down until she has a reaction) we called housekeeping and they had three people up to remake her bed with hypoallergic bedding, and apologizing for it too. W's in general must have an excellent staff-training program. Staff members at this particular W really went the distance to make what was a bit of a haphazard time for me a lot easier, for which I'm grateful.

The W's location was close to all the attractions we came for, while being nicely tucked away in a less frenetic locale. From the moment that we arrived to the moment we left, the service was prescient. We arrived by car, and though things were busy, we were immediately greeted by one of the bellhops (Nam?) who with a smile orchestrated a spot for us curbside by helping a cab that was trying to leave. He asked us about our trip as he loaded our luggage onto the cart and came with us into the hotel. Our car was whisked away to the W's parking facilities. We arrived around 10:30am, wanting to enjoy the city to the fullest. Being Starwood Preferred Guest Gold members, we were treated to a huge upgrade from our Cozy Room to a Marvelous Suite. When we first arrived, Mario advised us that a suite would be available at 3pm, should we wish to upgrade. For us, this presented no difficulty, since we had much to do around town. A bellhop stored our luggage for us and we were on our way to take a bite out of the Big Apple. Upon our return around 3pm, Cindy C. pleasantly and deftly handled our check-in. Our suite was not quite ready, so to ease the wait she treated us to a handful of vouchers for Oasis, the lounge bar serving the Living Room. Lounging on a comfy sofa in the Living Room after walking around town felt great. Alana took our drink orders sofa-side, returning to mix our complimentary drinks before our eyes with studied skill. A fruit and cheese plate meshed nicely with our drinks. Whenever we needed something Alana was there - a recurring theme for every visit to Oasis. Next, we stepped over to Cindy at the front desk, where we found she had upgraded us to a Marvelous Suite with private terrace since the other suite was still unavailable. The room lived up to its name. Spacious, and modernly styled, full of light, and sporting panoramic views of the city, the room felt like a home away from home. Even the standard amenities had visual appeal, from an interesting swiveling dual level glass-topped desk with Brazo LED work light, to a whimsical fuchsia cutout light fixture in the living room, to the wobbly chess set. The bathroom sported a separate shower and bath, as well as neat textured wallpaper rising from a handsome slate tile floor. One of my favorite W perks is the iPod dock and radio combo next to the bed. No need to worry about charging adapters or audio cables: I just plop in my iPhone and the room fills with my music, making the room truly mine. Everywhere in the hotel, there are trays of green granny smith apples available for consumption - in our room they added a splash of color to the glass dining table in the living room. Healthy and visually striking - awesome. Surrounding three sides of our suite, our terrace offered an open sort of privacy with great views and plenty of seating areas - definitely a space that begs for an after-party. The living room was also quite spacious and offered plenty of seating options, from sofas and ottomans to dining table chairs to the work chair by the desk. As we settled in, Cindy called to ask how we liked the suite - to which our reply was, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marvelous - thanks!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also spent some time in the Living Room at different times during our stay. There was always a refreshing playlist on at a comfortable volume, conspiring with the comfortable, eclectic mix of sofas and chairs, Oasis, and other guests to make the Living Room a pleasant time warp. There were one or two non-waiting staff members who kept watch over the Living Room guests to make sure absolutely nothing fell through the cracks. Everywhere there was something of interest to look at. There were art installations hanging from the ceiling. Abstract images and videos were projected onto some of the walls. Columns were draped in loosely pleated fabric and lit from inside, yielding a modern neoclassical look. The bathrooms on the second floor were also quite a visual treat, wrapped in stone. Vibrant green wheatgrass in stone-gray planters throughout the hotel look quite striking, while keeping the air fresh. The Living Room looks out onto 49th street through a kaleidoscope of randomly-shaped stained glass sections and clear sections, giving guests inside privacy while still offering a voyeuristic view of the street. While at Oasis, do try the sexy fries - they are drizzled with truffle oil and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. The pizza looked good too, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to try it. The coffee martini was tasty, as were the kobe sliders. One morning, while having breakfast in the Living Room, I forgot my sunglasses on a table. By the time I remembered, we were already at the Thanksgiving Day Parade. I called the W to let them know what had happened. When we got back, I went to the concierge desk to fetch my sunglasses; the concierge told me to speak with the W security team member a few steps behind me near the reception desk. As I walked towards him, he held out my sunglasses to me. I was surprised and delighted. That was fast! It also gave me a great sense of security. Losing my sunglasses could have tainted my holiday - instead, I felt taken care of, safe. After that, I began to take notice of and appreciate the security personnel. At night, in addition to the usual requirement of an active keycard to use the lifts, security in the lobby makes sure only guests and their guests have access to the non-public areas of the hotel. There is also security posted around the Living Room and everywhere in the lobby. They scope out who brings what. A security team member discreetly looked at my laptop bag and SLR bag when I took them into the Living Room one night; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fairly certain no one but me would have been able to leave with that gear. I love that. That level of safety left me very relaxed and happy. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m alone, either. Observe the sea of Macbook Pros in the Living Room on any given weekday afternoon. Our stay was excellent. We loved the modern style and great service, and we felt right at home, thanks to the friendly staff. Every time we left or arrived, Cindy or another staff member would greet us.

We found the other guests to be friendly, although clearly much wealthier than us, and the ambience of the building very warm. Don`t be put off by the `nightclub` stylings mentioned in other reviews - they were much more subtle than we expected and the lounge area was particularly pleasent. The bar was well staffed, (special mention to the evening queen, Tracy for conversation and style), the concept of `service` made us feel like royalty. If NYC wasn`t so interesting, we would`ve happily had stayed inside the hotel for our complete holiday! I wish I could afford to stay there everyday! The double bedroom was easily ample for a couple and extremely well appointed. The massive telly only let us down when trying to get some english news.

Unfortunately, the W New York did not live up to our expectations. First of all, I knew the rooms would be smaller, and yes, I chose to stay in one of the smaller rooms because I figured we wouldn't be spending all of our time in there anyway, but WOW. It was the size of a gerbil cage! We were literally stumbling all over each other and our luggage just to get from one side of the room to the other. And the bathroom! That was the size of a cage within a gerbil cage. There was no room for our toiletries and one of us would have to walk out sideways if we were both in there at the same time. I am petite and my husband is of average height, so we couldn't even imagine how an above average height/weight couple could have settled in comfortably. Fine, we forgave the small room because, after all, we were in Manhattan where space is limited. Maybe all could be cleared away by amazing service? Not really. On the last day we decided to store our luggage for a few hours until our flight later that evening. We asked the woman at the concierge where we could go to do this and she directed us to a small area between the concierge desk and check-in desk. The lobby seemed busy that morning, so we had no problem waiting for someone to help us. As we were standing, the woman from the concierge desk came into the lobby and started chatting with another hotel employee in front of us. After we had been waiting for about 15 minutes, the woman looked over at us and asked if we had been helped. Well, no, we were clearly still standing with three bags. So, THEN she decided that she could stow our bags for us. If she was able to do it all along, why didn't she help us in the first place instead of chumming it up with her pal? It was very bizarre. The close proximity to Grand Central Station and the swanky downstairs lounge are really the biggest perks of this hotel. I feel that for the price we paid, we should have skipped the W and stayed somewhere with a little less name recognition and a bit more space.

While I appreciate that rooms are different and depend on location in the building I feel that if it is stated on the website that the room we booked had \"large windows framing breathtaking city views\" we should of been given a room with that.

I feel they should make some sort of gesture, even extra starwoods points to make up for this as I feel they did not provide the room they had promised.

And that's not a good thing. Instead of a calm, relaxing, \"welcome home\" vibe, everything is too modern, too contemporary. You aren't stepping into your home for the next few days. You're stepping into a nightclub, complete with the thump-thumping bar and lounge to your right and features in your room that are meant to look cool but not actually make your stay any better. Arrive at the elevators, and there's more proof it isn't your typical hotel. At a typical hotel, your room key would work every time. At the W New York, your room key--necessary both to open the door to your room and make the elevator go to your floor--is too unreliable. Only needing one room key for your entire stay? That's so 2004. We weren't the only ones with room key troubles. At least four other guests in the elevators with us during our three-night stay had similar problems. Other reviewers on TripAdvisor have complained about this, too, as you can read. Once you overcome the atypical hassle of actually entering your room, you're greeted with something that actually is typical for a hotel in this location: a shoebox-sized room. This is no exaggeration. There's exactly 12 inches of space between the foot of the queen-sized bed and the wall. Thank goodness that the TV mounted to the wall was a flat-screen and not an old-style tube TV, because there is literally no room for anything deeper than a two-inch screen. At this point, you should know that we booked our hotel through Priceline, and we paid $200 a night compared with the standard rate of well over $500 per night. Though the standard rooms are the same throughout the hotel, I can only assume that Priceline guests get the worst possible location within the hotel. Saving money is not hip, so they give bargain-hunters the leftovers. I came to that conclusion upon realizing that our room was right next door to the cleaning staff's supply room. At around 9 each morning during our stay, three or four members of the cleaning staff congregated right outside our door and chatted loudly for about a half hour. That wasn't the wake-up call we asked for. Another example of the poor location was the view from our room. We weren't expecting to see a sweeping panorama of the city from our fourth-floor Priceline room, but we at least hoped for a little privacy. Instead, immediately to our right along the wall that runs perpendicular to our window was another row of rooms. That meant that four feet from our window was another person's window. If their blackout blind had been open, we could've seen right in. Unlike most hotels, there are no sheer curtains at the W New York. It's either all light or no light. That said, it shouldn't surprise you to know that we left our blinds closed for most of our stay, denying ourselves any natural light but preserving privacy. Here are three other things that made the ultra-hip W New York feel ultra-uncomfortable: - Weak lighting: Turning on all lights in the room gives you less than half the amount of light that you'd get in a typical hotel room. - No shower door: Seriously. The shower has no door. There's a three-foot gap in the glass that you step through and into the shower. Cold air flows through while you rush to complete your shower. A shower curtain? How d\u00c3\u00a9class\u00c3\u00a9. - A spacious minibar: About the only normal-sized thing in the room is the pressure-sensitive minibar. In the hopes of bleeding more money out of you, the W New York uses valuable space in your room to sell you overpriced snacks and beverages. Don't you dare pick up that can of gummi bears, though! You're charged instantly for anything that's moved. OK, so did we like anything about the W New York? Sure. The toiletries were really nice, the bed was free of bedbugs, and the location was ideal. But we won't be staying there again, at any price. Do you want to relax and be comfortable at the end of a fun, fast-paced day in New York City?

The location was awesome and very close to Grand Central Station. The rooms were very clean and tastefully decorated. The housekeeping staff on the fifth floor were excellent and constantly asked if we needed anything. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was small but I've been in much smaller in NYC. The Acura service which is free was wonderful and much better than taking a cab. I also got a last minute appointment at Bliss spa for a massage which was heavenly. The only three complaints I have is the air conditioning/heating system were very noisy. The ice machine on the fifth floor was without ice our last night but the staff downstairs got us ice.

The room was just fine - small, but well designed with a comfortable queen bed, desk and chair, bathrobes, rain shower, and a big TV.

There is only so much they can do, and unless you plan to stay in your room the entire time - there is no need for a huge space. The location couldn't be better; and I LOVED the free ACURA car service. They will drop you off anywhere in the city from downtown up to 86th street with a reservation. Special thanks to Scott, the manager on duty who moved me to a higher floor with a HUGE window and lots of light; and to Regine - the housekeeper who checked in on me, and brought me water while I was feeling under the weather. For those who expect huge, contemporary rooms, with brand new fixtures and plumbing - you might try the newer W in Times Square. The Whiskey Bar next door is popular and crowded, the hotel breakfast restaurant is okay - but you can find better outside the hotel, and the Bliss Spa is a great place to get a treatment.

My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights for our honeymoon trip to Manhattan and we had an amazing time. We booked our hotel through Hotwire and the cost was roughly $300 per night. Definitely expensive but it's New York - all hotels are expensive! We didn't even consider room service or the mini bar because, again, these things are always way too expensive because you're paying a lot for convenience, and the W was no exception ($15 for pancakes!). The rooms - Our first night we stayed on the fourth floor in one of the smaller rooms. Yes, the room is small, but I don't see why that matters when you're there to sleep. In the small rooms there is a queen-size bed (with a feather bed mattress topper, down pillows and a down comforter!! zzzzzz! so comfy!), a desk, a mini bar with a set of three drawers below it and still floor space to comfortably move around. There's a small closet with hangers, floor space for luggage, an iron + ironing board, and two cotton waffle weave bath robes with terry cloth lining. There's a 37\" flat screen TV with cable and I thought the decor was simple and artistic. The Bliss products in the bathroom and the rainfall shower were also a really nice touch. The remainder of our stay was spent on the 18th floor in one of the larger rooms and it was pretty much the same but just more floor space and the robes provided had a microfiber outer layer instead of the cotton waffle weave. My one gripe about the 18th floor room was that the air conditioner was really loud, something that was not a problem in the 4th floor room. On to the staff - When we checked in we told the (extremely nice) desk clerk that it was our honeymoon and we asked if we could upgrade our room. She didn't have anything available for that night but she said she could definitely do something for us the next night and we were moved all the way up to the 18th floor! We definitely did not expect that and it was really nice of them to be so accommodating. The staff were friendly, all smiles and very helpful during our entire stay. One of the concierges, Lisa, gave us two complimentary drinks when she found out that we were there on our honeymoon! Now I'm not saying that everyone will get free upgrades etc. but my point is that the staff are amazing and they did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d heard about the W chain being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcup-market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 so thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give it a go. Well, if up-market means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eye-wateringly expensive with snotty service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve nailed it. And if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit tatty, dirty and dated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve scored 2-out-of-2. My colleague and I had both opted for King rooms, on the basis that any NYC queen bed would probably completely fill its allotted room. My colleague arrived the day before me, and when checking in was told that the king bed he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d booked wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available. He was bumped into a queen bedroom which he confirmed was indeed the smallest you could imagine. The receptionist apparently presented the fact that he would not be paying the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 price for that night was somehow an added bonus. On my arrival at the hotel with a 25kg bag and various carry-ons, after a 12 hour trip, the gormless porters stood by and watched me enter without lifting a finger. The receptionist too was extremely unwelcoming. After the hotel swiped my pleasingly under-used credit card, my card company baulked at the sudden spike in my CC spending. They consequently blocked the payment; news which was delivered to me by the receptionist in the most condescending way you could imagine. No offer was made of a telephone to call my credit card company. Luckily, my CC company called me, to check the charges were genuine and allowed the payment. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the rooms is quite nice, although the smart \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew york style\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 white bathroom tiles didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as though they had been scrubbed since the hotel was built. The bath and tiles had a yellowish scum over them. The mini-bar is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen air\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and looks incredibly tacky. The price list and the snotty \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd warning sign together ensured I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to remortgage my house to get some Pringles. From memory, it was $12 for a miniature toothbrush and 10ml or so of toothpaste \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kind you get for free on airlines. Ouch. A miniature tube of Pringles was in excess of $10. Careful you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t choke! The wireless internet in the lounge has the bandwidth of a string telephone. Of course, it would be, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The wired access in the room was must better, for around $16 plus tax per day, but the room was too dark (see below) to sit in for any period of time. Wired internet points in the lounge would be good. Not wanting to go-on, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick run down of the other problems with this hotel: The lights in the bedroom are too dark to do anything useful. Ditto the lights in the hall. No tea and coffee facilities in the rooms. The air con is SOOO noisy and is hard to turn off. The bathroom fan remains on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchurricane force\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 all night. The DVD player didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Most of the tv channels were badly tuned. There is no sound insulation in the door, so I was woken throughout the night by noisy guests returning. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be purely negative about my stay. The location was great for what we needed it for, and the apples on the reception were a nice touch, as was the iPhone docking station (although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s becoming expected these days). Also, you could sit around in the lounge during the day drinking a Starbucks without being pestered by staff trying to fleece you for another $9 bottle of bud - that only started around 4pm. On balance though, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be staying at another W hotel anytime soon (although the Meridien chain in the same Starwood group IS very good but sadly not represented in NYC). Now, pray silence please, as a representative of the hotel will now post some wishy-washy, non-committal, nonsense below trying to trick you into thinking that this was just a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that it is actually a really nice hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6take it away maestro\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Front Door Staff\u201d", "Author": "DivaDP", "ReviewID": "UR82679961", "Content": "I have been a guest at this location on several occasions and wanted to give a big shout out to all the hard working guys on the front door!

First, we arrived on Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Oct. 1st and it was raining hard. There was no one to help us outside with our luggage so we carried it inside to the check in desk by ourselves. We arrived early so our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready. When we came back we checked with the front desk and our room was ready. We stayed in room 1822 which is suppose to be the upscale deluxe corner studio room. the bathroom and carpets were filthy with lint and dirt everywhere. It was around 1:30. We went to our room and relaxed for awhile in the living room area. We had a massage at the bliss spa at 3:00 PM. We showered and left our room around 5:00 since we had an early dinner and show. We went to bed around 11:00 PM and realized when we got there that the bed was not a king size which we paid for and received an email confirmation for. Early Saturday I went to the front desk to let them know about the bed. The girl at the front desk said that the bed was a king size and I told her that I have slept in a king size bed with my husband for 42 years and it was not a king. She asked if I would like to speak to the manager and I said yes. I waited for the manager for 15 minutes and after none came, I asked the front desk to have her call my room. No one ever called. We went out for the day around 11:00 AM Saturday and when we came back at 3:15 PM our room was never cleaned nor our bed made. I called down to the front desk and housekeeping came up and cleaned our bathroom and bedroom area while we waited in the living room for them to finish. We made the best of it and stayed another night at the hotel. Sunday morn was the worst of all. We asked the front desk to get our car so we could leave for home. It was 8:05 am. We waited for 20 minutes and after the car never came my husband questioned the bellman and he said nobody ever called it into the garage. We asked how and when we could get the car and he said we could walk around the corner and get it ourselves. the porter/bellhops were rude and seemed to be upset with the hotel management.Well, that is exactly what we did and we carried all our own luggage with us(in the rain). We then got to the garage and had to wait another 20 minutes for our car because they told us no one ever called them from the hotel.. It was one of the most unprofessional experiences we have ever had at a New York Hotel. We stay in New York several times a year for shows and shopping and I just wanted to let you know that we will never stay at the W again. Your staff is very unprofessional and there are no friendly faces behind your check-in desk.we asked twice to speak with yhe manager and were told you would call us in the room.you never called us. I would give you a name of the people on your staff we talked to but none wore a name tag to identify themselves. We wanted to make you aware of our experience this weekend mostly to vent our anger and frustration over the terrible attitude shown to us this weekend. we had 2 massages and saw 2 shows and hardly spent any time in your hotel but the dirty rooms,the failure to clean the room while we were out all day and the overall hatred between your staff and the hotel itself was evedent from the arguements between your management and your workers in the hallways and elevator. We are business owners ourselves and your hotel has some seriour management problems. Sorry to say that there was nothing good about our experience at the W hotel. If anyone is considering staying at the w hotel please take our review serious.we were extremely angry when we left and this is a great forum to vent.

For the price paid, I was expecting at least minor luxury---I've heard the W in L.A. is beautiful----but, sadly, no dice here in Midtown. Entering the hotel, the eye is confused---- common areas are, in a word, ugly and, I guess, trying to appeal to a very young crowd----large video installments hanging from the ceiling, big brown or purple-y fake suede sectionals, loud music constantly. Everything is kind of shiny and fake except for the totally out-of-place pots of grass here and there. Here are my pros & cons: PROS:: Great Midtown location. Walking distance to Central Park, great shopping on Madison, 5th Ave, Park Ave, lots of good restaurants close by (it's NYC after all). Very comfortable bed (but beware if you're allergic to down) Nice Bliss toiletries (and their spa is located in the hotel). Good blackout blinds on the windows in bedroom. Very good coffee at the breakfast bar in the a.m. CONS: Lighting in the bedroom is very hard to master. I finally just put a mask on one night because i could not figure out how to turn off the large illuminated photo over the bed. Ditto a light over the mini-bar. There's actually a hidden, miniscule sign on the desk lamp explaining how to turn it on...WTF!!! Message light was flashing on the phone when i entered the room---it was just an irritating ad for the W and there is no way to hang it up mid-message. Bed size felt more \"Double\" than \"Queen\". I was alone, so not a problem. Every mini-bar item is lined up next to the desk, out in the open. Tacky, unless you're 14. Loud music in common areas. Closet door in bedroom would not close without making a loud thud as the lock engaged. I'm sure the neighbors loved it in the wee hours that I arrived. Had the hotel decor been the least bit appealing, I would have been more satisfied because of the good bed and great location.

Oh, and the bathrooms have weird textured wallpaper that does not clean up well - as evidenced by the many odd (don't get too close!) stains all over the wall. Maid Service The worst of any luxury hotel I've stayed at. They do service the rooms, but never changed the sheets (we stayed for over a week). The towels were often dirty (we had to ask for changes for two towels that seemed to have blood stains on them) and smelled of cigarette smoke. The cups for the coffee machine were never changed or replaced. We requested replacement robes and they never appeared. By the end of the stay we gave up using their 'whatever/whenever' service.

The hotel tries very, very hard to be hip, which is sometimes a little painful. Now, the service really needs improvement. Two examples. First, I asked for a restaurant recommendation and I felt that the lady concierge was very arrogant and could not care less - the same one showed the same attitude when I asked her how to get to the Plaza Hotel for a meeting. Second, I left my ipod in my bathrobe, which was unfortunately taken away by the cleaning staff along with the towels. No problems here or accusations, as I should not have left it in there. However, when I noticed it just an hour later, no one made an effort to find it. In fact, I called WhateverWhenever and they did not even bother to get back to me that day to tell me what was going on. The same happened with security the next day. I stayed in many good hotels and never had an item stolen or disappear besides this one and to be quite honest, it could have been found if someone went through all the bathrobes in the cleaning department. I was very displeased about security/concierge not bothering to follow up and letting me know - after all, every room phone has a voicemail.. So overall, the location is very good. The beds are very comfortable - my room was opposite the cleaners' cupboard though, which meant that it was noisy from 8am onwards.... The concierge is less than average. The atmosphere is like a Preppie Kid in hip clothes trying to show to everyone that he/she is REALLY cool and trendy - just simply trying too hard... well, hello there... as they keep saying in their emails/notifications...", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henderson, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, great staff, high extra costs\u201d", "Author": "mobycat", "ReviewID": "UR80695763", "Content": "I stayed here because the client booked my room. I would never spend this kind of money myself. I'm glad they did. First things first - all these reviews complaining about the size of the rooms... clearly they haven't stayed in Manhattan much, if ever. ALL hotel rooms are small. There is this thing called limited space. That being said, I was actually surprised by the size of the room - compared to other hotels I've stayed at in Manhattan (including the Plaza, the Hilton Times Square, numerous others), the rooms were larger. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. If I came across any staff in the halls, they always greeted me and asked how I was doing. The shower is one of those \"rain\" showerheads. I don't particularly care for them, simply because I want something with a little more power. Also, the shower cannot be completely closed off - the glass goes just beyond 50% of the stall, the rest is open to the room. And I'll never understand why hotels put their towel racks *inside* the shower/tub area. All the soap/shampoo/etc. is supplied by Bliss, who has a store on the first floor and a spa on the 4th. I did not try the spa. Wake-up calls are a real person, not a recording. When you call for a wake-up call, they also ask if you'd like a second call, which is nice (a kind of snooze button, I guess). There is an ipod dock for charging and hooking up to the clock radio. Lighting in the room is a bit sparse, but enough to get by. The hallways are a bit dark. The location of this hotel is pretty good - you are maybe three blocks from Rockefeller Center. Times Square, Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building are all within walking distance. Being that there is an Intercontinental and the Waldorf-Astoria across the street, I doubt you'd ever have much difficulty getting a cab (even during their shift change at 4pm). The subway is nearby as well - I grabbed the E train (express) from near La Guardia that dropped me off about 2 blocks from the hotel. A $2.25 train ride instead of a $30+ cab ride. One nice thing they have is a program with Acura where you can get a ride in an Acura MDX to wherever you are going in the city - for free. Beats the cost of a cab and is a much nicer ride. A couple of costs that I find inexcusable: Like most higher priced hotels, they charge for internet, which I think is absolutely ridiculous - at these room rates, internet access should be complimentary. Most cheap hotels provide it for free, the higher end hotels can, too. On top of simply charging for access, the rates are ridiculously high - $15 for a day. You can save a *little* bit by buying more days at once. I don't care what kind of excuse they may have for charging... it's unacceptable. The Business Center access is also overly expensive. If you need to print something out, save yourself some money and go to FedexKinko's. The W will charge you 50 cents per page for black and white and $1.50 per page for color. I believe copy charges are the same. Just getting on to the internet in the business center will cost you a minimum of $8 for 15 minutes. I'm not sure what the rate is after that, but I'll bet you'd pay close to $20 for an hour.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice\u201d", "Author": "charlie34567", "ReviewID": "UR80534955", "Content": "Hotel is great, rooms are very modern and clean.

A co-worker and I came to NY for 5 nights. I will be the first one to say I am a little jaded about W hotels because my experience at the San Francisco hotel hasn't been that great. First and foremost, I want to mention Denzel in particular. He is a greeter in the front of the hotel. He is one of the most pleasant human beings I have met in a long time. Everyone was wonderful, but he stood out the most to me. His demeanor was so relaxed, so friendly, and so comfortable. Hopefully you will be one of the lucky ones to have a chat with this man. On to the rest of my experience-as soon as we pulled up it was nothing but amazing customer service from EVERY (EVERY!!!) single employee. We dealt with the door staff, the bell men, the front desk staff, the bartenders, the waiters, the cocktail waiters, the housekeeping staff-practically everyone and they all seemed to go the extra mile to help us out. We booked a single bed room because doubles weren't available, but as soon as we asked, the front desk provided us with a double bed room. She even offered to have an air purifier put in the room since it was next to some smoking rooms, but we didn't notice a smell at all. Over the next 5 days we actually started to mistakenly call the hotel \"home\" because it felt so comfortable. Now, for the room sizes and the ambiance of the hotel. The W hotels are supposed to feel more boutique-y so don't expect grandiose rooms and bathrooms. Plus, this is New York, so small rooms I think are a given. My only qualm is the bathrooms are really dimly lit. Which really sucks for make-up application. I would completely stay here again. In fact, the next time I come to New York, I'm for sure staying here again.

I'm typically a fan of W Hotels, having stayed at many of their properties throughout the United States. W Hotels trade on its hipster atmosphere, and modern designs. Even knowing that, I was still a bit surprised by the W New York. After a $40 cab ride from LaGuardia, I walked into the lobby (at 10:30 p.m. on a Friday night), and was immediately pelted by the din of an endless sea of people. The lobby and lounge area, and the Whiskey Blue Bar, are apparently where lots and lots of New Yorkers hang out on a Friday night. It was really, really noisy and crowded. Coming off a long day of flying, it wasn't particularly relaxing. However, check-in was very efficient, and I was up at my room on the 14th floor within minutes. The room surprised me as well. Despite being upgraded (as a Starwood elite), I still was shocked as to how small the room was. It seemed about half the size of a non-New York W Hotel room. The bathroom was no better. A pedestal sink was too oversized, and the toilet was sandwiched between the pedestal sink and the tub/shower. It was a bit uncomfortable. The bed was your typical W bed--very comfortable and soothing. However, what made up for the hotel room was the W New York's location. (If you read my prior reviews, you'll see how important location is to me.) It's about 3 to 4 blocks easy walk to the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station and Park Avenue. A little bit farther to the UN. And, if you're cabbing it over to Hell's Kitchen (where I was meeting my friend), you pass through Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza and Radio City. Subway stop is a couple blocks away as well. Would I stay at the W New York again? Perhaps, depending on where I needed to be in New York. It meets the typical W Hotel standards (service, room quality), but as other reviewers have stated, the rooms are shockingly small. Price-wise ($220/night), it was a little pricey, too.

The hotel was very attractive, the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable and quiet. We would recommend the hotel and stay here again. We got our reservations through Priceline -- hotels in Manhattan are never cheap and rarely spacious, but I felt we got good value for what we paid. When we checked in, I asked very politely if we could be upgraded. The front desk clerk upgraded us from a \"cozy\" room to a \"spectacular\" room at no extra charge. The room was not large but it was sufficient, and from what I read in other reviews here, it represented a big improvement on the \"cozy\" choice. Once we closed the door, we heard very little noise from either the hallway or the street. We were on the sixth floor. The bed was very luxurious and we slept well. The bathroom was small (and not very private with the frosted glass door), but well appointed with space to put your stuff. There is a dock for your iPod and wired and wireless internet connections (which I didn't test). There are lots of easily accessible electrical outlets. The concierge answered all our questions and made some great recommendations for sightseeing and getting around the city. There is a spa, but we didn't visit it. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant twice. The food was good, if a bit pricey, with plenty of healthy choices. The service was efficient and friendly. Our main purpose in visiting New York is to attend theater, and the hotel was within reasonable walking distance of the Broadway theaters, assuming you are an avid walker. Otherwise, it is a short cab ride. The neighborhood feels very safe and there are lots of stores, restaurants, coffee shops and other amenities. There is a street fair on Lexington in front of the hotel on Sundays. In sum, I would highly recommend this hotel.

On my previous 5 visits to NY, I had stayed at the W-Times Square (which is in a different class altogether) but this time, unfortunately, I was unable to get a room at a reasonable rate for the 3 day duration I would be staying so I thought I would try the W-New York with the suite offer, and the fact that it was next door to the Marriott East Side where friends were staying. Upon my arrival, I was told that a suite was NOT available, and the only thing they had available for me was a \"Cozy Room\". 1st issue: Why did the online reservation system allow me to book a suite when none was available? 2nd issue: While the desk clerk was polite and demonstrated a genuine concern with the erroneous booking, the manager who was solicited because of the error was quite curt - did not apologize for the error, and simply stated that was all they had and that was that. In a nutshell, I was displeased within 5 minutes upon entering the hotel. SO - my visit started out pretty bad and left a bad taste in my mouth from the get go - As I said to the desk clerk upon check-in: \"This was obviously a huge mistake on my part to have booked at this hotel\". My apologies to the DoubleTree down the street where I canceled in order to stay at this W. Now the room - oh my - THIS WAS THE SMALLEST HOTEL ROOM I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! So, from what I thought was going to be a suite to a large walk-in closet - you can imagine my feelings. So yada-yada, the stay started out very bad. On the good side - the room was very clean, tastefully appointed, and had the usual W amenities. The halls were nicely decorated and clean as well. The maids were very professional (especially the one I had on my 1st day - Hilda?) and attentive. Room service was pretty good (though pricey). All in all, though the hotel was OK in the end, this was my first, and last stay at the W New York. I've stayed now at 6 W properties, and this one is NOT on the same par with the others. Businesses should take note of why customers are dissatisfied and it started with the suite not being available (although I was able to book it on-line), but probably would have not been as bad had the manager on duty been more congenial and accommodating with the issue - it was her attitude that really set off my feelings from the start. Oh - I had to argue with her to reduce the rate initially (since I wasn't being given what had been promoted - as I saw it, a bait and switch tactic), and she was annoyed at my request. All that aside, the room was tiny - really tiny.

We arrived after 5 on Friday and the Living Room as they call it was alive with music and mingling. Check-in was quick and easy and the staff was very very polite. We chose a mega room for our stay. There was security in the lobby, very discretely dressed, known by the W pin on their lapel. After midnight or so you have to present your room key to get past the lobby. Our room was a corner room. After having read reviews about the size of New York hotel rooms I was impressed. We had a large space to relax in while we were in the room. Very modern in appearance and very clean. The lighting did leave a little to be desired in certain sections of the room, but for reading in bed or working at the desk it was fine. The housekeeping staff as well as other staff members always had a smile and a greeting when you met them in the halls. Refreshing is being done to the facade of the building yet we weren't disturbed by it at all. Apparently from information in one of the books in the room, this is the first W hotel. Located directly behind the Waldorf Astoria, a block from the 51st street subway, the location was great for access to most anywhere. The walk to Central Park, Madison Ave and Fifth Ave shopping was easy and pleasant. Directly behind the hotel is a great pizza restaurant, also 2 Italian restaurants and a Japanese restaurant. CVS is 3 blocks north. Anyway, great place to stay. Will definitely stay there again. The only complaint I have about the hotel is there are no drink machines in the building. I don't know if this is common in New York, but at 2 AM when you are thirsty, you don't want to call room service and have to wait and pay a small fortune for soda. Run to CVS when you get there and grab a soda or some water. There is a mini-bar in the room as well as snacks.

Below is the notice I provided the hotel to give them an opportunity to make up for not being advised upon check-in that I would hear the sounds of drilling and hammering outside my window in the morning. They requested I let them know if I return for another stay at the hotel so they can show a \"true, W experience.\" No way guys...you lost that trust. \"I am writing to inform you about an unfortunate incident during a recent stay from April 11-14 at the W Hotel New York. By way of background, I would mention that I have been a loyal customer to Starwood Hotels, in particular to the W Hotels. During the past few months, I have been traveling regularly to NY for firm business and have developed a preference for the property at which I stayed last week, and my prior visits had been very pleasant. Early on the morning of April 12, we were awakened by the unpleasant sounds of hammering and drilling right outside our window. I immediately called the Whatever, Whenever line, informed them of the noise, and asked the drilling and hammering be stopped. The hotel representative said she would find out what's going on and have it stopped. Five minutes pass and the noise continues. I call again and the hotel representative tells me they cannot stop the drilling and hammering, but can move us to another room on the other side of the building if we choose. I replied that we were half asleep and not dressed so that was not an agreeable option for us at that moment. She said they couldn't do anything else, and I said that I would talk to my girlfriend to see what we were going to do. The hotel representative replied that she would have the hotel manager call me shortly to see what we decided to do. I never received that call from the manager. When I returned to the hotel early that afternoon on April 12, I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came out to the lobby, greeted me, and mentioned that he heard there was a problem with noise outside our bedroom window that morning and offered to upgrade our room and move us to the other side of the building for the following two nights. I mentioned to him that I was following up because I was expecting a call back from him as the hotel representative said would happen, but did not. He said that he was standing right next to that representative when she took the call, and that I was told that they were waiting for me to let them know what I wanted to do. First impression -- I could not believe the manager was basically telling me that I heard incorrectly and challenging me in the first 15 seconds of our meeting. He then asked me if I would like to be moved to the upgraded room for the next two nights. I said yes, and asked him why we were not informed about this hotel condition upon check-in or at any other time (during my previous stays at that property, I have always stayed on a side of the hotel facing the street). He said there is notice in the welcome letter that guests receive at check-in. I told him we never received any welcome letter or notice, because if we had, we would have made a change immediately. He simply replied that we should have received something, and dismissed the issue. I proceeded to ask him how he would like to handle the previous-night's sleep that was unpleasantly interrupted by conditions at the hotel. He replied that there was no problem with the prior night's stay and that his remedy was his offering to move us to another room for the remainder of our stay. He simply stated that he thought the upgraded room he was offering made up for everything and he would do nothing more about our bad experience that first night. In short, I believe an uninterrupted night's sleep goes without saying as what a basic hotel offers its guests, and a W Hotel typically provides that and much, much more. I did not receive even the basics that first night's stay.\" A few emails and a phone call with Starwood customer care for a few points thrown my way.

Hallways leading to the room were a bit cramped. There was no view from our room and the windows was small. Staff was courteous and I have to give top marks to service. W even had \"Acura service\" which is a private driver that takes you anywhere within a certain distance from the hotel. Please note that the lobby can be very noisy and crowded as it seems to be a popular place to go for a drink. Not a problem for me, but it felt like walking into a bar or night club even in the middle of the day. I Paid $273 a night including all taxes and fees, a bit expensive but so are other luxury designer hotels in New York.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK south coast", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "bognorman", "ReviewID": "UR67612770", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews about the W on Lexington, I have to write to say they are vvery undeserved.

Room service was typically overpriced, but there are so many great restaurants in the area that it didn't really matter. The concierge provided us with a printout of restaurant recommendations upon request, and both of the places we tried from the list were excellent. This hotel takes security seriously. You have to use your room key to access the guest room floors via the elevator and security asked guests for their keys prior to letting them past the lobby during the evening when the lobby bar was full. Beware that this hotel, like other Starwood hotels, has a minibar that automatically adds items to your room bill if you so much as bump into them.

The room is small (just like any other NYC hotel room) but what makes it worse is that the air conditioning vent is just besides the bed.

You better be the only person sleeping on the bed. They claimed to have the most comfy bed but they might have forgotten to add in that's provided you are the only person sleeping on the bed. I was awoken whenever my partner tossed and turned. The bed is so soft and a good night sleep was impossible. 4. The good part is if you are a gym fanatic, the fitness centre is quite impressive.

I've been aware of the \"super tiny\" size of the rooms (about 170sqft, cos it's NYC), and the not so friendly hotel staff, from previous review, and that had made my stay more pleasant. The room was tiny, clean, cleverly designed, not too well-lit but gives you basically what you need, as in you won't be spending too much time in the room while traveling in NYC. The bed was really comfortable and I really regret not having tried their \"pillow menu\", which you could ask for different kinds of pillow (don't know if there's an extra charge though). The small but clean bathroom is a big plus, especially when it's loaded with high quality Bliss Spa products, which are quite expensive from their store. I really enjoyed the shower area and the decor of the bathroom, which the hotel promoted on their website. As for other in-room amenities, the Tivoli Audio Speakers doesn't work with my iPod Touch; it only works with earlier models. The TV also give you access to their extensive video library, which I didn't watch any cos it's too expensive. NEVER TOUCH THE MINI BAR and SURROUNDING AREA. the hotel have installed censors there and even if you touch or move something, they will charge you. I accidentally moved the box of band-aid and it costed me $9, but the hotel was fair about this, at check-out, I told the front door staff about this and she took it off my bill. so another tip, double check your bill before leaving. there's free wifi in the lobby so didn't pay extra for that in the room I'd have to agree with other travelers' comment about the bad service at the hotel. I've been told of the New Yorker attitude before the trip and didn't expect much from the staff so it was just alright. The front desk staff are pretty much just performing their duties, the concierge desk is often unattended, the bellboy and house keepers are nicer than other staff. Another thing I noted about the service, is that they often asked about how you think of the service or your stay at the hotel, and whether you'd be staying there again on your next trip. I told them \"yes\" because what I want most from NYC hotel is cleanliness, safety, and location. the location of this hotel is fantastic, 2 mins walk to the #6 subway train, 5 mins walk to pharmacy for daily essentials, 7 mins walk to Rockefella Plaza and 15 mins walk to Times Square.

We called hotel maintenance and the engineer came up and said \"I've never seen a room like this\". That was not very helpful to us. He spent a further 30 mins to arrange a complex extension lead!! 4) Later in the evening, we phoned concierge for a list of recommended Chinese restaurants - they did not answer the phone but we were asked to leave our request on an answer machine. No one called us back!!! 5) Be warned the lifts are a nightmare in this hotel! No-one tells you that you have to insert your card for them to work but even when you do, your card does not work.

It started with an early check-in (very unusual!) and the great service cotinued throughout our stay and extended to the lady serving us at Whiskey Blue, who without hesitation was able to whip up our 'favourite' cocktail just by telling her the ingredients and then she just kept them coming!! I would like to say a special thank you to 'Tiny' for always making us feel safe, and Augustine for his attentiveness and service. They really did make our stay here feel special. So much so we wanted to buy them a 'thank you' bottle of champagne and i have NEVER been inclined to do that before! I /we will definitely be back for that special brand of 'W' hospitality! If you like a hotel with a buzz that starts from the lobby (hang out and chat, watching the world go by, or just reading alone) then you will like the W New York it is the perfect 'girlfriend getaway' place to stay. Whatever was missing in terms of service historically (based on the previous reviews i've read here) based on our stay here, the W New York must be bringing it back, so well done!! One minus point - it's time to offer free wi-fi connections in the hotel rooms don't you think??

After I pre-paid for the room, I started to get really negative feedback about the hotel, and specifically their rooms. I called the hotel a day before arriving, and requested a corner Mega Room as was displayed in their photos. They confirmed it was noted on our booking. However on entering the room, it was NOT a corner room, and didn't look much like the photo. The room we got was so average - very bare, NOT a corner, tiny bathroom, zero ambiance, and ABSOLUTELY not worth the cost. I have stayed in hotel rooms around the world ranging from $60-$600. I have never felt so ripped off by the price of a room as I did at this W. I understand it's NY, and I've never stayed at another W, but I don't intend to after this stay. The lobby is very busy. The staff were quick and mostly efficient, but often rushed through their duties at the expense of a welcoming and full-service experience. Lastly, on our final night, we were surprised at 4am by a mouse rustling through the mini-bar items in our 8th floor room. Disgusting. We were removed immediately from the room, and management seemed genuinely surprised and apologetic. Because we booked our reservation through hotels.com, they said they could not credit back my credit card for that night's cost. Instead they comp'd us with SPG points in the amount of a free night, and comp'd breakfast. I was fine with this correction, though others may not have been. I thinks it's important to share how management deals with issues such as these. So in short, they stay was average, or slightly below. Definitely not worth the money.

I had a drink at the bar, went up, could not get into my room. Went down, got a new key, could not get into my room. Repeated the exercise, could not get in again. In exasperation, I went down and slammed the card on the desk and the ruffian manning the desk, who was not in the least bothered that a guest was having trouble getting into a room they paid for, admonished me for my behavior. Then I spoke to a supervisor type, who sent me upstairs and I waited on the couch on my floor in a dismal narrow corridor for perhaps 15 minutes. Finally a maintenance guy showed up - the battery in the electronic door lock had failed. It was not the stupid foreign guest not knowing how to use the key, after all. I complained to SPG and all they did was to give me a few free points, which I earn in a couple of days in any given week seeing how much I travel. I was tempted to put this down to a New Yorker attitude - but as a former New Yorker, and having been served better at other SPG hotels in New York, that would be untrue.

I have a lot of friends in the city, I attend charity events, and I go for work on occasion. Most of the time I stay at the W or Westin in Times Square. Due to the proximity of a dinner I had to attend with my husband on this occasion I chose the W New York instead. This property is much older than the ones in Times Square so the rooms are smaller. The decor was nice, having just finished extensive renovations. However, this is the first time I was downgraded from the room I paid for. I have been upgraded many times at Starwood properties but this was a first. When we checked in the desk clerk called someone about our room but didn't say anything to us. She handed us our room keys and I asked if this was the Mega room that I booked. She told us that yes it was the Mega room. I guess she didn't know that we stay at W's a lot and would notice if she gave us a smaller room. As soon as I walked in I knew it was the wrong room. We were late for our dinner (people were waiting in the lobby for us) so we decided to deal with it at check out. We were leaving the room when the phone rang, it was the desk clerk downstairs telling us she made a mistake and gave us the wrong room so she had upgraded us to a suite for our inconvenience. We were happy she had decided to own up to her mistake but we were really late at this point. I went alone to switch the room so my husband could meet up with our friends. The suite was a very small, handicap accessible room, with a terrible view and a tiny bed. Not at all what I wanted, when you sleep in a big bed, downsizing is not fun. The view in the smaller room was better, it had a king sized bed, and a bigger bathroom. At this point I could not take the time to argue and just accepted it but I didn't need the miniature living room since we only wanted to sleep in the room. The bigger bedroom is what I wanted and I am still upset with the tiny bedroom we got stuck with. After dinner we went to The Whiskey Bar with our friends. From dinner until the end of the evening I had a glass of wine and two drinks over an eight hour period. In addition to four glasses of water and an espresso. I had just ordered a water and taken a couple drinks from it when I went to the bathroom. I was feeling fine, not at all tipsy until I reached the bathroom. I collapsed in the stall, I could not see or hear correctly and my legs would not hold my weight. After about an hour I was able to make it back downstairs, meet up with my husband (who, along with my friends had been frantically searching for me) and made it to my room where I passed out.

My three colleagues and I booked 4 rooms, each of us expressed disappionted and will never stay there again. And we are not fussy people, all of us are frequent world travellers, we spend dozens of nights each year in NYC, staying at varoius mid-priced hotels or University clubs. Here is a summary of my experience at the W Lexington Avenue. This very busy section of Lexington Avenue - the sirens and horns blared well after midnight (luckily I had my earplugs with me). The windows are not soundproof as at other hotels. - you will need earplugs if your room faces the street. The rooms are small, which is expected in NYC, but the W's rooms are especially small, more like large closets, with no place other than the bed to set a suitcase, barely any room to get around the bed. And I had the deluxe corner room. - I am no fan of \"form over function\" and the W's rooms reek of form, with little practicality (for example the light switches are fussy push buttons with skinny slide dimmers, cutesy little signs on them, etc., closet light is built into the rack rather than overhead, etc.). And, to boot, many of the floor and table lights were UNPLUGGED in my room, really frustrating when I tried the wall switches, buttons on the lamps, etc. just to get a light to turn on! I finally realized the maid or prior guest must had unplugged them. Understandable - but someone from the hotel needs to pay attention to these things. As I walked to my room after check in, there were three room service trays, in front of three different rooms - with BREAKFAST DISHES (this was at 5pm). And, just in front of my room a big unattended hotel valet luggage cart was completely blocking the hall. I moved it aside and it was in the same location hours later. At check in I encountered an cheery front desk staff, and I was provided a card with a name and invitation to call with any questions or problems. When I left for dinner around 6pm I informed the person identified on the card that they should ask someone to remove the breakfast dishes. They expressed great shock over this and said they were \"soooooo sorry.\" When I returned from dinner at 10pm the dishes were still in the hallway. This is a perfect example of the \"friendliness with no follow through\" that is often evidenct in poorly run establishments. After returning from dinner I noted that the \"turndown\" maid service left a printed note inviting me for coffee and a danish in the front lobby the following morning. I thought that was a nice touch, offered as token of goodwill for my less than perfect experience at the hotel thus far. The following morning I poured a coffee from the urn in the lobby, took a danish and presented the note to person watching me from behind the bar. She took the note, went to a cash register and presented me with a tab for around $10! I said there must be a misunderstanding, since had I given her the note inviting me for coffee and a danish. Her reply \"no, that is only an invitation - nothing here is free for our guests\". I gulped down my breakfast and vowed to never again set foot in the W Hotel, Lexington Ave. You would be wise to do so as well.

Front desk staff, bellboys and doormen all seemed to be too cool and socially engaged to assist you. We felt no love, no warmth or even friendliness. Upon arrival, my husband and me had to drag our luggage by ourselves all the way up to our room without any staff offering their assistance to us. I'd lived in NYC for 10 years and had never met this kind of rudeness before. 2. The elevators are tiny and we often had trouble operating them: we had to insert our keys at least a couple of times for the beeping sound to appear before we were able to press any buttons. Seriously, W Hotel, with the rate you charged for your rooms I think you can afford an upgrade of your elevator operating system. 3. Bathroom mirrors are located too high, the sink was slow to drain; oh and the bathroom is ridiculously small. 4. The mini bar is outragiously expensive and is tricked with the latest technology so that if you remove or touch anything inside for more than 30 seconds, they'll charge you for it even if you do not plan to drink/consume it.5. We asked for a late check-out on our last day, and we were supposed to vacate before 4 pm. Way before the time arrived, the cleanig ladies and various staff had come and knocked our door to inquire \"If everything's okay\" and \"If indeed we would be leaving by 4 pm.\" Way to make your guests feel welcome (not!), W Hotel. I can go on and on about what made our stay there unpleasant but I'll save my breath and end with this: Avoid staying here.

The room was small, even by NY standards. While it was tastefully furnished with comfortable twin beds, the lighting is ambient and impossible to really see anything. Since the room is so small, why they have chosen to take up valuable space with a huge mini bar boggles my mind. There were two drawers for clothes. But it does have a large closet that has its own light. The bathroom, of course, is small and very hot!!! There is no fan or AC vent in it and it appears that some sort of heating system is embedded in the wall and radiates extra heat. We also had a lot of difficulty with the room heatling and cooling. Now they always responded quickly to our requests, but they replaced the entire unit three times. Each time it would work for a while and then quit blowing cold air. Now even though I'm not an engineer, even I would think that 3 units could not all be faulty. Finally the last maintenance person just reset the signal between the thermostat and the unit and it worked again. The hotel did make proper amends for the incovenience, but still we had several very warm nights. There is a large safe in the room that is a nice touch along with big robes for your use. The bedding was upscale and very comfy and the big flat screen tv was mounted on a pole and could be seen in any direction. They also provide two wine glasses and a wine bottle opener in the room, another nice touch. However, there is not a coffee maker in the room. The free use of the Acura is wonderful and the staff there is very accomodating. You can schedule it whenever it is free to take you reasonable distances. Can save lots in cab fare. (note: they will not pick you up from someplace but will take you from the hotel). We had breakfast at the hotel several times and the food was very good, but of course, at NY prices. Across Lexington about 2 blocks toward 45th, there is a pizza, sandwich and breakfast place that has two eggs, homefries and toast for $2.99. Best deal around if you don't mind going out. The restaurant is not open for dinner but will be happy to deliver room service with about, in the aggregate, a 30% surcharge. There is a bar in the hotel and a living room where people sit for cocktails. However, they play this \"house music\" very loudly and it really is for a young crowd. It is also played on the elevator and is very annoying. You can use the business center computer for about $1.00 a minute. You can, however, print out your boarding pass for free in the lobby. My daughter and I both used the Bliss Spa and we were very disappointed. This is not a first class spa. My manicure took 12 minutes!!! My daughter said it was the most expensive and worst massage she ever had. When I went to check out, the line to pay was 8 people deep. We were not impressed. We also were not impressed that you had to pay $16.95 for internet service in your room. You could use wireless service in the living room area so I saw many folks taking up seats in this cocktail area and just using their laptops. I know I did. The hotel is not very near good shopping. You can walk to it but it is a little hike. There were really few restaurants nearby either. It is close to Grand Central which is an experience in itself. The concierge was very helpful and we used this service many times. The front desk staff was also very accomodating and helped in any way they could.

The W not only let us stay on points in prime season, the staff made our stay the one part of the trip that was hassle-free. They were friendly and every request was met with an attitude of \"no problem, we'll take care of it\". We didn't know from day to day when we would be able to get a flight out, and the front desk staff made sure we didn't have to worry about it - they blocked us in the same room and were extremely flexible with us, recognizing that we had no control over the airline dilemma! In past years, prior to the renovation at this hotel, I had experienced an attitude among the staff that was in no way backed up or warranted by the quality of the experience. They were riding on the coattails of the W Hotel chain's reputation. The rooms and hallways were very worn and past their prime, yet the staff often acted like we were lucky to be there since it was so \"cool.\" The rooms are still small, but they are much nicer post-renovation, and the attitude of the staff has completely changed for the better - we were made to feel that our business was appreciated and that they were happy to help. I will definitely go back, and would encourage others who may have had mediocre experiences in the past to give them another chance - you may be pleasantly surprised.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLovely stay at the W\u201d", "Author": "Rioca", "ReviewID": "UR54663800", "Content": "Perfect location to take in all of NYC.

I regularly stay at the W New York, because its the best value option of the Starwood group in that area. For the price point, its not too bad for what it is. Think of it as a reasonably priced, budget, mid-range hotel. With that way of thinking, you will get everything you expect. Stylish lobby and attempts to be eccentric with the style of the hallway furniture on each floor help, so it looks better than a budget hotel, but in many cases I have had better service at Best Westerns and Holiday Inns - so its all about the balance here at the W New York. The rooms are always clean, the toiletries from Bliss I love and are regularly replaced (so feel free to collect for the use at home). Expect the prices for everything else to be ridiculous to the point that is well worth taking a few mins walk to get food and drink. One of these days Starwood will reduce the price of Wifi, or just make it free, but expect to drop $16.00 for 24 hour access. The biggest issue, and this happens everytime I check in, is that the front of house staff are socializing with the door or bell-staff to the point where you go largely unnoticed forcing you to interrupt the ongoing conversation. Generally, its not the experience that draws me back, but the price point and my loyalty to Starwood - I just wish they would make it a bit easier to stay loyal whenever I visit the W New York.

It's one thing to be hip, modern, and cool, but none of that works if you can't see it. The only option for the window shade is a thick fabric shade that lets in NO light. The bathroom lighting was also inadequate. Somebody mentioned the lighting in the elevators -- I'm not sure if the W put more light in there, but we didn't find that too dark.

I really think some people just complain about anything for the sake of complaining! Yes we got the hotel at a great deal and yes the walls in the rooms could do with a bit of paint but other than that we had no issues. We turned up at 12pm and although we had requested an early check in time at 1pm we were intially told we could not check in till 3pm however as we were storing our bags in the lobby to go walkabout a lovely gentleman came over and told us they had found a room for us and we could check in straightaway. We were given a Spectacular Room which had 2 full windows so lots of light and no less than 5 other light sources so not only was it lightfilled but nicely spacious too, complete with walk in wardrobe. We had a lovely view of the Waldorf across the street and the skyline. The bed was super comfy with a large flat screen tv at the base. The aircon wasnt any noisier than any other hotel and we could lower/higher/turn off as we pleased. The mini bar prices werent overly expensive and we didnt get charged for anything we didnt take. The bathroom itself was lovely, nice and bright & the reviews about it being too small and too dark were unfounded.. its compact (its NYC!) but not too small.. nice large pedestal sink and huge shower/showerhead and the 1/2 door is more than ample to stop water on the floor. We had lovely fluffy towels replaced whenever we wanted and fluffy robes to match. Bliss products delivered every day whether we had used our quota or not and our room cleaned everyday also (we never saw anyone, it was like magic.. we just returned to a lovely fresh room each day!) The only slight downside if even, is that the bathroom \"door\" is just a slider and it doesnt actually meet the wall when you close it so if you are prudish then it may not suit as it just gives the element of privacy rather than actual privacy! :-) We found the staff extremely courteous and helpful and they always answered our queries (But note if they point you in the direction of Raffles cafe for brekkie dont go unless u want to spend over $60 on a not so good brekkie .. id say the hotel itself is a better bet!) and theres loads of good tasty cheap cafes nearby (Europa Cafe) for original NYC breakfast. The lobby is lovely and always busy & the Whiskey Blue bar is hopping at night but we never heard it from our room and had great night's sleep.

Our three night stay was the first trip away from the kids in 6 years and I didn't want it to go off the rails from day one. My concerns were misplaced - it was a great stay. Good Surprises: Renovations appeared complete, our room was newly redone and while the room was small it was designed with the purpose and not just thrown together. As for rooms being dark, we disagree, I counted 6 different sources of lighting in the bedroom all of them relatively subtle which is better than glaring. The bathroom (which many complained about) is great. The glass shower stall has a half door but we didn't experience water on the floor. In fact the oversized showerhead is high enough for me (6' 3\") to stand under with room to spare. Huge pedastal sink. The Bliss shower gels (Lemon) and other amenities are great, so make sure to get your daily quota. Very comfortable bed. Great Tivoli bedside clock radio with iPod dock. Whiskey Blue (off the lobby) is definitely a happening bar - loud and packed. Water with berries in the morning and hot cider in the afternoon next to elevators, a great start and end to a day of touring. A block away from 51st street subway station so getting to SOHO or the Village is easy. Midtown is convenient to everything. Bad surprises: View, was less than good, it included air conditioning equipment, a multilevel parking garage and the back of restaurants. No sunlight, dracula is safe. But we actually didn't care because we didn't come to New York to sit by our hotel window. So we kept the blind closed. Air conditioning/heater unit wasn't quiet, but this is often the case in hotels I find. The thermostat has little switches on the underside which when set to ECONO shut the thing off - I prefered to open the window ( YES the windows open - Hurray!) a crack and get the city air. Valet parking is $60 per day. Park it instead at the pristine ICON Parking a 1.5 blocks away on 51st just east of Lex for $43 a day (including tax).

W hotels have a reputation for being hipand modern but I got the impression that was a good excuse to rip you off. The foyer and lounge area (which is far too small for hotel of this size) were dimly lit and it's not my idea of fun to sit in the gloom in the middle of the day when there's bright sunshine outside. Okay, I don't want it to be brightly lit either but there is a balance. We had a 'not quite the smallest' room and it was a reasonable size with a very good shower room and large walk in closet. The best thing to say about the room was the decent sized, very comfortable bed. The worst things were the lack of decent lighting and the ridiculously noisy air conditioning. I challenge the management of W hotels to stay in some of their rooms to see what it's really like. It's okay to have sexy mood lighting when it's appropriate but definitely not okay in the bathroom or when you're getting dressed to go out.

The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but it was fine - we weren't in the room too much anyway.

I didn't read other people's reviews only because I was being hosted by my company and had no choice but it was absolutely awful. I stayed here for three nights this past week and was shocked and appalled at how many things went wrong at what is supposed to be a hotel that prides itself on service. Granted, I realized the city was very busy with VMAs, Fashion Week, and the US Open, so it was crowded - but I had no idea how many things would be out of order. Cons: 1. Check-in was delayed (likely due to the busy week in the city - still, guests shouldn't have to wait for 2 hours simply to check-in). 2. The television in the living room of my suite did not work and calls downstairs were not returned. I didn't press it because I had a TV in the bedroom and didn't have time to watch it anyway, but it should have been fixed. 3. Minor point that is not their fault at all but there are a ton of wireless networks in the area and W Guest Rooms wireless network doesn't work that great/show up all the time. Beware of this if you go there so you won't enter your credit card info into some other hotel's network (W doesn't ask for that info). 4. I had to print several documents and the printers weren't working in the Wired center. They didn't have a backup option and a staff member graciously printed them for me from her own computer (after I waited 20 minutes at the concierge desk). I had no way of learning the printers weren't working, however, until I got so frustrated and called on one of the phones near the computers. No sign was posted though they knew about it. 5. Checking out, I was given two bills (one that didn't even belong to me) and one that was \"mine\" but had $120 in minibar charges (I never touch the minibar). I called them to correct it...and they produced another IDENTICAL bill without the charges removed. 6. The final straw was that I left my bag there upon checking out, and they LOST IT. And by lost I mean they misplaced it and couldn't find it when I went to retrieve it. I must admit that they were very polite and thorough and found it within 2 hours but I was inconvenienced by the delay and anxious the entire time that my bag was on its way to Johannesburg or something. Pros: 1. Lovely room 2. Friendly staff - everyone greeted me in the hallway in a kind manner 3. Good service from the housekeeping I'm so glad I wasn't paying for this stay.

The W hotels advertise (incessantly) that they cater to every wish, yet it was nearly impossible to get the concierge or Whatever/Whenever services on the phone. When I made a very simple and very polite request for firmer pillows after sleeping on super-flat feather pillows the first night, the gentleman on the other end of the phone said with a sigh \"we'll see what's available\" and promptly hung up on me before I could respond.

I tried to order room service late one evening (during hours where room service is regularly served), but there was no answer after several minutes of waiting for someone to pick up.

Approximately 25 minutes before checking out, I called down to the front desk and gave them my name and valet ticket number. They said the car would be ready in 30 minutes. We went downstairs to find that Lexington Avenue was shut down for a street fair--something the staff did not mention on the phone. When I asked the front desk where we would find the valet, since the street was shut down, I got a rude response, a shrugged shoulder and then a point to the side street where the valet and taxi stand were operating temporarily. We went outside, handed the ticket to the valet, and I noted that we had called ahead. The valet responded snottily, \"They don't pull the car until I call them.\" We waited another 15 minutes on the street before our car was brought around. Certainly we understood the staff's frustration in dealing with the traffic and problems created by the street being shut down, but they were flat-out rude to us without any provocation.

We were supposed to stay at my brother's apartment but the keys didn't work so we had to scramble for a hotel. We were able to book a \"studio suite\" for 14,500 Starwood points on a Saturday night. There was also a \"newly renovated room\" available for 13,500 points, and a \"standard\" room for 12,000 points. These rates compared favorably with another W in NYC that we checked that only had a standard room available for 20,000 points. The lobby had a cool, trendy vibe. Doormen were helpful with directions, cabs, etc. Our room was on the same floor as Bliss spa which was a bit odd but not a problem. The room (a \"studio suite\") had a small living room and a small bedroom. The living room was very funky, with a not-so-comfortable \"modern\" couch and an enormous light on a pole that we had to mess around with to turn on. In the bedroom, the bed was the smallest queen we've ever seen. We're not sure if this hotel has kings (each of the rooms described to us had a queen), but we're not very big people and we were pretty cramped in the bed. It was honestly bad enough that we'd probably look elsewhere next time. The lighting was pretty dim, but adequate. The shower in our room was one of those modern ones that doesn't have any kind of a break in the floor between the shower and the rest of the bathroom. Not really our style, but it didn't flood the rest of the bathroom. We give four stars because maybe we just need a king bed, but we have a hard time believing most couples would be comfortable in the supposedly queen-sized bed that we slept in. One additional tip: if you remove ANYTHING from the mini-bar, even just so you can put a bottled water of your own in there, they will charge you for it.

I was given the key to our room. When we got to our room I opened the door and saw that there were guests already in the room!! I was in shock!! I went back down to the front desk and explained that the room was already taken. The front desk lady could care less and gave me the key to another room. No apology. Nothing. The room was seriously the smallest room I have ever seen! The bathroom was so small there wasn't even any room for a shower door. I doubt the bathroom was bigger than 5 feet by 7 feet. The fridge was full of overpriced food and drink so we couldn't use it at all. At 5pm we asked for a roll away bed ($25 extra). After dinner the roll away was not delivered. By this time it was 10pm. We called down to the front desk and asked again for the roll away. They said it would be up soon. At 11pm when the bed was still not delivered we called again about the bed. We were told they didn't have any roll away beds. I was so upset I asked why they hadn't told me that at 5pm or at 10pm. They tried to transfer me to the manager. We got 'cut off.' I called back to let them know that I wanted to speak to the manager. They told me a manager would call back. After another hour I called back to the front desk and just asked for blankets and a pillow. Our son was going to sleep on the floor. By about 12:30 we finally got a roll away bed! Unfortunately, we had to move the bed in the room to the wall to even FIT the roll away bed in the room!!!! The size of the room? The size of one double bed and one single bed.

It's right across the street from Waldorf-Astoria. About 11 blocks to Times Square, 5 to the Chrysler Building and Grand Central, 4 to the U.N. building, and 3 blocks to the nearest subway station. We walked and took the subway everywhere. Very convenient and cheap. Didn't have to deal with the staff that much, but experienced no issues when I did. Front desk was very pleasant. I didn't use any hotel services as I wasn't in there much, except to sleep. I checked out using the internet...18 bucks a day. No thanks! And 9 bucks for a Heineken out of the minibar.

The negatives - over the past year, they haven't really kept up the rooms - they're starting to look a little worn. The largest problem is that the air conditioning unit in our room was not maintained. (our condo had a similar problem and it's something that happens over time but absolutely needs to be addressed before it reaches this extent of neglect.) The problem : we couldn't regulate the temperature within the room and it was making the most horrible screeching/ grinding sound. I was absolutely unable to sleep the entire night (I'm a city dweller and used to a lot of noise - so this noise was exceptionally loud. I was somewhat frustrated and called the front desk because the noise was so loud. I could barely communicate with the person at the front desk because the noise was so loud. The person answering the phone was not at all helpful and told me that sometimes the ac makes sounds. (seriously? you don't say, but when we can hardly hear each other over the phone, there is a HUGE problem with the unit). I then made the front desk aware at checkout that the AC in ROOM 1540 is extremely loud an needs attention - the woman at the check out desk didn't even bother to fake concern. She offered me 1/10 of a free hotel stay if I earn enough points by continuing to stay with their hotels- no thanks!!! I then followed up the the GM by writing a nice, succinct email.

The W New York underwent renovations in August 2008, but do not be fooled; the service remains sub-par. In other words, when the W New York wishes to play the role of fairy godmother and asks what is your wish, the magic wand disappears when you have the audacity to make one. My modest wish over the Superbowl weekend was to watch Superbowl XLIII in high definition in the comfort of my hotel room. To avoid misunderstanding, I contacted the hotel on three separate occasions prior to booking to confirm that I would be able to watch the game in high definition. All three times, employees assured me I would be able to do so. You can imagine my frustration when I learned that while the new flatscreen televisions were high definition capable, none of the programming being broadcast was in high definition, other than the initial hotel welcome channel. When I informed a manager about this misrepresentation, he offered nothing more than a credit of one hundred dollars. Other frustrations included being billed thirty-two dollars for minibar consumption despite never having consumed anything from the minibar and housekeeping staff being instructed to knock on our door half-an-hour before check-out and again a few minutes prior to check-out despite a do not disturb sign having been placed on the door. If there was a positive note during the stay, it was W New York's association with Acura called the Acura Experience. This gives any guest who stays two consecutive nights at the hotel the opportunity to be dropped off in a chaffeur-driven Acura MDX virtually anywhere in Manhattan during your visit free of charge. Upon my return home, I received an e-mail from the hotel suggesting that while it expected I had a spectacular stay, I could write about anything that was not satisfactory.

This didn't bother us as we didn't sit in the lobby much anyway. The veiw was limited to the building opposite and the room on our floor was very dark all day but it was easy to relax in after a hectic day in New York. The entire hotel was spotlessly clean and ultra modern in design. The room service prices were unbelievable and considering the hotel are so good about you bringing in food from the many sources on Lexington there is no need to do so.

The location of the hotel was good, we never had to walk for too long (as long as you are fit and able its fine and taxis were reasonable if not) Quite far from Bloomingdales ad the financial district - so if your going take advantage a plan to spend the day in that area but we went to cetral park nearly everyday as only a 15-20 min walk.

No need to complain about the room service though because it's NEW YORK CITY! There's a great restaurant on every corner... At the time of our stay, the W was engaged in a joint venture with Acura. This service allows you to book a private car (an Acura MDX) that can give you a lift to wherever you want (in Manhattan). This program was AMAZING and super helpful! The coordinators of the program were awesome as well. All the staff we encountered were kind and helpful. Nothing seemed out of place and/or shabby throughout what we saw of the hotel.

Everyone gathers in the lobby to see and be seen while catching up on the newspaper or a little news on the flatscreens. I agree that this brand tries a little too hard to be cool. If you are in the mood, it's fun. The bar, Whiskey Blue, takes on a life of it's own after hours and it needs the team of hot bouncers that guard the doors and the elevators. They look like the New York Giants working off duty. Let's just say... if you don't want the atmosphere that requires this type of security, don't go here. While being entertaining and literally exhausting, this club is an upscale meat market. The hot security boys enjoy making their own moves on the guests! This is no place for rookies, so be smart.

I like Bliss, but I don't get it. The brightly colored cartoonish nature of these products reminds me of a 13 year old's birthday party.

Overall, I must say that the W New York delivers what it promises, but no more. The hotel is often so busy, that it becomes unpersonal and the staff are not as complacent as they should be in a W-caliber hotel. I have stayed, many times, at other W properties, and the staff are friendlier and even greet you by name. The experience at ground level delivers the W promise quite well. Bars are full and crowd is hip, nice and beautiful. The decor in the bars is not exceptional and one can say that there are for sure many more beautiful and cooler bars in New York, but hey, this is New York and that in itself is a statement. The hotel becomes another animal by night, and there is a clear difference of its ambiance during the day hours as that from 6 PM and on. My room was decent-sized for New York standards, which would make a Texas man feel cramped for sure. There was space for only the essential, but the appointments, furniture and gadgets were all in excellent shape and of very good quality. Perhaps my only complaint would be that the rooms are unnecesarily dark. This is a clear case of function following form, where the dark design makes it unpractical to find items in one's luggage, as it really is dark, night and day. The food was OK, nothing to write home about and some items were a bit on the greasy side. It may have had to do with choice, though. The meeting rooms were comfortable, of good size, but somehow uninspiring. Very plain-looking and with no \"punch\". The gym is OK, also. Nothing great, but above average from other hotels in the area. The spa, however, is worth a visit and if you have time, the amount and quality of the services offered is really outstanding.

We had booked a \"spectacular room\" and this was definitely not that. It turned out to be a \"cosy room\", two categories below ours and unless we had said something at the time then this is the room we would have had to stay in. Essentially, the difference between the two is the size and floor level. We were shown another room, but found that there was no bath. We were shown yet another which overlooked some sort of generator. We then decided to speak to the manager who turned out to be the \"talent coach\", according to his business card. Never heard of one of these before in a hotel and wondered what his real function was. He showed us another room which also had just a shower and eventually we found a room with a bath and shower over. It took forever for our luggage to be delivered there and that was after a 'phone call to find out what had happened to it. In the meantime we had also requested a tea/coffee maker in the room, but this was nowhere in sight so that meant another call. One was eventually delivered, but was so dusty and unlevel that I decided that it would be wise to run some clean water through it before we used it. Just as well because the water which came through was filthy with lots of horrible black clumps in it. I also washed out the two mugs which were delivered and the one was full of white bits and something pink and sticky. We made one more 'phonecall and another coffee machine was later delivered, but the second machine was even worse than the first with three feet missing - where do they get these machines from?!! By this stage we decided to speak to the hotel manager, who had already left so we spoke the duty manager whom we invited to come to our room and see the problems for herself. She arrived armed with yet another coffee machine and mugs and apologised several times for what had happened and offered us complimentary breakfast the next day. She was actually very sweet and we felt a little sorry for her because her company was obviously letting her down. However when you are paying around \u00c2\u00a3350.00 a night without breakfast included then this is not what you expect. All in all, the whole experience was not enjoyable. The rooms are very small, the bathrooms are absolutely tiny and the room maids obviously do not consider it part of their daily routine to wash up the mugs after the coffee maker has been used by guests. The air-conditioning is also exceptionally noisy and it wakes you up in the middle of the night when it bursts into action and then again when it shuts down as it sounds like someone slamming a door! Being directly on Lexington Avenue is also very noisy, even on floor 16, as the traffic is constant and so are the sirens and car horns! Believe it or not we had stayed there several times before and this was our worst experience. Had we been paying a much lower rate per night then perhaps this may have been more tolerable, but still unacceptable. I also noticed that during our six night stay that our duvet cover was not changed at all. I know that there was a sheet underneath, but surely the whole bed should have been change during this period. There were also a few other niggles during our stay, but basically the real management there need to pull their socks up and check that standards are as high as they should be for this class hotel. Before I forget, the room lighting is totally inadequate. I know it is nice to have subdued lighting for relaxing, but when you want to read a newspaper for example you do not expect to have to go into the bathroom for clarity!

The spa is very cool and the massage (along with the brownie bar in the lounge) was excellent.

To note, the hotel was renovated in August 2008 of this year and as a result, the whole property looks and smells extremely clean. The staff themselves seem very proud of their new surroundings and eager to please their clientele. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a Fantastic suite on account of it being my birthday and received a small bottle of champagne as an added bonus along with a card from the hotel. Needless to say, this was beyond and above the hotel's duty to its guests and we were very grateful for the extra attention we received. The room we had was on the top floor of the hotel and was large and spacious, with an elegant modern vibe throughout. The bathroom was adequately sized with a rainforest showerhead (and a shower that could fit 3-4 people, if needed) and the room came complete with a small balcony. To point out some of the highlights: - No issues reserving the Acura experience - Welcome water and chocolates (made in-house) were available next to the elevators during all hours of the day. - Any service request (extra glasses, slippers, etc) was completed within 5 minutes of placing the call. - The W Concierge had great recommendations and passes for some of New York's hottest clubs. - There was an exceptional level of service in all areas of the hotel - from the SWEAT fitness facility all the way to the cleaning staff who took great care in providing extra amenities upon request.

I, along with most reviewers, read the poor reviews and set expectations low--- BUT I was very much surprised by a great hotel. Check in was easy and quick, although the SPG Rewards I used actually gave me a free night and one for half off rack rate- so I ultimately had two different reservations. That was the only hassle, having to trade in my room key for the second night stay. Walking up to the elevator we were greated with flavored lemonade and candies or cookies in the afternoon, and Tea and snacks in the morning. We stayed on the Spa Floor, getting off the Elevator was a pleasure.... smelling all the amazing Bliss Spa Products... we had a corner room that had ample space, a large closet and lots of room to move around. The AC was terrific, since we were in NYC in 94 Degree heat wave. There was a concern with the safe, and I couldn't get it re-opened, but we called security and they came up within ten minutes AND replaced the safe that day.... asking us, considerately, if we would mind if they enter the room while we weren't there. That was a nice touch.... I felt they respected their guests and wanted to please them. I did loose patience with the concierge, since he was held up with another couple, and I patiently waited on him for 20 minutes, and when he did answer my inquiry, it was short and not very helpful. He gave me a list of local restaurants which we tried: Megu for Sushi on First Ave was GREAT! Back to the hotel- I was very happy with the room and the service and the location. I would understand why reviewers would think that the room is small... but it is NY and a studio apartment the same size lists for $450,000.... so it is safe to say that the W is a good choice. The Valet parking is pricey, but again, once you park your car you will never have to touch it until you leave... The rates are high, but again it is NYC and the location can't be beat.... but remember if you need to take a taxi uptown, walk a block over to 3rd, so you can find one going north!

We left our luggage with the staff and went out for 90 minutes or so. When we came back, we were told that the room was still not ready. The lady behind the desk quickly organised one but we had to take our own bags up! When it came to leaving, we were catching a night flight and so asked if we could leave our luggage while we went out, which we were told we could. We then asked if there were any facilities available where we could grab a quick shower before heading off to the airport when we came back to collect our luggage. The girl behind the desk looked at us as though we had asked to take a leak in the middle of foyer. We carefully explained several times that many hotels have either a couple of rooms or separate facilites that guests could use on such occasions. She seemed utterly unwilling to help until she eventually made the effort to phone the in house spa who happily agreed to let us use their showers. In contrast , we found the concierge service very friendly and helpful when we needed it.

They mean it when they say \"Whatever/Whenever\". I called the front desk for printer paper at 2:00am, willing to go down to pick some up. It was at my door in about 5 minutes.

They were so nice and refreshing that I had to buy some larger packs from the spa shop downstairs. The comfy bed and pillows were just like being at home so I had some really restful sleeps (not usual when you stay away from home). The hotel is definately for the young and funky (or just the young at heart) . There is always cool music greeting you as you walk into the hotel and in the lifts. Whiskey Blue is great along with the living room bar adjacent to the reception. Comfy sofas, lovely ambience, etc. Their motto is whatever, whenever and they really do stick to it. They were so accommodating and nice and I will definately be returning to this hotel as I could not fault it. Who needs a huge room in New York? You only sleep and shower in it because there is so much to do you haven't got time to sit in your room all day!

We couldn't open the windows at night to get fresh air due to the street noise and the air con was really noisy. Also, the lock on our door was broken so the keys wouldn't work. This meant that every time we wanted to get into our room we had to stand around and wait for security to come and help us. Three times we were told that the door had been fixed and each time it wasn't. We asked for compensation for this (had paid about \u00c2\u00a3150 per room per night up front before arrival) and were offered a measly \u00c2\u00a350 to spend only in the bar of the hotel. And they even forgot to take this off our final room bill when we checked out! In general the hotel staff were rude and completely unhelpful. There were a few exceptions - such as the concierge and the doorman of the 'Whiskey room' bar but everyone else we came across treated us terribly (including the girl behind the bar who ignored us for 10 minutes when we were trying to get a drink and then snapped at us that it was last orders and the two women on reception when we checked out who right in front of us talked about us to each other in Spanish).

While the room and facilities were fine, the service was, to put it mildly, abysmal. At 9 am each day, you can hear the person responsible for the mini bar knocking on each door, loudly announcing \"MINI BAR,\" slamming doors, and chatting with the housekeeping staff. Each day of a 4 day stay, I was asked by the housekeeping staff \"checking out today?\" When I said no, I was asked when my partner would be leaving the room for it to be cleaned. An answer of \"10 minutes\" was routinely greeted by a sigh and rolling of the eyes. A request to change rooms, which was confirmed by the front desk, and by phone the day of, was not honored. Apparently there was a miscommunication among the staff. When I confronted the manager about it, I was treated to significant amounts of \"corporate speak\" in which I was informed that I had met \"challenges\" during my stay. I didn't meet \"challenges;\" the hotel made \"mistakes.\" While the manager tried to make things better, a $50 voucher for breakfast doesn't do much good when breakfast for two is over $60. The coup d grace came a week later when two separate sets of letters and DVDs failed to make it to their recipients. A call to the hotel simply elicited the response \"we deliver all mail to the post office, we're not responsible for what happens to it after that.\" Amazingly, after 5 years of Netflix, this would be the one time that the post office misplaced 3 separate DVDs. This level of service is not indicative of W hotels in general, which have been great. In terms of rooms, you should request a room on a renovated floor.

I think the bottom line is that whether you have a good hotel experience here depends significantly on how much you are paying. I've stayed at all of the other W's in NYC and this W (surprisingly since it is the original W) has less of the \"W\" vibe than the others. The location is reasonably convenient. Close to a number of subway lines and within walking distance of midtown shopping. Lexington Avenue is also an easy place to pick up taxi's heading downtown. This is an older property and the rooms are very small. Do not waste money on a suite. You will be disappointed. Similarly I would not book a room here expecting to spend a significant time in it (or the hotel). I like the W, however, when compared to a similarly mid or lower-priced (for NYC) hotel that doesn't offer any sense of fun or style. Is the style of the W getting a little old and in need of refreshing? Perhaps. But it is still better than many of the typical main-line brands. Again, this is a great place to stay if you want to be in mid-town, don't mind a small room (which is not atypical for NYC), and aren't paying a significant bundle - if your expectations are in check this place is likely to fit the bill.

I really didn't have the issues that so many previous reviewers had. I've stayed at several other properties in the W chain, so I was eager to try the original, flagship property on Lexington Ave. I wasn't disappointed - as I had a great room and great service in all aspects. I really enjoy the attitude and theming of all of the W hotels (each property is very unique, but the general philosophy and experience is consistent), and if you go in expecting that experience, you won't be disappointed. Spend some time exploring the W Hotels web site before you book a stay at a W. If the vibe isn't one that pleases you, you may want to go elsewhere. The look and style of the W New York was great - I loved the \"elements\" theming of water, fire, earth. I guess that lots of people just don't 'get it', but it is so nice to live your life as art, which is what W seems to be trying to do. I was most impressed by the friendliness and attitudes of the bell staff, the welcome desk staff, and everyone else that I encountered at the W, and everyone appearred energetic and professional. I love how W staff consistently try to treat you as a friend or associate - they seem interested in your story - what makes you unique - and I'm sure that isn't an easy stance to pull off in a large, big city hotel like the W New York - but they do suceed, and if you willing participate in the relationship, you'll have a great time. I was very fortunate to be upgraded to a corner suite, - the room was lovely, with a seperate bedroom and sitting room. and a large bathroom with combo tub/shower. All things in the room were fine and in working condition, the bed, linens, and Bliss products were decadent. I took breakfast three days at the Heartbeat restaurant, which was nice, in a very lovely setting. The restaraunt was closed in afternoon/evenings for some upgrades and remodeling, so I didn't get to try any other meals than breakfast - but since there are so many wonderful options in NYC, this certainly wasn't viwed as a problem. I also had a fabulous time at the Bliss Spa, it gives a vibe very similar to that of the W. Also had a great holiday cocktail in the Living Room where I chatted with some interesting and convivial people - just like a hotel lobby should be for. The W Hotel offered nice treats throughout the day in the Living Room area(chocolate kisses, brownies, blondies, hot cider, etc.). Security was very evident in the hotel in the evenings, so I think anyone would feel secure staying here. I'm really puzzled by all of the bad press that this place gets on this web-site. I suppose that people are just turned off by the overall vibe of the place, or perhaps are craving that \"brand new\" look and feel of typical corporate chain hotels. For me, I continue to really enjoy the 'warmth of cool\" spirit that the W offers, a wonderful respite for all the senses and for the human spirit. This hotel was instrumental for a fabulous weekend in NYC.

I think we ended up paying about half the normal rate...i quite possibly would have been disgruntled had i paid more than $300. Please note: when you book this hotel on Hotwire you automatically get a \"Cozy\" \"Smoking\" room. Smoking? Do they even still HAVE that? Anyway, we were not amused but they were kind enough to move us to non-smoking rooms so all was well. Size of rooms: Yes, they're small. We're from NJ so we only had an overnight bag with us...therefore, we didn't have any difficulties w/ storage. At check in, the woman said she had one \"Cozy\" and one \"Wonderful\", so we flipped for them and then spent 15 minutes accusing each other of cheating when we couldn't tell the two rooms apart. I would not want to stay here for a more than a day or two! Upkeep: didn't notice any issues with damage or wearing to the decor, although the TV and TV stand were very obviously from 1954. Well, maybe 1994, but same thing. Shower worked fine, bed was small but comfortable...the sheets were soooooo soft. You could hear a little noise through the windows (we were on 9th floor), but it didn't bother me...lullaby of the city and all that.

Misc2 - LobbyBar: fancy and hoppin', but i wouldn't pay for a drink there again.

We had a 'Wonderful' room which was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in - smaller even than one in Paris I stayed in. The room was incredibly dark with poor lighting. There was no WiFi in the room at all, only paid for 'Wired' internet connection which was $7 for 30 minutes or $15 for 24 hours. Also there was no free WiFi in the lobby.

The shower was OK, although water would go over the floor - mopped up however by the plentiful supply of towels which were changed everyday - around 6 towels a day.

Finally I found one for a 4* hotel in midtown. I wouldnt know which hotel until I booked it, figuring it would be the Waldorf or Marriott East side or something of that caliber. I figured any 4* hotel for under $300 would be great. Upon receiving my confirmation from hotwire I found out Id be staying at the W. Immediately I hopped over to trip advisor and read the plethora of bad reviews. I was disappointed, but decided to go with an open mind. We entered the hotel at 6pm on Friday night and the lobby/bar area was abuzz with people enjoying happy hour. It was more like a night club than a hotel lobby with loud thumping music.

The concierge was much friendlier. Went up to the 5th floor and its like a labrynith..nooks and crannies and dark, dim hallways. We found our room and prepared for the worst.

There was a large closet with plenty of hangers, a small desk and chair. The bed was also very small. No way was it a queen size. I think it was a full size because I have a queen at home and this was smaller. But the carpet was clean, the wallpaper was not peeling. It reeked of smoke and air freshener. I wish I could have just opened the window to air it out but obviously we couldnt open the window. Instead we turned on the fan which really did nothing.

The bedding was excellent, the rooms were clean, the toweling high quality,and the staff courteous and helpful. We stayed on Starwood points and had taken a larger than normal room. for that locale. Now to the issues we encountered. 1. Our first \"Mega room\" (about the size of a normal hotel room elsewhere) had one tiny closet, a portion of which was filled with one of those hanging fabric shelves one buys at a closet shop. There were no chest of drawers, end table with drawers, or any other place to put things. 2. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling. 3. The air conditioning was noisy. 4. After being out the entire next day, we returned after dinner. My wife opened the door and got blasted by heat. Looking at the ceiling, we saw large globules of water just waiting to drop. It was close to 105 in the room and extremely humid. When we went to see the manager, we were told that they were aware of the problem and had already moved us to another comparable room. They apologized for the inconvenience and credited us a night's stay. During the move they managed to ruin my wife's handbag (their insurance will cover) and leave her reading glasses, which we found along with some other items that were missed. 5. The new room was on a lower floor and was much noisier. 6. Additionally, we couldn't turn off the heater, which was scalding hot. The third call to maintenance got that settled. 7. We had originally asked for an upgrade to a suite but were told, none was available, so still being unhappy, the next morning we told the front desk we wished to leave the hotel and be credited for our stay. At this point, they managed to find a suite for us, which was reasonably satisfactory. 8. However, the suite's bathroom was so small that there was no room for towel bars to hang towels. They were nicely set out over a heater in the bedroom, which also could not be turned off. As a regular traveler I have encountered problems at hotels from time to time; however, here there were just too many, and the fundamental way in which a room, rack rate about $500, was outfitted just makes no sense.

Arrived from the airport and was allocated the wrong kind of room even though we clearly had a reciept from our online reservation with a booking number and clear details of what we had booked. We were given a \" Cosy Room\" by mistake which was clearly not suitable for two people, when you put two cases into the room you could not even walk around the bed to navagate going to the closet size en suite. Nowhere to store your clothes either, there was only a closet where you could hang a few things and that had no light in it and you could not see into it. Eventually got put into my reserved room after a spat at reception where it took me three phone calls to get my proper room. The splendid room is not much better, tiny bathroom, very little room to manuevre around, no storeage space for cases, small closet with no light, scruffy brown carpets with stains, generally very very poor. I found reception to be not very helpful, I got the impression that they are probably inundated with complaints about room sizes etc so its probably part of the course with them afterall its not their fault. I have regretted not taking the complaints you see on this web site at face value. I now understand that the reservations about this hotel are mostly accurate to the experience we had, and as we were in New York with other couples who stayed here aswell. It is not a case of me being over critical as they all agreed and had the same comments to make as I have highlighted. This hotel is not cheap either in fact its extreemly bad value for what you get, average holiday Inn's are cleaner, more comfortable and rooms are far superior. You must take into account room sizes in New York are not big in comparison to European Hotels, but cleanliness and layout and facilities should be a given in a Four Star Hotel which know how to charge. I would not advise any of my friends to stay here, it my have a good address and a decent bar but its a shame that you pay good money to visit such a great city to have to stay in such medicore facitities with average service.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yarmouth, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed; incredibly overrated\u201d", "Author": "lorenbc", "ReviewID": "UR10634879", "Content": "Horribly overpriced,, tiny room, tinier bathroom with wimpy shower and pedestal sink, so no room to lay out cosmetics/shaving stuff.

I had to call down 3 times for a blow dryer, before one was received. I asked for help with my luggage on the way up, and they were \"too busy\". (I was one of two guests in the lobby). On my departure, I called for assistance, waited 30 minutes and ended up bringing it all down myself. The room (a \"cozy\" queen) was the smallest I've ever stayed in and it's shameful that they charge that price. The \"living room\" or lobby area bar is always packed with lots of \"hip\" people and not at all inviting to sit down for a drink. On Sunday at noon, we tried to get a Mimosa and had to talk to three people and finally a manager before someone would help us. The housekeeping staff is very pleasant and accomodating, the \"car ambassadors\" were helpful, and the concierge was pleasant- although moderately so, compared to other hotels. I am a frequent traveler and have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels. I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest, but would never return to this hotel. Overall, the staff is a little too impressed with themselves, are generally unhelpful and rude, the rooms are ridiculously small and the atmosphere in the lobby is unwelcoming.

I stayed at your W New York over the Labor Day weekend and I wanted to provide some feedback. The location and lobby are very nice, and the services of the WW concierge outstanding. My main issues are really with the room I was assigned: 1211. I am used to the small NY hotel rooms, but not to unkempt and worn out rooms, especially at a W hotel. This is a $300 plus room and not worthy of the many hard-earned points I redeemed for this 2 nights in this room. Here are some of the issues you should please try to fix for future guests: Torn furniture Chipped/paint worn cabinets/fridge case Loose wall paper Discolored/Worn out carpet Chipped and worn out doors I am attaching pictures of my assigned room.. and I have to say these conditions are truly discouraging and not up to my expectations of a W Hotel or any worthy hotel for that matter. We also had to ask that out shower curtain be changed 3 times upon arrival as each one had a very humid/moldy smell and it just made the bathroom smell horribly. In addition the safe in the room was locked and security could not get it open, but advised me I could use one of the downstairs safes and to ask at the Front Desk. When I went to the Front desk I was told by the same security person that he had just checked and there were no safes available. My friend and I had to carry our personal papers, credit cards and money with us throughout our sightseeing trip in NY.. not a comfortable sensation. I stayed at the W Mexico City for 10 months and had an outstanding experience there. Currently I am determined not to go back to the W New York again. What's going on at the W New York? Should I assume that W Mexico City is the exception or W New York the exception? I am skeptical to book at a W Hotel again. I hope you can fix some of these things for future guests. After my experience I read the W New York reviews in TripAdvisor, something I neglected to do prior to my trip because of the blind trust I had in the quality of the W Hotels. I suggest you take a look at these reviews. One would get the impression that guests were talking about a roach hotel. Needless to say I will be adding my experience there too.

My honest opinion is the room was very small and we did pay a high rate for it but the bed was very comfy and we slept so well. The air conditioning was slightly annoying as we couldn't seem to work it but we did not complain about it. There is enough hanging space for 2 people staying for a week and I did find the bathroom too small. I found it hard to get ready in the evening as the lighting was bad. The floor had a horrible musky smell but when we saw other floors they looked alot nicer. Make sure you do not stay on floor 11. Floor 9 looked alot nicer. I wouldn't let the bedroom put you off as the staff service was really very good. We had our passports stolen on the first day and they really did their best to help us. The two bars in the hotel were very nice with good service. On the last night I had steak and chips before leaving for the airport which cost \u00c2\u00a315 and was very nice for bar food. The security is amazing, you have to put your room key in the lift to access your level. This made us feel very safe as there are lots of meetings going on and people coming in all the time. Avoid this hotel if you require good access to computers. Although they have several computers only one had a working mouse so I wouldn't suggest it if you do not have your own laptop and need 24hr internet access!! Also the hotel has a spa which looked very nice although we did not try it. Best of all the location is amazing. As I said we had our passports stolen... do make sure you take all your things out the taxi when you arrive as they will not return it to you! but the police station for lost and stolen is across the road with the British embassy!! Bloomingdales is a 5 min walk away and we really couldn't have been in a better location! I would deffinately stay in this area again but probably try a new hotel.

So we left our bags and headed out for some exploring the neighborhood. The hotel is in a great location on Lexington Avenue and is really close to shopping. Bergdorff Goodman is a few blocks, Saks Fifth Avenue is a few blocks, and all the rest of the great smaller store. My favorite store is Takashimaya New York, located at 693 Fifth Ave-- there's a Japanese Tea Room in the basement which has great Daily Bento Boxes for lunch. So back to the hotel lobby at the W. I could not believe that over the three days, not one single doorman ever greeted me or offered to open a door at the entrance. They also never asked if I needed a cab-- I've never had this happen at ANY hotel in NYC. Seems like the \"casual\" attitude has taken over. The W's motto is Whatever/Whenever and all I can say to that is \"Whatever!\" Let me say a few nice things: They do offer free apples and refreshing towelette wipes at the front desk. In the afternoon they had cucumber water near the elevators which was a nice touch. The Concierge was INCREDIBLE and deserves high marks for getting me two tickets to the Tony Award winning \"Grey Gardens\" which was completely sold out and was closing that night. Sure it took a chunk of change, and about an hour, but he did it: 10th Row Center on the Aisle. The only downside was I couldn't put them on my room tab to get \"SPG points.\" Speaking of points: Upon check-in I was told, repeatedly, that I would not be receiving SPG points. Repeatedly. Did I say repeatedly? This was due to my booking through Expedia and not through the \"official\" SPG website. I was not even getting credit for the nights toward my upgrades. Bummer....So, I get no points, I paid over 300 bucks a night for one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in NYC, and I get a big dose of attitude. This should be fun. Spectacular Room for over $300 per night. The room really was small. There was barely space to pass sideways by the TV-MiniBar console (there was tray that was teetering on top of the TV) on the way to the torn slipcovered chair shoved up against the bed next to the window. The only thing Spectacular was that they were getting $300+ a night. While the bathroom was very neatly styled, there was nowhere to put my travel case since there was only a glass shelf with all the glasses and hotel items, and a pedestal sink. NOTE: Not all rooms have bathtubs-- my room had a shower only. Waterpressure was great and the showerhead was adjustable for tall guys like me. Sometime around midnight the air conditioner stopped blowing cold air. Since I didn't want to have to wake up and have guys in my room fixing it at midnight, I left it until morning and sweated through it. I called down in the AM and asked them to fix it while we were out. But they didn't. So I called again when I got back that afternoon and after waiting 45 minutes, I called again and asked for a manager-- instead of connecting me to a manager... they finally arrived a few minutes later. After a few minutes inspection the guys brought in a brand new unit and installed it. I had already noticed mold and rust on the unit myself (see photo), and I also snapped a pic of the gapping hole where they pulled the unit. You can see, cleanliness is not next to godliness at the W NY. They were nice guys, quick to apologize, but they should have cleaned the mess behind the wall, which they didn't. The new unit broke that night around 11pm. Called. Waited. Finally had to move rooms-- to a smaller room!!! And not even any kind of credit to my bill. How Spectacular!

Funky almost. Oh, apples readily available on the reception counter. Big and juicy ones too! Quite a few elevators but quite cramped and a bit too dim. The corridor feelt dirty and did have an unpleasant odour......decor/wallpaper looked old to be honest - same thing with the room.

Complainted and they waiver the charge. Bed felt comfortable though and sheet clean. Fitness room bigger than the Barclay's and better equiped. No steam room/sauna however. Didn't eat in the hotel but had a drink in the lobby lounge. Pricey and barmaid wasn't that friendly - not a profession bartender as you would expect from a chic, high-class hotel. The lobby is far too small and with the bar crowd it's constantly too packed and had to dodge people on my way in and out. Conciege was helpful but the counter was too small that only one person can help at any one time. Had to wait a LONG time to get served. Other staff were just wondering around really - no smile offered. As W 'founding' hotel (I think), they really should make it more special and keep it at least look good.

About once or twice a year I ignore the reviews for one reason or another, and almost always regret it. Case in point, the W Hotel New York. Believe the reviews, this hotel is really dreadful. I have stayed in Four Points that have significantly better service and facilities. I can deal with the small rooms, that is expected in NYC. The lobby is nice enough to look at, the the first floor is hopping with bar guests and diners. I checked in about 11pm after a late night flight from Europe. The service at the front desk was chilly and detached. When I asked the hostess if I received an upgrade for being a Starwood Platinum member, she looked at the screen and coldly responded 'no.' When I asked why not, she told me because I booked my room using points, that I would have no Platinum benefits. What? Isn't that exactly the reason why we accrue our points in the first place?! After some discussion, a manager walked by, coldly clicked some keys in the computer, and he found a jr suite for me. However he didn't address me or the receptionists obvious lack of understanding on how the programs work there. I could understand if the hotel was sold out, but no upgrades based on ineligibility using points was crazy. We got to the room - a jr. suite in NYC is like a regular sized room anywhere else, but I was happy for it nonetheless. However, the hallways are dank and musky, and the carpet is worn and frayed throughout. The furniture in my room could've come from my nephew's college dorm hand-me-downs. I haven't seen that much particle-board since my last trip to Ikea. The bathroom was fine. The mattresses are extremely out of date and uncomfortable. They bounce so much we thought we were on a waterbed, and had plenty of time to ponder that as we were rolling into each other in the center of the bed. Arriving late at night, I called the 'Whatever/Whenever\" line to request a late check out. It rang for five minutes before an agent answered, and then cut me off midsentence to tell me that I needed to speak with the front desk to complete that request. (So much for whatever/whenever). After 10 minutes of ringing (no exaggeration), I ended up having to call the Starwood Platinum Concierge 800 number to ask them to complete the request for me. They were very slow to answer the phones (if ever), and the whatever/whenever button was true to its name. Their attitude was very 'whatever' and 'whenever' they got around to answering their phones, they may or may not assist you. The staff at this hotel had a tremendous amount of attitude and it wasn't positive. The location is fairly good, walking distance to Times Square and many other spots, and easy subway access a few blocks away. I realize it's NYC and that New York is its own animal, but bottom line is that if I have neutral to friendly service and a comfortable bed, I can deal with most anything else. This hotel offered none of the above. Try one of the newly remodeled Sheratons instead. Same amount of points and you'll be a comfy bed. The Starwood Platinum Concierge told me that they get regular complaints on this hotel. Save your time and energy, believe the reviews, and move on to another choice.

I'm going to look for a new backup hotel. I have stayed here a number of times in the past, and every time I wonder why I come back. Yes, the lobby is very hip, and if you're planning to hang out in the lobby bar, then it's certainly hopping, and that's a plus. But now head up to your room... When you get off the elevator (which itself is incredibly tiny -- an omen), there's one sign pointing the way to your room. But at that point it gets challenging. The floor design is a complete maze, and there are no more signs after that first one. Depending on where your room is, be prepared to wander for a bit. The hallways are very dark, with almost no lighting. The standard room is tiny, and *don't* be persuaded by the reviewers on here who say, \"Hey, it's New York, what do you expect?\" The answer is that for this price I expect much bigger and better, and I get that at the Intercontinental, Grand Hyatt, Millennium, Sofitel, Helmsley, and others, all within a few blocks of the W. The room literally has no drawers -- not one -- so you're living out of your suitcase whether you like it or not. If you're planning to do any work in the room, you won't be happy. There's a tiny desk, with a very cheap and very uncomfortable chair. If the view is important to you (it's not to me), you had better ask about that at the front desk, since many (most?) of the rooms look out into a small central area that is all ventilation pipes and other \"behind the scenes\" features. And not in a good way. If you think you're going to be persauded by the hip lobby, the new age music, and the Bliss products in the bathroom, then this hotel will work for you.

I don't doubt others have had the bad experiences they've written about, and I'm not saying this would be my first choice of hotels in NY by any means, but I had a better experience than many have, so maybe all these tough reviews have had some effect! The rooms were certainly the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel, period, bar none. If I were truly claustrophobic, I might've been really miserable. It took some getting used to, but it had a certain 'coziness' to it by the time I left. I guess it's 'to each his/her own' on that one. I've also stayed at the W in Chicago (not by the lake, but the other one) and these rooms were really not all that much smaller than those in Chicago as I recall. I did not find the rudeness or lack of cleanliness so many have cited. I got smiles at the front desk at check-in and upon leaving, there were no mistakes made with my reservation, and my room was perfectly clean. Very small, but clean. The daily charge for Internet access is ridiculous, but maybe just a dollar or two higher than the other 4 and 5 star hotels charge. The hallways are dimly lit to achieve a 'chic' look, but not to the point where I had any problem with it. The AC unit was loud, but in a good 'white noise' way; it was not the kind of 'loud' where it cycles on and off all the time and wakes you up, so I heard almost nothing from the hallways and nothing whatsoever from the street. I was on the 12th floor, and did not face Lexington Ave., so I guess that helped as well. Housekeeping was 'invisible' --in a good way -- the room got cleaned while I was downstairs in my conference, but I certainly didn't have the problem of vacuum cleaners and loud conversation among the staff at 8:00 a.m., or anyone knocking on my door, etc. So, do they overcharge here? You bet! (My room was $359/night). And, most people would no doubt prefer a bit more space to walk around in and a larger bathroom. Oh, and that shower curtain thing -- that IS annoying and really odd; it does come down to about 2\" off the floor so you do get a lot of water on the floor outside the shower. No question they should spend a few million to really get this place up to par considering the rates they charge. But my room was clean, the temp was comfortable, the hotel was quiet, the elevators -- while small -- were not especially slow or anything, the front desk people were nice, and I had no occasion to use the concierge, so I can't comment on that. Overall, it was way better than I expected, given the reviews I had read here, but if I were going to NY on my own dime -- even if I were going alone -- I'm sure there are other hotels I'd look at first, just to have a bit more room and to get more for my money.

This is a great hotel in an amazing location. We have stayed at several other W's and this hotel delivers all of the panache, comfort and service that the other W's do. The difference is . . . it is in the heart of Manhattan. This translates to a $300-$500 hotel room which is small and more functional than spacious. SO WHAT!! It's Manhattan, that's what you would and should expect. Other than the small room (ours was about 20X10), everything about the hotel was great. We found a buy two nights get one night free promotion on the hotel website. Our flight arrived late (after midnight) and we didn't arrive at the hotel until past 1am. Upon arrival, the front desk upgraded our room to a 'spectacular' room. The lobby is awesome, just what you expect from a W. The room was small, but totally functional and despite the tight quarters, it had all of the amenities that every other W's we have stayed in had. We used our hotel room as a lauching point for all of our adventures in NYC and it served us well. I do agree with some of the other reviews that this is not the right hotel for anyone who plans on spending a lot of time in their room. (Though I can't imagine who comes to Manhattan to sit in their hotel room). The other W's in New York are newer and nicer than this one, but you will pay more for their rooms. In one sentence, this is a great place to stay in NYC, amazing location, with comfortable, but not spacious rooms, at a great price (for NYC).

Tired , dated, and a bit grubby. I was under the impression however that it was a 4 star hotel.

Interesting that of all the tables in the restaurant we were put at one in full view of the kitchen.Hmm! We and our friends who had also checked in the previous evening ordered. When my order of Eggs benedict was taken I very nicely asked that my eggs have runny yolks.\" They always come with runny yolks was the reply.\" I apologised and explained that I had bad runny yolk karma . You can only guess what happened. Yep out they come rock hard as did the other benedict order at the table.

Thanks was our reply. My husband helped load the bags into the trunk of the cab opened the door to my side of the cab to get his wallet. As he was doing this he heard the doorman who thought he was done out of a tip say in a sarcastic tone \" Never mind the tip Sir\" You can imagine how we have dined out on that one over the past two weeks. Sorry to tell you this but our experience at the Sofitel was amazing.You should stay there. We checked in early and because of the attitude of your staff we very apologetic that we were early only to be told \"nonsense we have a wonderful room waiting for you.\" I pulled out my passport only to be told that they were expecting us and just a credit card imprint for extras was required.

One reviewer commented on an \"overly warm\" room - it's been twenty degrees in New York for the past week! Woud you rather the room was cold? -Great places to eat lunch, breakfast, dinner all around. Oxford Cafe nearby has good breakfasts.

How do we operate the damn lift?!) and there's no information in the rooms to help either - the room was like a sauna so we had to use the unfeasibly loud air-con (loud enough to keep both of us awake), not what one expects in New York City in January! - the plug didn't fit the bath and the water in the sink didn't drain properly - I raised these issues when we checked out of the hotel and the guy on reception acted as though he hears just such complaints all the time and merely berated me for not asking to change rooms (so they clearly KNOW some of their rooms are not up to scratch - I wonder how they allocate such substandard rooms?!)

We did not have any menus in our room, so they called room service and orders 3 personal pizzas. When the pizzas arrived they tried to charge them $60 for 3 personal pizzas!!

Money was not an major factor. But a good, clean hotel was. We arrived at the W after carrying our own bags into reception and onwards up to our room. The staff at reception were unfriendly. Our first room was completely disgusting. Tiny, even compared to New York standards, dark, dirty and very much in need of a total renovation. The furniture was worn beyond belief. See photos for clarification. The bathroom was tiled and again the pictures will speak for themselves. This is not the way you want to spend your honeymoon. The bed had stained sheets. The list of complaints went on and on. The hallways were dark and dirty and there was a bad smell in general. The reception area had dimmed lighting and candles lighting morning, noon and night. Wonder why? Possibly to prevent guests from seeing just how bad the hotel is in need of further renovations. We went down to reception and complained about the room and its standards. We also explained we were on honeymoon - which made absolutely no difference whatsoever. We were moved to another room - which was just the same (decor wise) only bigger in size. At this stage, we rang reception again and asked to speak with the manager. She rang the room back and we explained the position. I told her that the hotel as per the website looks totally different to the reality. She said that the only floor that had been renovated so far was the 4th floor. All other floors were of the same standard we had been given. There was no apology forthcoming but it was agreed that we would be moved to the 4th floor the following day. After more problems (with the reception staff) - we were finally moved to the 4th floor late on the 2nd evening in NY. The new room was again tiny but at least it was clean and slightly more up to date decor wise. Even the bell boy commented on the difference in smells from the 10 floor to the 4th. The room on the 4th floor we had still didnt gut the mustard as far as we were concerned. So BEWARE. The hotel manager at no time followed up our complaint to see if we were ok or indeed satisfied. SO if you get the 4TH FLOOR - you should be ok. But its not worth the money you will pay. We paid $504.00 per night (without breakfast) to stay at this hotel - we feel it was total extortion. We could have stayed in the Waldorf for an extra $50/$70 per night or Fitzpatricks for under $500. The Waldorf is directly across the street from the W. I have stayed in Fitzpatricks before (no comparison to the W New York). Our major regret is that we didnt go with our own gut feeling and stick with the Waldorf. Since our trip people has told us about the Marriot in Times Square and given it a good review. We only discovered Tripadvisors after we came back - I will always use it before booking a hotel in future. If anyone is considering staying at this hotel - we strongly suggest that you reconsider your options. There are other cheaper hotels available with MUCH better rooms and facilities. We thought Lexington Ave was the place to stay - if you want to shop, shop its great but if you want to enjoy a few days, sightseeing, wining and dining like us - you might be better off somewhere like Times Square, where there are alot more restaurants to chose from & nightlife on offer.

The bathroom didn't have a tub, but I didn't need one. Room service was quite good; I had dinner here one night and breakfasts both mornings. Delivery was very quick and on time when pre-scheduled. My only complaint was that my office manager booked the room through Starwood's main line and was told we could get an AAA rate by showing my card at check-in (significant savings: $499 down to about $350). Unfortunately when checking in, the front desk said the information was wrong and would not give me the rate. They insisted \"anyone at the hotel\" would have told us the card number had to be given at booking over the phone. Also, a fedex package was waiting for me when I arrived and I was told it would be delivered shortly.

They didn't. There was also no shower cap, so I had to work to keep from getting my very long hair wet when I showered each day. The person who said in another review that the bathroom was a nice size obviously had a different type of room than we did. We could brush our teeth in the sink, take a pee, and shave a leg in the shower all at the same time. The location of the hotel was good - about 7 blocks from Grand Central. Also, the Bliss spa products in the bathroom were very nice. I did have a facial in the spa one day and it was one of the best I've ever had.

The first room I was given was supposedly a \"Wow\" room, but was so small that I had to turn sideways to get past the bed. I called the desk immediately and asked if they hadn't possibly put me in a lower class of room. They were apologetic, and moved me to a preferred room which was the size of a small-to-average normal room. However, the upholstered chair was dirty and stained, the rug looked dirty and worn, and the bathroom was so small that when I sat on the toilet the sink dug into my ribs! I ordered room service two nights and the burger was overcooked one night and my drink order was wrong BOTH nights. After that, I went out for food. The bathtub had hair in it - and it wasn't mine. It was extremely hot while I was there, but the ice machines on my floor AND the floor above mine AND the floor below mine were not working. A staff member in the hallway nicely offered to bring me a bucket of ice and when he did, there was dirt in the ice! I had a pair of pants laundered and the cost on the Laundry Form indicated that it would cost $15. Upon check out I noticed that they had charged me $112 for laundry.

We got an awesome rate that included parking in NYC (which by the way costs $50/day). Everyone at the hotel was very friendly when we arrived. I asked them if they are able to upgrade us and they did for free!!! The suite we had was beautiful. I did get a look at the room similar to the one I originally booked and that room is very nice too. The room is small but this is common in NYC. If you want a big room, get a suite or stay in New Jersey. I must say, the suite made our stay very comfortable, however we did not spend too much time in our room. The room was very clean and well stocked. Some of the staff even bothered to learn our names. They were very helpful and informative. Just a note to the expense of this hotel. Sometimes you are not paying for the room, but you are paying for the time of year you go. No standard hotel room is worth $300 and up-you pay a premium if you go at a busy time. Go at a slow time to ensure better rates and more personal attention. The location of this hotel is perfect...right in the centre of everything and less than a $10 cab ride away from all attractions. We walked most of the time because the weather was so beautiful. My advise to everyone is shop around for rates in NYC hotels, negotiate and be friendly when you arrive. I was expecting a snobby hotel-but I was very friendly and spoke to people with respect. You will be surprised how far you get in life by being nice to people. Also, I suggest to tip well when you get great service. These people work very hard at their job. I spent about $30 tipping total which isn't much because it ensured great service.

Its only two blocks from the 6 or E/B train and only four or 5 blocks from time square. The doormen were not as friendly as I remember them before (I was a guest at the hotel 6 years ago) but the lobby was still very nice. I stepped up to the desk expecting to check my lugage since it was only 12:30 or so and was told that they had a room ready. I was also told that I was going to be upgraded from a wonderful room to a wow room. The front desk staff were friendly. When we arrived to our upper level floor, the hall smelled like there was a water leak and mildew. I have bad allergies so I immediately took note of the hallway. When my fiance and I opened the door to our room on a higher floor I did say \"Wow\" but not for the expected reason. Our room was super small (even for NYC standards) and it had the same smell as the hallway. I was disappointed. The paint was peeling a little, the bedspread looked extra lumpy and backboard needed repair. True it was a cheap rate but I have paid less for more (and I would have been exceptionally upset if I paid $299-$399 for this room). I called downstairs and was told that I would have to wait until after 1:30 to switch rooms. I decided that I would probably need a face to face talk with the deskclerk so I headed down stairs. I explained the situation and was promptly given another room. It was a suite with two plasma tv's, a living room area, a larger bathroom (still only a shower), better robes than the other room, and most importantly no mildew smell! It was an exceptional room, decor and all. Overall, I have seen the worst and (near) best that the hotel has to offer. If you pay $300 per night you will be disappointed with a Cozy, Wow or Wonderful room as they are supersmall. The suite is wonderful and reminds you of what you would expect out of a W room. If I had to do it over again I would probably just go to another W location (they are all in great areas) and shell out the $75-$80 more for the room only because it I would have been disappointed if I had to stay in the first room and obtaining the suite was a courtesy I can not come to expect everytime (unless I pay for it;0)", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cWhat a waste of money\u201d", "Author": "OklahomaParislover", "ReviewID": "UR5429728", "Content": "Our five night stay was the worst in NY ever.

When we arrived I asked at the desk to ensure it would be a twin (I only asked because I have seen a previous review from someone who was booked into a double when they requested a twin). Anyway, the girl at the desk informed us that we were booked into a double room \"as requested by the agent\" she told us, and that they are fully booked so they can't move us! The manager came over and we informed her that my cousin worked for the travel company and basically was the agent! Took her a few minutes to actually get this. She offered to move us the next day and gave us a free breakfast so I guess at least they compensated. They were pretty miserable though. The rooms are extremely small and shabby. They need thorough redecoration and new carpet. The room service was very expensive but good quality. Its a good location, walking distance to most attractions, plus the open top bus tour starts around the corner. The rooms are very dark, not helped by the fact that one of the lights didn't work. We couldn't be bothered to ask to get it fixed as had already asked them to fix the safe and the bathroom sink plug.

The living room was extremely comfortable and you could get a great latte there and have a lot of fun people watching. In the morning they set up a very nice and affordable breakfast.

I chose this hotel because the AAA rate that I could get made it comparable in price to the Waldorf across the street and the Marriot next door. Having stayed at both before, I thought I'd give the W a try. Big mistake. First of all, when I went to my assigned room, I noticed that there was a tray of dirty dishes next to the door (and also along most of the hallway - yuck!). I also heard loud music coming from my room. Perplexed, I unlocked the door and peeked inside. Fortunately, I didn't catch a glimpse of anyone in particular, but all the lights were on and music was blaring. Clearly, this room was already occupied. When I went downstairs to get another room, there was no apology whatsoever for sending me to the wrong room. Apparently, they are too cool to give apologies here. When I finally got to the correct room, I was highly disappointed. VERY small - even for NY, and I travel there on business quite a bit. The room was boiling hot and when I went to turn down the heater, I noticed the grate covering it was all broken and in pieces. It never really cooled down and it was so loud for the entire night. I went to turn on the light next to the heater and guess what - it was broken, and even if it wasn't, there was no light bulb in it. The carpet was ripped in a few places and the desk was all chipped up. No bathtub either, but I don't really need that. However, the shower curtain didn't reach all the way to the floor, resulting in a flood the next morning when I showered. People in the corridors were very loud. I kept waking up all night thinking someone was trying to break into my room, when really it was someone across the hall or next door going into their room. Overall, this was a very disappointing stay, especially for the prices they try and charge ($300+ per night). Just to be fair, I'll also point out a couple of good things. The lobby bar seems like a fun place if your young and pretty and want to have fun. Although I am young and pretty :-), I was on a business trip and not looking for much fun. I ordered room service and the food arrived promptly and was very good. Pricey though - $30 or so for a plate of pasta. I wouldn't recommend this place for families or business travelers.

Every time I had a problem or better said a concern regarding my stay at the W on 541 Lexington Avenue you where there to bring quick and swift resolve. I have been in the eye of public services for 15 years. I truly understand how difficult and taxing it can be on one to stand and hear all the complaints / problems of your clientele with out ever being told when things went exceptional. Well here is one that will be the exception. I did not like the initial size of the room for the ventilation sake and asked Yerhaura for a fan only to find out they had none available. As I am standing at the counter in the Lobby she is obviously fixed onto her computer screen and after a few moments looks at me and my wife and says, would you like to switch rooms? Is it a bigger? Oh yes she replies. My wife and I dashed off to find room 664 so much nicer for minimal cost. We moved all of our belongings and this made the stay so much nicer. It did not stop here. Yerhaura followed up with us three maybe four times during our 2 night stay ensuring that everything was all right. This kind of follow up created a customer relation that I call second to none. I do not know the room count in this facility but I will tell you I thought I was the only room she was tending too. This kind of customer service is only second to none. Yerhaura has set the standards and raised the bar of service excellence. I have had the privilege of frequenting a number of 5 star resorts and have to give her skills a rating of A++. The bar has been raised and standards are set by Yerhaura. Waldorf Astoria will never get my business as long as this keeps up at the W. I can still see in my minds eye coming in after a long day of walking the town. She would light up and smile saying I just called you guys. I was out of sight but not out of mind! Awesome! Am I a dedicated to staying at the W? Yes! Why? Because of the excellent customer service that was given to my wife and I on the week of New Years Eve by Yerhaura. I have to also say that the Bell Hop and the Front door men where also very polite and very courteous. Thank you so very much for making my first trip ever to New York City a very friendly and warm memory. Yerhaura, I cannot thank you enough. First impressions are lasting impressions. Word of mouth will weigh in stronger than any yellow pages advertisement. Because of this service excellence I will highly recommend your establishment to my friends and co-workers.", "Date": "January 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cW Hype, disappointed\u201d", "Author": "OJonVacation", "ReviewID": "UR2992725", "Content": "I just stayed at the Hotel for business.

What a disappointment! This was my first time staying at a W property. I had heard that the hotels were trendy and the rooms tastefully designed with a contemporary flair. What I didn't hear is that the rooms are so small that they are barely functional. Because it was the Christmas holidays, my husband and I packed more heavily than usual, bringing gifts as well as the usual travel items. The first room we were given was so small that I honestly didn't think we would be able to maneuver once our luggage and packages arrived, and we are both smaller than average. I expressed my concern to the desk clerk who informed me, albeit very politely, that none of their rooms are very spacious. He agreed to relocate me, but warned that the new accommodations would only be minimally larger. He was right. In addition to the small space, there was an awkward room divider which didn't add anything to the style value and merely segmented the room unnecessarily. There was a built in area with an armless chair which functioned as a small desk. In addition, there were no night stands but a narrow wall shelf which held the clock radio and telephone. The bath only contained a shower (no tub) and the lighting in the entire unit was so dim that it felt like a cave. I don't know how anyone could possibly apply makeup in the dark bathroom and I even had trouble seeing the items in my suitcase (there was not sufficient drawer space to unpack your clothing). Although the hotel was generally well maintained, there were, as my daughter would say, \"telltale signs of aging\" with torn wallpaper and peeling paint in the bathroom. There was a charge for high speed internet service and for the wireless service which I understand was available in some of the lobby areas. The only complimentary itnernet access was in the Business Center, and the desk clerk failed to disclose that information when I called to inquire about availability. Finally, the fitness center was being renovated and although alternate facilities were offered, I wasn't up to trekking down the street in the cold, rainy weather. If you like the location, I would recommend the Eastside Marriott, only steps from the W. My advice -- stay there. The rooms and facilities are infinitely better. Even though the reviews were not great, I chose to stay at the W based on the reputation of the chain, thinking the accommodations couldn't be that bad.

We had read mixed reviews about the W, but decided to try our luck. We were sorely disappointed and regret the decision hugely. Our room was hardly big enough to swing a small cat. Common in New York I know, but when you can't get to the bathroom because your luggage is taking up the entire floor space, due to the lack of storage, then it really does become tiresome. Most of the 'Terrible' reviews cover many of the points that we also experienced but there was something else that we weren't fully prepared for. On check out we decided to leave our bags for the duration of the day to collect in the evening. There was one luggage guy covering a 20 deep queue. During our lengthy wait, we observed the luggage guy swearing at guests behind their backs as they deposited their bags with him. This was done numerous times once guests went to leave. No strangers to the States we know the tipping culture, however, when we went to leave our bags, the same guy would not give us our luggage tickets until we handed over cash. He actually held on to the tickets and we grappled with him to retrieve them. Incidentally, we didn't tip him due to his threatening nature and felt for the rest of the day that he was torching our bags! We reported the incident to the manager and he said, \"We can't touch them due to their Union\". So again, ineffective staff as described by other travellers and having stumped up a large amount of cash it left a really bad taste at the end of largely noisy, rude and cramped stay.", "Date": "December 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cRun, Don't Walk, From This Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2943725", "Content": "Our stay at this hotel was so awful, I frankly don't know where to begin. Each year, my partner and I host a Christmas gathering in New York City for our friends and family. This year, we chose to put everyone up at the W Hotel New York (49th & Lex). What a dreadful mistake. Quick summary: The infrastrucutre in this hotel is tired and failing. Making matters worse, management is ineffective. For those of you who don't have time to read the details that follow, I say run, don't walk, from this hotel. Tired, Failing Infrastructure: The W Hotel New York is old and failing. Three examples: 1. No more than half of the elevators in the hotel were ever in service at the same time during our stay, resulting in long waits and shoulder to shoulder crowding (the elevators in this hotel are absurdly small, at approximately 4 feet square. 2. The room key card lock system failed us during our stay no less than three times (in one instance one of our guests was locked out of his room for an entire evening as the hotel removed the door to his room, jam and all, in order to gain entry). 3. The hot water boiler had to be turned off one morning during our stay, leaving the top floors of the hotel with no hot water (ironically, a large portion of our group arrived that morning, having flown all night on red eye flights, and we had paid for their rooms beginning the evening prior specifically so that they could get in to their rooms early that morning and shower). Ineffective Management: The W Hotel New York features two \"penthouse\" suites on the 17th floor. My partner and I stayed in one and, to our horror, quickly discovered that the other penthouse suite (it should be noted here that both of these suites share a large, common rooftop deck seperated only by low planters) had been rented out to a major U.S. corporation as a \"hospitality\" suite for the Nascar race being held in New York that weekend. The result? Non stop partying next door, night after night, with people standing out on the rooftop deck smoking cigarettes and cigars until late into the night. Making matters worse, since the room next door wasn't designed to be a hospitality suite, this meant the door would lock each time it closed. To alleviate this problem, our friends next door would block the door from closing each evening by flipping the lock bar into the door jam. This resulted in the door slamming into the lock bar each time someone came or went (which was constantly throughout each night). But wait. That's not all. The bedroom of our suite shared a (thin) common wall with the service elevators on the 17th floor, which meant that each morning, after being kept up late into the night, we'd awake to the housekeeping staff coming and going (it should be noted here that this issue was pointed out to the manager on duty, who at first refused to believe me when I told him our room backed up to the service elevator -- incredible!). All of the issues I've discussed above, including the service elevator issue, were reported to hotel management. Unfortunately, management was unable to correct any of these issues. The room next door was rented, Nascar related parties were planned, and there was no turning back. The best they could do was promise to monitor the situation (which, unfortunatley, they didn't do). There are two final insults to all of this. First, in the closing days of our stay, management offered to reduce the rate on our room (I quote his words here) \"by 50%, or $900.00 per night, which results in a total savings of $5,400\" in consideration of the issues we faced with our neighbors throughout our stay. In response to this gesture, I told the manager that I appreciated the offer but nevertheless wanted him to understand I hadn't come to the hotel in search of cheap rooms. To the contrary, I would rather see management correct the mistakes. With this as background, imagine my surprise when we went to check out and discovered that the promised credit hadn't been put on our bill. When I inquired, this manager told me he decided not to do it because I had told him I wasn't there for \"cheap rooms.\" When I protested, he argued with me, ultimately agreeing to credit $900 (50% of one night). As we stood to miss our flight, we didn't have time to argue further and left. Second, after spending nearly an hour checking out, we went to leave the hotel -- now running late for our flight. The bellman had stored our bags in a baggage room behind the front desk. Unfortunately, the card lock system was acting up again. We waited 15 minutes while he tried to get into that room. About the time we were ready to leave the hotel without our bags so as not to miss our flight, our bags appeared.

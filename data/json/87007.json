{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fairway Villa was just right! I was in Hawaii with my sister for 2 weeks! We stayed at a hotel for a week and then moved into Fairway Villas for the second week. We booked it through Traveltogo.com a website related to our moms timeshare. It was perfect for us. It was clean. We had a studio unit that had kitchen and Washer dryer. It was super conveniant to be able to do laundry right in our unit. Ok..it definately is NOT fancy. Its basic amenities that make your stay comfortable and very enjoyable. It was like a studio apartment and i wanted to move in and never come home to Jersey.Other reviews mentioned the TV. I can honestly say we never even turned ours on. Who watches TV while on vacation in Hawaii? We are to ladies in our mid 20's and were only in the unit to sleep and shower. Other then that we were out exploring the whole time.I am goin back to the Fairway Villas in January 2009!!! I cant wait!", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR391858235", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mook827"}, {"Content": "Standard Accommodations       View From Room", "Date": "Dec 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR887517611", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Sactown5"}, {"Content": "Great value and convenient location       View from the lanai", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR555304625", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hd91364"}, {"Content": "Room 1015 - Okay, but some problems We reserved thru Hawaiian Condo Resorts. They are great people to work with. This is the 2nd time we've used them. We asked for a budget room with parking included. We got that, plus this unit has it's own washer and dryer.. However, if we were to do this over again I'd prefer not to stay in this unit. There was mold under the kitchen sink that you could smell when you washed the dishes. Termites where in the armoir, where the T.V. and extra blankets are stored. The sound from the T.V. didn't work on all the stations, there was some kind of backfeed that made it irritating to listen to. The handles in the kitchen to pull out the drawers or open the cupboards were sticky and felt dirty. We washed everything before we used it so we knew it was clean. Everything in the room was old, which gave you the feeling it was dirty. Which the carpet probably needed a good shampooing. The bathroom seemed not completely clean and they don't leave you enough T.P. so you will have to purchase your own. Also, I recommend that you bring your own supply of soap.Thankfully the sheets/bed/towels were clean. I felt like this building was very secure as you have to have a device to enter the building and pull into the parking garage. Security people are walking around in the parking garage constantly and are very friendly. The roof top pool isn't heated, but is very nice and is clean. The jucuzzi is small  sometimes cold in the morning if they've just cleaned it and the morning is when I like to use it of course. The woman's sauna and restroom is very nice. The men's sauna was out of order when we stayed there. The view from the roof is beautiful. Some of the units in this building are updated and extremely nice, so it depends on who you rent from and particularly which unit you get. (We looked at the unit across the hall when they had an open house and it was very nice!)", "Date": "Mar 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR266607691", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SassyAlpaca"}, {"Content": "it was just ok We stayed at the Fairway Villa in April of 2006. This place is nothing fancy...very basic, no view of the ocean, so we didn't stay and hang out in the room. It was nice to have a pool and jacuzzi at the top of the building...but that was really it. The room itself was very small and we could smell the neighbors thai food they cooked every night. I probably wouldn't stay at this place again unless it was the only thing available. I'm not saying it was horrible, I mean it was close to the shops and beach, but it's just a room...that needs some updating.", "Date": "Aug 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR908519662", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kat2114"}, {"Content": "OK but not what we expected Went to Fairway Villa 1/28/06 - 2/4/06. Good location (can walk to anywhere in Waikiki) and quiet however, the hallway was dimly lit and creepy. The room itself was not bad but need updating. Bed was comfy. Air conditioner was noisey. Free parking which is hard to come by in Waikiki. Located on the canal, good views from lani. If you are looking for a good location and not a resort or 5 star hotel then this is the place for you.", "Date": "Feb 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR143933583", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Little cat"}, {"Content": "Feels like you are at home. We stayed at the Fairway Villa from 03/25/05 to 04/01/05. We own a timeshare with vacation internationale and decided to use our points. When we arrived we checked in at the Royal Kuhio, the sister timeshare in the chain. We were given our own parking spot and magnet keys to get in. Fairway villa is located two blocks from Waikiki beach. We were in the center of all the stores and shops in Waikiki. There is nothing fancy about Fairway Villa. It is like an apartment or condo and I believe people actually live there on a permanent basis. The room was VERY clean and roomy. We were on the 19th floor overlooking the canal. We stayed in a one bedroom which included a full kitchen, a living room, a double lanai (balcony) and cable TV. There was a small pool (not heated) on the 29th floor and a small jacuzzi. That was it for ameneties. At least the pool was not busy so we the whole 29th floor and the sun to ourselves. We basically used our room as a homebase so when we were tired or wasted we just walked the short distance from all the shops and party spots to our room and rested. We were away from all the noise of downtown Waikiki, so that was nice. If you want to have an affordable stay and a condo in the heart of Waikiki, and not looking for resort ameneties, I would recommend Fairway Villa.", "Date": "Apr 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR291410930", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not bad at all I stayed at this hotel with my partner in 2001. The room was a one bed with a rollaway in the living room. The kitchenett had an oven microwave fridge etc. It was clean and the view was great. The small pool is on the roof. The hotel has a porter and is within say 3/4 blocks of the beach area and within easy reach of the zoo and stores/shops. Only one gipe.

We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The room was nice as per Marriott standards and had a balcony (although it's right by the freeway so not much of a view). There were 4 restaurants within 500 yards so we didn't even have to drive anywhere for dinner. The room had a fridge and microwave for our leftovers! The free breakfast coupon got us a cooked-to-order, full breakfast with coffee at the lobby eatery. Our 4 year old loved the pool and hot tub! As for the noise, given it's next to the freeway, we ran the fan on low all night and slept like the dead!

I was redeeming points for a free night while visiting friends in the area and thought I'd try the Courtyard since I seem to usually only stay at Fairfield hotels when I travel. The hotel sits kind of far off the main road but is quite close to two restaurants (although I wouldn't recommend walking to them, even in summer). Upon arrival in the parking lot, I found it a little odd that there were no more than a handful of cars in the lot on a Friday night. The lobby seems recently redone and very up-to-date and check-in was a breeze, even though the hotel's internet was down and everything had to be done manually. The hotel only has three floors and my room was located on the third floor, which also appeared to be recently redecorated. As for the room....eh. It almost looks like this hotel used to be something else and they've tried to bring it up to Marriott standards. The room had a large sliding glass door with a small balcony, which might be its best selling point. The bathroom had a sink area outside the tub/toilet area, which I always associate with low-rent hotels. The small closet shared the space with the external sink, which made the area look rather tacky. The tub/toilet area had a switch outside the bathroom, which was a little odd, and the room itself was rather gloomy. The tub seemed a little small, even with the bent shower bar to lend the illusion of more space. The shower had good water pressure, though. As for the sleeping area, there was a king size bed, a dresser with a flat screen tv on it, a mini fridge (with a microwave sitting on top of it), a desk and chair, a couch, and a coffee table all crammed into this one room. With the dresser, fridge, and desk lined up along one wall, it gave the impression that \"Well, we had to put it somewhere\". It just felt rather cluttered. The bed was extremely comfortable, though, and I got a great night's rest. The fitness room was a little lacking, with free weights, three treadmills, and one elliptical machine. No one was using the pool or the fitness room while I was there. The lobby has a public area that also serves light meals, but with the breakfast ending at 10AM on a Saturday, I was unable to try anything there. Overall, I won't be staying at this hotel again. There is a Fairfield on the same road and I think I'll give it a try next time, as this simply didn't live up to my standards in a Marriott hotel.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat All Around Experience!\u201d", "Author": "sp8holly", "ReviewID": "UR18252770", "Content": "Stayed for a very long weekend in Indianapolis for a wedding. I am a huge Marriott fan and this Courtyard did not disappoint. This is a traditional Courtyard by Marriott but what sets it apart is the outstanding staff. The staff is kind, hard working and so accomodating. They could not do enough for me as I was using the meeting room while I stayed there. Plus the entire property was spotless.

We stay at Courtyards almost exclusivetly, and the only thing similar with this location was the artwork and furniture coverings. The king room (207) was very tiny. The bedskirt was frayed and unhemmed. The bed was saggy at the edges. If we were not paying the premium $124/night we never would have guessed we were in a Courtyard. And unlike the typical motels, this one does the usual Courtyard thing of actually charging extra for the breakfast. Add insult to injury! The only way they can salvage this stiuation is to rename it what it is, as a Fairview Inn-- at least you would get what you are expecting. They should not charge this much for this hotel/ location. I felt decieved. The key entry system to the outside doors were broken, and desk staff acted like it was a new problem every time it was mentioned. At least they were nice and friendly, but you get the feeling they are just college students doing their shift--not invested in the success or failure of this hotel. The light under the door was glaring--we had to use towels to block it. For whatever reason, our door had a big gap under it, whereas others didn't. Parking was insufficient in the number of spaces--always filled, and there is a closed restaurant next door. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have no choice and need to pay this much for so little.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "BeachYiaYia", "ReviewID": "UR8659780", "Content": "We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

I'm really fussy about the room and bed and I felt just fine. Our friends got a smoking room and were moved quickly to a non-smoking. People were friendly. Only one inconvenience, we had travelers check and they would rather not cash them for us, so we went to the bank across the street. Not a big problem.

Town center is easy to reach by interstate. Receptionist and management are very friendly and helpful. Managed by a indian family. Very cleanThe room was huge and the hotel is not very old. But in some very small parts it already needs some minor renorvations. No big problems - some colour will do. Similar with the room service: one day the \"ground-towel\" for the shower was missing. On two days the creamer for the coffee was missing. But I am sure just one call would have solved the little problem. Outside the room there was a ugly smell (from a cleaner or detergent??). Without this little problems it would have received \"an excellent\"! On the weekend a few \"party people\" are staying there. No problem. Good talks, nice people. Free WiFi.

The room was very clean and looked like it was being taken care of regularly. Also, the rooms were large which was nice because my family was there. The people at the front desk were pleasant too; they help us find places to go during the day that would be fun for the entire family. The only thing that I could think of that I did not like was some of the other guests in the hotel were a little loud. The location is also a bonus. There are lots of different restaurants around the area of the hotel. The breakfast they have was very nice. There was all types of breakfast foods on a table waiting for anyone to eat it.

We had no control or choice in the matter. We were all working together in Indianappolis. In my first photo, I HAD to document my discovery of Astro Glide and condoms in the night stand. I mean, REALLY??!! The Astroglide had leaked all over the drawer. Notice it's placement next to the Gideon Bible. I heard from at least two other people they found condoms in their rooms as well. The stains and smells were horrible in everyone's rooms. NON smoking rooms had ash trays and cigarette burns on the counters. Lots of unidentifiable stains, reminisent of crime scenes. One guy had a room with bullet holes and he swore there were blood stains. I had to stand in ankle deep water in the shower while trying to ignore the buckled linoleum tiles, and mildewed shower curtain. On the back wall of the closet, I am sure someone had urinated on it. The water stains on the ceiling painted over with spray paint didn't really hide anything. One guy actually went to Target to buy towels because whatever they had that resembled towels was more like sandpaper. When I slid the window open in my room to get some \"fresh\" air in, the whole pane fell out onto me. I'm glad I was on the second floor. There was trash everywhere in the parking lot and the empty lot behind the hotel. The elevator was \"out of order\" by the second day. I do have to say they got that fixed by the third day. The fluorescent hospital lighting was more than depressing. I have never stayed at hotel where there were condoms and lube sold at the front counter. The free breakfast consisted of cereal, bagels, OJ, Apple juice, and pre packaged sweet rolls. Oh, and some apples and bananas. I never had a cup of coffee without it always having grounds in it. Overall, I had to laugh about it all since I was stuck and had to stay there for 5 days working. It was just a place to sleep, or at least try to sleep while worrying about bed bugs. Other guys complained to get a new room, but only ended up with more problems. I would suggest that you go 1 mile down the road and look at Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, or anything else than this Days Inn & Suites.

We booked it expecting an average place - and got just that. The hallway was a bit rough - moulding torn up, minor stains in the carpet, but nothing that would have turned me away. The room was spacious, and provided my family with what we needed for a trip to Indy. They have a breakfast area, and we were suprised at all that was offered. The photo on the hotel's web site made it look like there was nothing more than cereal and donuts, but there were also bagels, muffins, assorted drinks, and fruit. Rooms could have used a bit more vacuum work - especially around the beds (dirt you do not see when you have the bedspread on), but again, nothing that freaked us out too much. We have stayed in Days Inn establishments that have been nothing but discouraging - and this one was much better than the average dumpy Days Inn out there. Thought it was funny - you can buy both ramen noodles and codoms on the display wall behind the front desk!

We were apprehensive about what we would find when we opened the door to the room, but were pleasantly surprised that it was a decent room for a one night stay. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom appeared clean. The furnishings were not top quality, but the room had two sinks as well as a small refrigerator (which we didn't use). The carpets needed a good vacuuming in the room as well as the hallways, but I never walk without shoes in any hotel room anyway. We travel to the Indianapolis area very frequently and have always stayed in more expensive hotels, but this hotel was sufficient for a good night's sleep.

I personally chose this hotel and made the initial reservation for 2 couples, 2 rooms, 2 nights (Fri, Sat). We later changed the reservation to 1 couple for 2 nights (F, S) and 1 couple for 1 night (S). Our friends booked in on Friday and were very satisfied with their room and the facility. At 6:00 p.m. Saturday, we booked in, and were also very satisfied with the facility and reception staff. We saw none of the bad things mentioned in previous reviews. It appeared to be an acceptable, pet friendly hotel, offered at an extremely reasonable rate. In fact, I told them I would submit a favorable review to Tripadvisor. Remember, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. The VERY Bad: After reading the reviews I almost cancelled the reservation. However, we each had a dog with us so decided stay to attend the UFO (Frisbee Dog) competition. Soon after we arrived in our room, our friends informed us that one of their bags was missing (including a $1,300 video camera). In addition, all their personal items had been packed up and put into their remaining bags. After checking with the front desk, it was determined that there was some confusion over the booking, and they mistakenly thought our friends had overstayed their reservation. The staff entered their room, packed all their belongings and moved them to a storage area downstairs. When they realized their mistake, they took their bags back to the room - minus the bag with the electronic equipment. After almost two hours of management trying to locate staff that removed the bags, our friends called the police. The police arrived and told them a report would be filed, but in all likelihood, the items would not be returned. Sunday morning, staff had been interviewed and maintained that they returned all the bags - they did NOT! To top it all, this hotel still charged our friends for their room, accepting no responsibility and offering no compensation. This situation and the management\u2018s response is appalling. After all, the room wasn\u2019t broken into, they admitted that they removed the bags. To date, this has not been resolved.

We talked to the staff at the front desk and they were not very apologetic or willing to do much about it - they failed the true test of customer service. We had to leave to go to dinner and they told us they would send somebody up to replace the towels and leave some toilet paper. When we returned at 11pm they had not done so. Two strikes. Second, we found bugs nesting in the window of our room. They were friendly lady bugs, and they were harmless, but it didn't make us feel like we had a clean room.

Having read the reviews on tripadvisor, I turned towards the Hilton Garden Inn and having stayed there; believe that it is the nicest hotel in Champaign. First off, the hotel is nicely located near assembly hall, though you might choose to drive if it is a cold evening or someone in your party needs assistance. The hotel does not look like much from the outside, but the lobby is very nicely furnished and decorated. The staff is welcoming and very well put together. We ordered the romance package which includes some champagne, chocolates and the like. While this was not in our room immediately, they brought up a very nice Louis Roeder Estate and goodies. They were well presented and made the stay very nice. The room itself is very nice with a high quality mattress and everything being in excellent working order. The TV was flat panel and had high definition and there was a refrigerator in the room that was available for use. Additionally, we were very impressed with how extremely well cleaned the room was. We could not find a stain or dirt anywhere in the room, which made things all the nicer. As part of the romance package we received a free breakfast downstairs. Normally, I am not a fan of hotel lobby breakfasts ala Embassy Suites. This is different and you will enjoy both the atmosphere and food. The selection includes; cereal, bagels, fruit, made-to-order omelets, waffles and more. The waffle maker is very impressive and they have pre-measured mix in individual containers ready for your use. Nice waitresses and pleasant lobby. Overall, it is clear that this is the nicest hotel in Champaign and you will enjoy it regardless of where you usually travel.

The staff was awesome...more than helpful, polite & courteous. The room was wonderful and it had a mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker and a large TV. The king sized bed was verrrrry comfy, lots of pillows and was covered in luxorious linens. They also had a free business center and complimentary high speed internet access. The lobby & dining area are lovely and the food was delicious. There is also lots of close, free parking, a nice work-out room, pool and hot tub. The convention center is well laid out and I am looking forward to attending the Illinois PTA Convention here in April 2007.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Garden Inn Champaign/ Urbana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35790-d90825-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Champaign_Urbana-Champaign_Illinois.html", "Price": "$114 - $176*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1501 South Neil Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Champaign</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">61820</span></span> (Formerly Clarion)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "90825", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/34/0b/340b9e1dd8b92f872ad81d89d36996184large.jpg"}}

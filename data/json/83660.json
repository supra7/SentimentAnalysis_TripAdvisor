The room was spacious, the bed comfy, the bathroom clean. We were literally driven nuts by the room air conditioner. There was no wall thermometer, so we were either shivering, or uncomfortably hot. There was no comfort there. The hotel itself is located in a very, busy, very congested area, near the 5 freeway. The traffic was unrelenting no matter the time of day. Every time we left the hotel it was pure madness. The streets were always packed with a line of cars. Very unpleasant indeed. We saw some unsavory characters strolling through the parking lot, walking around our car and other cars. That was disturbing. Further, there appeared to be several encampments of grizzly homeless people about the outside of the hotel. We just didn't feel safe there. We checked out the hot tub. When we came back some ten hours later, the same group of rowdy drunk people were still where they were when we left. However, some 40 or 50 of their beer cans were carelessly strewn about. Nice that they had their own private hot tub with greenish yellow water! That was very poor of management not to keep an eye on the public areas. Jasmine and Susan were very kind, very sweet people. We enjoyed them immensely. Susan took a liking to our little dog and gave him lots of attention and treats. He liked her too. This hotel was recently renovated. They did a fine job. But, they can't change the location of the property. And that was the reason we chose to leave. The owner should promote Jasmine. She is one of the precious few people who truly understand hospitality.

After searching the internet extensively for a respectable hotel that was in our price rage, that wasnt infested with bed bugs or had unwanted people patrolling the parking lots, we decided with this one. It was a very good choice! We were very close to Sea World and eateries in the area which was a plus in itself. I was kinda leary when we first got to the place because of where it sits. It sits on a little side street next to the freeway, next to a boat storage facility. I was thinking to myself are we safe here? Is my car going to get broken into? But after the 1st night all my worries were soon gone. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms are very big and comfortable. The fridge and microwave came in very handy with a toddler who needs milk and other perishable items at his beck and call hahaha I am not a breakfast eater by no means but I have this funny quirk. When I stay at a hotel it has to have a continental breakfast!!! This hotel's breakfast didnt disappoint! The pancakes were made right there, juice, all kinds of bread, bagels, muffins, eggs (scrambled one day, then a mini cheese omelet the other day), buttermilk biscuits, sausage gravy (which for a hotel was pretty delicious), sausage, ham, yogurt, cinnamon rolls (when warmed in the microwave were finger lickin good!!), cereals (4 choices), coffee and juices. I was in breakfast heaven... :) The room was well equipped with great amenities. It was clean, stocked daily, towels and bedding changed every time as well. Put it to a test to make sure they changed our sheets every day! LOL The only thing that we didnt like was, we asked for joining rooms that way we could go in and out of each other's rooms. When we got into our rooms we found out they were joining. No big deal really its just we didnt like having to leave our door propped open so we can go in and out freely. We were located at the very end of the hallway so we really didnt have to worry about foot traffic but none the less we didnt like that detail.

Comfy new beds (I love the pillows!). Decent, clean rooms. Polite employees. And probably the BEST free continental breakfast I've ever had at a hotel (eggs, sausage, toast, yogurt, etc.) Cons: The pool was dirty. The fitness room smelled really bad (it had that old musty smell) and consisted of a few old workout machines that hadn't seemed to be updated in a decade. Only one elevator, and was pretty slow.

I will say first that yes, it is not in your best interest to try to get a hotel reservation the same day you arrive in San Diego, but it couldn't be avoided with the nature of our trip. Anyway, we booked three nights at this hotel and arrived at the property. I wasn't thrilled with the neighborhood-as others have said it's a little more than questionable. There are suspicious homes directly behind the hotel and car sales lots at the bottom of the hill. Anyway, this seemed to be the best we could do so we reluctantly checked in. You know things aren't going to be good when the clerk says, \"Take the elevator DOWN to your room.\" Great. So we head DOWN the stairs. The first thing I encounter is the \"security\" door is propped open. This door leads from the parking area (not gated, not secure) directly into the hotel! This is a big safety issue as far as I was concerned. Especially since we quickly discover that our room is the first one next to this open door. So we go into our room and it is beyond basic. The bathroom seemed fine enough, but the bed seemed close to the ground, thin, and sagging in the center. I'm a freak about bugs, so I checked the mattress. While I didn't encounter anything, the mattresses they have can only be described as \"bed in a bag\"...it was almost like the mattress was wrapped in a nylon stocking. While I was investigating the bed my boyfriend looks out the window only to discover that our \"view\" is of a sidewalk, but you are eye-level with the sidewalk, as in staring at people's feet and ankles as they pass! He also observed some shady \"business deal\" taking place across the street. Anyway, I decided this was completely unacceptable for all the above mentioned issues. We decided to ask for a refund. The one pro of this event is that, when I explained our concerns with the property, the clerk agreed to give us a full refund. My boyfriend did have to follow up a few days later however to have the charge removed from his card. I have stayed at Holiday Inns before and this one is AWFUL! We decided to take our chances and look for somewhere else in the city that seemed to be 100% booked. To share what ended up happening: We had booked this hotel for $180 a night (I wouldn't even pay $50 to stay here) and ended up staying at a RESORT in Mission Bay (Paradise Point) for $220 a night. A difference of $40!!! Anyway, I'm pretty reasonable, but even for travellers on a budget this hotel was not worth it.

It has a warm breakfast buffet with eggs, bacon, bisquits and gravy, muffins, cinnamon rolls, bagel, yogurt, cereal, and fruit that was good and convienent. Ok here are the things that were bad. The spa needs resurfaced and only seats 4 people at a time.There is a employment center next door where a lot of homeless/ dirty people hang out looking for jobs, but they never once tried to bum money off of us or even talk to us. You have to drive 10minutes to the beach or anyplace else. No restaraunts close to the hotel that you can walk to only a Mcdonalds and Inn and out Burger. The carpet seemed to be a little dirty could use some cleaning. Last but not least the rooms felt a little crammed. We were all togethor pleased with the hotel and staff and the price that we paid for our rooms.

The room itself was clean and looked newly remodeled. Beds were really comfortable and the two sets of pillows (firm and soft) were a nice touch. The bathrooms though I can foresee could develop molding if we stayed there for several days because it didn't have an exhaust fan so moisture tends to accumulate. But becuase we only stayed 1 night, it wasn't a problem. The continental breakfast was more like a full breakfast, with loaves of bread, pastries, rolls, sausages and omelets, a juice and coffee station.

There was no \"musty\" smell that some other guests have reported but it appears if the just installed new carpeting and fresh paint on the walls so there is a bit of the \"new\" smell going on but not over powering. I found the bed(s) to be extremely comfortable with two choices of pillows (soft or firm), which I thought was a nice touch for sensitive sleepers. I was also really impressed with the quality of towels they provided. From the bath size down to the face cloths, they were very nice, almost robe-like in quality and thickness. Nothing major but a very nice touch in my opinion. The Hot Breakfast wasn't the greatest but there were lots of options with regards to bagels and english muffins, baked goods, cereals, coffee and juices. I found it to be avove average as far as Continentals go. The Business Center consists of a desktop computer with a laser printer. Definitely not what I would consider a BC but for some who does not have a lap top or needed to print out some documents, it was more than serviceable. Free Wi-Fi is pretty standard now but it was nice to have. The HIE also had a Pool and Cardio center which I did not use but it was nice to know it was available. I don't have much negative to say about the hotel but as another guest reported, the desk is located right next to the AC Unit so I had to turn it off and on every now and then. The free parking is limited and is a little tight at the front but under cover it's like a normal parking lot. The hotel is also a little tricky to get to, depending on how you're coming in. A little navigation savvy is required but after a day of driving around it's not too bad. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised considering the beating this hotel took in previous reviews. Perhaps all of the positives were due to recent renovations but either way, I would definitely recommend this hotel!", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anderson, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFriends don't let friends stay here.\u201d", "Author": "aufvedersehen", "ReviewID": "UR15139383", "Content": "Well first of all let me say I would never stay at this hotel again.

By the time the cab got me to Pacific Beach and they weren't picking up their phones, I had to resort to other options. Told the cabbie to find me a cheap hotel, and the Holiday Inn Express at the corner of Garnett and Mission Bay was right there off the interstate and looked assecible. Had never stayed in a Holiday Inn Express before but had heard the chain was fine, so with few other options nearby, gave it a try. The arrival experience is a debacle. Got out at the intersection and walked up the ramp, but had to walk up and down the ramp, through a garage and around the property to find the entrance. it's not intuituive. Walk-in rate was about $120, a lot more than I'd expect for some limited service property like this, but was I to complain at 3 in the morning in a city i didnt know with friends that I didnt like anymore. Check-in guy was friendly enough, but the process was long as he had to input all my info. Room was fine, actually more upscale than I expected, bed nothing special, bathroom small, but it was clean. Hotel had interior hallways which is a positive and basic, but new-looking furniture. Didn't see the pool area, or try out the wi-fi or notice if hotel had a gym or not. Breakfast was decent enough, small crappy little room though, didnt see any outdoor seating, which would have been nice for what was a beautiful San Diego morning.

It was night, and so I didn't have any problems with it at first. I noticed it was terribly humid in the lobby and when we came to our room it seemed clean and well-furnished. But the humidity was out of this world. I am from the desert, so I might think little humidity is alot, but there was a noticeable difference in the outside humidity to the inside. Once I started inspecting though, I found black mold all over the bathroom, under the wallpaper and more near the baseboards near the beds on the wall. It was so humid I almost passed out. The parking was horrific with tiny iddy biddy spots to squeeze into. Upon inspection, the entire facility dripped into the parking garage. The entire parking garage was dripping, everything in the hotel was wet and humid. The highlights were the fantastic staff, who put out the continental breakfast at 5am for us. The breakfast had some good cinnamon rolls, and otherwise was sub-par. The work out room had nice clean and new ish machines, but if you like watching tv the tv only worked on the bottom half. They offer a great cable package though I got to watch \"Pinata: Survival Island\" and that alone might have been worth the trip. There is also one computer for everyone but it doesnt run toooooo slow and at least they have a business center-type-computer at all. Thats about it.

The microwave and fridge in the room was nice for extended stays, especially with children. They have a printed up directions sheet and map that helpful. Right around the highway.

There is a day workers meeting place right behind the hotel so you get men (homeless and stragglers with a few exceptions) wandering around the parking area and outside of the hotel. One guy even took a moment to take a leak next to a car in the parking area. H The vending machine and ice machine are located outside of the hotel in the parking area.

The breakfast is pretty minimal IF you can get into the tiny area and IF there is anything left. Out of 7 days, we only ate in there 2 times. The pool area has pretty rickety furniture.

I booked using Hotwire, my first time, and after the hotel name popped up I checked tripadvisor and I was scared to death after reading all the negative reviews. After telling my wife what happened she immediately sprang into action, God bless her, and she contacted the hotel manager and quizzed him regarding hotel condition, amenities and poor travel site reviews. He let her know that he knew exactly what she was talking about and that he was new and was brought in to remedy the problems. She felt good about their conversation and we decided to take a chance and check in. The Room: First, this is NOT a three star hotel and I will not be using Hotwire again because of this experience. I paid $98 a night for Mon/Tue/Wed during spring break which I guess was a fair price. At most, I'd give this hotel two stars. We stayed on the 3rd floor, freeway side and our room had been given a recent makeover (rm 325). It was clean but very small, with a tiny bathroom, and it included a microwave and mini-fridge. We didn't notice any excessive noise from the freeway. We had no problems with the room although I heard a few people being reassured by the manager that various problems like leaky plumbing and no electricity in the room were taken care of. Amenities: The pool and hot tub were small but functional on the bottom floor surrounded by a wooden security fence. Apparently new pool deck furniture is being ordered. The adjacent workout room was small but functional with 3 cardio machines. The hotel breakfast was of a type being offered at several hotel chains with cereal, various muffins and bagels, a toaster, yogurt, whole fruit, no meats and warm cinnamon rolls. The hotel also had a small plate of freshly baked cookies at the front desk every evening. There was a single computer and printer in the lobby for internet access first come, first serve. Parking was free (very unusual out there) but very cramped and totally unsecured which brings me to the location. Hotel Location: This hotel is on a typical steep grade leading up to the 5. There is no buffer to adjacent office buildings and businesses whatsoever. There are two, small parking garages one at the lobby level and one at the pool/basement level as well as a single row of spaces butting up to a wall opposite the lobby entrance. I wouldn't stay here without a car but if you get in late, you'd probably have to park in the street. It sure seems like San Diego parking spaces are more narrow that the rest of the country. At the bottom of the street on the west side of the hotel, there's a day laborer pickup area so we were treated to various sights like a laborer peeing in the street and homeless types walking back and forth by the open (unsecurable) basement garage entrance. Mission Beach: If you go west down Garnet to Grand you'll soon be at Mission Beach and a short drive from La Jolla and a number of beach areas. For those booking a family vacation, Mission Beach is a mixed bag with areas appealing to the young alternative adult types with lots of bars, skateboards and tattoo parlors as well as family resorts. Do your research before you book. And people drive like maniacs in this area. I witnessed a motorcycle/car hit and run and two fender benders on this small stretch from the hotel to the beach. Away from the ocean there are several nice restaurants and plenty of shopping. If you go south on Mission Bay Dr there are several family oriented parks and beaches as is the San Diego Visitor Center which offers discounted attraction tickets and hotel rooms. Customer Service: We had terrific customer service during the day and were completely ignored by anyone at the front desk during the evening. There is clearly an effort by management and staff to treat the customer better. The cleaning staff work room was at the basement level and there were several signs, written in spanish advising the employees on how to treat guests. Perhaps they should post a few at the front desk. In general, given the choices out there, I probably would not stay here again unless the price was $79 or so.

He said in a nasty totally annoyed tone 'your car alarm has been going off, come turn if off' I asked him 'so someone tried to break in?' He very rudely said 'look ive had 4 complaints-come down here and turn it off' I told him I wasn't going to apologize for my car alarm going off. I went downstairs and turned it off. There was no 'hey can you come turn your alarm off, we have security so we're watching the car-dont worry' None of that--it was just EXTREMELY rude like he was annoyed he had to call me to turn it off. about 10 min. later he called again and was just as rude if not even more so saying it's going off that I better go downstairs and turn it off. I have never had someone be so rude. I went back upstairs and booked another hotel for the remainder of my stay. When he called the 3rd time, I was on the phone with hotwire telling them what was happening and how I was being treated and telling them they need to take this hotel off of their website. My room mate answered the phone and said he, again, was extremely rude. The hotwire rep. that I was speaking to called this guy to get 'his side of the story' he said. When he came back on the line to me he said 'Ok-I know exactly what you're talking about-the guy basically hung up on me' This guy told the Hotwire Rep. that I either disconnect my alarm completely or I would be kicked off the property. There is a complaint filed through hotwire against this hotel and with all luck it WILL be taken off of their website. The man that was unneccesarily and extremely rude to me was Adam (atleast that's what he said his name was) there is no reason to speak to a paying guest like he spoke to me.

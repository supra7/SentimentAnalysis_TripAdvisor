Location: Situated on Sea Harbor Drive, one block off International Drive, the hub of access to most things going on in Orlando. 5 minutes walk from SeaWorld; directly opposite. The Hotel: 7oo (ish) rooms is built in a hollow square format on 10 floors with a huge glass roof forming an atrium over the interior. The hotel is bright, clean and welcoming. Rooms: These are large, well appointed and well furnished, choice of two Queen beds or a super king, large well appointed bathroom et al. Excellent rooms with good facilities incl safe, refrigerator etc. Eating and Drinking: There is a sushi bar and restaurant, not tested. A US type sports bar and restaurant at which we ate twice. First experience was good. Second experience was very poor, due to a conference in the hotel (these are on an everyday basis almost). The place was obviously under pressure, our food took an hour to arrive, was cold and poorly presented. The waiter was embarrassed and replaced the food but we were still charged the full amount. There is also a restaurant called HBs. We ate breakfast here twice. Full buffet breakfast hot and continental choice costs $21 plus tax, continental only $16 plus tax. We tried both. The continental is better value with a good array of fruit, breads, pastries et al plus unlimited coffee and OJ. Service was excellent both times.There is a Starbucks inside the hotel which is very good for a quick snack and excellent coffee. Facilities: The hotel has an adult pool and an excellent children's pool with mini flumes. Whilst we were there the pool area was heavily used by conference guests, many of whom were dressed and lying on the pool beds between meetings we presumed. Car parking is good and plentiful and situated close to the hotel. The concierge service is outstanding, extremely knowledgeable and courteous staff who are very helpful in arranging park tickets, quick queue entrance to rides at al. They even produced us an email map for the 2nd part of our holiday south to Naples.We never tried the spa.There are ice machine stations on all floors. The hotel runs a free courtesy bus to SeaWorld (not really needed) and to Universal Studios. The Staff: As previously intimated the staff at this hotel are unfailingly polite, friendly, helpful and welcoming.We felt we were valued as guests and we loved the way all staff went out of their way to ensure we had all we needed. Minus Points: Not much to gripe about really, the maid service in the rooms was a bit hit and miss at times and the presence of large contingents of conference guests could deter some people but the hotel is there to make money. Overall Experience: Very positive, we would return and we would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting excellent service in a welcoming very clean environment, ideally located for access to most of what is going on on Orlando.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "TravelsABunch", "ReviewID": "UR126932726", "Content": "This place is great if you are going to the Sea World or staying in Orlando in general.

The $16.00 parking was disappointing but it was nice to see a security guard watching over the lot when we came in late in the evening-you can't put a price on feeling safe. We did ask for a cot because the boys did not want to share a bed and it was $20.00 extra per night which I felt was excessive as we have had cots at other hotels without a charge. We found an open bottle of Evian when we arrived to the room which was over $3.00 per bottle so we took it to the fronk desk and was not charged for it. We bring our own water and drinks when traveling with teenagers. We found the room to be very comfortable and large with French doors opening onto a balcony overlooking the lobby area.

They granted us a new room and sent staff to help me move (my husband and older child were at Seaworld and I was stuck there with a 2 year old... who TRIED to take a nap but couldn't because of neighbors). So, my only complaint is that the walls are a bit thin with rooms that have connecting doors. I think I would have still had an issue with those folks even if the walls had of been thicker, but I noticed other sounds \"normal\" coming from other neighbors (we requested a room away from elevators), etc. They have champagne/ sparkling cider there for you upon arrival- nice touch, especially if you have just left Seaworld and are parched!

The lobby area is classy - with the marine theme, a nice gift shop, well-appointed bar area, Starbucks & business center - and makes a good first impression. Also, the valet and reception staff greeted us by name and demonstrated excellent customer service in every way. The complimentary glass of champagne was a nice touch. The room was very large & clean, and the Aveda bathroom products were appreciated. The pool and water play areas for the kids were a big part of our enjoyment, and although we were there for 2 days primarily for a visit to Disney, my daughter asked to spend the whole first day in the pool area. It was relaxing & enjoyable. I have three suggestions that would make it an experience that is more consistent with this quality category. 1: The service in the pool area could be better. Having experienced similar setups at other hotels, I found that although poolside refreshment service was offered, it was inferior to that of other similar hotels. It was somewhat challenging to flag someone down & get a menu, and the follow-up once it was delivered was almost non-existent. Also, we initially set up in the children's water play area, and no service was offered there. It could be that we started there before they started providing poolside service (I read somewhere later that that service starts at 11 a.m.), or maybe they don't send servers to that area at all, I don't know. Either way, parents in that area need that service most of all! Those in the main pool area without kids typically have the freedom to get up & order at the poolside cafe, whereas parents watching children in the kids area would have to drag their kids away from their play, requiring quite a bit of effort in some cases, to get some food at the cafe. In any case, poolside service should start before 11 in my opinion. They post rules that say you may not bring your own drinks/coolers/snacks into the pool area - that opens early in the morning - and then they don't make drinks & snacks accessible? Not good. 2. The beds were very comfortable, but the bedding did not fit the beds, and the sheets were thin & not very high quality. The fitted/bottom sheets did not fit over the bottoms of the mattresses, which gave it a cheap appearance and also meant they did not stay in place very well, especially on the kids' bed. I would have expected better in this price category. 3. Have a lazy river. It would be the perfect finishing touch to what is otherwise an very nice pool area. There are a number of hotels in the area that are similar enough that would have an edge because they have the lazy river. None of the above areas for improvement would keep me from going back, although I might gravitate toward the lazy river at the Hilton on International or the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cPleasure & Business Trip\u201d", "Author": "bannertraveler", "ReviewID": "UR125983021", "Content": "The Renaissance Seaworld was a very nice hotel and in an excellent location, directly across from Seaworld.

Just be aware - there is a $30.00 charge per night for a balcony and we are Marriott rewards members. Also, just know that parking is $16.00 a day. We had a room on the 8th floor overlooking Seaworld. The room was huge with a king bed and seperate sitting area with a couch, coffee table and desk. The bathroom was large with 2 sinks. Amenities include coffee maker, coffee (not the best), refrigerator, safe and iron. Wi-fi was $14.95 a day. Our balcony was so huge, 20 people could have fit out there. Sunrise and Sunset were awesome to look at. Other than Seaworld, there is not a lot to do within walking distance. Check with the concierge to check out menus for various area restaurants. They also have coupons for some of them, but you have to ask. There is a trolley that stops in front of the hotel. A one way ride is $1.25 (exact change required) and will take you to a number of places. We went to Point Orlando, just 8 stops from the hotel. Just remember, the trolley rides end at 10:30 p.m. The hotel offers 1 day passes for $4.00. The only downside for us was the pillows. They were way too soft for our liking.

Here's the good and bad: The good: You can't beat this location if you're visiting Sea World. It's the closest hotel by far and we made the easy walk there even though the hotel offers bus transportation right to the front gate. Nice touch to have the hotel offer champagne and sparkling cider at checkin. It was so nice to just walk back to the hotel after our SW visit; other hotels are available fairly nearby but a much longer walk especially when traveling with a six year old. Renaissance Sea World is a comfortable, modern hotel with impressive architecture. It's like a gigantic box facing Sea World with the walls of the box consisting of rooms, the floor of the box is the lobby, restaurants, and ballrooms; and the rest of the box is open air with large lattice structures holding up a huge skylight. The hotel staff was very friendly throughout our visit. Our room was spacious and the bathroom had luxurious marble tile floors and very large double sink countertops. The outdoor pool is massive, the hot tub large and refreshing, and the kids water park is one of the best I've seen anywhere. Our daughter wants to go back to this hotel for this feature alone, as she spent a good two hours there. The bad: We booked this hotel based on our status as Sea World annual passholders attending the 'Bands Brew and BBQ' event at SW. We selected the Renaissance knowing it was a premium priced hotel with advertised benefits and a great location. The hotel's website advertises that for the BBBQ event, annual passholders are entitled to a special room rate (which we received), a free breakfast for kids, and free self parking. There are also other amenities available to SW annual passholders year-long that we didn't know about at booking, including free 'Quick Que' passes. At checkin, we got the special event passholder rate per our reservation, but were told the free self parking was for Sea World - meaning if we drove across the street to the Sea World parking lot we could park free, which we could do as annual passholders anyway, but when we drove back to the hotel for the night we would still have to pay the hotel's self parking rate of $17/night. We never heard anything about the advertised free kids breakfast or other available Sea World passholder benefits like Quick Que. In our room, which was on the top floor near the elevator, there was a consistent clack-clack-clack noise that I assume was related to the operation of the nearby elevator. It was noticeable as soon as we checked in, and while not ridiculously loud and probably not avoidable, it was an unwelcome disruption especially as we were trying to sleep. Our room had some nice features but others that need upgrading for a premium hotel - flatscreens are small, room has double vs. queen beds, and there is evident wear and tear. The verdict: This is a very nice hotel that has an unbeatable location if you are going to Sea World. It's a premium priced hotel and has great amenities, but make sure you understand (and get) all the things you should be getting.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cantonment, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Resort/Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Lauren M", "ReviewID": "UR124898129", "Content": "This Marriott-owned resort was awesome- from the rooms, to dining experience, and customer service.

We really weren't expecting too much as far as hotels go, but we thought that with the Renaissance we were sure to get a standard level of comfort and service. Firstly, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who has a problem with heights. The atrium with the hotel rooms on all four sides gives the impression of being in a high ceilinged industrial warehouse. The massive space gives the hotel a deserted look. The ambience is cold and there's a mish mash of of interior decoration that does nothing to help that. Cool, strangely shaped rattan lounge sofas are strategically positioned in the atrium but ruined by a terrible blue/green/orange carpet that the hotel should have done away with in the 90s. Other beach/lounge chairs give the whole thing a confused look. The sushi bar is modern but we gave it a skip because the fish didn't look fresh that evening. The best place for a drink and a bite to eat would be the hotel's sports bar, which is warm and inviting. The pool area is beautiful and it's a real shame that the rest of the hotel does not have the same standard. We found our room - which had two queen beds - disappointing. Although spacious, the room is furnished poorly. - The fridge droned so loudly, we had to unplug it from the socket. - There was no minibar. - The coffee/tea machine was stored in the closet and from the calcified look it had and the dust it had gathered, it obviously hadn't been cleaned for some time. - The hair dryer was likewise full of white dust/mould and a long strand of someone's dead hair was still on it (and I have the pictures to prove it). Also, the length of the cord meant you had to stand right by the bathroom door when using the hair dryer otherwise you would pull it out of the socket. - There was a wet, used face flannel hanging on the back of the shower head. - The chair by the office table was dusty and hadn't been cleaned either. - Wi-Fi in the room cost $14.95 for the first 24 hours and self parking now costs $16. - I believe someone already mentioned the Fedex Business Center. For a hotel of Renaissance's stature I would expect a decent internet connection if my credit card is being charged by the minute to use your business center computers. I felt frustrated and embarrassed for the hotel. - I must say, the thing that we found most unacceptable was the behaviour of some of the front desk staff. It's highly uprofessional behaviour to gossip about your guests (regardless of what they look like, where they're from, who they're with or any other factor) particularly when they are in full view of you and can see you doing it! The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that there was a highly competent, polite staffer (Australian/ Canadian?) working at the sports bar who made at least that bit of our stay enjoyable and the ladies who worked at the inhouse Starbucks were a pleasure too.

(no biggie) we then went down to the sports bar in the lobby and got a bit to eat. food was ok, (but is was 10pm at night. next morning we had a quickie breakfast Starbucks (coffee, Danish) we got our Sea World passes from concierge, which came with fast passes (can only be used on big rides) and we walked across the street to Sea World, about a 5 min. walk. they do provide a shuttle if you would like. after a day at the park we ate at the other restaurant in the lobby, I think is was trade winds?? it was a very quiet relaxing dinner, food was very good. after dinner we took a stroll outside to check things out. very pretty we actual sat on couches around a fire pit while the kids ran around. Next morning we had breakfast at Trade winds, breakfast buffet was more economic, was very good, made yummy omelets to order. After breakfast we checked out and put our luggage in their secured room and went to the water park and pool area outback. both were awesome. water park is geared towards littler kids but still fun. pool area was really relaxing, there is a huge pool bar, with a full menu. (burger baskets looked yummy) I could have spent a few more days just relaxing at the pool. we left about 2 pm, concierge had us loaded up luggage and all within 5 minuets for Disney World and off we went.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way but right in the thick of it\u201d", "Author": "Steve&Mandy", "ReviewID": "UR123808355", "Content": "Stayed for two weeks beginning of Jan 2012.

All of the staff, whatever their role, were fantastically friendly, helpful and there at an instant to help you out, but no pushiness. Really good this aspect. I don't think you could get better if you add up the location, so easy to find from Orlando airport, just out of the way, but seconds from Interantional Drive & 192 and minutes from Disney. If your visit is a first to Orlando and you are worried/daunted especially with children about the prospect of staying safe, quality and ease of finding your way around, put this hotel at the top of your list for consideration, it really is that good, well located for a visit to the Mouse and all the other theme parks.

First of all, when I reserved online, I specifically requested and was confirmed for a single king-size bed, but when I arrived, I was told that all of those rooms were taken and I was given two queen beds. The hotel is big, and the rooms are laid out in a rectangle around a large interior courtyard. There are only two elevator banks, in the middle on opposite sides of the large sides of the rectangle, so it's almost always going to be a long walk to your room. There are outside rooms, which have a view of little more than the Sea World parking lot, and inside rooms, whose glass doors open out onto the interior courtyard. But they are also visible from the hallways that surround the courtyard, so you must keep your drapes drawn or people will see in. This is really bad when you wake up, because you can't get any light in the room until you're dressed. (Rooms are dark, with low-wattage light bulbs.) After several days, the effect was claustrophobic, never seeing the outside world until we went outside the hotel. The courtyard has what looks like a huge fish tank, but it's just apparently a model. There are no fish, nor even water. There are several large TV screens showing video of fish. There are a couple of bars, but they are overpriced, the bar where where we drank was not well-stocked and the bartender made weak drinks poorly. The outdoor swimming pool has a bar, but it was even less well-stocked, and the bartender had never even heard of drinks or brands we were asking for. Plus it closed at 6 p.m. Also, the bathrooms are big, with double sinks, but there is no shaving/makeup mirror. The wide countertops are a bit away from the mirrors, so if you are nearsighted, it's hard to see while you're shaving or applying makeup. Not a dealbreaker, but worth noting. Cable TV pixilated or blacked out regularly. There is a FedEx business center, but it closes at 5 p.m. and is closed on weekends, when our business conference was scheduled, so you can't, for instance, ship heavy business materials back home. The hotel wasn't totally terrible - the staff was helpful and nice, and the restaurant was decent. We got a special room rate for the conference, but the posted rate in the room was $459. Are they kidding? For this? Taxes, fees, parking and internet will add to the bill.

When you are gone for an entire week, sometimes the hotel lifestyle can wear you out. This was more like being in a home with a plethora of entertainment right outside the door.

The tech team was there within 5 minutes of our call. He made several attempts to correct it inside the building but found it necessary to go outside and work with the dish. He gave us a free movie in the other room for the inconvenience which made my sick daughter very happy. This gesture was something so simple but greatly appreciated. Our housekeeper worked quickly around us when we found ourselves in our room for the day with a sick child.

Our room was right next one of the elevators which we never heard.

We had stayed at Hard Rock Hotel for 7 nights then 7 nights in a Ana y Jose in Tulum Mexico (both excellent) and had 1 night before returning to UK. Our daughter wanted to go to Seaworld (Discovery Cove) & so we booked this 5 star thru Virgin Holidays which states it is an excellent base for seaworld. Despite the booking being made a week in advance the hotel had no record of us. After some checking the room was found. It was 830pm. We were given a card saying we had 10 % off at the sushi restaurant. We went to the restaurant at 830 and it was closed! Eventually after speaking to 4 people we were told it had closed as they had only made $50 that night! We were offered an extra 10% off at the bar and had to have a bar snack of deep fried chicken wings or some such - not exactly 5* sushi! The room was a shock! An ugly view of something industrial looking & a loud annoying air-conditioning unit. The room was so dusty I started sneezing! I tried to phone to get it cleaned or to change but the phone didn't work. I then asked a man at one of the desks for an ATM he shrugged & said he was new & didn't know. I asked another person for details of Discovery Cove (part of Seaworld) & was told she didn't know as the hotel had nothing tO do with them. We got up early and left and although no-one had told us we knew we were entitled to fast passes for seaworld so got some. We didn't try out anything else so maybe other things in the hotel are OK. I won't be trying it out again. It was cheaper than the Club Level at Hard Rock but both are 5 star but I think they are like different planets! The Renaissance was a complete let down! Totally at odds with the rest of our Florida experience.

Front desk staff offered me a glass of champagne and worked with me to find a nice room as I am Marriott Platinum. I was offered a \"Parlor Suite,\" which I was told was newly renovated. The one caveat with this room is that it is equipped with a Murphy Bed (the kind that can \"tuck away\" into a wall), so it's not your typical Marriott/Renaissance signature feather-topped bed. Not too bad, though, as the room was HUGE (at least 600 sq ft), and was equipped with a dining room table for 6, a large sectional couch, double vanity in the bathroom, and brand-new, very contemporary furnishings and decor. The large flat-screen TV was nice, too. I enjoyed the Aveda toiletries and the room was relatively quiet, except for when the neighboring room's kids decided to run up and down the halls every morning around 7 am. I enjoyed the lobby bar, but didn't frequent the hotel's two restaurants as I felt they were very overpriced. The fitness room was PHENOMENAL and one of the best I've ever experienced - tons of machines, free weights, kettle bells, yoga mats, exercise balls, bosu balls, and more. New-in-bag headphones also provided for workouts. The pool and grounds of this hotel are immaculate and I enjoyed some pool side lounging. I wish it had been warm enough to swim in the pool as it looked very nice. Parking was easy, although it cost $16/day. Access to area shopping and restaurants is easy via rental car or a tram (ask at the front desk).

There wasn't much of a choice on the menu so we thought we would eat outside the hotel later. The chicken wings were undercooked and we had to send them back. The drinks were way over priced at 12.00 for a Rum Runner & 9.00 for a Mai tai. I think the alcohol was a little skimpy because I had 2 Rum Runners and did not taste the alcohol. The Rum Runners were good otherwise. The wings were taken off our bill but we ended up paying a bill of 47.93. There are so many good restaurants outside the hotel whuch would have been a better choice. Starbucks for breakfast the next morning was a real treat!

The rooms were redone, so they are gorgeous! The hotel looks brand new from the inside, and I loved the water that was available, it had either lemons, cucumbers, or pineapples in it. Delicious! This hotel is not near too many things but Sea World, but it is within walking distance of Sea World. You are literally across the parking lot from it.

Overall, we were satisfied by the hotel. However, we were expecting more for our money, but this Renaissance didn't live up to those expectations. The Good The hotel is well maintained and is in a great location; right across the street from Sea World and only a 10-15 minute stroll down to Aquatica. It is right at the end of the International Drive strip with all the necessary places to eat, drink and shop for kitschy souvenirs. The property has a fantastic pool with a large, separate mini water park for kids. There is a Starbucks on site along with a sushi bar, full restaurant and a bar and grill-type eatery. We didn't try the sushi bar, but the other two eateries and the Starbucks were top-notch. The room was spacious and clean and looked well maintained. The beds were comfy and the room had the usual amenities (TV, desk, etc). The bathroom was also quite roomy with two sinks and full size tub. And even though we were just down from the elevator, the noise from them didn't filter into our room. Noise from adjoining rooms was non-existent. The staff were friendly and very helpful when we needed answers about the hotel and local areas. The maids were excellent and kept our room spotless. They even took the time to arrange our daughters stuff animals in fun scenes when they made the beds. The Bad The hotel has a huge convention business due to the many \"ballrooms\" on site. In our five days there, one conference ended, one ran its course and another was just starting. The first one had an older, professional crowd and blended into the rest of the guests. The second one, however, was made up of college-age young adults who were quite noisy late into the evenings. The hotel staff didn't make any effort to keep them quiet either. For some reason, the water in the hotel stank. Not just smelled funny. It smelled bad. Sort of like a burnt asphalt smell. We didn't particularly like bathing in it, but it didn't leave any residual smell. The rooms are set-up for wifi and ethernet internet access...for $14.95 per day. I still have a hard time understanding why hotels that charge this much for a room insist on charging for internet access when even the cheapest independent flea-bags in town have free internet. The hotel does offer free wifi in the lobby, but this was so slow and prone to drop-outs that it was totally unusable. And speaking of extra costs, the $16 per day for on-site parking is a bit ridiculous. I understand the need to keep people from using it as an alternate Sea World lot or to sneak into the excellent pool, but charging your own guests just smacks of outright greed. The only alternative is valet parking at $21 per day. Choosing this option just gets you the service to the door. The cars are still parked out in the elements like all the others. One last nit to pick. The Starbucks closes at 7pm but the gift shop closes at 11pm. This seems backwards. Bottom Line This is a great hotel in a great location let down by some questionable operating practices and stinky water. Although we were satisfied with our stay, the next time we are in the Orlando area we will not be staying at this Renaissance. There are just too many little issues to make it worth the money.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulf Beaches, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt's okay borderline 4star\u201d", "Author": "Toad143", "ReviewID": "UR119495988", "Content": "Don't get me wrong it is a nice hotel, but I would say borderline 4 star.

Room service was fantastic - good food and the staff were lovely. In-room amenities were lacking. The free coffee was just that - no cream or sugar, so you can only use it if you drink your coffee black. The room itself was nice and clean and comfy, but the bathroom was a bit worn. The finish was worn off the bathtub so that it was bare in several places and had a big dip in the middle where water would pool. They charge $14 for internet hookup in the room but they don't bother to tell you that it's free in the lobby, and all you have to do is open your balcony door to access the free wireless. Quite a money grab and i'm sure everyone who discovers this after they've paid for in-room internet instantly becomes disgruntled. The capper for me was that my room was not serviced, even though i was out of it all day (from about noon) and the do not disturb sign was NOT in place (i double checked this when i found my room still unserviced at night when i returned). When i reported this to the front desk the next morning upon checkout, the staff said i must have left the DND sign on the door. In fact, I did not, as I've mentioned.She then apologized but didn't offer any sort of recompense, which was surprising. I thought perhaps I'd get a call or something in the mail (as she said she would report it), but nothing. I'm not overly picky and I'm not a complainer. I was extremely polite at the desk. But come on...you pay hundreds of dollars for a hotel room so that you don't have to make your bed or wash your own towels -- that's the point of room service -- and then they don't do it, and they don't seem to feel it's a big deal. Overall, the hotel itself is quite nice and the staff are warm and pleasant, but I'm extremely disappointed in the way my lack of room service was handled. I shouldn't have to ask for a remedy - they should have offered it.

Ideal location for our plans to visit SeaWorld and Universal. The room was superb, vast and the bed comfortable. Housekeeping was first class. Where things fall down is in the food and beverage department. On our first night we dined at the Tradewinds restaurant in the lobby. We had to wait for a table despite the fact I could see at least 10 empty tables within. The reception staff at this restaurant are not efficient.and spend more time trying to figure out the seats on their computer system We were called forward but they were not quite ready for us, so we waited. There was an overwhelming smell of fishy oil. This tells me that the kitchen staff do not clean their oil filters often enough, When the food came it was okay but Patrick's calamari was overcooked and was too salty. I had a soup which was fine. The next morning when we wen tthere for breakfast we had to wait for nearly 15 mins. Again tables free inside and 5 staff running about the reception like headless chickens. Why are they sooooo disorganised ? Patrick went to the buffet and 15 minutes later he still wasn't back. Where was he? Out catching the eggs from the chickens ? The trays for scrambled or fried eggs were empty. When he asked a staff member she went to the kitchen and at last appeared with eggs. This is REALLY poor foodservice management. They do not have busboys/ table clearers and the wait staff are expected to do this. the restaurant MUST hire some busboys to keep things flowing. The next day was worse. We came for breakfast and had to stand for THIRTY-FiVE minutes waiting for a table. I gave up and went across to Starbucks. Patrick hung on. I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels and never have ail had to wait 35mins for breakfast. This is supposedly a 4 star hotel. The F&B department needs a new manager and at least 3 busboys. Just a minor point, at the entrance to the Tradewinds restaurant there are faux plastic rocks, they look cheap and nasty, sort of thing you might see at a Macdonalds. They should replace this with plants, these nasty plastic 'rock's are not appropriate here. The lobby area is vast and the kids loved running around the space while their parents stood in line. So all in all, the F&B department needs a serious shake up. The SPA in the hotel is excellent. I had massage by a Chinese lady call Miranda. I recommend her to anyone.

Very professional and apologetic. All in all a great stay... pool is rather small for a resort but we were staying to go to Discovery Cove ( 5 minutes away) so we didn't really use their pool. The food is rather expensive at the hotel and just ok. We'd suggest you go to Delmonico's (5 minutes away) reasonable prices and DELICIOUS . Order the Delmonico steak and split it ...1 and 1/2 LB for $19.99! In closing, the Renaissance is exceptionally clean ,well maintained and professional staff.

The glass elevators, aquarium videos everywhere and oversized furniture kept them entertained in the lobby, and they enjoyed the game room as well as the foosball and ping-pong tables outside. The pool was very big and had a big shallow end with wide steps where they could play, but the best thing, by far, was the water park, with three water slides, fountains, sprayers, water guns, etc. that they loved! We spent hours of our vacation there. I had been worried that we were going to have to go to a \"real\" water park when they saw their slides from the road, but they were perfectly content with this one. They also had kids eat free nights, and scavenger hunts and movies on the lawn for kids. My only complaint is that the hotel didn't advertise those activites well enough ahead of time. We always seemed to find them already in progress. We hadn't planned on going to Sea World, but we almost changed our minds because of the hotels convenient location, right across the street, and the shuttle and discounts they provided.

There are no vending machine of any kind, so snacks are $4-$5 a pop at the gift shop or restaurant. The food at the restaurants were way over priced and small portioned.

The outdoor pool area is really nice, though it was absolutely choked with people after about 6pm (when everyone returned from the parks). My room was spacious, with a mini fridge. The only negative (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) was that there where issues with cleanliness details - crumbs in corners, nail clippings under the desk (gross!), and a desk chair in serious need of a vacuum at the back of the seat and on the pedestal. A colleague had similar issues in his room. This is also a nickle & dime hotel - $15 for parking and $15 for Internet. Still, nice place and if you get a great rate, I would recommend it.

Generally speaking you can never go wrong with staying with this particular hotel chain. However, I have to admit I was very disappointed from many various aspects of this hotel. I am a certified road warrior business traveler and have stayed at more hotels than my own home. Seriously! I booked this hotel through Priceline and stated I wished to stay at a 4 star hotel in this area. 99% of the time I agree with the rating they give the hotels. However, they missed the star rating mark on this hotel. I would give this hotel a 3 star rating. This may not seem like a big difference, but believe when I tell you that one star even \u00c2\u00bd a star makes a difference. My emotions really want to give this hotel a 2 \u00c2\u00bd star rating. Let me explain why\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 1. The hotel looks very old and shows its age. They made a meager attempt to make it something. However, that something\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. is just plain odd. It looks appears they are having money problems and are trying their best to keep the hotel afloat. 2. Crazy additional expenses such as $15 per day for self parking, $14.95 per day internet (Most 4 star offer this complementary) Breakfast buffet was $20 plus taxes and gratuity = $26.00 for eggs and bacon etc. Evening snack personal size pizza was $18. No extra gratuity added. Business center charges .55 per minute for dial up speeds. .59 per printed page. Over $26 in less than 11 minutes. 3. Imagine the worst bed you have ever slept in and you will have a good idea of what to expect. The king beds only have standard pillows. No king pillows. That really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad but the bed is horrible. 4. The staff does seem to offer the basic customer service that you would expect from a 4 star hotel. That is about wraps it up. If you are planning on visiting Sea World you will love the location. Otherwise, for other travelers I would not recommend this hotel, especially business travelers.

It's your typical new Florida hotel with a huge courtyard in the middle and the rooms surround it. Some of the rooms have balconies that overlook the courtyard. The courtyard has some restaurants and huge areas for conventions, etc. We stayed on the 9th floor, front of the hotel, overlooking Sea World. We picked this hotel due to its proximity to Sea World. While you can walk right across the street to Sea World, we had to drive to Discovery Cove and Aquatica where we spent most of our time. Unfortunately, this hotel is not near Disney and there is no shuttle from the hotel. It's about 20 minutes to Downtown Disney from this location. When you first drive up, it's somewhat confusing. The self parking lot has a gate and you can't get in without a key. There are daily charges to park there also. So, you're forced to valet park in front which also costs money. When we walked in, you are greeted immediately and helped. The front desk was awesome and made check-in a breeze. Since we were Marriott Rewards members, we were offered a package of free valet parking, internet and breakfast for a slight additional charge. This was great while we were there, but turned into a checkout nightmare when we were charged for these services instead of being credited. Technically, we weren't supposed to get this package (we were a day early) so there was some disagreement on the charges. Eventually, they credited everything. But if we didn't have this package, there would have been alot of extra charges at check out which totally inflates the actual cost to stay here. The hotel itself is either new or newly renovated. Everything is clean and trendy. The rooms are your typical Mariott: roomy, big beds with lots of pillows, a nice flat screen TV and a desk area to do work or work on your laptop. The Internet is not free in the rooms. When we were there is was $15 a day. Not sure why Fairfield Inns offer free internet access but these upscale Mariotts do not. In the public areas, there is some free Wi-Fi, but it's quite slow. The rooms are excellent. They are clean and updated including the bathroom, all renovate. We didn't hear any noise from guests next to us or above us. The sleep experience was excellent especially when you're walking around all day at the Parks and you're tired. The pool out back is really nice. Alot of seating, a pool bar, towels, etc. There are outdoor fireplaces in use at night. It's a big hotel with alot of space. You can see that they must have conventions and/or business meetings. When we were there, it didn't feel packed with people especially during the day when everyone is out at the Parks. In the Courtyard, there are several restaurants/bars, a Starbucks and a gift store. We ate at the TradeWinds breakfast buffet which was pretty good each day. The service was excellent and the food selection adequate. We ate there because it was part of the package but it is somewhat expensive for breakfast if we had to outright pay for it. But, you could definitely eat a big breakfast here instead of the Parks and save time. We also ate at the Boardwalk Bar the first night because of a late check in. It's your typical sports bar/pub food. The food was fine and has alot of TVs. Overall, this is a really nice, clean updated hotel and a perfect location if your vacation includes Sea World. It was kid friendly and perfect for families. It's very quiet for a good night sleep.

One of the largest vanities I've seen in a hotel room of late and nice size shower (took a while for really hot water to come on). Starbucks onsite. Aveda toiletries. Plenty of good quality towels. Comfortable beds and bedding. Negatives: Restaurant menu and quality is sub-par and pricey. No other options within close walking distance. Paid $20 for a very mediocre breakfast buffet aimed at families e.g. Froot Loop dispensers and cheap danish for the kiddies. Huge size carrot and celery sticks looked like fodder for Sasquatch. Atmosphere was dreary - wooden tables with haphazard table settings. For $199/night would have expected something a bit more upscale. From that point forward, made a point to go elsewhere. Also just one bar of soap in the room - can you spare it? Onsite taxi pickup appears to have some sort of arrangement with hotel with inconsistent pricing to the same destination depending on who was assigned by the valet. We heard this from several drivers along the way.

As we pulled up the hotel is very nicely lanscaped with beautiful grounds. The valet area that you pull into is very grand with huge curtains hanging down to the ground. As you enter the hotel you see large TV's showing all kinds of underwater fish. Just Beautiful! We checked in with no problems and were given a room on the 8th floor.

We went back down to get something to eat. We ate at the bar area and the appitizers were very good. We also ate at Tradewinds and thought that was really good too. The French Onion Soup was delish!

The hotel is a convention hotel and they had a realtors convention going on during the days we were there. It's a different feeling than being at a Disney hotel but for the price it was really nice.

First-off, the location - just perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better located hotel. Just off the I-4 and 528, it's really easy to get to from airports/disney/universal, as well as being just off I-Drive. If you want to be on I-Drive, it's maybe not ideal, and it's certainly best for those with a car, but if you're happy to drive the 5 minutes to Pointe Orlando for dinner, it's brilliant, away from the hustle of I-Drive. In addition, it's easy walking distance to SeaWorld, and the concierge are happy to drive you to Aquatica and SeaWorld for free (in a Cadillac Escalade too, which feels very classy!). Second, the quality of the rooms - we were in a King Room, and it was HUGE! The room was beautiful, the bed huge, with a desk, sofa and armchair, big HD flat-screen, walk-in wardrobe, fridge, safe. We had a pool view, sunset view and no balcony, which we didn't mind at all. In fact, as we had a Yellowjacket nest right outside our window we were glad, although we loved watching our little wasps working away each morning! Third, the hotel in general - the pool was beautiful, with cosy cabanas, 2 hot tubs, and a pool bar. We enjoyed evening swims, so we could've done with the pool being a couple of degrees warmer, but we loved the funoodles and snorkels that were available. The atrium area is just breathtaking. We spent a bit of time in the Boardwalk bar - the food there is brilliant, as are the cocktails. Try the Renaissance Sunrise and the Rum Runner! Reception staff were very happy to help with any queries we had, and gave us directions leaflets, restaurant recommendations and change for the arcade, among other things! We got a glass of champagne at reception, and when I was given a false charge at the end of the trip, the staff was more than happy to take the charge off, with no quibbles. When I enquired about a coach booking I'd made to Busch Gardens, and the time we had to be at the bus stop, the staff went above and beyond the call of duty, calling to make sure we were booked in. The fitness centre is also brilliant, and I enjoyed spending a couple of quiet mornings there. We went to Tradewinds one morning for breakfast, and the buffet was fantastic; I was very impressed by the quality and number of items on offer. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the price - $20 for breakfast is just too steep. Parking is free, which is great, as is WiFi in the lobby - don't get internet in your room, go downstairs! In addition, the shop is great, and has everything we needed during our time there. The laundry facilities were also top-notch, and it's brilliant having clean clothes halfway through your holiday. My only complaint about the Renaissance was the lack of an appropriately-priced breakfast or WiFi - at what is quite an expensive hotel, I believe such facilities should be increased. In addition, I didn't appreciate what was quite a pushy timeshare salesperson who had a desk in the atrium - while I appreciate that Marriott has a timeshare club and they need to promote that, I found the salesperson unnecessarily pushy, to the point that we avoided using the door near the salesperson's desk for the majority of our holiday. To conclude, the Renaissance is an absolutely fantastic hotel, and if you're looking for a really special holiday in Orlando, I would recommend this hotel over any other.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cTop hotel, great location, best hotel in Florida\u201d", "Author": "Deni48", "ReviewID": "UR80480395", "Content": "I thought this hotel was great.

Great location for Sea World (you can walk over from the hotel) and you can also catch a free shuttle bus from Sea World to Aquatica. 2. A lot of conferences were going on in the hotel but this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem at all 3. There was a fridge in the room 4. Free parking onsite 5. There were PCs set up in hotel for checking in online with Virgin 6. The room was clean and a nice size 7. The swimming pool was good and never too busy 8. There are rooms facing inside the hotel and those facing outside. We had a room facing outside and noise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem so if I went back I would request a room facing the outside again. 10. Staff were really friendly and helpful This was a higher class of hotel than those I saw on International Drive. If you don't need to walk out straight onto International Drive then I would definitely go with this hotel! Best place we ate at was Flippers Pizzeria. The staff and pizzas were fantastic. There are 2 Flippers near to Sea World, a really small one which is more of a take out place and a nice restaurant one where it is better if you are eating out. I also recommend Discovery Cove.

Service was excellent, lovely marble features everywhere and our room had its own personal balcony looking out at the back of the hotel and from which you could see the pool. I think we were really luck to have this room and if you are going to stop you may want to try and specifically request this type of room - we had lots of sun in the later afternoon and evening and I could just bask in it! Please note that lots of the rooms have balconies but they look into the inside of the hotel so please be specific. The bathroom had his and her basins, complementary soaps and shower products, great big lcd tv, a sofa, few easy chairs, tables, fridge, coffee maker and room safe for which there was no additional charge. The pool outside was bliss with plenty of sun loungers and two jacuzzis. We only went in the jacuzzi on our last day and it was really hot - perhaps too hot for some - I had to work my way into it. Gym was fantastic and I took full use of this - personal tv screens on most of the equipment and so much better than the gym at home that I currently use. Benefit of staying here was that you could walk to both Seaworld - really just opposite the hotel and round the corner to Aquatica - about a 7 minute walk, thus saving on having to pay between $12 - $15 dollars for the priviledge of parking your car there. Also parking at the hotel for residents was free. Downside for me (as I was not the one that was driving) was there you are not really within walking distance of any shops or restaurants - we usually stop somewhere on international drive so I am more used to just going out of the hotel and going to a restaurant or the shops and you cannot do that there. There is an i-trolley stop just outside the hotel and we did use this once but they don't run late and getting back to the hotel from Universal Studios was a horrendous $25 - the taxi that we had was driven by someone with no skills whatsoever, who drove like a madman and it was a sheer relief to just get back to our accommodation in one piece (although feeling quite sick). The staff were wonderful - very helpful and a late checkout for us was not a problem for them and my partner said he would definately like to go there again.

We had dinner in the Tradewinds restaurant. The food was fantastic and top notch service. The seating area extends into the relaxing lobby which made it even better as the atmosphere in the evening there is even more relaxing. We also spent some time out at the pool. This area was probably the most amazing and unexpected. There are landscaped garden areas, many small seating areas, one with fire pit. There are huge checker and chess games (the chess pieces were as big as my child!) and ping pong and foosball games on the lanai. The main pool is huge and clean. There is also a children's pool, 2 hot tubs and a playground. All are surrounded by lush landscaping, comfy, cushioned lougers and some cabana-like seating that I'd never seen before. You really feel like you are at a much higher-end resort. We didn't use the pool bar, but it appeared very convenient and also in a beautiful setting. We walked over to SeaWorld twice during our stay and both times were given cold water as we departed and more cold water as we returned.

Coming back to the hotel after Sea World did its big fireworks display can be VERY tricky. Traffic was a mess and they closed one of the street near the property, so I had to drive around it. My big gripe was the \"lost and found\" department, which I think should be called \"lost and lost\". When we were there, we left $200 worth of electronics (mostly video games for kids) at the room. On the next day, once we realized what happened, we immediately called the hotel and was transferred to the lost and found department.

Second, I told them that we were celebrating a birthday and they sent a nice package with champange and fruit basket. Third, This hotel is walking distance from SeaWorld so you dont have all the hassle with parking and fees. Cant beat that. Also, they have a nice pool area, table tennis, bars, and plenty of areas to lounge and relax. What more could ask for? The rates are usually pretty good too! The only cons I could write are as follows: (1) The Marriott International Vacation Club tried to sell us one of those time share thingys (2) The AC did not get a cold as we would of liked. We didnt bother to complain because we were gone most of the time (3) The parking fee is $15 which does suck. 4) Save your money on the spa. It's a bit overpriced and I have been way better.

As a person whom works out I was happy to have a safe and clean environment with a variety of working machines and free weights. Plus clean headphones were available for free to use on the machines-excellent. Free apples- a nice touch. The hotel is promoted as green. I found a couple of black recycle bins but I had to ask a member of the staff what I could put inside. Typically blue is the color associated with recycling. There was no signage, even in the rom, that the hotel recycles. I often saw recyclable items put into the trash can by hotel guests. I was at the hotel for business. I hope the recyclable items left in the meeting rooms were recycled. In the bathroom was a sign that to keep your towels hang them up and if you want new ones place on the floor. I hung my towels but when I came back to the room they were both folded and arranged with the other towels. I purposefully moved the towels I wasn't going to use out of the way. I wonder if they gave me new towels anyway. It seems a shame to have to wash all the towels when I only used two. I do understand hygeine and clean items for the next person. The room itself was beautiful but chilly. It took a while for me to get the room a comfortable temperature. I had to turn the air condtioner and fan off. The bed was comfortable and the room clean. I agree with others that the $15 parking fee for a staying guest is high. There were at least two other organizations having events at the same time but the hotel parking lots had plenty of room. I suppose taxes plays a role in the high fee but ontop of everything else one has to pay for includng food it is costly.

The lobby and pool area are beautiful and our room with an atrium view was awesome. We liked the double sinks in the bathroom. The breakfast buffet at Tradewinds was fresh and delicious. It was very convenient to walk across the street to Sea World. Our problems began on the night that my parents were driving in to spend one night with us. In Jan., when I booked the room, I had asked for adjoining and atrium view rooms. I was told that could not be guaranteed, which I understood. We arrived on a Thurs. and double checked to see if our request could be honored and it was punched into the computer and I was never told that it could not be guaranteed, so I assumed that we were all set. On Fri., we were going to Discovery Cove and checked with the front desk again to make sure that they were aware that my parents would be checking in before we returned and wanted to make sure they would be able to get the key for their room. Again, I was assured that things were set for the room next to us. It was a great surprise when we returned to find that my parents were not in the room next to us and did not have an atrium view, actually their room had a view of a rooftop. I was quite embarrassed, since this was a birthday gift for them. My daughter had looked so forward to being right next door to Grandma and Grandpa and being able to go back and forth between our two rooms. Now, they were on the opposite end of the hall. When I went to the desk to find out why the room next to us had been given to someone else, they had no explanation, but told us we could move to two other adjoining rooms. None of us wanted wanted to go through the inconvenience of packing up and moving for one night. To top it off, the people that they put in the room that was supposed to be for my parents were so loud. We were up between midnight and one. Since this was a gift for my parents, I had asked that they not get a bill. Well, they received one under their door. It was not included on ours. When I questioned this error, I was told that you have to request this. My response was - I did, but it was just one more request that had not been honored. We will not stay here again, simply because it will be a reminder of a very stressful time.

Not sure I've seen a more interesting interior to a hotel. The rooms were a little small but elegant and especially nice if you get a balcony, which we did, helping to expand the living space. And the staff at the hotel were uniformly courteous. There were only two negatives for us. First of all, the in-room thermostat seemed to be a facade or at best, very inefficient. When we arrived, our room was freezing. We turned up the thermostat and nothing happened so after our call, a staff person from engineering came up to our room and told us that the system was very slow and we needed to turn up the thermostat to 90 degrees if we wanted the room to get warmer. We did but the room did not warm up until about 12 hours later, thus making for a rather chilly evening. The 2nd downside was the housekeeping staff did not appear to understand the concept of a \"green\" hotel. We kept putting our towels on the rack so they would not be taken away and washed but yet every time we came back to our room, the towels were brand new and fresh.

My husband and I had taken two friends along as a treat (so 2 x adjacent double rooms), as we had two very significant birthdays to celebrate, plus it was their first trip to Orlando, so we wanted somewhere special which would impress them and provide comfort. Well, the Renaissance certainly did that! We all loved the hotel and we had a fabulous 10 day holiday there. Reay, a concierge, cannot be praised enough. He was so helpful when we had trouble with our hire car. He was also incredibly kind and helpful to me when he saw my mobility problems and he instantly produced a wheelchair for my use throughout our stay (an absolute godsend). Lovely man and a great asset to the hotel. Next for thanks and compliments is Terry, the Front Desk Manager. Brilliant, friendly and always helpful. He always seemed to be around and he always had tickets for this or that, or for free drinks at various restaurants. Another lovely and helpful man. Resourceful too. Oh, and several times he gave us bottles of iced water when he saw us hot and weary. Mike, a server at Tradewinds. Friendly, chatty and very knowledgeable about US wines. We really enjoyed chatting with him (and comparing notes about wine and roller coasters!). As I've said, we really enjoyed our stay at the Renaissance, and it is the best location you could wish for for Seaworld. We were very impressed with the whole atrium and entrance areas, and our rooms were spacious (we had a great view over Seaworld, which we'd specifically requested), clean and extremely comfortable with plenty of wardrobe/drawer space. Splendid bathrooms too. We had 3 or 4 evenings when we got \"home\" quite late and very tired after a busy day, so being able to just head for the hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, was such a bonus. In our experience it is actually quite unusual to find such a great hotel restaurant, so this was a terrific surprise. We thoroughly enjoyed some brilliant food there - the Black Angus Burger is tremendous, likewise the Harris Ranch Ribeye Steak. The Lobster Bisque is a meal in itself! Great selection of wines too. I'd read beforehand that the Renaissance serve an incredible breakfast, so we were looking forward to that. What I'd read was absolutely true - the buffet breakfasts at the Renaissance were superb, plentiful and delicious. On our last day, needing to return the hire car early afternoon, we had lunch by the pool in the The Palms pool bar. What a lovely, relaxing hour that was! Altogether a fantastic hotel, which ensured we had a fantastic holiday. We just cannot praise the Renaissance Orlando Resort enough. We will definitely stay there again, and will most certainly recommend it to friends or anyone. You can tell we enjoyed it, can't you? :o) Thank you, Renaissance!

Our room had a good size bathroom, high 9-10 foot ceiling, bright colors - and was exceptionally clean. We had a room with 2 queen beds and a sitting area and balcony. It was a much better size room than your standard Disney room and so was more comfortable to spend time in the room. Our package included tickets to Sea World - which is literally a 5 min walk across the street. Made it a no stress process especially since we avoided the car rental. So good location if you are going to Sea World. I should mention it is 12 miles from the airport and, although we didn't go, on the trolley route for the nearby Orlando Premium outlets (bus stops in front of the hotel). We also enjoyed the outdoor pool. Kids had a blast while mom and dad sat at the outdoor cafe/bar. It was a nice set up - great place for snack and cocktail in a covered yet outdoor setting right next to the pool. We used the on premises Starbucks for breakfast (which was overpriced) and Tradewinds Restaurant for dinner. Again, food was a little expensive ($80 dinner with a few drinks) but the food was indeed very good.

We took up the offer to pay for a gift from Shamu, and requested extra towels. Appreciated the complimentary champagne when checking in-but went to our room to find no gift from Shamu (we wanted to suprise our 4yo)-and three towels for three of us. Flip lock to adjoining room wouldn't throw a lock-so they sent an engineer to come fix that, while someone else searched for our gift we ordered. Located fridge in room (under safe)-put milk in there; came to find out next day it was an old courtesy bar-and the employee that assisted us couldn't understand why they hadn't put in the new refrigerators yet, as they had arrived. Brought us up an old mini fridge-door was unbolted from hinge on top-so you had to lift up door to open/close. That worked fine, until it was unplugged while we were at the parks one day. Mattresses are not at all what they rave them to be-remember those egg crates you'd put on top of dorm mattresses in college? Not too different. Our mattress was concaved to the middle so we took turns sleeping with our four yo-otherwise, we'd roll into each other during the night (the mattress was so bad that the bottom sheet wouldn't stay on). We had a late night one night at the parks (Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween)-and returned to our room at 12:30a to find that it had never been made up during the day. Garbage was full, beds unmade-and no towels. Called downstairs to ask what happened-they were unsure. Had to ask if we could at least get towels. Offered newspaper delivery when we checked in-never did get that all week-each day was a different reason as to why it hadn't been delivered. If you have ever stayed at Opryland Hotel-imagine that big open atrium area-that's how this hotel is designed-so all the hotel rooms' doors face out to that open area-it's loud til about 1/1:30a because of people congregating downstairs in the lobby area (popular sushi bar, etc)-the only saving grace to this is the darkening curtains your room has-so we'd sleep in later, but missed a lot of time being at the parks early. Pool is fabulous-especially being able to have a meal right there-they are a little stingy on the towels down there (tough some times to get one)-but if you come at the beginning of the day, there is one at each lounge chair. Food is good in the restaurants-went to all but sushi bar-neat having Starbucks right in the lobby. Disappointed in the valet-one guy in particular would be texting on his cell each morning-as we stood waiting for him to offer to assist us-when he finally did call for our car and it arrived-he'd open the door for my husband-not my daughter and I-and we quickly realized by day two-he was more interested in the tip, then in helping the ladies out. Love that they have computers set up in the lobby specifically to print your boarding passes (nice touch). If you are truly looking to get away from work, this wasn't the place to go. They really seemed to cater to business conferences and they were packed-at the pool, restaurants, and throughout the lobby-a constant reminder of work at home, not of people enjoying their leisure time/vacation. Had an extra-and hefty room service charge on our check out bill for our first night-though we had used room service once, it wasn't our first night. Front desk couldn't provide me what the charge was far, and simply removed it stating that they probably charged the wrong room number (slightly disconcerting). Our last trip, we had stayed at Hyatt Grand Cypress-and although we paid considerably more for our stay-the customer service was amazing compared to here. Can't say I'd be quick to return-unless they start to remember that it's the customers that keep that hotel going-not just the trendy decor.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cAlways a great stay!\u201d", "Author": "DIORLOU", "ReviewID": "UR47352732", "Content": "This is th second time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel and is certainly not the last.

Upon arrival at the hotel, you realise just how close it is to SeaWorld, literally it is across the road! We checked in and were given complimentary champagne, and were told we had a room with a pool view. I asked if there was a balcony in this room and was told no, and then we were offered a room on the 8th floor with a balcony, which we accepted. First point to make, the reception staff are very friendly, courteous and helpful, and this made a welcome change from some of the other hotels we have stayed at ! The atrium is lovely, very airy and spacious, with two bars and a restaurant, and also seating areas (where you see many business folk on their laptops) - there is also a Starbucks, which was handy in the morning, a shop that sells general sundries, and also the Expedia desk, who were also very helpful in arranging things for us. We flew with Virgin so we had complimentary Mears transport, so all we had to do was get a voucher from reception and then arrange our transport - all very easy! The room was very spacious, with a double sink unit in the bathroom and good shower unit. The beds were by far the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in, just gorgeous. You also get an LCD flat screen tv with basic cable, as well as 2 armchairs and a table. The view from the balcony through the sliding doors looked out onto the pool area and tennis courts and out to Orlando. I really cannot say enough good things about this hotel, we had a perfect stay, and if people were worried (like we were) about not driving on this holiday, dont be. The Mears transport is excellent and very promt for drop off and pick ups, and furthermore, there is an IRide and Lynx stop right outside the hotel, perfect for going up to I Drive, or even to Disney (Number 50 Lynx). And as i said, Seaworld is across the street,so its a short walk for there and the Busch Gardens shuttle. The swimming pool area is beautifully landscaped, and there are loungers and also a bar - the pool was lovely! For kids there is also an arcade area. A fitness centre is also located on the ground floor, and also a Fed Ex office which you have 24 hour access too if you dont have wi fi, you can use the computers in there for a small charge. One minor thing, we only ate in house once, and that was room service, it came to $43 all in for two cheeseburgers and fries. If you arent in the mood to go out of an evening, ask reception and they give you local take away delivery options that is wel worth it!

We didn't get the type of room that we had requested, ie pool view or atrium view, despite the hotel being very quiet. When I asked about moving rooms, we were given the option of a pool view room, but was informed that guests could be in the pool until any time of night, and I was wary of lots of late night noise, so we stayed where were. Although the hotel had apparently been renovated, our room wasn't one of them and the ceiling had stains and needed painted. You could also hear the guests in the room next door, which luckily was only for a few nights. Also, our fridge didn't work at all. I'd advise guests to ask for a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony, overlooking Seaworld. On the plus side, the room was large and the beds very comfortable. The hotel staff were nice, although I was taken aback by the comments from one of the Duty Managers, 'Terry'. During our first week, the hotel fire alarm went off twice on seperate nights. This could of course happen anywhere, but I was concerned that the alarm was very quiet and only sounded in the main hotel reception area. There was no alarm in our room, which I feel is a safety issue, especially for the hard of hearing. My husband bearly heard it either. I looked out onto the balcony, down towards reception, as many other guests were also doing. No-one knew if we were to evacuate our rooms, there were no instructions to be heard after the alarm stopped. There was also no staff on reception when I tried phoning to ask if we were to evacuate, I had to keep waiting for the call to be answered. I mentioned this to the security guard when we returned one evening and he said a duty manager would give me a call, which'Terry' did. I expressed my concern about the low volume of the fire alarm and how many guests would simply not hear it, then it was simply turned off with no information. I said that if a fire alarm went off in a British hotel, it would be loud enough for everyone to be aware of it and everyone would need to evacuate. Terry didn't seem to have a clue about the fire alarm, as 'they have never had a fire'. He admitted he didn't know if the alarm would get louder if a fire was nearer our floor or not. Do the staff never have fire drills here? I certainly didn't feel reassured atfer speaking with this member of staff. The buffet breakfast in Tradewinds was good, although you wouldn't want to spend $20 per person each day on breakfast. We often went to Starbucks, but this had limited choice and always sold out of croissants by 9.30am. Hotel transfers to Universal or Aquatica were complimentary, when arranged, although had set times to drop you and return for you. Hotel pool was very nice, plenty of loungers which were complimentary. Car park had plenty of spaces very close to the hotel (again, we were there off peak). Food was good in the Sports Bar. Overall, we felt it was a reasonably good hotel but certainly not '5*' as we'd read in the Virgin Holiday brochure, and not worth the money we paid,. On checking out, reception staff didn't ask how we'd enjoyed our stay, which was unusual.

The bath room was large and had two sinks. There was a large flat screen TV in the room. All the staff were very helpfull and provided local transport to the Disney parks. Sea world is just across the road and took 2 mins to walk there. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is cheaper than staying in Disney and it was only 10 minutes in the car. The dining was excellent and we had room service most nights as it was cheap enough. The bar was good if a little expensive.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a square box with an amazing lobby and standard rooms. We booked this Hotel with Virgin as a package from their \"Platinum Selection\". When we arrived at the hotel and walked through the doors you can see where they spent the money refurbishing. A very nice looking atrium with the sound of waterfalls and the lighting giving the hotel a warm glow. We were very impressed with the atrium. Checking in was fine but even though the guy behind the desk was very helpful I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he really knew what he was doing. He offered us 3 different rooms but then retracted the offer each time and we ended up with the room we originally booked, which was fine for us anyway. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive the champagne as advertised and no help with our bags. Entering the room the first thing we noticed was the badly fitted carpets under and around the door.

From a distance the room looks fine and before I reel out all the things that were wrong with the room it was a relief that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a smelly, damp, dark dump like the last 2 hotels we stayed in when visiting Orlando last, but then we did pay nearly double this time and expected excellent rooms. Look closely and you will notice that the carpets were not hovered in the corners; the furniture in the room was quite tatty and rotten in places by the fridge and just a general lack of quality. None of the bedding fitted properly and had marks. Most of the towels were old and had stains as did the carpet in places. Check out the photos I added and you will see what I mean.

The room was very spacious with a lovely view and large bathroom / living area. We were also offered a choice of newspapers to be delivered to our door each morning free of charge which we enjoyed. We did not drive at all on our trip so we picked this hotel through Virgin as it had free scheduled transportation to Walt Disney World, Universal & Sea World parks.

All you need to do to arrange your free transport is pick up tickets from the concierge and hop along to Expedia (next to Starbucks) who will arrange it all for you. The Mears transport was always on time if not early, just don't be late as they won't wait for you too long! The pool was large and quiet and always had sun beds and towels available. Lovely tennis \\ basket ball courts to use with equipment plus table tennis, foosball and games room. The restaurants were reasonably priced and the staff were fantastic.

Both bedrooms were lovely and included lounge areas with large flat screen TVs and beautiful bathrooms.

We got a glass of champagne on arrival, now I dont know of another hotel that adds that special touch in the same area! The hotel food no matter which place you ate in was brlliant. The buffet breakfast although either $15 per person for continental or $20 per person for full buffet was maybe a bit pricier than other places on International Drive but the difference here was that the food was of quality, it also kept us going until dinner. Having ate at places like Ponderosa etc all you can eat for $3.99, these are awful buffets in comparison. The hotel was in an ideal location, steps from Seaworld and the bus stop and I trolley stop right outside. The hotel is beautiful inside. I would say to the other people who have complained about the rooms and whatever else, go and stay in the Quality Inn, or the Holiday Inn, or the Wyndham Orlando, then compare, let us know what special touches and service you get there! The Spa is beautiful and offers a full range of treatments and there is a 24 hour fitness centre which we also made use of.

The TV kept cutting out even when weather was good, also lot of things were missing in the room like ironing board and hair dryer. The maintenance never replaced anything properly we had to call many times to ask for more coffee, she would never replace it when she cleaned the room. Also, I went to the spa for a pedicure, the girl did not speak proper english and at one point brought 3 types of exfoliants and ask me which I wanted, I chose one. The at the end when I went to pay they told me it was 15$ extra for that exfoliant, I told them nobody told me she apologized but did not deduct. so a 55$ pedicure became 84$ with taxes and surcharges.

Of course we said yes. The lobby area and the hotel grounds are amazing & kept us busy exploring. Around 4:30 the clerk came to find me and apologized for the long wait...(there was no need for an apology) and then said because we waited so long she would give our room a $100 credit to be used anywhere in the hotel & didn't need to pay for parking! It's beautiful, the food was great (we had room service & ate at the Tradewind restaurant) - it was a tad pricey, but we didn't pay since we had the credit. The housekeeping staff was very nice and always greeted us whenever they saw us. Other staff members were very nice as well. They always gave our son little blow up toys or balls & offered to take family pictures for us.

We had requested a slightly early check-in which we were offered although also offered a room upgrade if we waited. Balcony rooms are nice and worth the wait if you can upgrade. Location is excellent for SeaWorld - just across the car park although be aware that the hotel charge guests 12USD per day for parking (which is a bit cheeky considering the hotel is only accessible by car, therefore 4 stars awarded not 5) so it's not like you'll save money. BUT it does mean that adult guests you can take advantage of the free beer in SeaWorld and just walk home! The other advantage with the location is you're right on the junction for the I-4 which means you can get to Disney in 10-15 mins without having to go anywhere near the highly congested International Drive (aka I-Drive). Whilst I-Drive is nearby it's not walkable so you'd still need to drive if you want to go out to the bars, restaurants, shops and mini golf that are located further north (and you would over a longer stay as the hotel restaurants are a bit limited and pricey) or I suppose you could get that elusive green trolley bus that stops outside although I wouldn't want to use that regularly as they are very slow and not frequent. Hotel itself is a massive venue, geared up for meetings, incentives, conferences, events which isn't necessarily a bad thing (rooms are large and well appointed catering for business guests) but it's certainly not cosy.

I didn't get to actually use the spa but it looked great and the gated pool was perfect for those of us with little ones (Please note it is gated - not padlocked as described by one reviewer!!) There is also cute little playground ideal for under 6's. The pool area is very clean and well designed and not too busy even though the hotel was full.

Firstly, for the price this hotel is the best value for money compared to some of the others like the Peabody or JW who charge random crazy rates depeding on what convention is going on (although you can get off-season priceline rates to the Peabody for around $60/night). I was at the Renaissance for business and the location can't be beat. It is one light from I-4 West and 2 lights from I-4 East bound. To get to the convention center you don't even have to go on any main roadways, and even if you do it is only the extremely quiet end of I-Drive. Also, I liked that I could get to the Premium Outlets mall via the back of I-Drive quicker than if I took the highway. The hotel itself had great service from the moment you valet. At check-in they offer you a complimentary glass of Moet champagne and your room elevators are literally 15 feet away from the reception desk so you don't have to carry your bags far. The hotel has a great recently remodeled atrium lobby along with remodled rooms. The rooms have raised unique ceilings that are unlike any hotel I have stayed at. Also, the rooms are extra large so there's plenty of room for your luggage as well as a sitting area to relax. If you can, get a room with an interior balcony. I would reccomend that over an exterior balcony if you are there for business. The bathrooms and tv stand are all granite The hotel also has a full service FedEx Kinkos in the lobby. The sports bar has mediocre food but the furnishing is top notch as well as all the HD tv's they had. None of that basic Vizio brand here, only LG and Sony. The sushi bar in the center of the hotel had great food as well as extremely nice furnishings. It would be used much more if it wasn't in the middle of the lobby. They have no music playing anywhere in the restaurant so the ambiance is pretty dull. The hotel also had a great pool area with a pool bar and full size tennis, basketball, and I'm pretty sure volleyball court. The fitness center was also great with nice gym quality machines and fresh towels and headphones placed on every machine. All the treadmills have built-in tvs and there is complimentary fruit and larger towels for when you are done.

TV - very complicated to work - purchased 2 movies when only trying to get to the menu for regular TV - they charged me for them but after me explaining that we did not watch any movies they reluctantly took it off. Another thing - charged my bill for 3 days worth of valet parking ($16.00 a day) plus $12.00 a day for self parking - we self parked the whole time. I had to go down to the desk and get that removed also. Be careful and check your final bill carefully. They try and add extra charges apparently. Also, housekeeping rushing us out of the room at 8:00 a.m. on checkout day - checkout is 10 a.m. Overall the facility is nice and very clean - beds are very comfortable. the staff is not overly friendly.

We HAVE to say that service was excellent from BEFORE we arrived. Booking the hotel twelve months in advance meant we had time to obtain information prior to our trip and the hotel responded promptly to all emails and even sent us an information pack about the hotel, local transport and the surrounding area. This staff service carried on right through our holiday. They were always happy to help and very cheerful and chatty. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car so were dropped off right outside the door and therefore saved on the daily parking charges others have mentioned. Check-in was a breeze and wife and I were given a glass of champagne. Kids made a dive to the iced water machine located in the lobby entrance (a machine which was to become a regular stop every day of our stay). Initial reaction to the central atrium was very nice following its recent renovation. Our room was excellent. Eventhough it was a standard room, there was plenty of space and had the benefit of facing SeaWorld. We unpacked and this is where we found the only fault in our two week stay. Storage space in the room can very easily get filled up when you have two weeks worth of clothing, especially when three of the four people are female, but this was a MINOR complaint. Once unpacked, we took kids down to the pool for a quick dip. This was interrupted by a thunderstorm and hotel staff were quick to evacuate pool for safety reasons. Kids are catered for in the pool with a selection of inflatables and also table tennis and table football. The energetic can have a game of tennis or basketball and at night a screen is setup showing films for the kids, even including the popcorn. Next morning we suffered the usual Europe to US side-effect of early morning wake up and this is when we discover one of the hotels little gems. During darkness the whole of the central atrium is well lit and it is at this time that this area actually looks it best. The hotel has a number of food outlets. Firstly is the Starbucks branch for those how fancy a coffee and muffin in the morning. The hotel also has a restaurant. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat here until our last morning, partially as it appeared a bit pricey but mainly as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the chance. We had breakfast here on the last morning and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault it. Kids eat free at the restaurant and this even extended to our 15 year old daughter (if only we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d realised before). For those wanting something to eat during the day, or simply crashing by the pool the best location is the pool bar. Meals are about $7to$15 approx but you can easily share one between two (as we found out from the leftovers from our first order). The pool staff take your order from your lounger, deliver to your lounger and you just charge straight to your room (or you can pay). At this stage it might be worth mentioning that any UK guests who are also member of Virgin Holidays FVC should ensure they get a voucher from reception which gives them 10% of all food in hotel. Food is also served at Sports bar (steaks and burgers) and Sushi bar but we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on these. Eating out around this hotel is a bit of a problem if you have no car. The I-Ride and Links buses to I Drive stop outside the hotel but the nearest restaurants/sops are located about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Although this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far a good proportion of the walk has to be done along grass verges, albeit well worn grass verges to the corner of International Drive and Westward Boulevard. Here are Chinese, pizza, Italian, steakhouse and even a Subway. Not having a car meant that we had to take advantage of the shuttles services. The hotel runs shuttles using Mears to Universal, Aquatica etc free of charge. To book shuttle visit the Expedia desk located near Starbucks. Hi to Paul and Janette there who were excellent during our stay arranging bookings and rebookings when members of our party changed there minds, and even just having a quick chat. Three shuttles run in the morning (8.25, 9.25 and 10.25) to the parks and you can either book your shuttle back or leave it open for you to ring later. In addition to the free shuttles they can also arrange for shuttles to Disney. These are charged for unless you are staying with Virgin Holidays (you need to get a pass from the concierge desk). Tickets are also available from here. Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any as we already had ours, talking to them indicated they were not the usual excessively charged tickets you might expect from hotels. To be honest for those going to Aquatica I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say walk across the road (literally!) to SeaWorld and take their shuttle. It runs all day and gives you the freedom to come when you want and go when you want. For Discovery Cove simply go out to the valet desk and they bring the hotels own car around to drive you across and they will collect you when DC ring them to advise you are coming back. All-in-all we had an excellent stay at the Renaissance. Would we go back? Well if my wife and children had there way we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be back there next week. The hotel is ideal for visiting SeaWorld and its related parties. There was nothing better than walking across the SeaWorld in the evening and being back at your hotel 5 minutes after you leave the park.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocala, Florida", "Title": "\u201c4th of July Family Tradition - Fantastic Resort\u201d", "Author": "OCALAFLORIDATRAVELER", "ReviewID": "UR17682643", "Content": "As a Platinum rewards member I expect the best that Marriott delivers.

Also be aware that the concierge will only tell you about taking taxi's to ANY location you might enquire about.

The location is convenient to all the major Orlando attractions. You can walk across the street to Sea World, or take a short drive, about 5 miles, to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, and other Disney parks. Cocoa Beach is about 55 miles away, but an easy drive. Everything went well upon our arrival. Valet parking is $16 per day, or you can self park for $12. We chose valet parking and they were very prompt with bringing our car around every time. We would call about 2 or 3 minutes before leaving our room and our car would be waiting. Check-in was fast and friendly and they offer a welcome glass of champagne. Our room was a standard King room without a view, which was fine for us, but you would have to request a view of Sea World if you want that. The bed was a little soft for both me and my husband, but we slept OK overall. Nice bathroom with double sinks and plenty of complimentary toiletries, and even a little Shamu bath toy! We did have an issue the first 2 nights with noise from the room next door. The first night we didn't call the desk and they were at it until 4a.m. The second night we called the desk and they sent security right up. The next morning my husband asked what will happen if they continue the behavior and was told they would be asked once to quiet down and failure to comply would result in eviction. We were pleased with how this problem was handled. Housekeeping did a good job. The carpet seemed like it needs a good deep cleaning, however. The hotel has a sushi restaurant, Mist, which was surprisingly yummy. The menu wasn't extensive, but the sushi was fresh and there were some innovative choices. One roll, I think it was called Tara's Volcano Roll, was so good we wanted a second! The pool area was lovely. There were lots of lounge chairs, although it did fill up on the weekend. There is a nice poolside bar and grill that has tasty food (sandwiches, salads and appetizers), cold drinks, and a friendly staff.

First and foremost, the staff is RIDICULOUSLY friendly (someone has trained them well!) and helpful. Every single member of staff was personable with me, particularly the housekeeping and room service staff, which just enhanced my experience. Also, the rooms are HUGE. I wanted to do cartwheels down the middle, it was that big. If you are traveling alone or with only one other person, you will have ample space (even with kids, there's room for everyone to stretch out). The rooms are also clean, warm and cozy -- the color scheme is vibrant greens and rich blues (the scheme for the entire hotel is \"Under the Sea\"-like, in fitting with their proximity to Sea World). The food and general social atmosphere at the restaurants are excellent. Mist Sushi bar is PERFECT for business travelers/young professionals, as they have a fun mixed drinks menu the sushi itself is DELICIOUS. I tried sushi for the first time there, and found the fish to be fresh and flavorful, though I have to say the \"wussie\" sushi was my favorite -- the chicken teriyaki rolls are perfect for the raw fish phobic -- it's basically a chicken wrap, yum. All the food in the hotel, including room service, is done out of the Tradewinds kitchen, and that is a very good thing! All food at Tradewinds is fresh, seasonal and organic. Beware some pricey dishes, but the *quality* of the food for the price is unsurpassed. The fare in Tradewinds proper is healthy/fine dining, whereas you have to go to the Bar and Grill to get things like mini burgers, chicken wings and pina coladas... but just note there are duplicate items across all the restaurant menus, and everything on the room service menu, you can go down to Tradewinds and order. (that said, the service fee on room service is roughly $5 an order, but the delivery is prompt, food hot and fresh and the staff very nice) I highly recommend the Tradewinds salads! Oh, if you do the breakfast service, they are very prompt about delivering your food at the time you request! Transportation can be tricky, especially if you're not renting a car. The I-Ride shuttle is easily accessible for going to attractions on International Drive, and only $1 a trip, but if you are staying here and intend to visit parks other than Sea World, rent a car, or stay somewhere more Disney-centric. But for Sea World? Ideal location, best hotel you can get. Other amenities: gym is fantastic (and free!), with a variety of machines, weight lifting equipment and a daily yoga class. Several of the machines have TVs attached, with all the channel selections you get from the rooms. Speaking of TVs -- the giant, widescreen plasma HD TVs in the room are ACE. (randomly, also, the desk chairs in the room are ergonomic and so comfortable). I didn't use the pool, but the pool area is gorgeous, and I heard only good things about it. The Starbucks closes at 3 p.m., so no late afternoon coffees, but it's great having it there in the morning. Oh! And there are coffee makers in the guest rooms. The coffee quality isn't the best, but for instant in the room, it's pretty good! Also, the elevators are speedy, so you're never waiting around long for them, which is a plus (I waited AGES at the Peabody). CONS: probably the biggest drawback for a business customer (or just an internet obsessed person such as myself), is both the cost of the internet and the lack of wireless. \"High speed\" internet is $14.95 a night. I have high speed in quotations, given I don't find a 50KB transfer rate very high speed. I spent one night at the Peabody on I-Drive and their high speed was going at 300KB a second. BIG difference. Fine for checking email and doing general things, but streaming video was VERY touch and go. There is no wireless connectivity in any of the rooms -- so you have to use an ethernet cable, which means if you didn't bring your own 25 foot cord, you are bound to the desk. I'm someone who likes to surf in bed, so that was right out. There is wireless in the lobby area, however, so those doing conference stuff or just those who like to laze about in Starbucks will be able to connect on your laptops. This hotel was in perfect proximity to work, so it was the ideal hotel for my needs. The friendliness of the staff, and especially their understanding I was on a long term stay and not getting in my way every day (they only cleaned the room when I asked, but left me extra chocolate every day! :D), plus the size of my room and quality of the Tradewinds food (which I was eating twice a day), made up for any shortcomings the hotel might have. I had a room facing away from the Atrium, and found it very quiet, which was great -- there were plenty of kids staying there, and I barely noticed. There's a good mix of business/conference people and families, which was nice. If you're going to Sea World, on a business trip or there for a conference, I highly recommend the hotel.

I was surprised to receive a private message regarding my comment I posted on Trip Advisor, from a manager of The Renaissance, inviting us to stay at his hotel. He said he'd be honored to have a military family stay at his hotel. My husband called, spoke to him personally, and we were given a room for Easter weekend. We immediately cancelled the reservations at the other hotel.Upon check in, my husband was informed our room was on the top floor, facing Sea World. This would be perfect to see the fireworks from Sea World at night. It was. The manager also sent us up a hand written note with some beverages and fruit, welcoming us to the hotel, and told us to contact him if we needed anything. We truly felt welcome. We only had one minor problem and that was there was no bedding on the pull out sofa. We didn't open up the bed until late at night and by that time, housekeeping had left, so we compromised and used a sheet from the bed. The next day housekeeping made up the bed, so it really wasn't a big deal. As for the room itself, it was tastefully decorated, very spacious and comfortable. My daughter and husband played tennis and swam, though the temperature of the water was cold due to the time of year. My daughter received her Shamu, which my beagle now claims as his own, and it was nice to have the bed turned down in the evening with chocolates left for us. My husband was offered a drink at check in, but politely declined. The hotel was quiet, not the typical tourist hotel where you hear all of the people outside. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants because we were basically in Orlando to visit our son who is in culinary school, so we tried to eat on a budget. My husband and I were so happy with the service we received that we will definitely stay at The Renaissance for our future overnight stays in Orlando.

As in some earlier reports they said of the front desk staff not being very friendly, i found none of this and found them all to be friendly and helpful.One word of caution though, as with alot of US hotels this hotel is very high, 10 floors in fact, and if you don't like heights as my wife doesn't it may be worth taking this into consideration, as it has glass fronted lifts as well.This hotel also gets very busy with corporate events, i didn't think this had a negative effect on the hotel i think it brought a buzz to the place. We also saw a wedding while we were there which was really nice. The florida gators american football team were staying at the hotel and also alot of supporters which also brought a buzz to the place, i got in the lift one night and 4 of the players got in, those guys were huge, i felt about 2 foot tall. Alot of long faces though as they got beat. I agree with the last few reports about the food in the hotel. The tradewinds restaurant looked quite expensive and i think you could get the same quality meal for less elsewhere, although the meal we had in the sports bar was nice the menu was very limited especially if you have children like we do. All in all a great hotel in a great location just let down slightly by the food options. On a personal point of view , if i were to go back to florida i would stay at a private villa with its own pool. This by no means puts a black cloud over the hotel, just my own point of view. I would have liked to have gone back to the villa after a long day in the parks and enjoyed a swim with the children and a glass of wine with my wife. But the main point is that i dont think i could face another burger.steak, chicken or pizza etc. as found in vast quantities in the parks, all my daughter wanted after the first week was an egg mayo sandwich, easy if your in a villa as supermarkets are vast and found everywhere, but not so easy if your in a hotel room.

I was a little bit skeptical considering that the hotel was undergoing renovations, but I am happy to report that with the exception of fewer places to eat than you would like to have, the property is fairly complete. Check in was a breeze. The front desk staff were gracious and accomodating. We were offered glasses of champagne which was actually quite good. We were in our rooms within 5 minutes of checking in and our luggage was brought up with us. The rooms - WOW. While not as luxurious as say a Four Seasons would be, these were absolutely some of the largest standard hotel rooms I have ever seen. The beds were comfortable, the room was decorated in lovely shades of blue and green and the bathroom was just tremendous. There is a flat panel TV as well as a good deal of storage place. You could stay there for weeks and not feel claustrophobic. Food - There are only two restaurants open. We ate in the sports bar twice and it was very good. Our server went out of her way to make sure we were happy. The sushi bar did not seem to be open while we were there, but looked gorgeous. Of course there is a full Starbucks on the property which we indulged in quite a few times. Location - This hotel is located directly across from Sea World and it is less than a 5 minute walk. They also have rooms with exterior balconies that overlook Sea World. It's a quiet location, far from the bustle you feel in the Disney resorts. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. I had a truly wonderful experience and would not hesitate to go back!!!", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bendygirl", "Title": "\u201cFabulous, Stunning!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bendyGirl", "ReviewID": "UR8850929", "Content": "I stayed for two weeks at the Rennaisance Hotel by Seaworld from Sept 1st 2007, after reading some of the reviews earlier in the year I was a bit wary of what this hotel would be like however i needn't have worried, this hotel is beautiful, every bit a 5 star rating. The rooms have everything you need from cotton buds to irons, hairdryers and coffee machine. They are cleaned daily to an excellent standard. Like most top class hotels this one is excellent for those with disabilities with very few steps in the hotel everything is accessible, they also have rooms specific for diabled guests. The staff are very friendly from Janitors to senior managers, the food is excellent (although portions are massive) the breakfast buffet is must for everyone!!. The hotel has 5 restaurants plus a starbucks and gift shop (no deli which is reported in some brochures). Unfortunately the Atlantis restaurant and the Winstons pub were closed when we were there for refurbishment which does reduce your dining options within the hotel. For some travel companies the hotel offers free shuttle bus to all the parks, all you have to do is collect a voucher from the conceirge and hand this to the shuttle desk, bookings have to be made 90mins before departure though. If you get worn out by visiting all the parks then you can relax by the pool which is never very busy, there is also a pool side bar and restaurant which serves very good food. TV INTERNET - don't use, it's very slow and you can't get access to some sites however the business centre which is open weekdays 7am-5pm have internet access at 25c per minute, I went in there most days and it never cost me more than two dollars which is cheaper than the $10 for 24hrs the hotel charges for the tv internet. TIPS - Before you go on holiday join the Marriott rewards program, when you arrive you will receive a 10% VIP card for use in the tradewinds restaurant (food only) and since this is the only restaurant to do breakfast you can usually save around 4-5 dollars per day on breakfast alone. The I-Ride trolley is a must and there is a stop right outside the entrance to the hotel (very handy!!!) costing $1 or 25c for Senior Citizens it is an inexpensive way to travel. Pick up a brochure on board the trolley and this will give you a map of all the stops and also discount vouchers - my recommendation - go to stop 43 (premium outlets) take voucher from the I-ride book into the customer desk in the food court and they will give you a book of vouchers for the outlet shops. Seaworld is a 5 min walk, yes really!!!! PARKS - a lot of parks have now introduced fingerprinting at the entrance gates accompanied by photo id - so take your passports with you. DINING OPTIONS - we went to see Dixie Stampede which was very enjoyable, lovely dinner and very reasonable for price, you get a free souvenier drinking cup as well!! Get there early as you can see the horses that will be used in the show, there is also a pre-show event which is very funny.. CIRQUE DU SOLEIL - a must!!!! absolutely fantastic!!!! BLUE MAN GROUP - very funny, indescribable, stunning visual effects!! - beware though, if you sit in Zone 1 (behind poncho section) you may still get messy!!! BUSCH GARDENS - There is free transportation from seaworld bus parking area each morning but you need to phone in advance to book but as this is a local call is doesn't cost much from the hotel room (less than a dollar). Take a change of clothes as you will get wet on the water rides!! OVERALL TIP - BUY BEFORE YOU GO, if you can, buy your park tickets on-line before you go as this will get you the cheapest price (I went through attraction tickets direct and unlike some companies i received the actual tickets before I went on holiday and not a voucher, with the exception of the Cirque du Soleil) I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would definately go back........", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nigelfromkent", "ReviewID": "UR8711500", "Content": "We just returned from 2 weeks at the Renaissance and I really cannot fault this hotel.

I was really nervous after some of the previous reports of building works, but shouldn't have been since there is now no evidence of any work. We arrived at 5pm and were offered a fabulous room with a balconey overlooking Seaworld. I guess we are really fussy and I just had this thing about wanting one of those rooms with a view of the atrium. They didn't have one ready, but said if we went to get some tea and came back in an hour they would have one ready. Sure enough it was! The room was large and had a flat panel TV with Keyboard and Internet Access. There as a safe and fridge thrown in free of charge too. The bathroom had two sinks which was really handy of a morning and was well stocked with everything including bottled water. The papers were delivered everyday. Service? Well that was good too. One day we went out and forgot to take the 'do not disturb' off the door. We came in a 10pm to find the room had not been serviced (our fault really). We phoned down and within 10 mins the was someone there doing the full works. Also on the first morning the smoke alarm in the room went off - again we reported it and it was immediately replaced. That night there was a 'sorry' note in the room with chocolates on the beds. I guess my main gripe about the rooms was that I think there was a lack of storage draws and cupboards. Bearing in mind the size of the rooms there was plenty of space it fit them it. The Starbucks was a godsend, although it does get busy in the mornings, specially if there is a conference on, which there was a few nights. We eat in Tradewinds the first night, nothing wrong with it but you can get better cheaper outside the hotel. There was a sign saying car parking was $12 a day, but we were told this was waived for Internaional Guests and sure enough it was. Being opposite Sea World was great since we could leave the car in the hotel and walk over in the evening to see the shows or get some tea. As far as eating out was concerned I was recommend Outback and Bahama Breeze for dinner, although they get very busy. In the morning we just had a quick breakfast in Perkins or just a Starbucks if we were really in a hurry.

Its easy to find from Orlando airport, just jump onto the 528 until exit 1, turn onto International Drive for half a mile and then turn right onto Sea Harbour Drive and a few hundred yards later there it was. All in all it was about a 15 mile drive and took about 20-25 minutes. Just a tip though have some dollars or quarters ready as there are 2 x 75 cent tolls on the way. Parking at the hotel is also ample and you can choose from valet parking or self parking Walking into the hotel and it is impressive. The renovations certainly look good, from the waterfall, to the sports bar, to the secluded areas in the atrium, to the sushi and main bar. In the evening it looks even better and after a trip around a theme park my wife and I always enjoyed a glass of wine, sitting down in one the many seating areas - the tall backed wicker chairs being the best - very comfortable and a great way to unwind and rest those weary feet. The pool was also great for unwinding. Its a great size with lots of space (watch out for the geckos) and we especially enjoyed the large and warm Jacuzzi. It never seemed to be overbusy either. The staff were also very helpful except for one or two exceptions, beware of one of the ladies in the gift shop! On our arrival we got upgraded to a room overlooking Seaworld so we could see the evening fireworks and the reception staff couldn't be more helpful. The Conceirge were also helpful though I don't think they were as knowledgeable as maybe they could have been but with so many guide books about it didn't really matter too much. I have stayed in quite of number of good hotels around the world and I don't think this quite was worth the 5 stars, more 4 if I was honest but maybe this is being picky. The cleaning of the rooms was ok and they were pretty clean but in comparison with other hotels I have stayed at such as the Bellagio in Vegas, the Marriott in Toronto and recently a hotel in Venice it did not quite match up. The room itself though was large, with big comfy beds and a good size bathroom with 2 sinks (though the baths could do with being a bit bigger). They have safes in them, along with an empty fridge to store your cold drinks and other non perishables and also an iron and a hairdryer. I think they may have to improve the transportation side as the connections provided to the Parks were a little hit and miss. Indeed one morning we turned up to get our connection with Mears and though we had been told to be there at 8.15am the driver had turned up 20 minutes earlier and then left putting us down as a no show. To be fair the lady in the Mears office did rectify this but even she admitted that the Mears / Taxi drivers did not always know what was happening and a couple of times we had to help the drivers ourselves. If you did not want to get these connections there were always taxis outside and we found these to be better, especially in the evenings (going to Downtown Disney, Universal Citywalk, meals out, etc). I also had the feeling that this hotel was more catered for the Business traveller rather than the holiday maker and during the week it did get overtaken slightly by some conferences but you're in Orlando and unlikely to stay around during the day too much and it didn't affect us at all though. From previous reviews I have seen some criticism of Tradewinds, their restaurant. Though we did not go there, there were quite a few positive recommendations to go there from other guests who had eaten there. We didn't eat there ourselves as there are so many other great places to eat in the area and in the mornings Starbucks in the Atrium was a godsend and I think we tried nearly every cake and danish they had. Location wise the hotel is very central. Seaworld is only 5 minutes away, Discovery Cove only around the corner (the hotel provides a free ride to this), Universal and Downtown Disney about 10-15 mintes drive away and the Magic Kingdom about 20-25 minutes away. I would recommend getting a hire car if you can for convenience sake but with the taxis, Mears and buses / trams its not essential. As for tips on what to do, everyone is different but we really enjoyed Orlando. We felt the Universal parks were the best (do the Hulk, Spiderman, MiB, Terminator and Shrek 4D especially). Get there early if posible and get the best rides done first and if you can get the fastpass in Universal. We reckon it saved us about 3-4 hours of waiting over 2 days. Citywalk is well worth an evening visit as is Downtown Disney (but book reservations at restaurants at these places if you can). Disney is Disney and always good fun and if do want to move away from the parks we really enjoyed ourselves at Kennedy Space Centre and then Cocoa Beach. The best time though was in Discovery Cove so book this if you can as it was great and a day to remember. Eating wise, there is so much! But a special mention must go to Charleys Steakhouse on i-Drive, fantastic food, House of Blues in Downtown Disney and the Hard Rock cafe in Citywalk. All in all Orlando was fantastic and the Renaissance a great, enjoyable and comfortable place to stay and explore it all from.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWhere to begin?!\u201d", "Author": "lou_pro85", "ReviewID": "UR8378315", "Content": "My boyfriend and I have just returned from our 21 night stay at the Renaissance Orlando resort and it was a huge disappointment. We spent a huge amount of money in booking this hotel as it was a supposed to be a 5*. I have always stayed at 3-4* hotels so obviously expected this to be of some improvement. Well unfortunately, it was a shocking 2* in my opinion. On arrival, the young ladt to check us in was friendly but we were given a room opposite the elevators which were very noisy. We requested to move to a room with a balcony, but they could not accommodate this request and so, we stayed in room 5001 for 2 weeks of our stay until they finally had a balcony room. The front staff were useless, they clearly chose to help guests in suits rather than the holiday makers which was frustrating when we were obviously struggling with shopping or our luggage. We had complimentary transport to the parks with our stay but this was a total joke. It was a company called Mears. The ticket office is located in the hotel and we had to book via them every time we wanted to go to disney. There was a young man called Sylvester who was very nice, but on other days, they had a dragon by the name of Barbara who was awful! No tact with guests, no knowledge of the parks, and extremely rude (we began having to dread booking out trips with her). When we actually booked out transportation, it was then a matter of Mears actually turning up and collecting us. on the first 5 days we were collected late on 3 of our trips. One of which was at magic kingdom, where we were left for 45minutes at 11.30pm. When discussed with the 'manager', they just said it had nothing to do with them and to speak to mears. Of course, when we spoke to mears, they advised us to speak to the hotel as they are providing the payment for our taxis! It was very much blame the other person in this hotel. We were often woken up at 12am, 1am, 2am by noisy guests which staff were not interested to hear about. My boyfriend and I do not regularly complain and we certainly wanted to avoid it on holiday but it was a matter of everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. I ordered a sandwich from the tradewinds restaurant and requested no tomato because I am extremely allergic, and of course, it came with tomato. No apologies at all from the staff. The food was expensive for what it was, and twice the bread tasted stale. (we only ate there twice!) Breakfast was $20 for 1 bacon, 1 sausage, 1 egg, orange juice and a coffee! Renovations are still happening which we weren't told of (see pictures). One evening we left our room at 10pm, and when we did, we found a squashed piece of pizza next to our door. On the way out of the hotel I asked for it to be removed. We returned to out room after 12am to find the same piece of pizza. Again, we complained (not what you expect from a 5*). When I opened the door at 7am to collect my paper I was not exactly happy to see the same smelly piece of pizza by the door. In the end I just removed it because it was disgusting. Things like this I would not expect to happen in any hotel, especially an expensive one. The feeling I got was that they have recently finished major renovations and not hired enough staff to return to full capacity. You saw plenty of staff by the front desk, but none cleaning on the 10 floors or anywhere being vacuumed or tidied. All staff were about 20. On the 1st evening we arrived I got mascara on my pillow and by the 10th day it was still there. I had asked for the pillow case to be changed on the 5th day as it was getting beyond a joke. On the 8th day I rang front desk and asked for it to be changed straight away. At this point, one of the front desk staff shouted down the phone that the sheets are changed every 3 days and that I was lying it had been there that long. As you can imagine, I was furious and on the 10th day, the pillow case was still dirty, so I had to complain to the manager before it was changed! All of this was running alongside our holiday which was really taking it's strain. I went on holiday to have a good time, not to have to chase up the hotel because they could not complete any simple task. I recommend that you do not stay at this place for over 2 nights as you begin to pick up on all the things they are incapable of. No staff became friendly with us, even after being their 21 days and speaking to some of them on a daily basis. There are loads of other things that occursed but I do not have time to list them all.

Over all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give the hotel a B-; the only way that I would go back is if we were just going to Sea World again, otherwise there are much nicer hotels in the area. Room Notes We found that room was a decent size and that the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room was lovely. It had a nice sofa and chair in sea green and royal blue tones that was pretty to look at and extremely hard to sit on. There is a refrigerator but it was only for non-perishable food (I know, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point??) The bed was relatively soft. The television was a LCD television with high definition channels (I never understand why hotels will put a high definition television in a room yet most of the channels are blurry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.). The bathroom was typical and the tub was small (or I my butt is getting fatter). The shower had nice water pressure and a nice shower head on it. We had a room with a door out to the lobby area which was nice in concept, but not in reality; it was nice to be able to look down at the lobby but it was pretty noisy with the door open. I give the room a B+. Restaurant Notes Mist is their version of a hip and modern booze and sushi bar in their lobby area that just opened two weeks ago. Nice atmosphere and giant LCD wall that played a fish tank dvd all the time. We went down there both nights that we were there and found the staff really nice and they made some of the best martinis that I have ever had. We had a really good time there both nights. We liked the waitress and the service she gave us. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give it a B. Boardwalk is a sports bar right next to Mist with a lot of cheap modern furniture and lots of LCD televisions. Again, I question why they put these two obviously new restaurant/bars so close together when there is so much space in the room that is bare. Oh well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Anyhoo, we also hit this place both nights because we liked the atmosphere and found the food to be good both nights, drinks were inconsistent and the service was always bad. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give this place a B- because the great grub was cancelled out by the crappy service. Tradewinds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c On the advice of our crappy waitress at the Boardwalk we decided to hit their breakfast buffet for $19 per person. Everything except for the service was okay; my hubby had an omelet and he thought it was delicious. I had the mini waffles and they were waffles. (How can you screw waffles up?) The bacon and sausages was typical buffet fare and some of the fruit was ripe and some of it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. They had some interesting things that I am not daring enough to try like hash browns with cheddar cheese, corn beef hash and cheese blintz. If I had a choice between this place and sitting in line at IHOP for an hour (which we did the second morning), I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be torn; I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind paying $20 per person for breakfast, but it has to be more than a C+. (BTW \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the IHOP breakfast was twice as good and cost half as much.) They had what appeared to be a nicer steak restaurant which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open while we were here so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on it. I was told that it would be opening in the next month or so. They also had a Starbucks that opened last week. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the gym and only walked through the pool area which seemed busy even later in the evening. They had carpeted tennis courts which I really wanted to try but just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the time to do so. Over all I thought that the hotel was pretty average in a city of some spectacular hotels.

From the start of our stay through to the day we left, the service was excellent and we could not fault it. We were checked in as soon as we stepped through the doors and offered a glass of champagne and asked which kind of room we would like - we picked one with a king size bed and a view over seaworld which was nice to see the fireworks every night! I asked if we had a fridge in the room and was told that we did not but that one would be sent up right away - one arrived within 10 minutes. The guest relations staff were helpful during our stay along with the guys outside the hotel who are always ready to get you a cab or welcome you back after a day at a park. The room was very big and modern and the bathroom was lovely. Our bedding and towels were changed daily. The pool was also nice, clean and had towels around it for you to use. The renovations were almost finished and starbucks opened on the last day of our stay, we never heard any work going on at all. The location is great - if you want to go somewhere to eat all you need to do is hop on the I-ride trolley, this stops RIGHT outside the hotel. If you don't want to wait for this you can get a cab - we got one a few times to the centre of international drive and it cost us about $10. A cab to the I-hop or Dennys around the corner for breakfast cost us about $5. Breakfast at the hotel was nice, if a little more expensive than going out but the buffet has a good choice. There is a mears desk at the hotel where you can book tickets and transfers. We had transfers included in our package with Virgin and that was invaluable - most days we had a taxi rather than a shuttle take us to the parks as it was only us going. If you have to pay for transfers it costs about $14 round trip per person to Disney. It took us about 5 minutes to walk across the car park to seaworld and we had a good view of it.

There are no restaurants / shopping in the immediate area - so if you do not have access to a vehicle - you should probably rethink booking this hotel. One major drawback is that they do not offer free shuttles to the attractions - as so many other hotels in the area do. Upon check in the girls at the front desk could not be nicer, they changed our room to one with a doorwall facing the atrium, when we asked about it. They offered my husband and I each a glass of champange, and gave each of our kids a stuffed Shamu toy. The queen beds were exceptionally comfortable. The room was very spacious with four chairs and a desk. We had a vaulted ceiling which really made it look big. We were surprised at the Plasma TV in the room. We liked the fact that there were two bathroom sinks - it made it much quicker to get a family of four out the door in the morning. The room faced the beautiful 10 story atrium.

I'll start with the good things; the swimming pool area is fantastic, and the bar next to it does good food at a reasonable price. The bedrooms are quite large with a brand new plasma tv and the beds are extremely comfy!! we had breakfast in the hotel nearly everyday, the buffet costs $19 dollars each but even though its expensive the choice of food is amazing! we had dinner twice at the hotel restaurant 'tradewinds' but both times it was horrible so wouldn't recommend eating there at night. The bad things about the hotel are; some of the staff at the check in desk are very rude and dont seem like they really want to be there but the staff in the restaurants and shop are very polite and helpful. The main disadvantage for the hotel is the location, eventhough its great for seaworld (just across the car park) for restaurants at night, there arent any! you have to get the i-tolley to get to the main part of international drive, and when you have been at a park all day we found we were too tired to have to wait for a bus to be able to get a meal, but we had to as there weren't any in walking distance and the hotel food at night tasted horrible!

From the moment we arrived I felt that all the staff were there to make sure my stay was enjoyable as possible. Check-in was effortless and I was told to address any further enquiries to guest services. Guest services couldn't do enough for you. I asked about i-ride trolley tickets and received complimentary ones for the first week of my stay. I asked lots of questions about where to eat, drink and enjoy myself and always received good advice. We were in two rooms on the 4th floor, the room allocated to my daughters was large, my wife and I were allocated a suite just down the corridor which was massive to say the least. Both rooms faced Seaworld and we enjoyed the firework display most evenings. The guys out the front of the hotel would do anything for you. If you wanted a cab they would whistle and one would appear from the car park. If you were using Mears transport to go to theme parks etc, they would make sure you got in the right shuttle bus! The only two negative comments I would make are that to eat and drink in the hotel was fairly expensive and wasn't really for a family budget. Also, if a function was taking place in the center of the hotel the noise echoed around the interior and could be heard in your hotel room. We love Seaworld, so staying across the road was a great advantage. Disney is about 15 mins from the hotel and Universal is about 10mins. A Lynx 50 bus stopped outside the hotel and went to the Disney transportation centre for $1.50 (75 pence!) if you didn't have transportation as part of your holiday package. The i-ride trolley stop was also just outside the hotel, the trollies can be quite crowded this time of year and dont always arrive every 20mins as advertised on the website!!

Since my husband was at work, I stayed by myself at the hotel all day. Since the lobby was undergoing construction, it was not a pleasant place to hang out. Also, the temperatures were extremely cold and I found myself shivering every time I left the room. For me, the workout room was the best part of the hotel. There were several cardio machines (treadmills, lifesteppers, recumbent bikes) with built in TVs -- just bring your headphones and you can access all the satellite TV channels as you work out. They also had extensive free weights and nautilus type machines so you could work out virtually every muscle. They had a separate mirrored room for stretching, complete with yoga mats and medicine balls. The exercise room was extremely clean and comfortable -- better than my gym at home. The pool was nice. There is an outdoor bar to order drinks (around $5-7) and sandwiches/salads (around $9-10). My only complaint about the pool is there are these really annoying small black insects all over the place. I don't know what they're called, but they're annoying like gnats, only bigger, and they travel in pairs, as if they are constantly mating.

The Atlantis and Tradewinds restaurants and bar are open as normal and at the moment they are just working on the bar right in the middle of the atrium. This building work is hidden behind in the lifts as you go in so we didn't even notice it apart from when we were walking along the hallways to get to our room. I did specifically request a room overlooking Seaworld and I have to say that if anybody is going here during the building works then this is a must. Some rooms look outwards onto Seaworld or the pool, while other rooms only look out into the atrium of the hotel. We didn't hear any of the work going on from our room but as soon as we stepped outside it was fairly loud. So you are well sheltered from it if you have a room looking outside, but I can imagine the rooms over the atrium could maybe be quite noisy.

The work was apparently due to be completed by end of march however when we were there there was still ajor works going on and when speaking to the hotel staff they were under the impression that the hotel wont be completed til at least june. The bar in middle is no where near finished either is the main entrance or the star bucks. Having said this the check in staff were very helpful in getting us a room away from noise and away from the elevators which are also meant to be noisy. The rooms were fantastic about 30 foot long with plasma tv, twin sinks etc. The work that was going on didnt really disturb our holiday much as we were always out doing parks and on our last day they opened the new Tradewinds restaurant which served buffet meals at $20 and was fantastic I wish it had opened earlier. This is aswell as the atlantis ad the palms restaurant. The pool area is nice and never very busy as full of business people. The free transport that you get if you travel with certain holiday companies is great most of the time they just send taxis for you. There were a couple of times they didnt show but if you just get a taxi and get a receipt they will refund you at hotel. The bus stop outside the hotel takes you everywhere for a dollar and is really useful.

On booking this holiday we were informed by the travel company that there was ongoing rennovations. On checking there website at booking it stated all work shall be finished 31st December. As we were arriving on the 27th December we felt that work would be almost completed. On arrival we were under no illusion that work would not be completed for a long time. I had read a ladies comment on Trip Advisor about this hotel in December and not to come here. I contacted the hotel who reassured me there was still ongoing work but it would cause minimal disruption and they booked us into a room on the 10th floor away from the minimal amount of noise made. On arrival to room 1057 the room was beautiful and we could see DisneyWorld from the room, all good. Then we discovered we were under the elevator motor which kept us awake most of the night. We requested to be moved which they could not do until New Year's day. With 2 adults and 2 small children moving was not a small task. We were moved to the 5th floor,(5007) the door did'nt seal properly and thus fore we could hear the noise from the lobby (Waterfall at night but not the end of the world). We didn't want to move again due to the hassle this would cause so we just got on with it. Then during the day the real noise began. There was jack hammering going on most of the day. You could not stay in your room during the day, the noise was UNBEARABLE!! There is no were to sit in the lobby and relax during the day so we spent our complete holiday whilst in the hotel in our room. This hotel that we booked in September was due to have work completed in December 31st and paid alot of money for as a 4Star hotel. When we spoke to Duty Manager Brenda Lasaari about constuction work beginning at 07.30 - 18.00 she very firmly told us that our tour operator knew about the work and it was there responsibilty to inform us. Fair enough, she looked up our package and told us we should not have been paying for parking so she wiped the parking bill. I went back to Brenda to try and get a contact number for our tour operator and she then asked why we had left it to the end of holiday to complain, I explained about the inconvience of moving rooms again with 2 children. She then informed me that I got a cheap holiday as the price was on the form I gave her. The holiday cost \u00c2\u00a34,000 I aked her if she considered $8,000 a cheap holiday and she said yes and that if thier hotel was up and running we would never have been able to stay for this price. She then gave us 2 days vouchers for breakfast. This experience really ruined my holiday and I am really dissappointed with the Marriott group. This hotel is running on a 14% occupancy and was the only hotel in Orlando with empty rooms over the Christmas, New Year period. There is a very good reason for this.

There is also a small shop where you can buy drinks... Mountain Dew!!! crisps newspapers etc. Also a shop(DeLI) that sold Starbucks, muffins and cakes. Hotel Room The room was recently re furbished,massive especially for just the two of us. We were on the 7th Floor over looking Seaworld!!! We had a KING size bed (really comfy!!!!) with lots of pillows!! A 38inc flat screen TV with the american channels on ABC, Disney, ESPN etc. We had a sofa bed, table and chairs and also an internet connection in the room. The bathroom was really big and so clean we had two sinks!!!! and a large bath with a shower. We got lots of shampoo and soaps each day aswell as clean towels. We also got a little free shamu in the bathroom which was really cute. Pool The pool was massive with lots of sunloungers and a pool side bar the drinks were a little expensive however u always find this if u eat and drink in the hotel. Transport We came to Florida with Airtours as a package deal included was transfers to and from all the Disney parks and Universal with Meers.There is a desk near the hotel reception where you arrange transport with them. We noticed it would have costed approx $50 dollars a day to go to disney in a cab so I would recommend either take the free transfers if it was included or just go in the car and pay $10 parking at disney. Universal would cost about $20 in a cab. Itrolley is a good cheap way getting around IDrive costs $1 adults, free for kids under 12 and 25 cent for over 60's. We were so happy we stayed at the calmer end of IDrive as the main part of IDrive gets so busy and you cant even cross the roads!!! You can get a Free 1 day pass for ITrolley at Guest Relationations in the hotel they will also give you the time tables for the trolley which runs about every 10 mins from 8.30 in the morning to 10.30pm. Trips We went to the Seaworld Makahiki Luau. We purchased and pre booked the tickets with Attraction Tickes Direct on the internet.The show itself was fantastic however the food wasnt up to much especially for me being veggie!! There was spicy pork and ribs, fried rice with chicken and mixed veg. As u can see it was a plate of veg for me!! The desert was penut butter cake again wasnt really what I liked. Soft drinks were free all nite Coke Sprite Dr pepper etc. Dolly Parton Dixie Stampeed was another show we did which was fab!!! The show celebrated Christmas there was pig racing ostrich racing ice skating, dancing and of course horses... it even snowed!!! The food the show everything was brilliant. For those meat eaters you get a whole chicken to eat with your hands!!! u also get veg soup which is really nice loads of veg and an apple pie for desert. Also drinks are free in the main show including wine and budlite!! The pre show you have to pay or drinnks which were pricey $4 dollars for soft drinnk so we only had the one.

Just got back from a fortnight at the Renaissance Orlando resort at Seaworld. Thought the place was just magnificent. We booked through Virgin Holidays and had requested a high level room. They gave us one on the 3rd floor! The lowest floor for guests. This is my one and only complaint. The hotel has around 700 rooms centred around a huge 14 storey double atrium. Rooms can have either an external view or atrium view. All atrium view rooms have bacolnies. We had an external view room, overlooking Seaworld. No balcony though. The rooms were huge. Apparently the largest in any Orlando hotel. We had two Queen size beds, 2 Armchairs with a coffee table and footrest, a desk and associated chair and the usual TV and cabinet etc. Rooms have safes, fridges, irons, coffee makers etc. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms were clean and kept clean by the house staff. Ground floor of the atrium has an atrium, a koi pond, a couple of bars and restaurants. There is a playroom with video games and a huge, clean pool with bar (and shade!). There are also a couple of tennis courts. We had free transportation to the parks via Mears. They had a desk in the lobby. ou just requested a time for pick up and waited outside the hotel. In the event that not too many are travelling from the hotel, rather than send a shuttle bus for you, they send a taxi instead. All included. Appox. 5 min. walk across the car park to Seaworld entrance. A bit longer to Discovery Cove though the hotel will take you anyway, free of charge. The Trolley, stop number 38 is right outside the hotel and day tickets for this are alos provided by the hotel. Breakfast buffet was huge, though compared ro Ponderosa ect, maybe a tad expensive at $12.00pp. We ordered room service one night and was informed it would be 20-25 minutes. After 40 minutes it hadn't arrived. So rang down and within 2 minutes it arrived, free of charge! As can probably be seen, thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and cannot fault it. Highly recommended.

I found the grounds were not kept up and that the tennis courts needed repair. While walking across the court to retrieve a ball for my son I slipped on a section of worn out astro-turf and fell and broke my ankle in two places.

At the business center I saw a hotel employee and I explained what happened and aksed for first aide. She said that they did not have first aide. I then saw FIVE additional employees NONE of which offered to help me. I walked/hopped from the business center to the elevator then to my room. I almost passed out from the pain. Once at my room I called the front desk and was told that all they could do was call security if I wanted. I didn't understand why I needed security so I asked about a hopital and location. My husband was not with me and when he returned he went to the front desk and they gave him a wheelchair with the foot rests broken off and direction to the hospital. I went to the hospital and found out that I had broken my ankle in two places. When I got back to the hotel I had a message from Security. I called and they sent a gentlemen to our room. He had no idea why he had been sent. I explained what happened and he took an accident report. He was the ONLY employee that showed any concern whatsoever. He was very polite. The rest of my trip was ruined because I could not leave the room. I couldn't go to the parks with my family nor leave my room. Only once did the hotel management call to ask if I needed anything. I missed the call because I was asleep. I called and asked if I could have a late checkout because it would take me longer to pack the day we were scheduled to leave and was told I could only have one extra hour!! Upon checking out the employees at the front desk were extremely impolite and at times rude. I never once complained about the dirty room, unkept grounds and tennis court, or the food prices. I then had to drive two days back home to Michigan. Now I'm home and have found that I have to undergo surgery to repair the damage. I received a phone call from a representative of the hotel and returned his call, he never called me back. Not very good customer service.

They do have a little cafe area though which serves toast, bagels, filled rolls etc which is very reasonably priced. My other complaint is that they have no guest coin laundry - although I do not use this much, it is useful to be able to wash jeans etc. They do have a laundry service but it is $8 to wash and dry a pair of jeans (you would be better buying a new pair!) On the whole, it was a lovely hotel, very clean and convenient for sea world (5 mins walking to main entrance). The hotel says it charges $7 for parking per day but we weren't charged either (like the other reviewer). I possibly would return and would recommend it to anyone if they get it at a good rate (as we did!)", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Titusville, FL", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed, but overall OK\u201d", "Author": "FloridaVisitor12", "ReviewID": "UR4165104", "Content": "I had a Atrium view/King bed reserved ($250 incl tax).

The third room was correct, but the heat was on full-blast and took about 3 hours to cool the room down. I went to the front desk and they gave me a $20 breakfast certificate. That was OK, but for $250 a night, I would have expected better service. The rooms were over-sized and the bathrooms had two sinks, but the bathroom floor looked like it had not been scrubbed EVER. The showerhead had much to be desired (once again for $250/night) it should have been supurb! The hotel lobby was beautiful and clean. The breakfast buffet was mediocore.

I switched as soon as I could because of the bad experience I had where I was staying. I only wish I had booked in here from the beginning. This property is deluxe all the way. From the time you pull in to the time you leave the staff do everything possible to help you. The property itself is huge, almost a square shape with the rooms on the perimeter and the restaurnts, shops and lobby under a glass covered atrium 10 stories high in the center of the square. Very breathtaking when you first walk in. The rooms are huge by normal hotel standards and very well appointed. The bathrooms are large and stocked with nice bath products. The fitness room is excellent with all kinds of free weights, machines and cardio equipment. The outdoor pool area is also very nice. Room service is prompt and the food at this hotel is some of the best hotel food I've had and trust me I've had plenty bad hotel food to know the difference. I also noticed that every staff member made it a point of saying hello to every guest when they passed them in the hallways, from the chamber maids to the managers. That's some good customer service training they must have there. I was sorry to leave and come home to the real world of laundry and bills but I know where to go now when I am back in Orlando again. With so many hotels on Orlando it's hard to know where to go but this one stands out head and shoulders above the rest.

I didn'f find the rooms any nicer than a Hampton Inn or Comfort Inn. The room was very clean & very well-taken care of, but I found it very cold, even with the air-conditioner off. What also disappointed me with this hotel was that they do not provide a shuttle service to Seaworld, which is only across the street, but is still quite a hike, especially after a long day at Seaworld when everyone is exhausted. If you're not looking for luxury, but just a nice, clean hotel to stay in, this is a good choice -- but for the money they charge plus $7.00/day for parking, a stay at a Hampton Inn would be just as nice for alot less money.

The swimming pool temperature was fine for cooling off and the grounds surrounding it were well maintained. I can confirm that this Hotel does also cater for the business market and there were many conferences being held during our two week stay. Personally, we had no problems with the business traveller and although parts of the atrium were cordoned off at times it was no big deal. We ate twice in the Tradewinds Restaurant and the food was excellent and good value. The drinks were slightly dearer than outside restaurants but realistically you expect that in a Hotel of this class. Having driven up and down International Drive many times during our two week holiday, the position of this Hotel was superb. It is away from the more touristy areas and my family felt extremely safe when parking the car in the car park late at night. In fact most nights when we were in the car park we saw a hotel security guard patrolling the area. On the issue of car parking, when we checked in on our arrival and the receptionist realised that we were staying for 14 nights he automatically waived the $7 dollar a day car parking fee.

The glass roof in the lobby leaks every time it rains, so you find yourself having to avoid buckets and bowls on the floor. The cost of 1 pint of Budweiser is $5.00 and the guys behind the Dolphin bar were extremely miserable. I suspected I was interupting their time watching tv every time I ordered. The hotel is very business orientated, every day I was there another conference was on- it seemed to be that the staff were too busy to bother with families on holiday. The pool was dirty (even saw a turtle one morning laying at the bottom). The toilets were nasty and needed an extreme cleanse. The room was outdated and the maid service was minimal.

If other parts of Orlando are your focus then this hotel will still serve you well although obviously you've got to drive to the attractions.

There's a small playground for kids, a pool for infants and then a wonderful pool for grownups. I believe the big pool is heated. I saw plenty of people using it during an unusually cold December spell (Brits or Canadians, perhaps!) and no one seemed to complain about the cold. Checkin and checkout were extraordinarily efficient. Maybe it was the holiday season but they were offering glasses of champagne or apple juice to people as they arrived. All in all a great experience at this hotel. Savvy travelers can book this place with complete confidence. And if you're planning a visit from Europe or the U.K. you'll be delighted with this place. One more benefit. They have a tours desk at the hotel where we got amazing deal on on Seaworld tickets. (We paid approximately $42.50 for a day ticket which was good afternoon noon and then allowed you to come back next day!) Only complaint was the relatively pricey restaurants which were fine but no bargain (unless you're visiting from Europe in which case it'll seem like a bargain. On the other hand if you're not happy there are plenty of other dining options a few minutes away. Enjoy this place and I look forward to seeing your comments as to whether you agree or disagree with my review.", "Date": "December 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "fort lauderdale, florida", "Title": "\u201cI LOVED IT!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2847863", "Content": "well, it was just a few weekends ago I went to the Renaissance Resort in Orlando. We were only going there becuase my Grandpa wanted us to go on a family trip and the hotel we registered for suddenly went for constuction and put us in a crappy room then we got there. We didnt go to that hotel. We registered at the Renissance. When we pulled up, they opened the doors, valleted the car, and took our luggage. I walked in and I was amazed. My chin dropped to my feet. As a 12 year old Ive never been to a resort like this. It had a spa,an indoor wirlpool, a hair salon, a resteraunt, bird flying around!!! IT WAS AMAZING!!! The rooms were perfect, the delivering of the food to the room was great, ive never been somewhere as beautiful like this!!! and i thank the employees there for making me happy.", "Date": "November 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "southport merseyside U.K.", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as I expected\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2833744", "Content": "My family (my husband myself two boys aged 9 & 13) and i have just returned from a stay from the 7th october till the 22nd october. I have to admit I was somwhat disappionted,the room was big with two queen sized beds the bathroom had two vanity sinks in it but one was cracked. The food is expensive and the hotel is not really children friendly, it is more suitable for buisiness people. The pool area was under refunishment but the pool was in use, it was freezing. In its day (The hotel is 20 years old the staff imformed me) this hotel would have been magnificant but at the moment every where looks tired and in need of updating, Im not a person to complain i have visited 4 star hotels in the U.K and i'm sorry but this is not of the same class. Most of the rooms look on to the lobbby not over looking sea world (unless you get a room on the tenth floor,this is where you get the free buffett breakfast). You may also get compementry coffee FREE OF CHARGE if you don't ask for ot believe me you wont get it. The staff in general are very nice but check you bills for service charges they should only charge on partys of 6 and over we got stung!!! but after an argument at reception was refunded the differance....", "Date": "November 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cYada, yada, yada...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2814110", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel in October. It was 'okay' at best. I, too, experienced the 'room dance' at this hotel...check in, up to the room, back to the desk for the room I'd 'reserved', bit of a tug-of-war, back up to the new room, only to again be disappointed, but too tired to argue anymore. Room service took an hour and a half to deliver a cold sandwich and a cold salad...an order that was placed at 9:30 at night. It was only after an inquiry call that it was finally delivered. To their credit, the food was of good quality and portions were nice. The front desk was snippy to say the least, and the self park charge irked me a bit. The lobby is indeed beautiful, but the rooms are just hotel rooms...certainly not worth better than $150-$160 a night even at peak times. The nicest thing I found about the rooms were the bath & body amenities. The location can't be beat if going to Sea World, but that would be my only draw--along with a great rate--to go back to this hotel.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Sunday Brunch\u201d", "Author": "Coire", "ReviewID": "UR2811833", "Content": "Stayed here in September 2003, we were getting married in Florida and booked this hotel for somewhere special to stay, we certainly were not dissapointed, gorgeous atrium and reception area.

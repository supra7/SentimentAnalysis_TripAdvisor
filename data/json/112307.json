That included great recommendations of places to spend the sunny afternoons and to watch said sun hide in the ocean in the evening. (And also plenty of recommendations of places to get into good food and mischief after the sun went down). The location is central and seemed safe, but slightly less unique than other more eclectic parts of the city. The hotel however more than made up for this in its charm. I really felt like I was their target demographic (30's, single, interested in a bargain food truck burrito, Michelin star ratings, a proper cocktail, or a relaxed pint with equal enthusiasm). The rooms have a (and I mean this in no way derogatory light) a lived in or almost slightly shabby comfort. More of the old familiar sweater than the latest trendy frock. It is not an inexpensive hotel, but priced competitively especially given its location. If I had a complaint - I'd take some more water pressure in the shower, but I am really stretching here if that is the best I can come up with. TA's high ranking of this hotel was totally accurate in this case - and often I find I do not always agree with the masses.

But...we may have stumbled into a bad weekend for not only Hotel Rex but San Francisco as well! The Oakland Bridge was closed down into the City for reconstruction, so the entire city was a bit off. THE GOOD: A perfect location near Union Square in a clean, fairly trendy area. Personelle that loves to take care of you and remembers yours and your dog's name. Pet friendly and with that said rooms are very clean and you would never know they allowed pets! Nicely decorated and good amenities such as an honors bar in the refrigerator that is nicely stocked AND you can use it for your own items without fearing charge like some hotels! Windows that open! Nice comfortable little bar with great wine free of charge in the evenings. Quick and efficient room service. Pet is free and they even provide a bowl of water and food dish. Large TV and lots of channels and even a IPod dock. THE BAD: We were in room 601 and there was a very loud clunking noise (sounded like the ceiling was falling in) constantly. Don't know if it was the toilet above us or what? It would wake us up from a sound sleep! Although the bed was very comfy, the pillows were overstuffed and we both woke up with a bit of a sore neck! THE UGLY: Where the Bridge caused a problem for the city...a broken pipe and fire alarm caused problems for the hotel. The trek to and from the 6th floor with a dog the first night of stay was no fun! That said, this was no ones fault and the staff tried very hard to compensate for the problems and it was very appreciated! They sent up wine so we didn't have to hike back and forth, didn't charge me for taking a Corona beer from the honors bar since the bar was closed due to the flood and gave us a coupon for a drink the following evening.

A lot of older hotels call themselves \"boutique\" when what it really means is old, musty, with a few second hand antiques to give them character. Hotel Rex is the real deal. The staff is top flight and very knowledgeable. Our room (sixth floor in the back) was quiet and neat as a pin. Some other reviews have commented on the room size. I've been in hotels with very large rooms that waste the space or provide cookie cutter decor. Our room at the Rex was of a good size, but even better, laid out in such a way as to make the best use of the space. My wife and I both had our own night tables and reading lamps, and the writing desk had lots of drawers. The decor is fun without being cutesy. The bathroom, while on the small size, as very clean and well-supplied. It was the kind of room you can enjoy being in because of its furnishings and layout. My only suggestion would be another shelf or two in the bathroom because of the limited counter space. And you can't beat the location--depending on your willingness to walk uphill (its always uphill in SF)! you're minutes from Union Square shopping, Chinatown, and Nob Hill. The only reason I didn't give it five stars...about 10:30 on Friday night the fire alarm went off. Nothing seemed amiss so I called the front desk--no answer. So we got dressed and trudged down six flights of stairs, join our other roommates on the sidewalk while the fire trucks rolled up. The alarm malfunctioned and the staff seemed to be a little befuddled on how to fix it. After a while, we walked back up the six flights because the single small elevator was way too backed up. And the next afternoon, it happened again! This time I called and they told me it was a malfunction, but for th next half hour we endured the alarm going on and off intermittently. After a long day walking, all we wanted was a little rest, but all we got was the fire alarm! Maybe the staff could use some extra training in the area.

Hotel Rex provides you with the usual amenities such as cable & a mini bar and we were encouraged by staff to use the mini bar for what ever we needed and to just remove any mini bar items we needed to. What set them apart for me was one particular night of my stay. I had to make arrangements for my girlfriend and my 7 year anniversary dinner. Both the bellman and the concierge helped me greatly going through a number of options for me as well as providing me a reservation at a fantastic nearby restaurant, Palominos.

This was not a bid, I was paying for the hotel upon check-out. In spite of confirming my reservation with the hotel, upon arrival, I discovered that instead of an executive king room, they had booked us in a room with two doubles. Since our class of room was unfortunately occupied, they offered to put us up in the executive suite for two nights if we'd be willing to stay in the double for one night. I thought this was fair and agreed especially since I did not know if this was their's or priceline's fault. The next day, upon preparing to move, we discovered that we were not getting the suite, but instead the room we should have originally had. The suite was and always had been booked. Needless to say I was annoyed. Now to be fair, the hotel did more than make up for the inconvenience by offering us complimentary parking for one night, breakfast for three, and a discount on the room. If this was the end of my experience, I probably would have given the hotel 4 stars. However, that evening, we asked the front desk the best way to get to Fishermans Wharf from where we were in Union Square. We were assured that a cab would be at least $20 and that the most economical way was the trolley line. 90 minutes later on the trolley to go 2-3 miles showed me the cab was probably the best bet. That evening the $9 cab ride we took in absolute gridlock showed me they had no idea what they were talking about. The next morning, the girl at our complimentary buffet breakfast forgot to keep checking the food and practically everything ran out. This for a buffet they charge I believe $15 or more for. The final straw was at checkout. We had a very early flight and at 4:30 in the morning, a friend of ours discovered she had been charged for the entire mini bar at $200. This was after the hotel offered to empty it so that she could use the fridge. Instead of resolving this quickly, the front desk needed to delete each and every item individually. Ugh! I will say, the hotel is very clean and pretty, and the location is great. Thankfully, we obtained a great rate, and they were accommodating with the room change.

Union Square on 2 minute walking distance were you can find Macy's and other stores. A bus stop a minute away, with line 2 and 3, who, by example, bring you to Japantown. BART and MUNI station 7 minutes away. You can walk to Chinatown in 10 minutes. We also used a bus stop that is 5 minutes away to get to the old Italian district in North Beach with great restaurants.

As a guest of the hotel you get a complimentary glass of wine everyday - Bikes! The hotel has 2 free bikes that you can use to cycle the hills of SF or go downhill to the Piers and then over the Golden Gate Bridge. Just make a reservation at the Front Desk a day before and (if available) you can ride them all day - On the website of the joie de vivre hotels you can find a 'Volunteer Greeter Program' section. A a guest of the hotel, you can book a complimentary walking tour with a local from San Francisco. It's not guaranteed and you have to book on-line in advance, but we did and we had a great 2 hours with someone who really knows the city - If you want to skip maintenance/housekeeping for a day, you will be rewarded with a 5$ gift card from the Hotel Bar. Great to try the City Fog Coffee. I can go on, talking but I think you'll get the point by now. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Because it's not a big hotel, the service is very personal. We loved the city, did all the tourist things, went a day out in the wine country, saw a baseball game, celebrated the 4th of july at the pears near the ferry building and even did a day trip to Yosemite Park with Extranomical Tours. There are a lot of good restaurants, and you can almost in eat in every language. Last thing: Don't stand in the lines at the cable car turnaround. That line is the biggest tourist trap of SF.

We dined elsewhere the rest of our stay but that was just because we wanted to try everything! The Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy's in Union Square is worth a mention for dinner and extravagant cheesecakes although we did wait an hour for our table (a good excuse for a look around Macy's). There isn't any breakfast included but there are great places to eat everywhere, a couple of doors down is Lori's Diner which is a novelty 50's style diner, entertaining for tourists and children (there is a car in the middle of the diner and lots of 50's memorabilia) I wasn't expecting a lot from the breakfast but i was pleasantly surprised! We had huge portions of pancakes with loads juicy strawberry's and whipped butter (A holiday treat!) and the men had streaky bacon, eggs, hash browns etc, worth a visit! We mainly used the hotel as a base for sightseeing - we were up fairly early and out seeing all the sights e.g Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, Golden Gate Bridge, Chinatown, Union Square, Coit Tower, Lombard St, Washington Sq Park and a little bit of window shopping in Tiffany's! The trams are also fun to take a ride on although there were huge queues everytime. The streets can be unbelievably steep but rewarding views are definitely worth it, esp from the top of coit tower ! The weather was warm but a really bitter wind everyday so a jacket with sunglasses was necessary!

We had my daughter and a friend of hers, both 12 years old, with us. We all enjoyed it very much. The hotel is funky and small, with a literary theme. There are quotes from famous authors on the stair landings and the bar/restaurant is called \"The Library\". We liked our room a lot, which is to be expected as we had one of the two suites the hotel offers. There was a good-sized living room with a foldout couch, a good-sized bedroom, and two bathrooms. The bed was comfy, with high quality sheets. The bathrooms were well-appointed as well. We had no problems with cleanliness but my wife's boss's room was full of dirty glasses and such when he checked in, so one cleanliness star deducted for that. We saw one other room that was not terribly small by San Francisco standards but a couple of the people there with us mentioned that their rooms were shoe-box sized. If you like a larger room, you might want to check on this when you make your reservations. The location is excellent - on Sutter just a block or so off of Union Square. It's pretty hard not to have fun in that neighborhood. There's a free glass of wine for each guest offered in The Library at 5:00 each day. Our first night there, they had a string quartet followed by a jazz singer to accompany the wine. This was really nice and we enjoyed both acts a lot. They offer light food and cocktails in The Library as well as the wine, and the bartender is good at what he does. If you stay here, don't miss out on this. Employees were all very friendly and willing to help with whatever we needed. One of the guys working the front desk had his dog there (a pug named Max) who delighted my daughter and her friend. (The life of a hotel lobby dog is one we can all aspire to in our future lives.) I don't know exactly what the company paid for these rooms, but my understanding is that they were quite a bit cheaper than The Four Seasons and such. If that's the case, then I'd say the Rex scores pretty high on the value side of things. Bottom line: This is a really great place for people who like hotels with character and individuality.

This is a very central spot and an ideal base to travel around San Francisco. The rex is a very friendly hotel. On first impression it seemed a bit glum - but it wasn't that was the 1920s style decor. Our room was large for american standards, the bathroom was also large, clean with a good shower and a good quality hair dryer. There are no tea making facilities in the rooms, but the hotel provides these during the morning free in the lounge area. The hotel also provided guests with a glass of wine every evening between 5 and 6 pm. Breakfast was not included in our price but we chose to eat breakfast in their restaurant every day (except 1) and we found them to be substantial. There are other places close by to eat though. I would definitely stay again oin this hotel So a bit about San Francisco. Union Square is a shoppers paradise with Macy's in the square. I recommend you visit the Cheesecake factory in Macy's. The restaurant is worth a visit for is decor - but the cheesecakes are huge and the cocktails we had were also very good. In one of the side streets just off Union Square there was a small diner called Maccos which served delicious food at lunch time and very good value for money. we ate there 4 times. it has tables and chairs in the streets and the street has gates on so just look for it - opposite the cafe in union square itself. Tour buses leave from Union Square and we used these to familiarise ourselves with San Francisco. Travbelling across Golden Gate bridge and every other area in the city. There were 4/5 different trips adnyou could get a reduced price for 48 hours - they gave us an extra day free. The cable trams are a must but these cost 5$ per journey. You can buy a daily ticket for 13$, a 3 day ticket for 20$ adn a 7 day ticket for 26$ - extremely good value. These tickets allow you to travel on the cable cars, buses, trams and muni (underground system). A trip to Alcatraz is a must and th etours are very good. You need to book these before you go as they do get full. There are other ferry trips and we went over to Angel island and also caught the ferry to Sausalito which was a lovely town - I think you can drive here. We were not impressed by Fisherman's Wharf although this is where the ferries depart. it was smelly and a bit like a Blackpools Golden mile. the fish restaurants were overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you received.

The hotel is situated 5 blocks up from the Powell Bart station, which makes it ideal to get to / from the airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am glad we took the BART instead of a Airport shuttle as it worked out a lot cheaper and was really no hassle at all. The walk from the station to Sutter Street was as I said only 5 blocks and not that steep an incline. Overall the hotel is really central to all the Union Square action, being only minutes walk from the BART, Metro, Cable Car and F-Line trolley as well as numerous good restaurants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I cannot recommend Fino (Italian) and Colibri (Mexican) enough, as well as Sears Fine Food for breakfast. The room itself was on the 4th floor and was furnished to a high standard, including a very handy IPod docking station as well as a good size flat screen TV. Size-wise, it was more than spacious enough to meet our needs, with good storage and plenty of floor space. The queen bed was super-comfortable and certainly got the thumbs up. The en-suite bathroom was again a good size for a hotel, with a bath / shower, and was kept well stocked with the requisite toiletries.

The wine was served in the atmospheric, low lit lobby bar, which was like walking back into an Agatha Christie novel. The bar also offered a happy hour, which I think ran from 5pm to 7pm. This was a great way to start the evening, and was full with tourists of all nationalities and locals alike. We had breakfast in the onsite Cafe Andr\u00c3\u00a9e on our final day which was great. The portion size was more than adequate to see us through lunch time as well, and I can thoroughly recommend the smoked salmon hash.

The service was impeccable throughout and nothing was too much trouble. The staff were very informative and also very proud of their City! We had breakfast once in Cafe Andree which was very nice although we ventured out during other days to enjoy what San Francisco had to offer! The free coffee in the morning and wine hour late afternoon is also a lovely touch and we really enjoyed this. The location is fantastic being just a couple of blocks from Union Square and the cable cars making it easy to get around. The only slight issue we had - and it was slight - is that occasionally the mini bar fridge can be a bit noisy during the night but this is nothing major. Overall, a great stay and start to our honeymoon and we will check out Joie de Vivre hotels if we are back in San Francisco again.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napa, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay in a Union Square\u201d", "Author": "ChefDo", "ReviewID": "UR62548979", "Content": "My wife and I went to the city for a quick get-away weekend.

So, if I have one advice to give to anyone wanting to go to San Francisco -- avoid having a rental for your entire stay. Finding a place to is a royal pain (and very costly)! The hotel itself was very nice. Old, but nice. It was clean, and though the towels weren't as fluffy as some would like it to be, we found it acceptable. Overall, the one thing that sticks in my memory three months later -- is the staff. The lady with the very difficult to pronounce name which I cannot recall [sorry!] and Jeff at the front desk were especially friendly and helpful. They gave us good advice and made recommendations; they answered all our questions, and made us feel like we were \"home\" during our stay with them. The maid that cleaned our room each day was also very accommodating. On the days that we left our room late in the day, she came back to clean our room later and replenished our supplies. (Most places -- if you missed the maids while they are on their cleaning schedule, you are out of luck.) Personally, I feel like my family and I could not have asked for more from a hotel.

We reached Hotel Rex after a nine hour drive and was welcomed by their friendly staff. We walked into our room and realized it was a bit warm but thought it could just be us and spotted the a/c switch so we thought to turn it on a bit later. As the night progressed it became unimaginably hot, I called the front desk and realized a/c is not available in that specific room. We were so exhausted we couldn't think to move to another room after we just finished unpacking. So we thought we'd request to be moved next morning. At 3am it was like a sauna in there and couldn't bear to sleep. It was ridiculous. We opened the window and that didn't help and didn't like the idea of sleeping with the window open anyways since the room was by the fire escape. At 3:30am we couldn't stand it and asked to be moved immediately. The front desk moved us right away to a room with a/c which shocked me and made me think why they gave us this horrible room in the first place if other rooms with a/c were available. We moved into the new room and realized it was significantly cooler, we didn't even need the a/c, and less noisy. The next morning I spoke to the manager about our problematic night. He was very understanding and friendly and immediately took responsibly for the room. I was very impressed and obviously we were compensated for that night. So we would say our experience was very positive after that first night. Our advice is DO NOT stay in the rooms by the fire escape. I noticed that there are other reviews on this site that has the same complaint, I wish I read those beforehand. I think it is not right for Hotel Rex to be letting these rooms out when they are unacceptable and when there are perfectly good rooms available.

The staff is the best anywhere, the hotel is comfortable, and the location is great. The rooms are fairly large for SF and the beds are comfortable, although I was told on this past trip that they're in the process of replacing them in some rooms. I will warn you that this hotel is nothing fancy, but if you're looking for a home away from home it would be hard to beat. You can check in or out in 5 minutes and not have to stand in line. This means you can stash you luggage and be out enjoying the city quicker. There is a wine reception in the bar area each evening which includes live music on Friday nights. Free coffee, tea, and newspapers in the morning, in the bar area. The business center is there, but tucked away and hard to find (it's labeled The Library). The restaurant, Cafe Andre', is actually very good and worth a try if you don't feel like going out. We ate there with friends this trip and the food was excellent. This hotel is about a block and a half from Union Square, two blocks down from Nob Hill, around the corner from Sears Fine Foods (fantastic!), and half a block from the Powell Street Cable Car line. So what's wrong with the place? Not much, but there are a few nit picky items. The wireless internet is slow which can make remote access not usable, but standard e-mail and web browsing is fine. This is an old building and we noticed on this visit that, at least in our room on the sixth floor, the floor under the dresser was not level (at the dresser door stayed closed). There are some areas of the hotel, mostly stairwells, that remind me of the unsettled nature of the ground in the bay area, but I've stayed there when there were minor quakes and never knew until someone told me about them later. Anyway, if you don't need to be pampered but are looking for a hotel in SF where the staff treats you like family, where you will actually meet and speak to other travelers (at the wine reception), and where you will begin to feel like a local, the Rex is the place.

From the decor to the furniture, Steinbeck et al quotations/ charicatures/wall art, paintings, color scheme, Society list pages in the elevators, library-club-like lobby to lemon and thyme scented toiletries and lemon/green/black room decor, all were well thought out. The hotel excited all of our senses. They asked guests to donate to support a literary charity, in keeping with their overall theme. Everything was wonderful--location, services, food, etc. Convenient to everything we wanted. Only the amount of time it took for the valet to retrieve our rental car from the remote lot (we paid a daily fee) was excessive and visitors should allow a little extra slack if they need their vehicles.

All the staff are friendly and happy to help and suggest things to do and see and places to eat.

Bathroom was ok - small and a bit basic but the shower was strong and the water hot, so no real complaints. The room was very quiet but I can see that something at the front might be noisier as Sutter Street is active pretty much all the time and there is a nightclub next door. Every evening they offer free wine (one glass) of excellent Californian wines and the lounge/bar gets pretty busy with interesting guests and locals. Bar food is also available and reasonably priced. The great attraction of this hotel is the location - only minutes from the shops in Union Square and a bit further to Market Street.

There were four of us and they insisted that we needed a 7 seater. Ignore the selling as the car we had booked was big enough for our family and possibly a couple more at a squeeze.

My husband and I traveled here for an anniversary gettaway. When we arrived at around noon of our first day, Renin (hope I am spelling that right) upgraded our Queen Deluxe room to a quieter and larger King room. The price was an awesome value, booked on the Trip Advisor website. We were immediately able to check in and did not have to wait for our room after our flight there. The room was very artfully decorated and very clean and comfortable. We were very glad to be able to use the mini fridge for our leftovers throughout our stay to save on food costs. The wine reception was lovely and the wine was excellent. Our housekeeper on the sixth floor did an amazing job cleaning our room, anything extra we needed she provided with a warm smile. Actually, all of the staff was super friendly including Max the pug dog, who was kind enough to pose with us for a photo. I think he handles the fame well ;-) I think one of the premier features of this hotel is the excellent location and proximity to so many great restaurants and to the Bart station.

We booked directly in the hotel website and got a very good rate (much better than those found in Expedia or Booking). The hotel is ideally located just 1 block from Union Square. That is great for your first or second visit to SF, but maybe too touristic if you're coming for business or if you want to avoid the tons of people that daily walk Sutter street. We stayed in room 213 or 214 (don't remember very well!), which was pretty large and comfortable. It had a king-size bed with a very nice flat big TV. The bathroom facilities were ok, a little smaller than the room. It seems they preferred to give this extra size to the bedroom instead of making the bathroom wider. I would have done the opposite! The hotel offered complimentary wifi Internet access which is something I really appreciated. I hate paying the ridiculous amount many hotels want to charge you for a few hours of Internet access. The quality was pretty good, and the speed good enough. Our room faced Sutter street, and it was just in the first floor. The window was not very good, so we had a lot of noise during the day and at night. For those who can't stand it, you'd better ask for a room facing the interior patio. Worse view but much quieter. We didn't ask for a room change. We got too late at night, and (fortunately), both of us sleep quite well , so we didn't care much. We didn't try either the breakfast, lunch or dinner. With that many options around the hotel, we thought it was a better idea not to do so. For those Starbucks lovers, you can find quite a few of them just a few meters from the hotel.

Right now in the off season, I am staying here for an incredible $104 a night in a room that will be $250+ a night this summer. The decor is beautiful and stylish, with bright South of France colors. Very cheerful. Staff is very friendly and helpful. My room is large (by downtown San Francisco standards). I'm staying here a month for work and leisure and spend a fair amount of time in the room working on my laptop. There is plenty of space for me to work without being cramped. There is a restaurant in the hotel that serves breakfast and dinner and also room service. Food is very good. And, there are many nearby inexpensive options in close walking distance. This is very comfortable for me for a long-term stay, as well as being the best price I could find.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMet all of our expectations/ and a few more\u201d", "Author": "dlpcanada", "ReviewID": "UR25896797", "Content": "Had a great time here-- nothing to specifically \"write home\" about, but it was in a great location, clean, friendly, safe and had internet and printers to print out your flight boarding passes.

We were disappointed with the size of the room and although the decor was styled 'boutique' found it to be dull and gloomy rather than vibrant and modern. (See photo of room). A friend who was also staying at the same time as us however found that the room size was fine for a single person. Decor wise the walls are a dull yellow with all paintwork green. In the bathroom the walls are custard yellow with green paintwork and lilac floor tiles. Windows and doors have been repainted numerous times and look like our own did before we got double glazing. Reception staff are very friendly and helpful but I don't know how they can see to do their work it is so dark where they are based. There is also a very old dog sometimes around Reception (does not mind a bit of attention), however he is allowed to sit on the chairs in the vicinity. The beds were comfortable with 3 pillows on each, lighting was dim as is usual for hotels but there were lights above the headboards of the beds. The wardrobe is very small, only one side for hanging clothes which also held the ironing board , 2 robes and the suitcase holder; all of which had to be removed to try and fit the clothes in. The other side of the wardrobe should have had three shelves but we only had one in ours. There was an old long unit which held the television, underneath was the fridge on one side and 3 drawers (which stuck) on the other. It was very cold when we were there (San Francisco in August is like the worst of an English summer ) - lots of tourists were wearing jackets with San Francisco on - like us they had probably thought California in August would be hot and sunny but the low cloud makes it COLD! It was even four days before we could see the whole of the Golden Gate bridge. It is really strange because you can see Sausolito which is quite close and it is lovely and sunny there. Anyway back to the room - the heating (yes we needed heating!) is very noisy (probably an old system) and I wouldn't be able to sleep through the rattling it was making. There was no safe in the room so we had to put valuables in a security box at Reception and keep asking for access whenever we needed it. There was no coffee maker. The bathroom was well lit and nice and bright;with a magnifying mirror and hairdrier . Shower head was fixed to wall and was a decent strength. There was a full length mirror on the back of the bedroom door. There was an extending washing line over the bath which we made use of - only drawback was it took 3 days to dry things. We did not have the free glass of wine as we were always out and about but it is a nice gesture and enjoyed by many I'm sure. Things we enjoyed while in San Francisco and would recommend: Alcatraz But trips are booked up well in advance so book at least a couple of weeks beforehand - longer if possible to get a good time. I would suggest going in the early afternoon as the low cloud seems to clear by then and you get the best views, but the cloud does come back in later in the day (around 5pm when we were there) Wine country tour Very enjoyable, not just because of the wine but also the tours are interesting and you get to spend some time in Sonoma where you have lunch. Sealions on pier 39 Great fun to watch them sleeping, swimming and shouting their heads off! Boat trip to Sausolito Also a lot of people had hired bicycles to ride over the Golden Gate Bridge and got the ferry back. Whilst in Sauslito we got the local bus to Muir Woods where the giant trees are worth seeing. Nightime: Duelling pianos downstairs at Foley's Bar in O'Farrell Street. Not recommended Open top bus tour - nearly had our heads blown off. The bus does not go slowly and as mentioned above SF is very cold. I looked around the bus as we went over the Golden Gate bridge and everyone had their heads down, eyes closed or were burying their heads into their companion's coat! I felt like I couldn't breathe properly as the wind was taking my breath away so covered my nose and mouth with my hands. AVIS car hire at Union Square Avoid this company/office like the plague - we waited THREE HOURS to collect a car we had booked )along with numerous other people who were in the same position). Interestingly the manager had preprinted $25 disount vouchers to hand out - we assume therefore this happens quite often. We had a long drive ahead of us and Avis complelely ruined one of our valuable days in California.

I kept imagining myself wrapped up in a old fashioned bath robe with a glass of cognac in one hand and my favorite book in the other. The rooms, which are also decorated with a similar theme, are small, but given the hotel's central location within the city close to the Union Square, the Financial District and Chinatown, it simply made the hotel seem all the more cozy. Keep in mind that the hotel is in downtown San Francisco, so parking is typically by valet. You can try to \"self park\" on the street, but take advantage of the valet which makes you feel like a VIP without the cost! There is a small restaurant within the hotel which has great food, however, there are about 1,000 other restaurants within walking distance to the hotel.

The Rex sent us to a nearby hotel -- about 15 minutes walk -- for the night, and paid for a taxi and breakfast the next morning. The substitute hotel - the Galleria Park - was fine. The next morning, we walked back to the Rex and checked in. For the first two nights we were in a very comfortable, quiet room at the back of the hotel, but with a Queen bed. For the last three nights we switched to a bigger room with a King bed, but it was noisier. In both cases, the rooms were comfortable and well maintained. The bathrooms were generous, and each room had a CD player, which was a nice touch.

When I first checked in I was very optimistic. I was willing to overlook the fact that my shower didn't drain properly or the fact that the bedding was a major step below the major hotels because I like to stay at boutique hotels when possible. I stayed at Hotel Rex for 3 nights on business. When I returned to the hotel on my third night, at approximately 11:00PM, my key didn't work. I went down to the front desk only to find out that they had MOVED MY BAGS AND ALL OF MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS TO A DIFFERENT ROOM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION! Needless to say I was extremely upset. The manager proceeded to tell me that the room I was in was booked for a wedding party and they had no choice but to move me to another room. They claim they made several attempts to contact me however I never received a phone call, one e-mail was sent however I didn't receive it! Regardless, I am still furious over this! Never before in my 20+ years of travel have I been treated this way. They offered to comp my 3rd night, nice gesture hey! I urged the manager to comp my entire stay or I was going to fight this with AMEX to no avail, they were so pompus that they in fact billed me for my first two nights... Business travelers beware!

Everything felt fresh and new and I thought that the color scheme was really fun!! The bed was extremely comfortable, and I'm rather picky about these things. The main reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 is because there was no Continental breakfast included (although the hotel went out of its way to compensate for the fact that its restaurant was not open on Christmas Day). I never would have thought a thing like this would have mattered so much, but all the nearby restaurants, especially that of the hotel, were REALLY expensive and that really made a big impact on our budgeting.

The literary theme was fun, manifested in quotes by famous writers just outside of the elevator entrances on each floor. My room was spacious, modern and quiet. The restaurant the next morning was excellent, as was the service. I was headed north that morning to Petaluma, and south the next morning to Palo Alto, so the location was perfect.

Check in was easy and having a car booked for the airport when checking out was great. The room was cleaned efficiently. The best part of this hotel is the location. It is central to the shopping district and very close to cable car, trolleys, bus and subway transportation. If you go to San Francisco, this is a great area in which to stay. There is some improvement needed. The hallways and public areas look a bit worn and shabby. I visited the Hyatt where I could have booked a room for just a few dollars more and was impressed with the cleanliness and the overall condition of the public areas there. The elevator is very small and slow. The two of us could barely fit our bags and ourselves on board. The room itself was very tiny. There were no drawers to store clothes in, although there was a wardrobe. However, there was not floor space to store bags, so the only place to put them was in the wardrobe, which then limited the space to store clothes. The bedspread in the room had cigarette burns in it, although I thought the room was non-smoking. After cleaning the bathroom one day, the room attendant left a dirty cleaning rag (looked like an old, ripped up bath towel) in the middle of the floor. We were on a room toward the back, so didn't get street noise, but had one tiny window which looked out over HVAC units and the grafitti on the building next door. Finally, there was a gift basket addressed to someone else in the room when we checked in. I took it to the front desk and the clerk said \"Oh, that's where that went!\".

A choice I am happy with, only a couple of service oriented issues arose during our stay. As other reviewers mention, the decor and ambiance of the hotel is great, the 1920's theme is very well done, and consistent throughout the hotel. The room we booked (through priceline) was, yes, small, but not uncomfortable small. BUT... there was no air conditioning, I was not aware that all of the rooms in the hotel did not have air conditioning. The person who assisted us with our luggage said that it gets rather cool in the evening so we should be okay. Upon entering the room, it was very stuffy, we were able to open the window and a small fan was in the room, however this did not offer much relief. The room was in the back of the hotel, and no breeze or air flow came through the window, even though the temperature in the evening was cooler outside. Besides the temperature issues, the room was very nice and clean. I did not hear a sound from any of the other rooms at any point during our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, with one exception. We had a rental car which I chose to valet ($35 per day w/ unlimited in/out privledges), slightly expensive but worth not having to deal with parking, etc. Here begins my 2nd and final \"complaint\"; The day we checked out we had to leave rather early, around 5:30am, I called the night before to inquire about the process to get my car that early. The person working at the front desk was definitely not friendly off-the-bat, and said that the valet is not available that early, and I would have to retrieve my car myself, gave the impression that there were no alternatives. Ok, I understand I'm leaving earlier than the average guest, however, from a customer service standpoint this person did not offer any alternatives. Perhaps they retrieve my car that evening and park on the street in front of the hotel, I'm sure I cannot be the first guest to have this special request. In any case, I thought this was a poor representation of the hotel, and again I'm paying for a valet service. The morning of check-out, the person working the desk was very nice, I mentioned having to get my car, and she asked if I made arragements the prior evening, I explained what happened and she did apologize and said they should have moved my car and had it ready for me this morning. I did appreciate the apology, but I still had to retrieve my car myself (a block away, uphill). Upon my return to load the car, the front desk person came outside to tell us that she put on a fresh pot of coffee if we'd like to grab a cup for the road. I thought that was a nice gesture to end our visit on an up note. Overall, I would definitely stay here again (requesting a room with A/C), not a bad experience by any means, just a couple little annoyances which can be avoided in the future.

At first we thought the room wasn't too bad, a bit tired and shabby but the staff seemed friendly enough and the location wasn't bad.

We've stayed in a few hotels with terrible air-con over the years so pretty much just accepted that this must just be another. However on our second night we got back to the hotel - this was a typically cold San Francisco summer night. We walk into the hotel and the place is like an over, when we get back to thye room it's even worse. A pretty uncomfortable night followed and I then went to reception to complain about the heat and the air-con not working. The reply? 'Oh your room doesn't have air-con'. It turns out the controls we'd been playing with were for the heater! This staggers me so I ask why not and I'm told that there's one room on every floor with no air-con so they gave it to us! As we paid up front with Expedia this just smacked of getting rid of the worst room to someone who's already paid. So we got moved and now had air-con but an absolutely tiny room. Funny thing is on our last night we came back to the room at night and suddenly the temperature was fine so they'd obviously had trouble with the heating too. It seems plenty of people have stayed here and had a great time and that's fine - but we didn't and our experience is all we know!

Hotel Rex is in a GREAT location for exploring downtown San Francisco.

Chinatown is well within walking distance, though, and this is coming from a gal who isn't fond of walking too much. Anyway, Hotel Rex is a very quaint hotel. It smells a little musty, but if you can deal with it, the decor and atmosphere is cool. The rooms are very small. The \"queen suite\" that we booked was really tiny due to the big furniture. The hotel does offer a free glass of wine from 5-6pm in the bar, but they DO NOT budge on the 6pm deadline. We arrived at 6:15pm, and they wouldn't even throw us a bone. I was kind of disappointed about that. All in all, I liked the Hotel Rex. Wouldn't book it for full price, though.

Just to help you with our opinion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are a 33-34 year old married couple from the bay area. Location: The place is very good walking distance from Union Square. We took a $6 cab ride to North Beach from the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is definitely not bad at all. The only downfall is that Union Square is full of homeless people. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be shocked if you get approached by 6 panhandlers every time you set foot outside the hotel. This is not a downfall of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location, but the location in general. Price: Very, very good. We had a rate of $132 per night and it was worth EVERY penny. We were able to check in early. Upon check in we were greeted VERY VERY nicely in comparison to other high-end hotels in the area. We were also upgraded to a king bed suite room. Very nice on their part. Also included is a 5pm happy hour free glass of wine at the hotel bar. Very nice. We met a nice couple in the bar. Comments on the hotel: The d\u00c3\u00a9cor has a French flavor. The bar area is filled with a comfortable ambiance and has gorgeous paintings and well-known novels aligned in the front of the bar entrance. The elevator is very slow and small and needs to be updated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but as I say this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it might take away from the hotel and its antiqueness. The room was VERY clean and spacious. Love the simple touches (CD alarm radio with a couple of CDs next to it and the Aveda bath products). Note to light sleepers: The bathroom toilet flushes pretty loud and you can hear the adjacent bathroom users flush their toilets at night. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear people and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the walls are thin enough to hear conversations or any love sessions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the plumbing.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cHotel Rex is \"king\"!\u201d", "Author": "Marrat", "ReviewID": "UR7253464", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed at Hotel Rex on a recent visit to San Francisco.

We checked in and whilst the room itself was quite nice, the bathroom was really very basic and a little bit grotty - the sink was cracked, the bath looked very old....so I went to reception and told them I didn't really expect to find a cracked sink and did they have another room. We were shown another room, and although the sink was newer, it was all just a little too basic - the sort of thing I might expect to find in a youth hostel but not in a hotel charging decent prices. I told the hotel I wasn't happy and they tried to find us alternative accommodation in a sister hotel but the rooms in those hotels were tiny, so we checked out and went to stay at the JW Marriott round the corner, which was streaks nicer, for about $20 more a night.

I've stayed in other hotels and B&Bs in this city. Yet, despite the lack of a couple things, I put this one in the top 5% for so many reason. I will absolutely stay here again. My daughter and I went San Fran to visit The Academy of Art University in January. Not normally a good time of year in SF, but we lucked out and had warm, sunny weather, while yet another snow storm raged in Colorado and other parts of the US. The Art Academy has a relationship with The York Hotel just a few blocks away. However, we wanted to be just a little closer to the shopping and the Academy, and the York's twin beds just didn't really fit our needs. We also didn't want to share a bed. The Rex offers 2 dbl beds in a room, which was perfect for us. Excellent location in the Union Sq area. Beautifully decorated, very comfortable beds, lots of power outles in good locations, clean (tho the carpet looked a bit worn, but not too badly). Wonderful, intimate restaurant where we were able to have a late night dinner our 1st night there. Good thing too as we checked in late and were dead tired. There's A/C in the rooms if you need it, which we didn't of course. The control for the heater was a bit hard to locate, but actually, I didn't even know it was in the room until the 2nd day. I just happen to notice it by accident. Good thing I did too as the room was chilly at night. All rooms have FREE WiFi, a well stocked mini fridge, gourmet snacks (expensive, but handy if you don't feel up to going out), and excellent cell phone reception. The bathroom was a bit small, but well appointed. The water pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water, even at 8 am. Our room was on one side of the hotel with not a very nice view, but to be honest, I didn't care. It was quiet. I'd rather have little view and a peaceful room as I'm a light sleeper. The elevator was small and slow, as I'd read in other reviews, but it's an old hotel so I didn't mind. It's part of the charm when you are staying in historic style places. There was a note about it being replaced very soon anyway. When I was tired of waiting, I just walked up or down the stairs and stopped to check out each floor if I needed a rest. Best of all were the very friendly and helpful staff. I really appreciated all the help they gave me. They were warm, friendly, knowledgable and professionable too. I chose this hotel based on location, on reviews I had seen here, on their website and 2 other review sites, for the Friday evening Jazz performance. However, our plane was delayed, so we were unable to attend the entertainment. Funny thing was I discovered several of the employees attend the Art Academy. We talked extensively with the female bartender who was one student we met. Everyone was exceptional, even the housekeepers (of course tipping well helps too). Bravo! The only things I could complain about are the lack of a swim pool and hot tub, which would be nice to soak in after a long day walking, site seeing, shopping, beach going, etc. Also, the restaurant was closed for remodeling on the weekend, but there was a small continental breakfast put out for the guests. However, the food went quickly. And anyway, there are pleanty of good restaurants to go out to very nearby for any sort of meal you might want. So, who cares? I especially liked the intimate bar-library- lounge area. Very homey and comfortable. Free glass of wine each evening for adults and juice or soda for the kids too. Might be nice to see a little snack for children, such as cookies, or cheese, crackers and fruit. Good selection of top shelf liquors. I might suggest they have out a few games perhaps to keep people entertained and staying in the bar to drink and order more snacks, especially children. Plenty of books to borrow tho in there. And be sure to check out the drawings on the walls. One last thing... This hotel is about a half block away from the Powell St. Trolley. I suggest you get a multi-day Muni pass and take full advantage of riding the trolleys and buses as walking up and down hills get difficult when loaded down with luggage and shopping bags. You can buy them at the airport, train and bus stations and a few other locations. Well worth it if you are in town for a few days. Beats paying $5 per ride on the trolleys. Also beats driving, paying very high gas prices, and paying high rates for parking. The Hotel Rex is part of a small group of boutiques hotels. Check out their website: http://www.jdvhospitality.com/hotels/hotel/13 . I have yet to stay in the others, but am thinking of trying another for my next trip out there in June.

First, the negatives. You'll be a little disappointed by your first impression of the Rex because it's being kind to say that the exterior is nothing to write home about. The seven-story hotel has a single tiny, slow elevator. Be prepared to use the stairs. Next, our room had two full-size beds and we added a rollaway - add our four suitcases to it and it became arguably the most crowded hotel room I've ever stayed in. Water pressure in the shower - my personal pet peeve - was spotty. At times the water slowed to a trickle before starting back up. Now the positives. The lobby is elegant and I can't say enough about the helpfulness of the staff to provide both information and advice. The front desk found us a doctor who paid us a house call to attend to my sick son at 9:00 p.m. (just don't ask how much he charged). Extra towels were delivered almost before I hung up the phone. The room itself, while small, was top shelf. Furniture and finishings were gorgeous. The bathroom was large and fully renovated with up-to-date fixtures. The room air conditioner was relatively quiet and the thermostat actually worked, giving it a leg up on many hotels. There are some reviews on this forum that complain about the street noise, but our room faced west and it was as quiet as a tomb at night. I also really appreciate that there wasn't a bellman constantly holding out his hand for tips. The help was always available, but it was unobtrusive. For tourists, it's hard to go wrong with any hotel in the Union Square area.

If you're looking for new or spacious, this is not the right place. It's also probably not the best place to take small children.

The location also means that daylight is at a premium in the hotel and the general lack of direct light was amplified by some very earthy coloured decor (presumably because of the style being sought). This is particularly pronounced on the stairs. There is no natural light and the artificial light is not overly bright, yet they have laid brown striped carpet which makes it very difficult to see the edge of the stair tread. With the elevator problem making recourse to the stairs for descent (even at four floors up) a more frequent then usual occurrence, particular care had to be taken. The room, whilst generously proportioned and quiet, also lacked daylight and was not brightly lit artificially. It was a bit depressing. The bathroom/ shower was good for such an old building. The lack of coffee/ tea making facilities was not helpful particularly since the bar served dreadful coffee (we didn't dare ask about tea).

Don't let the name fool you, this is no \"dog\" of a hotel. Rex is actually short for Kenneth Rexroth, a famous poet and author; which not coincidentially, impressionistic art and the literary arts are the themes around this charming French Boutique hotel. The wine reception in the lounge every evening is a great way to relax and gear up for dinner and an evening on the town. Cafe Andree, (named after Rexroth's wife, Andree Dutcher) in the hotel serves excellent food. The business center, which is more like a private study, is a plus for travelers wishing to stay in touch but not wanting to drag a laptop around with them. The hotel was clean and housekeeping was excellent. However the staff played the best part of our trip. The staff not only answered any questions, but offered concierge services in prediction of when we would need them. I have stayed in four and five star hotels that could have their staff take a lesson from the staff at the Rex. I really hope that this trend continues with their staff (according to other reviews I have read on the Rex, I think this is expected to continue).

I immediately called the hotel with my confirmation number, and they confirmed that we were booked for two rooms, each with one queen bed. Upon arrival at the room, the other couple in our party had no trouble checking in - getting a nice roome on the 7th floor with a queen bed. But when we tried to check in to the other room, they could find no record of our reservation - which, of course, should have been impossible given that I bid for both rooms at one time. When I tried to explain as much, the desk clerk actually told me to calm down. I have to figure that he's not long for this line of work when his first reaction to a screw-up by the hotel is to tell the customer to calm down. Once they managed to determine that we actually did have a reservation, they stuck us in tiny room on the second floor with one double bed. It was conveniently located just TWO steps from both the stairs and the elevator, so we could hear everyone coming and going. The single-pane glass in the windows also allowed us to hear everything that was going on in the street below, and the second floor location put is right at eye level with the street lights, so that it was nice and bright in our room all night long. Morals of the story - hope that you don't \"win\" this hotel through priceline - calling ahead to confirm your reservation doesn't actually mean that your reservation will exist when you get there. - If they do lose your reservation, you're not allowed to have any reaction to the situation. - don't book this hotel at all for more than one person if you are not fine with the idea of ending up with a double bed. - If you do end up in this hotel anyway, try to pursuede the desk clerk to put you on a high floor, as I'm sure this would help immensly with the noise and light from the street.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinehurst, NC", "Title": "\u201cRex was best!!!\u201d", "Author": "mf7lakes", "ReviewID": "UR4017492", "Content": "Hotel Rex -- 562 Sutter St. -- downtown SFO For a small hotel in a \"hotbed\" of hotels in San Francisco, I was never treated better than at the Hotel Rex.

We had forgotten toothpaste and there was none at the front desk - oh well - a knock on our door came shortly after and there stood the hotel night manager who had brought us his own toothpaste! We were hooked! Since then, remodeling complete, the Rex has turned into our cosmopolitan home-away-from-home- we have stayed there 10+ times. The restaurant is fabulous, the menu is smallish, but the food is impeccable; the bar and downstairs lounge perfect for relaxing and entertaining clients; the staff has had very little turnover and they remember us by name and treat us like family.

We booked a room through the Hotel Rex website, and managed to get a deluxe queen for 119.00/night with a choice of free breakfast or parking. Since we rarely eat breakfast, and most hotels in the area charge at least 35-40/day for parking, we opted for the latter. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. They were happy to check us in a few hours early (we were exhausted from a very early morning flight from DC), and seemed like a jolly bunch. The room was on the small side (typical in city hotels), but perfectly adequate, with a wardrobe/closet, desk, minibar, chair, and very comfortable queen-sized bed. (Great cotton bedding, too.) Though it wasn't really hot enough for A/C, we'd just left a heat wave in DC and were in the mood to be COLD, and the room's window unit did the trick. (I don't usually care much for window A/C units, but this one was new and worked really well without being too loud.) The room's decor was charming; interesting art in the room and bathroom, unusual lamps, and a just a wonderful uniqueness to the place. Very appealing and cozy. The bathroom was older, but perfectly functional and spacious. Nice thick towels and Aveda tolietries are a welcome touch. The room was extremely quiet--we never heard any other guests, though the place was fully booked--and every staff member we dealt with, from the check-in staff to the bartender to the maid, was friendly. There's a very cute little bar called the Vicious Circle (the hotel has a literary theme) downstairs, and guests are invited to have a free glass of wine between 5 and 6 each night. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but the menu looked interesting and affordable, and the place seemed to be doing a very good business. We would definitely stay there again. The location is excellent and the room was great. It's a charming place. (The Theatre Too cafe across the street has great morning coffee and cheap internet access, and we had a delicious lunch at the Cafe Persimmon next door to the Rex.

A trip like this can be overwhelming and exhausting and sensory overload. What Hotel Rex did for me, was gave me a place with character, charm, comfort and familiarity. I explored the city with every opportunity, and I recharged my soul in the comfort of my wonderful room. I found the decor to be just perfect for the image of the hotel and a great reflection of the city. Hotel Rex has assembled a group of people who love their jobs and do it well. My favorite time is the am, and I loved my delicious breakfast which I had daily in my room as I prepared for yet another \"new\" day.

All major downtown sights are an easy walk. Also, the Bart trains are not far; if you don't mind walking 4 blocks and don't have a ton of luggage, I recommend using Bart to get to the Rex from the airport. Atmosphere - Polished and serene, with a european feel minus any \"attitude.\" My small, immaculate room on the second floor was completely silent - absolutely no view, but I really didn't care becase the decor was lovely and fun. Nice size bathroom too. Somehow, I lucked out and had a window air conditioner, but I am not sure if all rooms have this. Service - Front desk staff are attentive and hardworking. Cafe Andree has great food at surprisingly low prices. Even room service was inexpensive. The business center is convenient (no charge), and my room was promptly cleaned every day. Price - At $175 per night booked on the Rex website, I received a voucher for a full breakfast each morning and tickets to the Asian Art Museum. Well worth it, no regrets.

The rooms at the Rex have a lot of character, not \"cookie-cutter\", or corporate looking. Housekeeping was great. Everything was spotless. There is a business center off the lobby with 2 computers and a printer. Concierge was excellent. We had called to have him arrange for our transportation to Oakland Airport (a 20-30 minute ride on a Sat morning). We had planned to hire a well-known shuttle service in the area. The concierge told us that the shuttle service we had chosen had a reputation for not showing up and suggested an alternative service that was actually less expensive and more dependable. By the way, Oakland Airport is a great alternative to SF Airport. The Rex will give an additional discount if you find a lower rate than what they offer on their website. We found a lower rate on hotels and they honored the agreement ($114/night!!), no problem. Cons: Just 2 very minor complaints, but just in case anyone cares....it's an old building so the rooms are small, but there is plenty of room for 2 people.

I researched a LOT of establishments, and picked this one because of the stunning location and appearance. It looks to be one of the most fantastic choices within ready driving distance of me. I called this morning to make the reservation, because and I told the clerk that I was 1) taking my first vacation in a while, 2) celebrating a \"big\" birthday, and 3) looking for something \"special\". I asked her what she could recommend for me. This would have been a fantastic opportunity for her to ask about my interests, preferences, etc, and recommend (or customize) a special experience for me. Instead, she merely rattled off a list of facts about the property and then gave me a rate for a standard room. I asked if there were any rooms with a special view, etc, and ultimately selected a Lakefront King for something like $230/night. This wasn't too worrisome, but I went online when I had a moment, and started looking around at the property/amenities. Turns out, the hotel offers several packages that would have made my stay MUCH more special, including one with champagne, strawberries, a $50.00 food credit, valet parking, etc.... and this package went for only $250.00! The reservationist should absolutely have \"upsold\" me on this package. I called back to request an immediate change, and the same reservationist accommodated me. While I was speaking with her, I nicely stated that a \"special\" package was EXACTLY what I was seeking, and asked her if there were any other packages that I should be aware of. I was also interested in staying another night, potentially, if I could be accommodated in the room type I was seeking. Again, she didn't ask me what was important to me, didn't try to devise something that would interest me, and merely said that if I were wanting something special, then she would make the change to the room package reservation. Is it weird that I am already disappointed that the reservationist had the opportunity to \"sell\" me and excite me about something, and she passed it by twice? Am I to expect the same disinterested, lackluster action from the rest of the staff when I arrive? I'm spending good money for a few days away, and was planning to spend even more on spa services... I hope I am not disappointed.

As most posts here state it is a very nice property. We found the staff to be universally professional, friendly and helpful. The \"extras\" like \"The Sweet Shoppe\" is a plus, indoor and outdoor pools very nice, our room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. We kayaked and rented a pontoon boat for a couple of hours to motor around the lake - very nice marina with great staff (thanks Andrew we enjoyed talking with you and your expertise with the pontoon boat). A few things I found disappointing for such a highly rated hotel were: 1) very lame coffee service in the room and no free coffee in the lobby area. We are happy to brew our own in the room but only a one-cup coffee maker with the pre-measured single cup packets were available - ugh; 2) our room - which overlooked the pool - was on the south side of the building above the VERY loud HVAC power \"plant\". The noise never stopped and it was impossible for us to have our sliders open because of the incessant noise. Ask for a room on the north side of the building to avoid this; 3) while I know this is billed as a high end hotel and spa, I found the spa prices to be absolutely appalling. I live in the Chicago area and have frequented high end spas here and have never paid the prices quoted at this Spa ($95 for a 50 min. massage PLUS a mandatory 20% service fee???? Really??? Why not just say the massage is $115?) I was not inclined to pay those prices so I did not use the spa although I had been looking forward to doing so during our stay; 4) This may be a very small issue but the pool side menu and the \"Yesterday's\" deli menus need to offer more vegetarian options - there are hardly any at all making grabbing a bite to eat at or near the pool difficult for a non meat eater; 5) I appreciated that Chateau has a fitness center but it is outdated. Neither the treadmills nor the cross trainers have individual TV screens and the treadmills have very few updated features I have found at most hotels - even places like Holiday Inn Express. All in all I DO recommend Chateau. Aside from a few small annoyances it was a great stay and we would stay here again. We enjoyed all the outdoor activities available either on the property or close by. BTW, Katherine at the concierge desk was very, very helpful, professional and friendly.

The Boat House on the marina had some good quality Table Rock lake apparel if you want to pick up a t-shirt. 3. Service was good. We had no complaints and there were plenty of people around to help you. Cons: 1. Beds were uncomfortable, even my 10 year old complained. The pillows were hard and lumpy. This is Hugely important to get a good nights sleep, especially b/ c this was a work-related trip. 2. Be ware of the balconies if you have one. Two of my co-workers were locked out of their room when they stepped out to see the view. One of the co- workers two daughters were stuck out on the balcony for 4 hours. The door lock sticks when you shut it so beware. 3. Tap water was terrible- Complimentary bottles of water would have been nice, especially not having a mini fridge. 4. No exhaust fan in bathroom.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hopedale, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cElegance in Branson\u201d", "Author": "HopeTravelot", "ReviewID": "UR131920174", "Content": "The view!

We upgraded to a King suite with the deal but it was supposed to be a view off of the front of the hotel which had a lake and dam view just not the full lake view you pay a little extra for. We booked for the Sunday and Monday at the end of the Memorial day weekend and and did the confirmation call and confirmed that we had a balcony room. We were driving through Branson several weeks before our booking and decided to see the hotel where we would be staying so we stopped and asked to see a room like we would be staying in and they told us it would not be possible. They did confirm though that we had a balcony room on the front of the hotel. When we arrived for our visit our luggage was in disarray because we had to rummage around in it to find a couple of things on our trip and a few things were scattered in the vehicle. We did not want the bell person to have to wait around on us so we requested that we could get a luggage cart so we could get our things in order and we would just do it in our own time. It was a pain when the doorman brought the cart over and wouldn't leave. We felt like we were rushed with him breathing down our backs. It was embarassing being there and our things not ready and his head poking in trying to get whatever he could. We wanted a private moment to get things together and it was not private at all. I didn't know it but he shadowed my wife to the room with the cart and she did not have cash on her for a tip while I parked the truck. I had to park in the parking garage and back in so that I had the kayak pinned against the wall and the cap down so it was difficult for it to be stolen. I was hoping that the security gates on the garage were working but one was missing totally. When my wife got to the room she found a brown recluse spider on the lamp shade when she went to turn the light on. I was not going to mess with it soshe called 4 star hotel. It took 15 minutes for somebody to get rid of it. We were wanting to leave to go eat and it seemed like an eternity. The room was not on the front of the hotel it was lakefront, but there was no balcony just half windows and we noticed that there were pets everywhere on the floor. Then we found out that there were fireworks that night off the front of the hotel for Memorial day so I guess we had been moved to the pet floor to accomodate somebody booking for the fireworks. The lights from the pool obscured the lake view at night on the 3rd floor. Don't drink the bottle of water on the counter that looks complimentary that other hotels do. It is $3 The carpet looks faded and the bed felt soft and comfortable to begin with but it soon felt lumpy, but I am a sensitive sleeper. The linens did feel nice but the pillows flattened with the weight of your arm. The next day when I decided to go to the desk and say something about what room we recieved they did change rooms without a hassle. I should never have had to say anything. If they had documented that I came to check out my room they should have known I would say something. when it wasn't what I had booked. The upgrade was not an upgrade. I do not want to be walking around after somebody elses pets when I do not have one. I love animals but not staying after them on my anniversary trip. Our room was long and narrow and felt crowded all the time we were there. We felt like we had to get out not to be crowded. The atriums and restaraunts were beautiful but the prices for the food were outrageous. --- like around $5 for a bagel and on up. The staff is nice but not welcoming like most of the ozarks are. Try to walk from your car and stop at the pool with a soft drink cup and you will be scolded. They will bring you ice water which is nice or you will pay for thier drinks which are very high. If you have a soda you had in your room you cannot bring it to the pool.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Howell, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNot a \"Four Star Resort\"\u201d", "Author": "WC G", "ReviewID": "UR131127417", "Content": "My wife and I wanted to take a short vacation and decided to stay at the Chateau.

POSITIVES: \u2022 Check in process was painless (however, we had to pay an extra $50 just to check in early). \u2022 Concierge, very pleasant and professional. Getting all of the show tickets we wanted. \u2022 Surrounding grounds are just beautiful and very well kept. \u2022 We ate dinner at the grille, food was expensive, but very good as well as the excellent service. \u2022 Our room was a Lake Front Ambassador King Suite overlooking the lake....view was worth a million dollars. \u2022 Car parking valet was attentive and always on duty. NEGATIVES: \u2022 Room was not very clean, my expectations for a four star resort would be much better than what we experienced. Housekeeping manager needs to do a better job in checking out rooms. \u2022 Spoke with a housekeeping lady and she indicated that they clean from 13-15 rooms a day...not bad, but would have expected a better job. \u2022 Decor was old and dated. \u2022 Most of the time we had to keep the sliding door closed because of the calypso music being played at the pool was non-stop and also very loud. \u2022 Also regarding the calypso music, I had to call the front desk at 11PM to request that they please shut it down, particularly if you want to have the door open at night to sleep. \u2022 The area overlooking the pool, was very dirty, the ceilings had cob webs and a wasp nest.

After about 10 minutes we caught her attention and informed her we were ready to order. She took our order and since we were having an early dinner my husband and I decided to split a sandwich. There is a $5 split fee which I thought was a little ridiculous considering the sandwich was $15. We ended up moving 3 tables over to have a better view which the staff didn't really seem like they wanted us to move. After 20 minutes of sitting there with only water, we realized we hadn't even received our drinks. I ordered a rootbeer and my husband ordered Ice tea. Nothing crazy. I got the busser to find our waitress and informed her of what was going on. We had not received our drinks or our salad and soup. She said that the kitchen was having issues and the drinks must of gotten lost along the way. We gave her 10 more minutes to bring us our drinks and nothing!!!! We got up and left.

However, it really overlooked the top of the parking garage or convention center. Lobby: Can we not have real flowers in a beautiful setting in the lobby area???? Plastic ones?????? Expected real. The room: Nothing special. Really no complaints, bed was nice, however, the TV control was confusing...Was nice to have a large countertop in the bathroom and the extra counter in the room was nice as well. Couldn't open our curtains at night because a spotlight on the garage (?) roof was glaring right at us! Was great to have 3 elevators in the hotel. Never had to wait! The pool: Disaster! Too many people and not enough lounge chairs. Attendants need to make sure people are actually using the lounge chairs and not just leaving stuff there. Need more lounge chairs. Also the cushions on the chairs are in desperate need of trashing. Most that I saw were ripped at corners. Really?????? I expected better! Also, need more places to sit and eat down there if you are going to offer food. Get rid of the grass space and put more loungers. I actually saw people trying to put their towels on the very small green grass and lay down???!!! Yikes! Was nice to have pool attendants walking around with water, but they could go around and pick up empty water cups that were left by poolside. They seemed to enjoy just talking to one another. (Where is the manager on this?) I read on website that the pool also offered cold towels, but didn't get offered any of those. Would have been nice at 90+ degrees!!! Could use a kid pool. Adult couples need to realize that there are a lot of kids running around this resort. When I looked in the outdoor hot tub, it was filled with pre-teen boys. The view from the pool area of the lake could be fabulous, but old mature landscaping has grown too tall. (Pool was important to us...They missed the mark for us on this! Since we couldn't find a spot at the pool and kids were running rampant, we went to marina to get a kayak. ) The food: Didn't eat in the Grille, but did have dinner and lunch in the Atrium Cafe. Food was excellent. Service was great. However, wanted to sit at a certain table at lunch, but was told that since they had a party of 7 in that area, we needed to sit somewhere else. Really? We refused that suggestion, and was seated where we wanted and had no problem with service. We were waited on and served quickly. Keep in mind, there was no one else in that area either. Didn't quite get all that!!! Ice cream bar and dessert area was fabulous. It was so nice to have that available during the evening. Marina: Not really that convenient. Need to drive there or wait for a shuttle. We choose to drive. One disappointment there is that you cannot swim or float around in the coves near the marina, even though it seems clear of any boating activity. We have stayed at other Table Rock places, where they have inner tubes and such that you can enjoy the water around the marina. We went out in a kayak and had a great time. Marina service was very good. No complaints, except for the fact that you offer men's swimwear, but have no women's swimwear. Why? Overall: Was a nice place. Staff was extremely friendly. Enjoyed the stay. Just hope that this review can offer everyone some insight to what we experienced. Would have been nice to be able to sit outside during eating at the restaurant or outside from the bar and not have to look and hear the pool. Bear in mind that if you sit outside at the Grille, you will be hearing all of the sounds of the kids at the pool. Need to build a new family pool off to the side of the hotel, out of the range of dining and lake viewing. Will we be back? Not sure. Chateau seems to be catering more to families, so if you are a couple looking for a romantic setting, this is probably not your place, in my opinion. If you enjoy watching a kids movie by the pool at 8 pm on a Saturday night, this place may be for you! Didn't expect that since they have an indoor movie theater set up just for kids.

My room had a separate vanity, nice flat screen, very large bathroom with a tub/shower combo and large countertop. Everything in rooms and the entire hotel for that matter, is of high quality. There are a lot of \"nice touches\" not found in every hotel like a hamper in the bathroom for you towels, etc. The hotel is just the right size. Big enough to have all the amenities including a spa, couple of restaurants, nice bar, deli/pastry shop, indoor and outdoor pool, fitness center and more, but it's very easy to navigate. The indoor pool and whirlpool are open 24 hours which is a really nice feature. My only recommendation would be to add free weights to the fitness center. I've never seen a decent sized fitness center that didn't have a set of free weights to use. You enter all the rooms from the interior which is beautiful and features a waterfall, lots of plants and some tropical birds. There are 3 elevators so you never have to wait for one. They also have a full service marina that offers everything from jet skis to full size boat rentals. The service I experienced was excellent as well. While kids are obviously allowed, I think this is the perfect place for a couple or a group of couples looking for a luxurious romantic spot. I would highly recommend this hotel.

We could not stay in the Jacuzzi for long since the smell of chlorine would hurt our eyes to the point that we would start tearing up. The inside pool was so cold and not heated, however the outside pool was heated which makes no sense. The outside pool was also dirty, and you could see that it was not regularly being cleaned. We could also not use the kayaks and paddle boats which was another disappointment. You could also hear bird sounds throughout the hotel which were really annoying, guests come to a hotel to get some piece and quiet and not to listen to birds all they long.

In addition, the service at the front desk is good, but not great. The people who check you in are accommodating, but not friendly. As far as the amenities go, the pool is nice and the hot tub is large. The fitness center is okay, but very small. Overall, this hotel is gorgeous, but way overpriced.

The \"co-ed\" area that contains the whirlpool is a bit small, but it's private, and there is access to a secluded outdoor area as well. The spa doesn't offer too much in the way of food or beverages, but there are a few interesting choices if you choose to stay there for any length of time. Treatments are on the pricey side, but the staff seems to know their stuff. There is a theater in the bottom of the hotel that provides nightly movies (when it's not reserved for a private party), and in indoor pool for visitors who don't use the spa facilities.

I was in Oklahoma City, and would be returning back home to Indiana this weekend. Last spring we stopped by Branson on the way home and thought about doing so again. I stumbled across the COTL and decided to call. The lady who I talked to was very helpful. She stated she would make a note to get me a room on the 10th floor for a better view of the lake and she did as our room was on the10th floor. (Lake front room). Secondly, I read every single review of this hotel. All 20 pages of them. After reading these reviews and after staying at the COTL this past Saturday night, I got to say some of the reviews are uncalled for. Some I can understand especially concerning any bad service, but some reviews are just nit-picking. You have to realize you are at an expensive hotel. They have expensive costs. One thing that did bother me was there was a common theme people were disappointed with over a 2-3 year period and appeared to never get fixed, and that was the food service area. I kept saying to myself, Stephen appears to be active on this forum, and reads the reviews, but people keep giving the food service and quality bad reviews. How can this not get fixed. (After my experience, I wonder if some were nit-picking). Now on to my review. Arrived Saturday night at 5:00pm. Based on all my readings I was going to quantify this place with my own personal experiences while there. We pulled up at the hotel, and of course was greeted by the bell hop. I immediately told him we didn't have much luggage and we were just going to check in real quick. He said ok, and I had to hand over my keys while inside checking in. Check-in went real smooth. A man checked us in, was real professional, and was quick. We walked back out out and parked the car. We walked back in the hotel and went to our room to dump the luggage. The wife and I decided to walk around and check out the hotel. We walked all around the hotel and I thought about having a quick drink before we got cleaned up for dinner. We went to the lounge which all the bar seating was taken. My wife and I sat at a table and was not sure whether they come to the table or not. So I walked up to the bar to order a drink. (Now I'm giving the place a pass on this) But, no bartender came soon, so I turned around and told the wife, we'd just get some Diet Coke and mix a drink back in the room. Now I didn't stay at the bar a long time, So I can't fault the place for anything here. I do want to say, the lounge layout just didn't click with me. I would liked a bigger bar so many people could sit at it. Make a square bar with TV's on all 4 sides and more people can sit at it. I dunno, the lounge just didn't feel welcome to me for some reason. Ok, so we decided to get a couple of Diet Cokes at the Coffee shop before we went to our room. This place was incredible with the choice of cakes and desserts. The lady behind the counter was extremely nice and provided great service. We headed back to the room and had a drink before dinner. Ok, We didn't want to spend a ton of money at the Grille, so we decided to go to the other restaurant which was a tad more lower priced. Plus, we wanted to sit in the atrium with a view while dining. I thought eating out on the atrium was a great idea. I told the person seating us I wanted to sit at a table with a good view, which she accommodated. Josh, was our waiter, and took our drink and appetizer order quickly. It did take a tad amount of time to get the drinks, and when they came the beer wasn't very cold. I told Josh, I wanted him to know the beer wasn't very cold, and ordered another beer. He said he knew what to do and would make the next beer colder. Indeed he did. The second beer was very cold. I don't know if he frosted the glass or what but the beer was much colder. Even the wife thought her first beer was not very cold. For the appetizer, we had the avocado fries which I had read in a review were good. They lived up to the previous review. They were awesome. We then ordered the Haddock fish and were delivered to us in 11 minutes from the time we ordered to being delivered to out table. The Fish was very good, along with the cole slaw, and fries. I would like to have had more cole slaw, but it is what it is. Josh should be commended for his service. At times, he was 1/2 running back and forth. It almost appeared they were short staffed. I looked around if this was the case, but I had mixed emotions whether they were or not. Sometimes waiters like to be more busy with more tips, then not as busy with less tips. Other staff were delivering food and clearing tables so it appeared to be worked out. Overall, I would say our dining experience was two thumbs up. I was concerned about this after reading the reviews. This was a common theme in the reviews about the dinning experience at the COTL. Now the room. Incredible, just incredible. I could not find one fault in the room. Extremely upscale and comfy. The TV sound in the bathroom was cool. Go an extra step and put a TV in the bathroom. This would definitely make a mark with your hotel providing this service. I have a TV in my bathroom at home and enjoy this. The bed was too soft for me. Some might like that, but I like hard beds. The bathroom and the room was especially spacious. In summary, I loved the place. I already want to come back, more so when it's warm so I can enjoy the facilities better. I hope this review help some in people with their decision whether or not to stay here. This is a very nice hotel. They have expensive costs in maintaining this hotel. I understand the prices.

Sounded like they were dragging furniture across a wooden floor! The rooms had carpets! On the up side. The hotel restaurant served lovely food, and the staff in there were very friendly and helpful. The housekeeper was also very friendly. The hotel itself has wonderful views, and beautifully landscaped gardens. My morning at the Spa was perfect. The best massage therapist I have had, she actually listened to what I wanted, and resisted the temptation to tackle the knots she found deep inside my back! The first one that has ever resisted the urge, which made the massage so much more relaxing. The two of us, (the therapist and myself), had so much fun, we spent a lot of the time swapping stories and giggling! Would we go back? Probably not.

We wanted to stay at a hotel/resort that had many amenities on-site, as we did not want to spend too much of our precious family time driving from place to place. Frankly, we wanted to stay at Big Cedar Lodge, but it was booked, and this seemed like the second-best option. At any rate, things worked out in that we decided we wanted to take our dog that we had adopted a month ago with us, as he was not ready to be left in a kennel for an entire weekend, and this place has pet-friendly rooms. Overall, it was a good choice! The name of the hotel gives perhaps an impression of European luxuriousness, but I would more aptly characterize this hotel as a bastion of relaxed Midwestern helpfulness and friendliness. All of the employees, from the doormen to the restaurant servers to the pool waitstaff to the housekeeping staff, were helpful and truly friendly, yet not in a pompous way as you may sometimes see at, say, the Ritz or the Four Seasons. For the first two days we spent time with our kids (7 and 5) at the outdoor pool and at Moonshine Beach, which is a very small beach a two-minute drive from the hotel. We also watched a movie in the in-house theatre and went to the marina. We ate all of our meals on the property, including breakfast at the Atrium (their more casual lobby dining spot), dinner outside on the balcony (which was VERY pleasant and breezy), ice cream and coffee from the pastry shop, and a Sunday afternoon brunch buffet. The food in general was very good and nicely prepared. I loved that you could eat lunch poolside, and have drinks brought to your pool chair...nothing beats a poolside Bloody Mary. Yes, some of the food and drinks were somewhat pricey, but not terribly so...in general that is what you get when you want it brought to you without having to move from your hotel or even your chair. The hotel is rather removed from central Branson and its strips of, dare I say, cheesy and nondescript low-lying buildings laid out in strip mall-esque fashion. I rather liked that, though...for us it was nice to be able to escape to a show (in our case the Shanghai Acrobats) and then drive back to our secluded oasis of a hotel; for us, even if we were in the entertainment mecca that is Branson, the enjoyment of the hotel amenities is what we were looking for for our vacation. The room itself that we had booked was slightly dated, I thought, with a Fairfield Suites flair to it (think maroon and hunter green color scheme, nondescript generic landscape fake-o oil painting), but perhaps this is because it was one of the pet-friendly rooms that overlooks the back parking lot...some of their other rooms could be more updated. If you want luxury that pulls out all the stops, go find a Ritz somewhere and pay top dollar...if you want a low-key relaxed break in the Midwest where you can take in a show or two and easily entertain and feed your children at a more reasonable price, stay at the Chateau.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Time\u201d", "Author": "ch5082", "ReviewID": "UR117994393", "Content": "Weather was so-so for our family trip to Branson, but we still had fun.

Awesome room. Loved the privacy, since traveling with our kids, who slept on the sofabed. LOVED the little extra touches for the kids, like Lucky the Bear delivering milk and warm cookies fri & Sat nights (should do this every night though :) in case someone isn't staying over a weekend), the free movies in the mini theater, although I never saw the free popcorn, but we missed the beginning of every movie we saw so maybe they handed it out when we weren't there, also the dive-in movies in the pool at night, the kids loved that too. I thought it was very relaxing too lounging in the chaise while they played in the pool and we all watched it. LOVED getting ice cream and sweets at the Sweet Shoppe every night and sitting on the veranda overlooking the lake and sunset to eat it. SOOOO relaxing and peaceful, especially with the cooler evening air. (could turn off the fake bullfrog recording though, that was loud and annoying). I asked upon checkin for a free upgrade to a lakeview if they had it, even though I only reserved mountain view. They said they had 'partial lakeview' available during my whole stay so they gave us that. The window out of the living room therefore overlooked the convention center roof-ick, but the balcony and view from the bedroom was of the lake and dam and absolutely gorgeous! I sat out there every evening enjoying the peace and view. We found the staff to be extremely nice and helpful. Every time we saw a bellhop they opened the door and we always thanked them. My girls remembered the name of our bellhop who showed us our room so whenever we saw him they were sure to address him by name and say hi. The restaurant staff was very personable, we had the same waitress for breakfast buffet the two days we ate there (she was from Kimberling City, forgot her name). She was great and very professional and helpful, she also always gave us a table right by the window overlooking the lake, which of course I loved :) I will say, that the first night we were there we ate dinner in the cafe atrium and was unimpressed by the food portions compared to the prices. In that atrium setting I would expect a little less price. That was the reason we headed to Branson for most of the rest of our meals until Sunday when we decided based on our boating reservation we should eat at the hotel to save time. That is when we had the opportunity to sit in the 'fancier' section of the dining and try the buffet, and both were great! We absolutely loved this hotel. We paid about $50 more per night to stay at the Grand Wailea in Maui a few years ago. The rooms here at the Chateau are a million times nicer. Granted, part of your room price is to pay for the amenities of the 'resort' and Hawaii has the ocean a few steps away and the Grand Wailea had a GREAT pool system (sandy beach pool/slides/rope swing/lazy river etc). But even with all that, my husband was unimpressed with our Hawaiian trip. But here at the Chateau, he said he really liked it and would definately come back. That says a lot from my husband! I myself, definately loved it!!!! Loved the robes, and the bedding too! The only ladies 'shopping' store was definately geared towards grandma's though. I am 40 with two kids under 10 and nothing in that store was attractive to me...except they had a small Brighton section in the back, which I did end up buying some earrings and a bracelet from. A younger clientele would like different clothing though. There is only one outdoor pool and there is nothing special about it. But the kids had fun in it. I really like the pool movie though. The atrium is beautiful and we really loved our vacation here. We will be back. We also went to the marina where they have free canoes/kayaks/paddle boats. We rented ski boats and had a ball. I like that you can bring your own boat and lauch it here, we will do this next time.

We took advantage of the valet and luggage service. It was $15 extra a day, but my husband feels it\u2019s worth it and afterwards I had to agree. There didn't seem to be alot of close convenient parking and with two young kids it was nice having the car waiting and someone to help with our stuff when we got back each time. We had a king with a mountain view. The room was clean and big enough for our two boys to have their blow-up beds on the floor and still have plenty of walking space. We also liked that there was a clothes hamper for towels in the bathroom, just a nice little detail. A mini-fridge would be a great addition to the rooms considering the caliber of hotel, but not worth $20 a day extra. We already had a cooler from the drive so we just continued to use that for our drinks. We ate at the Chateau Grill early afternoon and it was ok. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet the next morning - Now that was really good. Everything was fresh and hot, the made-to-order omelets and waffles were outstanding, and the service was good too. One of the evenings we inquired about ordering and taking our meal up to our room since it was so late and the hostess didn't seem to have any problem with us doing that. We ended up getting room service and the delivery server was extremely nice. Wish I had noted his name, think it was Michael. We enjoyed the outdoor pool and the kids liked the playground, but did not get to take advantage of the children\u2019s movie theater and kids club. The concierge helped us with directions and Branson activities for the kids. Thought the location was great. It is centrally located enough that you are only a short drive away from most of the attractions. The only complaint I had was the Memorial Day dinner. When we checked in, we received a list of hotel activities for the guests. Make sure to inquire as to whether there are additional fees on those. One activity was a BBQ cookout and fireworks by the pool on Sunday evening. Considering the price per night, I never even thought there would be such a high charge, maybe a nominal fee... The BBQ dinner was $24 per adult and I believe it was half that for children over 3. We drop $60 on dinner often enough, but not for outdoor bbq.... So we skipped that - and considering only a handful of people were eating, it looked like alot of others did too... and just got drinks, swam and watched the fireworks - which were awesome! Overall, our experience was great, and we would definitely go back and stay here.

I travel on a weekly basis and am not the typical picky person who picks on every detail about a hotel. I ordered a drink after the conference I attended and was Id'd, which is absolutely no problem as I look fairly younger than what I actually am. However, the bartender decided to take my ID away and not say anything and be gone for close to twenty minutes. I work for a Fortune 500 company that specializes in Identity theft so I immediately asked for the manager as this is a HUGE \"Red Flag\" when your identity is taken behind closed doors. The manager came out and basically started arguing with me in front of all the customers. I tried to explain to him that I had absolutely no problem with them examining my ID, The only problem I had was taking my ID behind closed doors. The manager ended up raising his voice and not even apologizing for what happened. I have never, from a business standpoint, dealt with someone so unprofessional and behind the times. I honestly wonder if the manger was abusing drugs (not even trying to be funny). This experience ruined the trip for me as I am sure it would for anyone who chose to stay here. I am not one of these unrealistic people who post on this website with expectations that are sky high and write a bad review when innocent people don't meet them.

I felt like I shouldn't have been there. The visit was very nice after that. Our room was great even though it was a mountain view. Bathroom was wonderful and clean (the ceiling above the tub was discolored). The staff was very good and friendly. Supper was very good. I would recommend the French Onion Soup. The Sweet Shop is a great place. It was so much better than a Coffee Bar stuck in the corner and it was a place to get dessert after supper had settled.

Stayed 5 days Call ahead reservations: Went smoothly. Lauren and Jessica set up our rooms and they were very funny and helpful.They emailed everything to me. They told me all the things we should do and all the shows we should miss. I wish I could of met them while I was there to thank them in person. They were right on with their information. We arrived at about 1:30 p.m. and was greeted by Brodie the bellman. He opened the doors for us and asked us how we were doing and proceeded to the trunk of our car to get our luggage. He waited with us while we checked in. He did a great job and was very friendly. CHECK IN: We were warmly greeted with a great attitude and smile by Ashley V. She gave us all the info we needed and set us up to eat brunch at their restaurant. Even though we were coming in late the buffet was full and the food was WONDERFUL ($29.00 -Adult and $16.00 child). Everything you can think of they offered. It tasted fresh and was hot. It was worth the money. Our waiter was Ibo and he was very attentive, great to my two children and we never had a half empty glass. He was so kind to give us take out drinks for the room. ROOMS: We had 2 rooms that adjoined on the 8th floor. Both were Lakeview king and a double. We faced the parking lot (we requested this view because we did not want to hear the air units they have on the other side) with a 1/2 lake-1/2 tree view. Rooms were nice and clean and the beds okay......a little hard for my taste but had many pillows to choose from. As stated in other reviews there is no free internet in room. We did use their library for the free wi/fi and it was very comfortable(Took pillow and blanket with me). Did order in room internet for 2 of the 5 days we were there and it was only $10.00. Not too bad. SWEET SHOP: Had the BIGGEST sweet rolls and malts ever. They had a great selection of most things and the best part was little sweet Margaret. She was so kind and soft spoken. She made you feel like you were at Grandma's. Wanted to take her home with us. ROOM SERVICE: We ordered room service and it came in the time they said. We had Cammila and she was fantastic. She entered the room, was very friendly, she set up a table with a tablecloth, put out silverware, poured the water glasses, and served the food. It was hot and very tasty. INDOOR POOL: Nice but water was cloudy and had a strong smell of bleach. Kids loved it though. 3rd day there I heard a grandmother talking to her granddaughter on why she peed in the pool. Got the kids out and told the front desk asap. They sent someone to the pool within a sec to check the chemical levels and put more in. I appreciated the fast action on the part of the hotel to fix this. However, we did not swim the rest of our time there. (I'm OCD about germs) SPA: Nice but pricey. Staff was very friendly and did a great job. COMPLAINTS: 1ST. The restaurant does NOT like for YOU to get take out orders from them. Instead they want you to order room service. My 6 year old son just wanted a pizza to take with him because we were to eat at a fish place he does not like and they were flat rude about it. I asked them if this was a hotel \"rule\" and he said no but they \"prefer\" you to order from the room. I asked him what the difference was if I sat down ordered a pizza and asked for a to go box and he couldn't answer me instead he put in the order and we got the pizza to go. I know they want there 20% plus a tip they get from room service but give me a break. I'm not ordering take out for the whole family which by the way should be honored. My son just wanted to eat pizza on the way to the \"yukky restaurant we picked to eat at. 2ND: The two live birds in the lobby. THEY ARE VERY VERY LOUD! They cover them at 10:00 p.m. and uncover them at 8:00 a.m. to feed them. They chirp very loudly for 2 1/2 hours and if you want to sleep late FORGET IT. I called down to the front desk and they give you a song and dance about how well they are taken care of and Mr. Hammons loved these birds and he felt they were a great thing to have in the lobby. blah, blah, blah. However, some of the staff did agreed with me and to tell you the truth it made me feel better that they actually felt the same. They are only LOUD in the morning until about 11.00 a.m. I personally told the highest person up I could talk to to put the LOUD birds in her office if she liked them so much. She didn't like that too well. Maybe she hates the birds too. Moving on...... CHECK OUT: Checked out over the T.V. . Left the card keys in the room and the bellman took our luggage down and we were off. Painless PARKING: Free and covered if you want to park a little ways out. Worth it if you have a black car and it gets hot. Well that's it. We had a lovely time and will return if the birds die or go away or if we have to get up early in the morning while there.

The Chateau was beautifully decorated and the room was very nice, but I do have some recommendations/complaints for you. My first complaint is that the menu for the New Year\u2019s Eve package, when I looked at this online, said there would be Surf and Turf. What we received was Grilled Caesar Salad, which actually turned out to be a giant leaf with dressing, and a piece of steak (which they never asked how we like it cooked) and a little bit of crab meat on top of the steak along with what was described as (truffle whipped potatoes. The potatoes were not cooked and actually were the worst potatoes that I have ever had. I never saw dessert. They did not serve it our table. I have a problem with this because when I booked the package, I was thinking that Surf and Turf meant steak and Lobster. I was thoroughly disappointed. We paid almost $500.00 for a room and dinner that served a leaf and a small steak with a handful of chopped crab meat. My second complaint is that we book this package and can\u2019t even access the swimming pool. How much extra do we have to pay to get in the swimming pool? Did we not pay enough? This was ridiculous. Needless to say we were quite disappointed that we spent $500.00 for one night and I feel like we only got half the worth of that. Also, we were told that there would be a Champagne brunch on New Year\u2019s Day, but it was $40.00 per person. Why was this not included in the package?

I really wanted this trip to be special, so I picked the Chateau out of the many choices available because it looked like a beautiful place to stay that was away from the traffic yet within a short drive away the from shows and restaurants in Branson. I chose a lakefront room to have the best view available. The Chateau was the perfect choice for our Branson getaway. This majestic hotel is perfectly located on a hilltop that overlooks a beautiful, pristine lake. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and featured several gingerbread houses that were delightful. A manger scene was situated at the head of a beautiful indoor waterfall. A whimsical Santa was found climbing down a rope from the 10 story atrium. What a wonderful, delightful experience we had while staying at the Chateau! Upon first driving up to the Chateau, we found the bell staff to be very helpful and friendly. When we checked in, we were initially offered a room on the 3rd floor. I had previously read that the 3rd floor was where pets were allowed. My wife is allergic to cats, so I asked for a different room. A short time later, we were given a room on the 8th floor. I don\u2019t travel that much, but I thought the room was absolutely perfect. It had a balcony with 2 chairs so that we could sit and enjoy a magnificent view of the lake. The king sized bed was absolutely comfortable. There were 2 sink areas: one in the bedroom, which my wife used as a dressing area, and one in the bathroom. Both sink areas were long and roomy. The room and the hotel were not only clean, but amazingly spotless. The staff truly went way out their way to be helpful and friendly. We ate 2 meals at the Chateau. We ate dinner at the Chateau Grille and breakfast at the Atrium Caf\u00e9. For dinner at the Grille, I had the Texas fried steak, which was served hot and tasty. In both instances, we had a delightful waitress by the name of Amber. While ordering breakfast at the Atrium Caf\u00e9, my wife was really in the mood for hot chocolate. However, she has lactose intolerance and would be unable to consume the hot chocolate that was on the menu. When we mentioned this to Amber, she went way out of her way and found soy milk and had the hot chocolate made for my wife that she could enjoy. Amber\u2019s demeanor was so sweet and friendly; she made an impression on us that we will not forget. Yvonne at the Concierge desk was also very friendly and helpful. We had some time available for a show and she was able to print up a list of shows that were still available, even though it was getting close to the last minute.

There are no other close restaurants around unless you have a rental car and can go into Branson city which is about a 15 min ride. I did take advantage of the pool and the spa one day. VERY nice so don't miss out on this if you have time. The outdoor pool is lovely and overlooks the lake so you have a great view. On another note, if you go into Branson for a show, (that is really all there is to do there!)get a map and take the side roads as the traffic on the main street is so backed up. (the orange, red and green lines work best) We saw the \"12 Irish Tenors\" and they were fabulous! There are not many wonderful restaurants in Branson,(Mostly chain food) so we were happy to eat at the Chateau on the Lake where it is much more peaceful and away from all the crowds and traffic. We are from Atlanta so we loved flying in and out of the new airport in Branson. It is so small, but like a one room lodge! LOVE IT! The only place to get food in there is Famous Dave's BBQ which is good. It is a beautiful drive from the airport which sits on top of a mountain, beside 2 golf courses!!! All in all, our stay in Branson was very nice - just be prepared for all the tour buses and senior citizens - but we loved talking to them...

We thought ok it is very hot so we'll kick the a/c down to 64 and when we come back in a few hours it'll be cooler but that didn't happen. It never did cool down properly even when we set the thermostat to 60 and left for part of the day. We travel with a fan and that was pretty much the only reason we were able to stay somewhat comfortable. I think the biggest surprise to us was the lack of a refrigerator in the room. A room that cost 200 and up and there's not a fridge? I was also surprised at how thin the insulation was. Anytime the people in the room next to us made any noise (normal noise) we could hear it. Should we really be able to hear them in the bathroom? I wouldn't discourage someone from staying at the Chateau, but I don't know that I would recommend it over other hotels/resorts.

The hotel is located away from the commercial/retail areas of Branson and very near a state park and beach area. Also close to a fish hatchery. We loved the location as it was on top of a hill and the view of the lake was wonderful. If we wanted to go see a show it was just a short 5 to 10 minute drive back to the hustle and bustle of Branson. We opted for a mountain side view to save some money and our room was very spacious and beautiful. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable. The birds go to bed around 10:00 or 11:00 so if you want to go to bed before that time you will hear them. This is a pet friendly hotel which is nice. I have never found animals to be a problem. The pool was spacious and there is a great view of the lake from the pool area as well. The hotel offers a free movie each night in the lower level theatre, a kids club, paddle boats, canoes and kayaks free of charge. A mulitude of other boats, and jet ski's are available for rental. I'ts best to drive to the lake/marina as Branson is all hills so driving is a little easier. The lake is very clean and clear. All in all I enjoyed my stay very much and hope to return if I visit the area again. Items that could be improved upon would be a small fridge in all rooms. Some folks must take medicine that has to stay refrigerated or like to have cold water available at night so the fridge would come in handy. It would be wonderful if the hotel put in an actual sand beach area. The lake is so great it's a shame there is no where on the property to actually swim in the lake. There is a beach about 1 miles from the property at a state park but having a beach on the property would be great. One evening during our stay storms rolled through the area. I was very glad I had used the underground parking that is available and that I was staying in such a well constructed hotel and not the one of the lesser constructed hotels downtown.

If you are coming from Springfield, MO, do not take the directions that they suggest. Take the Hwy 248 which turns into Gretna Road all the way to the Hotel. You go through the strip, but just the interesection of HWY 76. The conceierge was very helpful finding different things around Branson and provided a great map of the roads around the city. We really enjoyed eating lunch by the pool....a little pricey but that is what you expect from a luxury hotel. If you have kids this is a great place. The grill by the pool offers boxed lunches for a charge, but saw lots of kids eating these. Would suggest that the hotel offer mini-refrigerators for its guests. We ended up going to Walmart and buying a styrofome cooler to keep our sodas and alcohol and snacks cool. Saved us money too. This is a great place for conferences and conventions. They have a nice marina on the grounds, but it is a steep walk so would suggest driving, especially in July. The hotel is located near a state fishery and the dam. This is nice to take kids to see.

First of all, this hotel and spa is probably one of the best hidden gems in the state of Missouri. Roughly a 3 1/2 hour drive from the outskirts of St. Louis, Chateau on the Lake offers a secluded getaway that is often impossible to find in the Midwest. The location is great, although a little tricky to get to if you are not used to a rolling and hilly terrain. The seclusion is nice, but can be intimidating if it is your first time in the Branson area. For my wife and I, we took it all in stride as it was a getaway for our sixth anniversary. Booked online at the beginning of May, we were absolutely stunned at the bargain and availability we were able to get so close to our travel date. We thought for sure the hotel would either be fully booked or prices would be outrageous. Kudos to hotel management for keeping the prices reasonable during this economic slowdown. The room we were blessed with could have easily gone for twice as much here in the city. Now, the reason for the title. Despite having great amenities, a fabulous location, delicious food, and a spectacular spa, I feel all of that was undercut by a sense of nervousness from some of the staff and guests. Having a different ethnic background from most of the people in the area seemed to catch a lot of people off guard. Let me be clear. No one said or did anything offensive at all; however, there were a few awkward stares from other guests and a few interactions with one or two members of the hotel staff that were less than desirable. Overall, this did not affect our entire opinion of the hotel, only to say that for the facility to have people of other ethnic backgrounds working on staff, it is quite surprising how uninviting cultural diversity was during the time of our stay. So that was the uncomfortable part, the satisfactory came from the great lakeview room which was large enough for four guests and the spa experience which made the entire weekend a success. The room was very comfortable and exceeded our expectations. You never know what you are going to get when you look at the web photos of a hotel room before your stay. Room service was timely and the food was better than expected. With such a wide variety of treats throughout the entire hotel (the candy shop and deli downstairs included) it was very hard to go hungry. The movie theater and cafe were also a nice touch. Management has gone out of their way to ensure guests never have to leave the property. The spa was an unexpected bonus. We knew there was a spa before we arrived, but we weren't sure if it was going to be available or priced reasonably. To our surprise, it was both. My wife and I were able to book a last minute service and we took full advantage of having access to all of the amenities such as the sauna, steam shower, and hot tub. Our goal was to have a lazy anniversary weekend where we could escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, yet spoil ourselves with the amenities we are used to at home. Chateau on the Lake was able to accommodate our wishes and for that, we are thankful. We will recommend this resort to our friends, but we encourage management to continue to improve diversity training among the staff members. We have a large network of friends in the Midwest, most of them from all types of ethnic backgrounds. We would love to have them include this resort on their list of 'must do' for Missouri.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester NY", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous Hotel, Lacks Room Amenities and Complimentary Services\u201d", "Author": "TravelAdviceFrom", "ReviewID": "UR63605847", "Content": "This is a beautiful hotel.

Let me begin by saying that the hotel itself is wonderful, it is a lovely place. The room was nicely appointed and we had no trouble checking in. The only issue we ran into was with the dining options. When we checked in we were given a weekly newsletter for the property. We arrived around 930 pm and were a little hungry. According to the paper we were handed the only option open to us was room service. We called the room service number and no one answered. We called the front desk and asked them about it. We were informed that all dining options closed by 9 and that our best bet was Domino's. We reminded her that the newsletter stated that room service was available until 11pm. It was about this time I realized that the newsletter was from January 2009, a whole year old. They basically told us we were out of luck. I was really bothered by the fact that the newsletter they were giving out was full of incorrect info, what is the point of that. It only makes the staff look lazy or the hotel look like it doesn't do much business at all. The following day we saw a sign in the lobby for high tea. We thought it would be a fun thing to do that afternoon so we set up a time. The tea itself was fine, and the waiter who waited on us was pleasant and pretty attentive. As we were finishing the other waiters were getting ready for dinner service and were chatting. They were going on and on about how crappy the groups were that they were assigned for the evening. I thought that was extremely rude, especially as there were customers not 15 feet away. We decided then and there we were done eating at the hotel. The bright spots were definitely the doormen and the maid service. The room was spotless everyday and the maid was very nice. The doormen were kind and struck up conversation with us as we came and went. I would perhaps recommend this hotel if you're just going for a nice place to stay. It is beautiful. I would however just advise people to not expect much in the way of service or kindness from some of the staff. The hotel sells itself as a very upscale place, and they just need a little revamping of the customer service staff.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Property, but in need of a head waiter and some customer service training\u201d", "Author": "tl704", "ReviewID": "UR52012349", "Content": "My family and I stayed at this property over Thanksgiving this year and were pleased overall with the property, but found the service to be incredibly lacking. We drove from Dallas and ended up arriving after midnight. When we went in, we were immediately impressed with the Christmas decorations and initial presentation. We waited for about 5-6 minutes for someone to show up so we could check in. As I was about to go looking for someone, the Security Manager came by and went and got the front desk clerk for us. During the stay the Security Manager proved to be the most knowledgeable, helpful and genuinely concerned for guest services individual we encountered. The lobby of the hotel was very nice, but the overall hotel is basically the cookie cutter design for Embassy Suites although they tout it as being architecturally significant. We were checked in, and the Security Manager took our bags to the room. The room was nicely decorated, but not anything extraordinary by any means. Throughout the booking process I was under the impression the I was booking a suite only to discover that we had been booked into a King room. The next morning I asked about moving to a suite and paying the additional charges. The person at the front desk said that he would check and get in touch with me about availability. Evidentially there were none available since I never did hear back from anyone. That morning we also decided to eat breakfast in the hotel. If you stay at this property DO NOT DO THIS! This property in is desperate need of a head waiter and some wait staff training. There were maybe 5-6 tables of people in the dining room and what appeared to be 2 waiters and a manager. We ordered a very simple breakfast which took over an hour to be delivered. With a 6 year and a 3 year old that is a long time to wait for eggs and pancakes. We noticed that we were served ahead of a few tables that ordered before us and that two tables that arrived after us were served first. When our food did finally arrive one order was stone cold. After about 5 minutes, I had to seek out the waiter to get it remade. It seemed that the wait staff throughout our stay were simply thrown into these jobs without any training at all. The service at a very basic casual dining restaurant is head and shoulders above what this property provides. We went to the concierge to arrange for the show tickets and tickets to Silver Dollar City. She had no record of us and we had to spend over and hour with her just trying to get this together. The concierge here is also evidentially not trained in any way. I booked the trip about 3 weeks in advance and had placed 7 calls to the concierge during this time, which all went unanswered. After leaving messages on probably 5 occasions I finally received a return call about 4 hours prior to our scheduled arrival time. I was not able to answer the call since I was driving through the mountains en route to the hotel, but returned the call within 5 minutes only to get voicemail again. I left another message, but no return call. When we were trying to get all the tickets arranged it was clear that the concierge was frazzled, callous and simply just trying to get us out of there. I have had better service in a crowded deli. This is were tripadvisor again proved invaluable by helping to arrange the activities for our stay. The other issues with the service were mainly with in room dinning. They close their restaurants and bars really early but say that room service is available. The first night we ordered from room service. Again, a very basic order, some sandwiches and a cobb salad. When the food arrived the cobb salad was just lettuce in bowl. I am really not exaggerating this in any way. It was lettuce in a bowl, for which we were charged $16.00. I called back to room service to find out what that was all about. The woman who answered said that with the changes we wanted made to the salad that is what the cook prepared. When I told her that it was a bowl of lettuce and asked if she really thought that was what we wanted, she would only answer (very rudely I might add) that was what we ordered. Since it was late and I was no mood to deal with her, I simply told her I would take it up with the GM in the morning. Much to my surprise, the night manager called back and removed it from the bill. When the food was delivered to the room the delivery person made it a point to say that the total and line for gratuity were on the tab. Since he went out his way to point this out my assumption was that it was not included, which I saw later was not the case. I don't begrudge anyone a gratuity for doing their job, and after waiting tables myself for many years go out of my way to make sure they are tipped properly, but come on. This was something that occurred throughout the stay with the wait staff. The only training they get must be on how to maximize every chance to make an extra buck. With the wait staff being trained to gouge, the housekeeping staff seemed to be the opposite. Each morning our room was made up perfectly. However, each time a new person would make up the room they would leave their gratuity on the bureau. I certainly appreciate the honesty of the staff, but I would suggest that the hotel go over some protocols that I thought was generally accepted with the staff. I mention that simply to make the point that the hotel needs to do a much better job of training and not to fault the house keeping staff in any way. They were some of the best I have ever encountered. We had Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel, which kept with the hotels \"MO\"; wonderful food, great ambiance and bad service. Again a total lack of wait staff training came into play. We were seated and someone took our drink order. A different person brought them back and said he would be our waiter. We went through the different carving stations and when we returned to the table the waiter told me that he was going to leave our bill since they were booked solid and they would need our table quickly. I was ready to give the bill back to him and tell him that we would leave when we were good and @#!% ready, but decided simply to keep giving it back to him whenever we added something just to make a point. We had the same early closing issues with the bar and restaurant the next night. There were quite a few guests in the bar, but when I went in it looked liked it was closed and that these we people who had been in there for a while. I saw the bartender at the end of the bar counting the money, but when I asked him if they were still open he just held up a finger and said \"give me a minute\". I went to the front desk and asked about the hours. The woman there said the bar was closed but that I could still order from room service. This was about exactly the same time we ordered as the previous night, but this time the same woman who had answered the call the night before refused to allow us to order beer and wine since the bar had already been \u201ctotaled up\u201d, whatever that means. At the markup being charged for beer and wine one would think that they would take a few extra steps and go and get a bottle from the wine cellar. Lastly, when the bill arrived in our room the day we were to check out it was about as convoluted as it could be. They had randomly deducted random amounts from different charges to give us the package incentives. I had to go down to the front desk and have the Assistant Manager go through these with me. He was nice enough about it, but one would think that they would simply show you all the charges incurred and then the amount deducted for the total. It made it seem like they were trying to get away with something. Overall, I would reluctantly recommend this hotel because of the property. It is a very nice location, it is beautifully decorated for Christmas, it has great amenities and the food is excellent. It is apparent though that they market themselves as a 4 Diamond Hotel since the AAA Diamond rating system evaluates services offered, and not the way in which the services are rendered. After staying in a 5 Diamond property, the difference is exponential. I would add that the doorpersons are very friendly and helpful. If you stay at this property and need anything ask one of them! If you are looking for pleasant getaway with the family, this is an ideal spot, just go in with no expectations as to guest service and you will probably not be as disappointed.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and perfect for a getaway\u201d", "Author": "nibblet1", "ReviewID": "UR51806795", "Content": "The hotel was all decorated for Christmas and the atrium was a wonder.

About a week or two before I was to fly out to Branson, I called and asked if they had any cheaper rooms available. Come to find out, they did. It was a handicap room but that didn't matter. She told me I would lose my originally-booked lake view but I said that was all right. The lady was very informative, kind, professional, and helpful. I was very impressed with the grounds of the resort. The views are magnificent. Inside the resort is just as impressive. My expectations were surpassed! I had read the previous reviews, but I wasn't prepared for that! From the little river/waterfall in the center of the lobby (with REAL FISH at the bottom) to the glass elevators. It was very nice. They have an indoor AND outdoor pool, a business center with two computers, a HUGE convention/conference area, and more to rave about. After I got settled in, I sent pictures to my family and friends to show them where I was staying. The location of the resort was about 15-20 minutes from the church where my conference was. It was also a shorter distance to the 76 strip which is where a LOT of the attractions, theaters, and restaurants are. I like that the resort wasn't on the strip itself. I like the seclusion. Whoever chose that location deserves much kudos. The room was fantastic as far as cleanliness goes. That's a huge deal to me. The housekeepers are very thorough. They are also very attentive and take the initiative, because I always put a towel down in front of the toilet, and by the third or fourth day, I came back into my room and found a rug there, LOL. It was nice. :-) Service was great. From room service to the bellstaff constantly opening the doors for me, to check-in and check-out. I mainly kept to myself during my stay, but the little interaction I did have was very nice. I work in the hotel industry, so it was nice (and a little weird, lol) being on the receiving end of the treatment. Value for the room was good as were the rooms themselves. I rated each of them four because the value for other things were pricey -- the spa, even the food. And the room didn't have a refrigerator. I worked around that though by filling my icebucket with ice and setting my juice in there, so it worked out. For seven nights, I did spend a pretty penny, but it was all worth it, I feel.

The room was average to large in size with two queen beds and a large flat screen television. There was a wet bar area in the room, itself, but it did not include a mini-bar or fridge. The bathroom was large with a huge vanity area. One nice touch was a hamper in the bathroom for wet towels (you didn't have to leave them on the floor or in the tub if you wanted them to be replaced.) Overall, the rooms were comfortable, clean and nice. Our room, unfortunately, had absolutely no view. We had one window that looked out at the roof of the entrance. Seriously, we looked at a steepled roof. We did not complain as we were on business. I'm sure their are rooms with great views, most with sliding doors and small balconies. Just avoid this room if you would like a view. The pool was nice with a great view, and usually not too crowded in the morning. It could get difficult to a chair later in the day. Also, on the ground floor near the pool there was a large patio area with tables and comfortable chairs. There was also a fountain. This was a nice area to sit and relax, read, have a drink, and enjoy the view of the lake and mountains. There was a nice sweets and coffee shop from which you could grab a coffee and muffin or cinnamon rool for breakfast or ice cream of cake for dessert. The prices at this shop were rather reasonable and the servings large. I did eat at the restaurant for breakfast twice, once having the buffet and the other ordering off the menu. I didn't think the buffet was worth the money. Anything at the buffet could be ordered off the menu, and some of the items on the buffet were soggy, etc. The prices were high, but similar to other hotel restaurant prices. It was never busy, and the food was pretty good, but not great. The service was good, although the hostess was not the friendliest. One nice amenity was a small movie theater that showed two movies daily. The first showing at 2 p.m. was always a kids movie, and the second at 7 p.m. was usually PG or PG-13. Popcorn was served. This was a nice diversion on a rainy afternoon. One afternoon, we rented a pontoon boat and tube from the hotel marina. This was by far the highlight of the trip.

I selected the hotel's bed and breakfast package which included a one night stay, allegedly overlooking the mountains, and breakfast room service. Well, things didn't turn out as expected. Upon arrival we were met by a downright unpleasant valet who, upon discovering we had no business to extend him, rebuffed us with quite a sneer. Unperturbed, we proceeded to check in only to be met by a nice, but untrained, young lady. After having to assist her to provide us with our own needs we went up to our room which was indeed nice. The beds we luxurious (my thoughts), if a bit hard (my wife's comments.) The view was of the lake, if one were to stay far from the window. Otherwise it was of the trash bin and back of the hotel where, to our chagrin, we learned we would be treated to a frequent host of banging noises. Still, we enjoyed the room overall. We eventually wandered out of our room and ended up at the sweet shop for dessert. What a disappointment that was. Again, service was not only lacking but the selection of available food items was scant, at best. Nevertheless, the view from the shop was magnificent and we thoroughly enjoyed our treats. Soon after, we visited the gift shop where a perfectly lovely lady, the shop manager, conversed with us as if we were old friends. After selecting many fine gifts to take home with us we sauntered on to enjoy a dinner on the town. Here again, service was an issue for when we asked for directions into town from the hotel we were misdirected. The evening went uneventfully but we didn't sleep comfortably. The next morning, upon waking, we ordered breakfast via room service. It was not a difficult order but it took the staff three trips and an argument with my wife to get our order complete. Even so, the food was lukewarm, at best, and nearly inedible. The coffee, however, was great and we highly recommend it.

We used to come annually to meet friends at an conference and came because this is where the conference was booked. We always liked the location (love Table Rock Lake and the surrounding Ozark scenery), and the hotel offers alot of amenities that are otherwise almost impossible to find in Branson. As such, when we were thinking of coming back to Table Rock, we wanted to stay here. Unfortunately, despite the millions of dollars spent on the place, the resort can't seem to entirely shake the dust of the Branson strip from its feet. In my opinion, this place needs to decide relatively quickly whether it wants to be a top notch resort catering to those seeking R & R in the beautiful Ozark scenery or just another Branson tourist trap. With proper management and just a few slight adjustments, it could easily be the former. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that too many guests today are leaving with the impression that it is the latter. A couple of specific suggestions: (1) Charging $10 a day for internet access is just beneath the standards of a 4 star resort - even the motels on the strip advertise \"Free Wi-Fi.\" Either add $10 to the room price or put a quarter machine at the side of each bed where the guest can choose between internet access or a 10 minute massage bed. This goes for the many additional \"charges\" we encountered - $2.50 for a band-aid to cover our son's stubbed toe at the pool was another particularly egregious example - if you want to be a 4 star resort, act like it. If you just want to pick your guests' pocket at every turn, then rename yourself the \"Baldknobbers\" or some such thing and move to Hwy 76; (2) The service has got to be more consistent. This was our #1 complaint from our prior stays. However, I must say that during our first night, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The wait staff at the main dining room for Friday night dinner was superb, as were the girls at the twilight \"S'mores\" campfire for the kids and the very friendly (and prompt) waiter we had for Saturday morning breakfast. Unfortunately, it was all down-hill from there. Our service (including the front desk staff, concierge, and waitstaff in the restaurants) for the next 2 days were terribly slow and unfriendly. On the positive side, however, the outdoor pool, marina, tennis courts and activities staff are great. We loved the \"Sweet Shoppe\" and other on-site amenitites. The bottom line is that I REALLY like this place and want to see it succeed as a first rate destination resort in the beautiful Ozark Mountains. I love the facilities, the marina, the scenery and the idea. Unfortunately, it's the little things that are getting in the way right now. We will keep trying it out from time to time and I am really hoping to be able to eventually give it my whole-hearted recommendation.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFantastic service!

The shrimp salad is a much better value. On the positive side, when I complained about my salad we were offered dessert complimentary. The fine dining is really good!!! They even make their own mozzarella (not an easy feat). The deli makes a mean sandwich as well. However, the food does not come cheap so be prepared for the bill. We thought it was worth it and ate most lunches and dinners on site. The staff remembers your name and asks you how you are when they see you. Very friendly staff members all around. We really felt welcomed. The only other comment to add is that during our stay there was a very bad thunderstorm. This caused the fire alarms to go off before 4am. Then they went off again after 4am. I felt the staff handled the situation very well and the manager took half the room rate for the inconvenience. I don't think we could have asked for the situation to be handled any better!!

We booked the Vice Presidential Suite and one connecting room with 2 doubles overlooking the lake. Although the cool weather did not permit enjoying it, both the suite and the room had a small balcony with 2 chairs. The VP suite also had a one-person jetted tub. On the first day I spent 8 wonderful hours in the Spa Chateau. The massage therapist, Jodi, was wonderful. My only complaint is that I was not offered a lunch and having only had a cup of coffee before my services was famished by 5 PM! They kept directing me to their \"snacks\" which consisted of a few grapes, whole apples and dried fruit that could not be identified. Also, there was water, but no juice offerings. I got the idea that the spa was not very well managed. Use of the laundry services (2 washers and 2 dryers on the 10th floor) is free, with charges only for the soap and softener. We purchased our own at the Walgreens just down the hill and kept up with our laundry... less to do when you get home. The Chateau Grille is the restaurant in the hotel and the food is very good. Service is friendly, but we opted for room service after twice waiting nearly 30 minutes to receive the check after finishing our meal. The hotel is very quiet, but the indoor pool was very crowded each time we tried to use it. The Sweet Shoppe had wonderful ice cream and coffee and stayed open until 11PM! The hotel is just a short drive to the Branson strip, and there are many dining choices on the way. On our last day we stopped in Danna's Barbecue and Burgers for a late lunch (a sign outside boasted \"The best burgers in Branson!\")... Although my husband opted for the catfish plate, I got the single cheeseburger and onion rings and was not disappointed. This is also the ONLY place that offered freshly brewed SWEET TEA!!! I think if we return to Branson I'll stop in there first and buy a gallon to keep at our hotel! As for the shows: We went to the Dixie Stampede and were very entertained. Just be cautious where you purchase your tickets, and be aware that if you purchase them and receive \"vouchers\" you will have to stand in line to pick up the actual tickets before being admitted. The show lasted 3 whole hours... beware if you have little ones with early bedtimes or short attention spans!

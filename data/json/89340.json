I waited about three days for someone to phone me back, but they never did. I phoned the hotel again and asked for housekeeping. The head of housekeeping (who had the same last name as the general manager) said she'd look in the lost and found. She didn't find my things in lost and found. She said she'd talk to her staff who'd cleaned my room on the day in question and phone me back in a couple days. The phone call never came. I then phoned the 800 complaint line for Best Western.

They told me that the hotel's general manager had 7 days to respond. After 7 days passed, the 800 number phoned me and said the general manager had made no response. I then filed an on-line complaint. Again, zero satisfaction. The *ONLY* satisfaction I received was from American Express because I'd charged my airline ticket on my American Express card and I have trip insurance.

The wedding was held at Martins West which is almost in the parking lot of this hotel. We were prepared for the worst after seeing some reviews on hotels.com.

The decor was a little dated but other than that, the room was good. The bathroom had a cruved shower curtain and everything was clean. We walked to the wedding and I thought it was ok for the price.

We switched rooms several times because they either did not have adequate heat or smelled bad. Mind you this is after several hours of driving and a trade show with a two year old. When we finally settled for the smelly but warm room, with a non-working phone, it was 12:30 AM. The continental breakfast was meager but worst of all the dairy products were not in ice, they were warm to the touch. I decided against eating anything when I found my butter pat was moldy. The manager seemed to want to help but this hotel is so far beyond bad, I think they may want to just start over. At least drop the prices. If I knew this was a cheap, bad hotel that's one thing but we were under the impression this was a decent mid-line Best Western hotel. Hot tips for the management: 1)Fix the heaters in all the rooms 2)eliminate the smells in the rooms 3)Make sure your food is being stored and displayed safely 4)the decor seems new and tasteful, hopefully everything else will catch up soon.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cworst western!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jobloggs", "ReviewID": "UR5983672", "Content": "Ten of us travelled from England to attend a family wedding. We had three rooms between us none of which were of a decent standard. We had to move rooms three times (during what would have been a two week stay) due to a leaky bath, bad smells, poor ventilation and a visit from a mouse (which seemed to be a recurring problem as there were several Rentokil traps on the premises)! The maids were hopeless and their cleaning methods were shocking(cleaning the bath with a dry towel)! During our stay we witnessed several other similar complaints being made. The staff on the front desk were about as useful as a chocolate teapot! Our problems were only resolved when we spoke to the manager who tried to help but by this time we had had enough and decided to leave to find alternative accommodation. My advice to anyone contemplating staying here would be DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The only reason we stayed there was because we were attending a wedding reception next door and needed a place to stay. We had no lights in the vanity. No hot water in the shower. No cold water in the vanity. When we ran the cold water in the shower, the bathtub wouldnt drain. The bride and groom also stayed at the hotel and they had to sleep in the floor because their bedding hadnt been changed. They also had left over food in their room. It was pure disgusting! The hotel says they have security but they werent around when a fight broke out in the middle of the night. The brides car was also damaged during the one night stay. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone. It's a dump and most of the staff are complete idiots. OH and one more thing.

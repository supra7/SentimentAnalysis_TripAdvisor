There were two of us and let me tell you, we had no room to move around. The toilet is literally next to the bed, at least there is a door that you can shut in the bathroom, but that was not pleasant!!! One little window in the room that opens up only a few inches. There is not a pool or hot tub. The restaurant and bar were tiny as well. I just didn't find anything enjoyable about this hotel. The only staff that were friendly were the door men.

I was also pleasantly surprised with the workout equipment which had the latest cardio equipment, a workout station and a decent rack of dumbells. More than enough to address the guilt you feel after your over-indulgence the night before. The Hotel is nicely situated in the Gold Coast section of the city close to Michigan ave (about a 1 min walk) and great restaurants. The hotel offers wifi for $10 a day. There is an abundance of Starbuck's in this area in particular, a large Starbucks located on Rush St that is a short 3 min walk from the hotel . With so many Starbucks all over the city offering free wifi , I really never needed to pay for it. The staff was friendly enough however not as enthusiastic as the staff at the Talbot Hotel. For example, the doorman at the Talbot would see you coming and open the door for you The doorman at the knickerbocker was always too involved in conversation with the valet. (Just an observation not a criticism) That being said, I would choose the Knickerbocker over the Talbot.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto Ontario Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice but has its Issues\u201d", "Author": "TPoppleton", "ReviewID": "UR126222780", "Content": "I stayed here on business for 5 days.

They claim that is is an old hotel and that when the temp. outside is 50 degrees or over it only blows cold air. they gave me a portable heater. In the morning I put on a cup of coffee and tried to blow dry my hair. The power went out in my room! I just started laughing MAO. I have stayed at 2 star hotels that were much, much better.

The lady finally showed up to clean at 5pm, but by then we were too frustrated and didn't want to wait in the hallway for her to clean, so we only took new towels.

Restaurant food was great for lunch and the bar was well stocked and civilized with decent service. Just be aware of the pianist who plays from 7pm with no idea of what \"ambient music\" is and proceeded to beat the ivories rather than tinkle them - it made conversation a little difficult. My only issue was the service - receptionists were slow and poorly informed, while the bell station was rarely manned (I waited 15 minutes to drop off my suitcases on my check-out day), while valet parking requires 15 minutes to retrieve your car - something they fail to tell you when you're dropping it off.

We always walked in to the left where the elevators and checkin area are located. Didn't get to see the lounge and fancier areas of the lobby. But walking in does not give you the wow factor. - I know the building is old but the elevators are so tiny. We could barely fit with our luggage. The wait for an elevator can be time consuming as well. - We ended up in a room with absolutely no view. Someone has to get these rooms but there was nothing to see except the neighboring building and mechanical equipment. - Seating around the checkin area is minimal. - Had to pay for Wifi. - Parking was confusing.

The Millennium Knickerbocker is a great place to stay if you want to be close to the shopping on Michigan Avenue, the restaurants on Rush and the tourists spots like The Hancock Building. This hotel is one of the originals and they have managed to keep the elegant, old fashioned feel and yet give you a very contemporary look and amenities. Our room was on the 9th floor and although the space was small, I really felt that the way the space was used made things really comfortable. I loved the fact that this place was quiet...I never heard any noise or activity in the rooms near us and it was completely peaceful at night. The bed was really comfortable with nice linens and pillows. There is a desk for working and they do charge a small fee for internet access. The bathroom was small but luxurious with a European-style hand held shower attachment as well as an overhead rain shower...different but easy to use .A state of the art toilet that you flush by pushing a chrome button on the wall is fun and the sliding pocket doors are a cool touch. On the other side, you have a decent sized closet with an in-room safe. There are 2 TVs- one mounted on the wall in front of the bed and the other in the sitting area. The space doesn't really require 2 but it's a nice touch. The room has a refrigerator that comes as a stocked mini bar and a Keurig coffee maker is included. If you need ice, you need to go up to the 10th floor...I know that's annoying but in older buildings, it's usually the case. You can order room service 24 hours and the first morning I did have breakfast sent up....it was EXPENSIVE for what it was but it was a nice treat and the food was good. This hotel features a really nice bar that seems to stay open pretty late, a coffee shop, fitness room and a spa- unfortunately, I didn't get to check that out but maybe next time !

Upon check-in found out that it was in fact a mini-fridge, but they remedied that by providing 2 at no charge. Restaurant was good and not too outrageuous for a quick bite. Late night bar area and ajoining fireplace room was perfect for group gathering. We brought in truckloads of our own snacks, water, liquor, food etc and they were ok with it all. Would suggest your own cups and plates for a large group as they will consider it catering if you ask for 30 glasses! One other drawback was the single serve coffee-maker, so we brought our own maker and coffee! Yes the lobby is a throwback to a bygone era but that is what adds charm to the hotel. And the location cannot be beat-walking distance to all the excitement of the Gold Coast. Doormen were very helpful and no one hovered with their hand out when you asked for help or advice.

The lobby is nice, clean, with a spacious lounge. There were people at the bar almost every night and at times there was live piano music. The elevators are small and old but they were not super slow...it was not bad. We didn't head to the bar since we ventured out of the hotel for most of the time. We actually didn't even explore the hotel that much since we were gone for most of the time. That being said...we really didn't interact with the bellman/workers etc. because the few times we asked questions one person said that he just moved here and he had no idea of anything & barely spoke English & the concierge \"Henry\" gave us wrong information in regards to the museums. So we were a bit turned off by the staff. Not a big deal because there is always GOOGLE and we did a ton of research before we go to Chicago. We noticed that the staff was always changing, there was hardly any consistency in the faces we saw during our stay...but again that was not important beacuse we did our own thing. This hotel is located at the top of the Magnificent Mile. It is a great location to walk to the beach and to the shopping areas and practically to all of the basic sights like: The Bean, Navy Pier, Lincoln Park, Zoo etc. It is a bit of a treck to the Field Museum but you don't even notice the walk if you are in comfortable shoes because the parks are so beautiful and well manicured. Of course taking a cab is always an option. We took the \"L\" train (blue line) from O'Hare Airport which was about a 40min ride & then a $10 cab ride from the last stop near the hotel instead of walking. Check in was super easy, like 3 mins and Sean was pleasant and friendly. Louis is right around the corner, Bloomingdales and the 900 shops are across the street and Water Tower Place is two blocks away and so is the John Hancock Building...great location! Our room with one king bed was really small but we made it work. The rooms was humid and so the air was on all the time which was a bit noisy. The thermostat was set to 68 but it felt more like 75 in the room. Anyways, the beds were comfy..nothing amazing but our pillows were on the dead side. For the most part the room was clean and I feel like they should provide 2 robes instead of one per room. Rooms had adequate toiletries (which we didn't use) and the mini bar was fully stocked and surprisingly affordable. The downside was that the bathroom/toilet was RIGHT NEXT TO THE BED so you could hear everything going on in the bathroom! Not a fun situation if you were staying with a friend etc. The bathrooms are remodled and the rain shower is a nice touch to add some \"class\" to the decor. Our view was not that great since we booked through a third party site. Ice is on the 7th floor which could get annoying if you have to constantly refill. Room service was adequate. I wish they changed the sheets everyday but in light of going green we didn't mind so much. This is a great location for dining as well. Everything is within walking distance or a short cab ride away. The train lines are very easy to navigate and getting around is a breeze. Of course you have to pay for WiFi in the computer lounge since it is not \"part of the hotel\" but the Apple store is right down the street on Michigan Ave if you need to use a computer.

Saves you from having to have exact cash too which is what they need. No change is given. We went to the art museum, Willis Tower (former Sears Tower) and the White Sox game using the pass.

I am disappointed to say that it did not live up to my expectations. I decided to take the train from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare to the hotel. I called the hotel to see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the easiest train route to the hotel and she told me to get off of at State/Lake stop in the Loop and walk 30 minutes or take a $10 cab ride. I was looking at the map and didn't understand why she would give me such advice. I ended up being adventurous and took the train to Jackson on the Blue Line and transferred to the Red Line to get to Chicago. The walk was still a bit long but much more manageable with 2 pieces of carry-on luggage each. When I got to the hotel, they gave us a room on the second floor, right next to the elevator. You basically just turn left, take one step, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right in front of the room. The view is literally nothing to speak of. I mean, this is the second floor. The second floor is basically for meeting rooms, fitness center, and such. I asked for a room with double bed for 2 people and I was only given one robe. The next day I got two robes but the day following that I only got one. The second day, they only changed out sheets for one of the beds. I don't quite understand why especially there's not much I can do since there's only one card in the room. Am I supposed to rip the card in half to signal \"Change sheets for BOTH beds!\" There's also no consistency. When I checked in, the robe was hung in the closet. The next day, two robes were folded and put on the bed. The following day, one robe was folded and put by the tub. They also did not replenish shower caps, soap bar, and shampoo. When I checked in, it still had the old soap bar probably from the an earlier stay. The third night I was there, there was a storm coming so I wanted to have dinner close by the hotel in case it rained. I went down to the concierge and spoke to Sheryl. She had an air about her that made me feel like I was bothering her. What a way to make guests feel welcomed. I was happy to know when I got to the hotel that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complimentary Internet in the lobby for quick email checking. That was probably the only good thing about the hotel I can think of. However, there's actually no connection in the hotel lobby by the door, you can get that same connection in the room or in the inner lobby of the hotel. Another good thing was the shower. I liked that there was an overhead shower head and a hand held one. It was a massage tub which was good after a full day of walking. Location-wise, I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve chosen a hotel much closer to Streeterville, but I was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153advised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to stay closer to the John Hancock building. Oh well. The Knickerbocker is still a fairly nice area but not as central as I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve liked, I guess. So in all, I think Knickerbocker could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a good hotel for me, but with the room location, the ugly view, and the average upkeep of the room (oh, the lady at check-in told me it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd renovated room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a joke!), Knickerbocker sort of let me down.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cStaff were friendly and helpful,hotel was well located and we will definitely return\u201d", "Author": "judykball", "ReviewID": "UR116035394", "Content": "The hotel is old but the rooms have been refurbished.

The food was also very good and reasonably priced. I got a special conference rate which made this hotel a very good bargain for the area. I have stayed at many similar Chicago hotels that were considerably more expensive. The location was excellent. The hotel is very close to a nice beach as well as Michigan Avenue shopping. For example. the shops right next door included Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Gucci. Macy's Water Tower Place, Saks, and Neiman Marcus are just a couple of blocks away. There is an L station within a few blocks, and, or course, taxis and the bus are available. The business center was great to print out boarding passes or check the internet.

We stayed on the seventh floor which was nice and quiet, and our room (#735) was fantastic, we highly recommend it. The bellhop (Tom) and the concierge (Jeff) were extremely helpful and friendly, they made our stay all that much better. The only downfall if we had choose one, is that since it is an older hotel, the elevators are very slow and small and you do need to be patient.

We did take a few items and they replenished it the next/same day which was a nice touch. There was no tub in our room but the \"Rain\" shower was nice. Room service was great and the bell-hops were so pleasant and helped to give us clear and concise directions. Breakfast was really good. I had the Eggs Benedict with the Spinach and my husband had the Texas cherry chocolate french toast. Our waiter Andre was by far the Most Polite we've met in all our travels. We were saying that if we ran a restaurant, we would offer him a position! The orange granola pancakes we had on another day was so fluffy and sweet. Mmmm. The housekeeping and room service staff were so attentive and were all smiles. They even remembered us and thanked us for the small token/tip we gave them. You almost feel like you've known them for a while. There are a few things to note however. The internet is charged at $9.95 per 24 hrs. What we did not know was that it was PER device. We were charged twice on some days as we were connected to the Internet using our tablet and the occassional phone. So please be careful. We were advised that it is in the hotel terms and conditions so we were obliged. The reception did take 1 internet charge off the first night. Secondly, we ordered room service at around 1025pm one night and we were advised that we could only order from the late-night menu. It clearly states that the late night menu is from 1045pm. There were only 4 things to choose from, one of which was a cheesecake and there were nothing fish/vegetarian. We decided to skip it altogether. The John Hancock centre is located on the next block along with Jamba Juice or a beautiful Italian cafe/bistro L'Appetito for a quick breakfast. There is also the cheesecake factory for the little indulgence late night.

Instead us Brits and my Chinese colleague had to put up with scowls and service ranging from poor to disgraceful . This was most unlike all other hotels visited in Chicago and the rest of the USA. This continued for a couple of nights, in the end, we took our business elsewhere. On our last night we noticed on our way back into the hotel that David was not on duty, so gingerly ventured into the bar again. What a shock, the other bar staff were lovely, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough for us and took the time to come and speak to us for over 15mins.

The rooms are a little small, even the King Superior (which we paid $140/night). We upgraded from the King Standard because the rooms looked small online, but the Superior room was more like a standard room at most other hotels. So, it's a good price compared to other hotels in the area, but don't expect a large room for that price. The rooms are really nice and recently upgraded. Unfortunately, there is no free wi-fi, but I guess that's to be expected since it's less expensive. There's a nice lounge area on the first floor with a great drink selection. The main restaurant in the hotel is only open for breakfast and lunch, but I think the bar/lounge serves food at night. Just an FYI, Valet parking at the hotel was $53/night.

The hotel had a Fall promotion going on with really good rates. The purpose was to have some fun and to get out of the heat of South Florida. No problems with reservations or check-in. Front desk was very friendly and with no line ahead of us, it took only 5-minutes to get to our room on the 12th floor. I have not stayed at the Knickerbocker before, so I cannot compare it to the past. The property is older, but has been modernized with very comfortable beds, flat screen TV's and a huge showerhead ! Everything in the room worked fine. The rooms are not too big, but certainly functional enough to suit my needs. The Concerige's were terrific with giving directions, advice and reservations. BTW, for anyone that is very critical of hotel attitude, try loosening up your purse ! When a Conceirge gets you into a name restaurant , club, cruise, or what have you...$how some gratitude. A $10 or $20 can mean the difference of getting to do something on short notice, or sitting it out. Besides, you are there to have fun, don't cheap out. We ate at the hotel cafe for breakfest; \"Nix\" just off the lobby. They offered a buffet for $18 and it was excellent. Juice, coffee, pasteries, eggs, french toast, bacon & saussage, fruit, all very tasty ! Lastly, after an amazing steak dinner in town, we came back for a nightcap at the hotel bar. Cut up with the bartenders and several patrons around the bar. Nice ensemble playing too. All in all, and fantastic stay. Here's my bottom line. You can stay at newer property with far bigger rooms in Chicago. To me, the whole purpose was to have a nice room with a place to stash my shopping until we left.

All the staff in the lobby -- doormen, behind the front desk, the folks helping with bags -- had very poor guest interaction skills. No real greetings or smiles, and didn't make much of an effort to help when I had questions. I mentioned this to my husband when I returned home and he said \"so what? Do you really need very friendly staff?\" The answer is no, I don't need them, but it would have made the stay more memorable. When I return to that area of Chicago, I'll definitely try a different hotel, because the niceties of good customer service do make an impression, and make a difference.

The check in process was efficient and the front desk person was polite. We were located on the 12th floor facing Walton St. and did not have much of a view, but that was not really a concern for us. The room itself was clean and the size was what we would expect for a hotel room in the downtown area of any city. There was a fully stocked mini-bar with a compliment of snacks and things that you may need - small first aid kit, cork screw, shaving cream etc. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable which ensured a fantastic night sleep each and every night. The bathroom was appropriately sized for the room and featured a stand up shower. Other reviews have indicated that the over head rain shower head did not have much pressure - we found this to be true as well but not a detriment. The hand held nozzle more than made up for it. The only criticism we had for the bathroom was that the toilet was too high off the floor and did not make for a very comfortable experience! LOL! This may not effect all people but I can say that one of us is 5'4 and the other is 6'0 and both of us were not exactly comfortable - but really, just how much time are you gonna spend there anyway! The air conditioning in the room worked very well to cool the room, but it was a damp cold. The location was close walking distance to Michigan Avenue though it is at the North end of the street. You walk the whole 'Mag Mile' to get places. Those who would wish to lessen the walking distance would perhaps like to stay somewhere in the middle. We enjoyed the location and loved having access to Old Town where there are plenty of interesting restaurants and unique shops. We did the Chicago Food Planet - the Near North tour, which was a guided food tour of Chicago neighbourhoods. The walking tour was about 3 hours in duration and led us to areas that we may not have found otherwise. Favourite stops were to a spice shop and an olive oil shop. If we had to state a criticism about this tour, I guess it would be that the tour does not end where it starts. You are left to find your way back which is a couple of miles from where your hotel is likely located. The day we took the tour it was extremely hot and humid. We took a cab back to the shops we wanted to buy things at and then walked back to the hotel. We also did a segway tour and architectural boat tour which were a fantastic way learn about the city.

My husband and I have both traveled extensively for both business and pleasure. We always thoroughly research hotels and the knickerbocker had some great reviews. Because we were in town with a conference, my secretary booked through the conference travel office. There was some miscommunication about the package and room type we had requested. We got into town after driving all night and the first thing they told us was that we couldn't get into our room until 3pm even though we had already paid to check in the night before. After much argument, they \"found\" a room for us to get into immediately. She also said that we had reserved two doubles and we said that no, we had actually asked for a king room and they agreed to check us in but not at the rate we had been quoted. We finally agreed to the higher rate because we were exhausted and were running late to a meeting. I then asked about a sleeper sofa because I had my two young children with me and was told no, that the room with the king bed did not have a sleeper sofa. We asked for a rollaway and they agreed to bring it up. When we got to the room, the four of us could barely get in the door and I still do not know where they were planning to put the rollaway bed. It was the tiniest room I have ever seen.The bellman apologized and offered to go talk to the desk for us. This began a game of good cop bad cop between the bellman and the front desk \"manager\" She was the worst. She also insisted to me that she had no boss, she was the end all be all and that I was not permitted to speak to anyone else. She told us that we could fit better in a room with two double beds so we said fine that we would take the two doubles. At that point, we went back to the not getting in until 3pm argument. The story changed at this point and the woman told us that since we reserved a king room, we'd have to wait. When I pointed out that she was just plain lying, and asked to pay extra for a suite, just trying to get into a room, she suddenly \"found\" a room for us and let us check in. So we get to the room and the rooms are the most overpriced, underquality that I have EVER seen. There are no tubs, they get only about ten channels (most of them sports) and they charge extra for a fridge. They don't even have Nickelodeon. Do not ever stay here with kids! The recent redo was done by an architect with absolutely no commen sense apparently because the details are wrong. For example, you cannot reach the knob to turn on the shower without getting drenched by the cold water. We had to get our own ice, which is not something you expect in a hotel like this. Then the stuff that didn't work list was just a mile long...The hair dryer, the alarm clock, the air conditioner, tv remote...it went on and on. The view was of part of the roof. One of the lights in the room would not turn off. And there are no dresser drawers in the room at all. No room service and the concierge was not even remotely helpful. I asked about the shuttle to our conference and he had no idea but as he walked away I saw the poster with the times sitting on the floor behind his desk. Add to all of this that they did construction all day and the music from the wedding receptions downstairs blared long into the night (even though we were on the fourth floor). We had friends stay down the street and pay half what we paid but have a phenomenal experience. I will NEVER go near this hotel again.

I would not come back for all the reasons I stated and also would like to add there is nothing for a family to do here nothing. One Plus was I did like the food at the NIX and the service was excellent there as well", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cDo not recommend\u201d", "Author": "Travellllllller", "ReviewID": "UR56767665", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 days in Feb. My mother had stayed here 2 yrs ago and liked it. However, apparently it has gone downhill since then. Cheap generic toiletries, which I would not expect, as this hotel is not cheap. A bath so small and shallow it served absolutely no purpose - you certainly couldn't have a bath in it. Very weak shower. A charge of USD 1.25 'connection fee' levied on a free 1800 call. There had been Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room 2 yrs ago, but that is gone - now just standard hotel coffee. We were originally put in a room with an adjoining door - we could hear the guest next door very clearly through the non-soundproofed door. We asked to change and were given a quieter room, but am not sure why we were placed in a noisy room to begin with. Housekeep did not replenish our toiletries after our first night, nor did they clean a spillage that had been there when we arrived. Housekeeping were also very noisy outside our bedroom and woke us up both mornings. On the plus side, the beds were comfortable and the location is good. Generally, I feel this hotel is very overpriced for what it offers. I had stayed for 2 nights at the Courtyard Marriott Magnificent Mile the week before, and although it was much cheaper than MK, it offered much more - nice toiletries, big, quiet room, and excellent breakfast included in rate. I believe there are far better hotels available in Chicago for the rate that MK charges, or indeed for less.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cMillennium Knickerbocker Hotel (Chicago) exceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "phxbassman", "ReviewID": "UR55127410", "Content": "My girlfriend & I had an excellent experience at the Millennium Knickerbockers Hotel in Chicago.

The only complaint I had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. When we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. The issue was corrected, though, and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay. The hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. Very cute. Their late night menu, however, is lacking. It would have been nice to see some soup on there. That being said, I RARELY order from room service when on vacation, so I really don't see that being a big deal.

I frequently use TripAdvisor.com to research and plan my trips, and this is how I found out about the Millenium Knickerbocker. We stayed for 4 nights, which reduced the price per night due to an online hotel promotion. We are normally budget hotel frequenters (i.e. Hampton Inn). I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. 1. Accomodations: we booked a superior king (which is a corner room). When asked to upgrade to a room with a view, they gave us a street view of East Walton Street (where the hotel front faces). Although disappointed at first, we loved the room. There's enough space for two people and we experienced no outdoor noise from the street. It is a small one-way street so there's not a lot of thru-traffic. The bed is very comfy, the modern decor is funky and the bathroom is cool with the big shower stall and rainfall shower-head. It felt like I was in a spa bathroom. 2. Service: everybody was extremely helpful. I read a Frommer's Chicago city guide book cover to cover before arriving, but we also relied heavily on the concierge staff for many suggestions. Les and his staff were fabulous! They are so knowledgeable about the city - all the restaurants suggested were excellent and their sight-seeing tips were so helpful. Tjhey secured us reservations for places that weren't in my little guide book and we loved them! If you don't know Chicago, use their hotel concierge service for suggestions. 3. Location: the hotel is located on the northern end of Michigan Avenue, but it seemed so close to everything. On a nice day, you can walk the Miracle Mile down to Grant Park or the Chicago River in 20 minutes. You are near so many restaurants and shopping, all within walking distance. The Hancock Observatory is 1 block away (all the locals said to go there instead of the Sears Tower). We did not rent a car (the price is high for parking at the hotel or basically any hotel) and just cabbed or walked everywhere - so worth it. 4. Drawbacks: their restaurant menu (and room service) are a bit pricey for me. The food was good but I would prefer going someplace nearby for breakfast instead of dining in. You will always read good and bad reviews based on personal experience, but ours was nothing but excellent.

This turned out to be very convenient because we started off each day with a good meal and it saved us the time of trying to decide where to go to eat each morning. The food selection was very good. On the weekend, a buffet with cold cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, hot foods (eggs, bacon, sausage, potatos, pancakes, french toast), an assortment of breads, muffins, pastries, bagels; Juices, coffee, tea. If you forego the buffet, their breakfast menu offers a wide selection: fresh fruits, breads, eggs (any style) including omelettes and benedicts, waffles, pancakes, a la carte items. The hotel is conveniently located just off of Michigan Avenue, the Mag Mile! In the other direction, just two blocks away is Lake Shore Drive with a great view of the Lake, Navy Pier, beautiful homes. My traveling companions found the room to be small (Superior with double beds), but I found it to be fine. We were so beat by the end of the day that we watched some TV and crashed. Bathroom was modern and well stocked with lots of towels, soap, shampoo, lotion. Had drinks in the lobby bar (pricey, but that's true in any nice hotel in a big city) and the bartender, David, was good company. One member of our party ate in the bar the first night of our arrival (it was already late) and she said the food was very good (grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup). As for our trip: We rented a car upon arrival at MDW to see some of the outlying sites (my family's roots in Humboldt Park and Logan Square) and Hot Doug's, 3324 N. California Ave (famous Chicago hot dogs). We arrived well after the lunch crowd (it was like 3pm on Friday) and we still had to wait over one hour. It was worth it! The line snaked around the building and down the block, but people were friendly, passed a menu around, made recommendations. They only have their fries (in duck grease) on Fri & Sat -- GOOD EATS! We returned the rental car to MDW that first night (didn't want to pay for parking in the City) and took the EL back to the hotel (orange, transfer to red) -- very easy. We purchased a 2-day GO card which allowed us into the Hancock Bldg, Sears Tower, River Cruise, Skyline Lake Cruise, Navy Pier, on-off trolley. The card gets you into many other places, including museums, but we ran out of time. We had Chicago Pizza at Gino's East (on Superior, I think). One night we cabbed it to a place called Sola (a great neighborhood joint in Lincoln Park, very popular as the place was packed by the time we left). En route, we drove by Wrigley Field!

They remodeled the rooms very nicely. Frette sheets and the bathrooms are very nice. The rooms are small but this usually is the case in most big cities. I stay in Chicago a lot. I got a good deal for four nights last week on Hotel.com. I paid $200 per/night and considering that there was a Restaurant Convention in town (100,000+ people) I paid a very fair rate. Most of the staff were great. We did encounter one night manager that sported a bit of attitude the couple of nights that we went to ask a question or for a late check out. She is really not too friendly. I would say that this hotel is worth the money if you are paying in the $150-$225 range. If you were to pay anything above this amount for a room (I think that their rack rate is $450), then I don't think that you'd be very happy. This is a nice hotel but this is no Westin, Four Seasons etc. The rooms have no views except for the front of the Drake or the back of the Westin. I was a little suspicious of the previous reviews regarding the A/C system. We had no problems on the first 3 nights. On our last night we walked into a really, really, hot, muggy and humid room. We called down to complain and the front desk said that the A/C system automatically turns off when the outside temp is lower than 50 degrees. They said that there was nothing that they could do but suggested that we \"open our window\" to let in the cold air. They also offered a \"fan\" for the room which they would send up to us upon request. Personally, I think that the hotel needs to rethink their A/C system policy. Its crazy to think that in a modern hotel that the A/C system wouldn't work if its cold outside. I've stayed at motels that offer the guest to operate heat and/or air independantely if and when its desired. That is my one big complaint. This hotel is not worth more than $225 per/night.

The hotel said they couldn't switch the billing since it was prepaid and made us pay for a different room and collect for the first room from the other family members who were given the room. It was way too confusing. The rooms were small, but the beds were comfortable. The rooms were all hot and at 75 degrees they were very uncomfortable. The controls in the room didn't run the A/C, we could only get more heat. It was 75 outside when we arrived.

There was also no restaurant for lunch or dinner. You could order food at the lobby bar during the day, but no room service was available until after 6PM. Families with small children were out of luck for lunch, unless they went off premise. But most of the people went to the church wedding at 1:00 and expected to come back for lunch. Those with children planned on ordering room service and having the kids take naps. The lobby bar was very crowded and had only 1 bartender to serve drinks and take food orders. The bartender was not in a very good mood. Someone from our group complained about the service and some managers did come out to help with food orders. But the service was a little slow. This was not good planning on the part of the hotel. If they're trying to bring in big weddings with out-of-town guests, they're going to have to do better with overall service. The wedding was very nice and the food was good. The hotel was recently renovated, but they must not have worked on the ventilation.

I typically stay at large hotel chains when visiting Chicago so this was a sweet surprise to me. First of all parking is always absurd in downtown.

The concierge was quite accommodating in directing us to last minute dinner plans on a Friday night. But wait, there's the hotel itself. Wow, it is an architectural beauty. The lobby was quite inviting and the conference room was just gorgeous. I loved that the hotel rooms were modern in their amenities yet homey and comfy with the lighting and decor.

Several nice restaurants close by, all the shopping you desire, and Hancock building right next door. While I was in town for a conference, I had plenty of time to do/ see all that I wanted.

You can also walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art. I recommend the Cape Cod Room in the Drake Hotel across the street as a dining splurge; cheap but fun options include Foodlife in Water Tower Place (a sort of new age, upscale food court), the Italian deli at the base of the John Hancock building, and Espression Lavazza, an ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS European coffee house with locations in the Drake and at the John Hancock Observatory (the quiche is absolutely to die for--go here and pretend you are vacationing in Italy!).

Amenities are Gilchrist and Soames toiletries (no body lotion, just shampoo and conditioner) with Starbucks coffee and Twinings tea for the coffee maker. The bed was very comfy and the rooms are equipped with giant flat screen tvs and a basic cable lineup plus HBO. The drawbacks were as follows: 1)while cozy for one night, the king rooms are very small and I would think they would feel cramped for travelers staying for longer periods; 2)while the desk clerk was polite at check in, I did feel we got a bit of second class treatment at Priceline customers--all of the other guests on our floor were given complimentary newspapers but we did not receive one, and this is the first time I've experienced this kind of snub in a long history as a Priceliner; 3)I don't think families with children would really enjoy this hotel, because it has no pool and it is clearly geared towards a more mature clientele.

I made a reservation, so upon arrival I was quickly checked in and whisked to my room in record time. The room was small (most in the city are) but extremely well appointed and totally comfortable.

Had I known how disgusting the Knickerbocker truly is, I never would have done so. The room had hair ALL OVER. Dangling from the lamps, in the bath tub, in the sink and god only knows what was there that I could not see. The room was small, which was not a big deal. The fact that you had to go sideways into the bathroom because a bed was in the doorway was a little annoying. The whole room was shabby, the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling (and again had hair stuck to it). The toilet was hard to flush.. the bedding was very tattered and the pillows had lost all their fringe (and yes, I threw those things off as fast as possible. they just looked like they harbored bacteria).

We had a king room on the 6th floor at the end of the hallway with a view of the Westin and roof of the neighboring building. So, no view. The room was tiny with the woodwork painted over and over, and it was cracked and peeling. We agree with what others have written about the temperature. It was either hot or cold. Then there was the bathroom. Cheap, small, and smelly. It had a musty smell. There was nothing luxurious about the bathroom either. Cheap fixtures and tile work. Scratchy towels. The linens on the bed were okay but not of 4 star quality. I would rate this hotel a 2 star. It is not as nice as some Super 8 rooms I have stayed in while on the road traveling. The elevators are old and also in need of remodeling. The help was less than helpful. Basically, the help ingored the guests. I used the fitness room, and it had everything that is needed for a good workout. However, all the machines were crammed into a hotel size room. Then there is no pool or whirlpool. They offer those 6 blocks south of the hotel. Who wants to venture out in cold weather to walk that far in the cold? On the positive side, it has a great location! We did have a great weekend taking in shows, restaurants, and the Bears game. Go Bears! Priceline, Please take this off your 4 start list!!!!! We have used Priceline for most of our stays in Chicago and were terribly disappointed this time. This hotel lacks the amenities and features of a 4 star hotel.

The elevator is conveniently located right next to the check-in. Upon getting to my room and getting situated I noticed a slight problem. I called the front desk and within two minutes one of the front desk personnel was in my room (I believe it was the manager). There was no question from him other than...... \"what can I do to make you happy?\" I stated that I wanted to stay at the hotel and try another room. He immediately went to find another room; checking the room first to make sure it was perfect. I cannot express how satisfied I was with the concern that he quickly had shown to me and how fast he worked to find another room. The room was not only beautiful but clean and very comfortable. The great things about the rooms and hotel are: **** Beautiful furnishings **** Comfortable beds **** Beautiful lighting and mirrors **** Quaint bathroom with high end shampoo and soaps **** Fast room service - including all night service **** Great housekeeping **** High end linens and pillows **** Location..location..location.. **** Friendly staff and hard working bellman and valets If there is any down sides at all it would be: **** Expensive valet parking - $44.00 per day **** No Menu for children Overall I will stay at the Knickerbocker every time I am in Chicago for either business or pleasure; with or without the children. Checking hotel websites the prices are very reasonable for this type of hotel. Before this hotel I would normally take my changes on Priceline or Hotwire; but now I would rather spend a few extra dollars and have peace of mind on knowing I will be totally satisfied with my hotel.

I knew it would be a bit difficult to see many sites so I was enthused about a great hotel. I read reviews, but remained positive that it would be good. Heck, a hotel you are paying $300 a night for must be nice. The day before I flew in I called the hotel as the travel agent didn't book a smoking room. I was told that the couldn't arrange it for the first night and that all smoking rooms for the remaining nights were on the convention level and it would be loud during the day. That didn't bode well as I was working a night shift so I opted for a non-smoking room. When I checked in my room was ready early. The lobby is outstanding and the Martini bar quite neat. The Nyx restaraunt is immaculate looking though I was never back early enough to eat there. There was a faint odor in the hallways, but it wasn't in my room. I found a double bed arrangement instead of the requested king. Dropped my bags and headed to work. After work I was excited to sit down and have a drink at the neat little martini bar....it closed at 12:30. The bartender Floyd was wonderful despite not being able to serve me. He gave me directions to a 4am bar so I hung out there the next few days. Upon returning to my room I unpacked my laptop and couldn't find a wireless signal (the internet usage directions were hidden under the phone). Called the desk and was told that I would have to purchase a LAN cable out of the wet bar for $7, and be charged $10 per 24 hours for internat usage. I was stewing now so I inspected the room a bit. Yes, it was tiny and I could understand that. The lighting was dim at night. The TV didn't pull out far enough to have a good angle to the desk for when I was working on my computer. The closet was small and had a small as well as the restroom but the shower was nice though. Limited space all around. The comfotors were VERY worn and had holes in them. Explaining the problems to the front desk, they agreed to comp the cable. I asked them to be sure no one woke me up and to have room service after 3:30pm. I was awoken at 1pm by the room service people that had or should have had contrary orders. The comforters were not changed my entire trip there. On check out they didn't charge me for internet usage for my stay. This place isn't terrible, but is is not worth $300 a night.

But if you expect a 4 star experience you'll need to go somewhere else. We booked through Priceline - got an OK rate: $110/night. I see others have gotten rooms here for less. After booking we called the hotel and requested 2 beds. We confirmed again 2 days before we got there. We got into the room and found a King bed. The person at the other end of the phone when we called down to question the room told us that booking through Priceline only gives you the option to \"request\" 2 beds - apparently calling twice and confirming 2 beds means nothing. We were told there were no other rooms available. The woman I spoke to wasn't pleasant at all - very surprising for a supposedly 4-star, customer-friendly hotel. It was obvious she had a bias against Priceline customers. The bellman (very friendly and sympathetic) suggested getting a roll-away - but there would be an add'l charge. We declined since there was absolutely no room for it. The rooms here are \"old world\" small, by the way. Cozy and cute but not a place to hang out (but then you're in Chicago so why would you spend more time in your room than you have to?). There are no dressers - only small drawers in the desk. We kept things in the suitcase. The room comes with a single-serving coffee maker. But check that you actually have more than one serving if there are 2 or more in the room. We called for more coffee and it was promptly delivered. No free phone calls - charges are by the minute. No free internet access. No views to speak of but the street is fairly quiet. Now about the bathrooms... Who designed these?!?!? They're small - VERY small. Just to close the door I had to turn sideways. The toilet was nearly flush against the wall. The bathtub was narrow and I kept bumping into the soapdish placed at shoulder height. No fan. They provide the usual soaps, shampoos, etc. but if you bring your own you won't have much shelf space. The next morning we asked at the front desk about availability of a room with 2 beds. They had one - and apparently had one the night before. We asked them to call us if they had a cancellation but got no call. It would appear they hold these rooms for off-the-street customers and force Priceline customers to take the one bed rooms. We called for a bellman to help move us to the new room. After 20 minutes of waiting we moved ourselves. The room was very similar to the old room except there was no easy chair (the better to fit 2 double beds in the room). The bathroom was nearly identical - by which I mean still small. The saving grace was that the door was on a different wall and there was more room to maneuver going in and out. I still can't get over the narrowness of the toilet and shower. Aside from the woman on the phone the first night (we stayed 4 nights), everyone we came in contact with was pleasant. We ate out so can't rate the restaurant in the hotel. The martini bar is right inside the front door and didn't seem to have too much business any of the nights we were there. If you use the valet parking be sure to call down at least 15 minutes before you want to leave. Cars are parked on another block and it can take that long for someone to run to the car and get back through traffic. Check that housekeeping left you enough coffee every day - they didn't always - we had to call for more twice. Our rooms weren't in bad shape - perhaps the renovations are working their way up as we were on the 5th and 3rd floors. But the room renovations aren't up to the standard I expected for a 4 star hotel. The finish - molding, wallpaper seams, caulking in the bathroom - was noticably un-finished. Bottom sheets on the beds didn't cover the ends of the mattress. My companion missed the trash can one night and was too tired to pick up his small piece of trash. It was still on the floor the next day when we returned to our room. Overall, we were very disappointed with the experience. We knew we were getting smallish rooms but the pictures we saw made them look bigger. If you absolutely have to stay in the north loop and are on a budget and are thin you might find a bargain here.

We've used Priceline several times before (always indicating that we want a \"4-star\" hotel). In all prior bookings, we've been very satisfied. Not so this time. The Millennium Knickerbocker is listed as a 4-star hotel by AAA, and has been for years. While some of the reviews below indicate a significantly poorer experience than was ours, I am astounded that this hotel would receive AAA's 4-star rating. It is simply inappropriate. The hotel is a historic facility, dating back to the Prohibition Era shennanigans in Chicago - allegedly the Knickerbocker hosted a number of famous gangsters back in the day. And you see the old-style charm of the place in some of it's external and internal details. The lobby is not a massive affair by modern standards, but was likely quite exceptional in its day. There is a nice bar to your right as you walk into the lobby, and a small but nicely appointed restaurant to the left. The registration desk and concierge desk are very small but are staffed by friendly and helpful people. In fact, the one thing that the Millennium Knickerbocker has going for it is the friendliness/helpfullness of its staff. We had many engaging conversations with staff during our 24 hour stay, and found them to be the saving grace during our stay there. However, the facilities and amenities are substandard by any interpretation - at least for a 4, or even 3 star rating. As mentioned by other reviews below, the rooms are small. But they also are in moderate to poor states of repair. Upon closer inspection, our floors and bed linens appeared to be clean - but the condition of the wall coverings, bed coverings, carpet, woodwork, and tile in the hallways and rooms makes you think that they are not clean. In our limited experience, they ARE clean - just in poor condition. The bed cover was snagged in many places and had a cigarette burn hole. The wall paper was not well applied, and seams were raised in many places. The desk chair was a faux velvet covered affair, and the material had many gouges and was very distressed appearing. The wood desk was also gouged in several places. The woodwork was painted, but appeared to be the last of MANY coats of paint - the finish was VERY lumpy/drippy/wavy. Once the bed cover was pulled off the bed, the bed linens seemed to be relatively new and clean. The bathroom was quite small. The tile was in poor condition, with the grout cracked and stained in many places. The joints where the tiled walls met the floor were in bad condition, with gaps in the grout and stains. This was NOT a room in which it was easy to be comfortable. The hallways were in the same state of repair (clean, but very worn looking). Unlike other reviewers, we detected no foul odors. The hotel is situated in a very convenient location for people wishing to explore the River North/Michigan/Rush St. areas in downtown Chicago. It is across the street from the Drake Hotel, and one block north of the Hancock Tower. And you might say that we shouldn't complain having paid only $69 for our room. However, we've paid that and much less for far nicer hotels, ones appropriately designated as 3 or 4 stars by the AAA., via Priceline and Hotwire. I would certainly have been very upset had I paid rack rate for this room. Also, internet access is quite expensive in my opinion ($13 per night); and there are no complimentary ethernet cables - if you don't travel with one, you must purchase one for $6 thru the mini-bar. Not an unheard-of practice in my experience, but not a pleasant one either. I'd steer clear of this hotel unless rooms are full in your preferred hotels in the area. It is adequate, in that it is clean and staffed by very helpful folks. But it will NOT be the sort of hotel experience you expect from a 3 or 4 star hotel.", "Date": "February 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hattiesburg, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel stay\u201d", "Author": "sparklejoy2", "ReviewID": "UR6731782", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Knickerbocker for a conference. I have to admit i was worried about some of the reviews on here, but the hotel was fine. I will say that i dont understand why the hotel is 4 star either, and had it been money out of my own pocket, i might have choosen a different hotel. But overall i had an average hotel stay. Here's a breakdown of my experience Check in: due to a change in flight schedule i actually arrived at the hotel around 11AM. I had planned to just store my luggage and do some shopping, but they had a room ready early which was unexpected. Another unexpected was a 50 dollar per day hold placed on your credit card for charges to the mini bar and room service. I was able to get them to waive this for me, because i was traveling on a pre-paid business card and was unaware of this fee. The clerk entered me as a cash paying customer so that i couldnt make room charges, which was fine with me. I wish they would make you aware of this at check in... if you dont know about it ahead of time that can take a big chunk out of your travel budget!!!!!!!! Staff: Excellent, prompt service, very helpful! Location: Right across the street from the Drake, convient to lots of shopping and restaurants on the Mag Mile. However it is towards the end of the mile where a hotel in the middle of the mile might be more convient. Room: On the small side, but very clean and pleasent. Decorations were a bit on the girly side, but being a girl, i enjoyed them! The bed and pillows were extremely comfy. I had to refrain from taking the large pillow home with me! :) My room was close to the elevator, but this was not really a nusiance of any kind. There was one night when the noise outside was bothersome, but i guess that would be the case with any hotel in a larger city. Coffee maker and plenty of glasses provided. The only fridge is the mini bar, no where to keep leftovers. Bathroom: By far the smallest bathroom i have ever seen! The edge of the sink literally hung over the bathtub. And the tiny shelves provided no storage room. But the bathroom was very clean, no mold or mildew. I have seen several people post that they only had a shower, but the bathtub I had a was a deep garden tub and very nice. Water pressure for the shower was great with plenty of hot water. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom, but didnt work very well. The towels were a good size but very scratchy. For female travelers, i wouldnt plan on using the soap or shampoo provided by the hotel... they are very manly smelling. i found it funny that the rooms were all decorated girly and the toilitries provided were clearly for a man!", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cEeeewww and Yuck !\u201d", "Author": "Unbiased&FairAdvisor", "ReviewID": "UR6705768", "Content": "4-star ??!?

We parked the car and walked everywhere. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and willing to hail us a cab, give us directions, suggest places to eat.

I have to tell you, honestly, this is not the Hilton. I travel to Chicago 6-8 times a year for work and I've had the luxury of trying out many of Chicago's finest. First off, I checked in around 9pm. The doorman pretty much tripped over himself to open the door for me. As he was opening it, the bellman was right there welcoming me to the Knickerbocker and to take my luggage. He swept me over to the check-in desk and stayed neaby until I was finished. The woman at the check-in desk was so helpful and cheerful. It wouldn't surprise me if she owns the Hotel the way she was so willing to help and make my stay as enjoyable as possible. After a quick check-in and being taken to my room, the bellman went in first and turned on every light, showed me the mini-bar, TV, and made sure nothing was missing or what I didn't want. I stayed in room 316, smoking, king with a tub. I did request a tub at checkin and was told the hotel is looking to do away with all tubs in the next remodel. The front desk said if I find there isn't a tub in my room to call and they will put me in a room that had one. Decor of the room is a little dated, but comfortable. I personally like the canopy over the bed, but not the old mirror - maybe if it was newer or clear. Keep in mind this hotel was not built last year, but it's still charming. No problems with the bed. I have a really bad back, and most of the time I'm waking up in pain when staying in hotels, but not here. I have bad allergies to mold, but I'm not having problems here. I always bring a candle when I travel, I smoke, and the room did have a musty smoke odor. I can see a bit of the lake through the Drake. Didn't hear anyone next door, you will hear doors slamming from other guests, but again, you have that in most hotels. Bottom line, this may not be the most up to date hotel, but the service I got more than makes up for it. The people here really make this hotel what it is. Some of the reviews make it seem like this is a hotel you'd find in a third world country - it's not that bad.

As everyone else has stated, the location is great. I got this hotel through Priceline at a pretty resonable rate, and was impressed when I first walked into the lobby. It was very nicely decorated, and not at all smokey like some reviewers have stated. However...since I arrived early, my room was not ready. So the bellhop checked my bags, and the girl behind the counter said she had \"pre-registered\" me. This meant I could go off to the convention I was in town for, and when I got back, there would be no paperwork to do. I could just get my keys and go with no problem. So, later that night I came back and the new girl behind the desk had no record of my pre-registration. Apparently, the first girl had not done what she'd said she had. As a result, there was absolutely no rooms available in the hotel. Someone from the back office came out and explained the situation. He was very nice and apologetic. They gave me cab fare for 2 days, and sent me over to the Whitehall. (which was FABULOUS by the way!) The hotel covered all our bills which was cool since the suite they put us in at the Whitehall was 3 times the price of our Priceline room. Anyway, the next day we came back. The manager was there. He apologized all over the place, did some major groveling, and gave us an upgraded room. After we were all checked in we received a phone call from the concierge making sure everything was ok and acceptable. They even sent up an apology note to us that night. The room itself was nicely decorated, but a bit worn. It wasn't horrible. The only gripe I had was that our toilet wouldn't flush! We asked to have it fixed, and were told it had been while we were out for the day, but it wasn't. Big inconvenience, and kind of gross.

We used a lot of the space because we were attending a wedding there and every room and venue we used was just right.

Not large, but bigger than others I've had in Chicago and nicely decorated. Not worn or frayed at all. The mini fridge even had a tiny cubby that I could have put a small snadwich or drink in, had I wanted.

I was preparing my friend for the worst and we both were pleasantly surprised. Location- Fabulous! North end of the Magnificient Mile and South End of the Gold Coast. 1 block from Michigan Avenue(and Bloomingdale's!!) and away from all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue. Room- small, but very nicely done. AC worked just fine. Beds were very comfortable and the canopies over them were a nice touch. The bathroom is small. If there are more than 2 people in your party, try the next larger room or a newer hotel. This is an older, European designed hotel, which means small rooms and bathrooms. Let's face it--if you want to live in the hotel room all day, you might want to go somewhere else. But for us, it held plenty of shopping bags just fine! Our room had a view of Walton Street. We heard minimal street noises and nothing from our neighbors. Lobby- During the day, the smoke smell was undetectable; but later in the evening, you could smell the smoke. Just walk fast to the elevators!!! Check In/Check Out- A breeze!! Concierge- One was absolutely no help whatsoever!! We asked him his favorite restaurants in the area and his response was \"I like what my hotel guests like!\" The second one was more helpful. Doormen- In both arriving and departing, they barely acknowledged that we were there. We rolled our own suitcases in and out and opened our own doors. I gave the Knickerbocker 4 stars (I would have truly given it 3 1/2 stars if they would have let me) for the great location, clean rooms, nice beds and the decent price we paid for it. Compared to other European hotels that I stayed in, the Knickerbocker is quite quaint! If your are looking for modern decor and big rooms and bathrooms, I'd advise looking somewhere else.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLocation... nothing else\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4072257", "Content": "Stayed at the Millennium 10-25-05.

The Knickerbocker is an OLD hotel. It has some mildew, it doesn't smell new. BUT!!! If you like old hotels, the Knickerbocker is a gem. Be sure to check out the ballroom on the first floor. It is BEAUTIFUL!!! Let's face it. If there is no casino attached to a hotel anymore, they just cannot build them like the Knickerbocker. Look at the details....the Lobby ceiling, the beautiful mailbox... Bear in mind as you walk around the hotel that this place was a favorite of Capone and his cronies. It will put a special aura on your visit. Everyone I encountered was wonderful.. The cute guy at the desk from New Zealand who told me all the best places in New Zealand....the great bellman from Chicago who had such an exuberant attitude (and who kept calling me \"young lady\"... it was contagious, to Andre at Nix who was so enthusiastic about his work that he made me enjoy my lunch twice as much. The concierge genuinely tried to be helpful. I've stayed in a lot of hotels. Sometimes a concierge has \"airs\". This young gentleman was just plain helpful. Much appreciated. This is a great staff. Not a snob among them. Just enthusiastic and pleasant. I ordered room service three times. Twice it was perfect. I even received hot and crispy french fries with a sandwich. That is good service. Fries just don't stay good unless they are eaten fresh. The lunch I ordered took over 45 minutes and I had to leave before it got there. I was disappointed because I had told the lady who took my order that I had to get to a meeting and wondered what she could suggest that would arrive in 20 minutes. I also ordered a chicken pasta dish that was excellent. There is also a CheeseCake Factory virtually in the next block that had great carry out. The room itself was lovely. The lovely Chinese armoire with the mini bar was really pretty as were the linens and canopy on the bed. I was by myself and felt perfectly comfortable. If you are traveling as a couple, I might suggest a larger room. The bathroom is small as other travelers have noted. But it had plenty of outlets and was just fine. And it was clean. Really clean. Even around the baseboards of the bathroom. If you have allergies (and I do), you might have some trouble here, as I do in ALL old hotels. I just kept my migraine medicine handy and I was fine. If you are going to complain about mold in old buildings stay out of them. They all have it. Get a grip. I was within a block of Bloomingdales and the John Hancock Building. Lord and Taylor and Marshall Fields were within 5 blocks, Filene's was across the street from that. Nordstroms was a little further down Michigan avenue. Younger people may want to cross over Michigan and head to State Street...there is an Urban Outfitters that direction. As always, it was great to return to my hometown of Indianapolis.

They were chatting on the phone the entire time I was there, and I could tell it was a personal call. They didn't even get off the phone while I paid. The concierge desk was also mediocre service, willing to answer questions, but not going beyond the call of duty. This is all fine, if I was told upfront this was a 3 star hotel, but they continue to advertise the Knickerbocker as a 4 star. When I see 4 stars, I expect 4 stars ... and that they did not live up to. The rooms were very small, we requested 2 queen sized beds, but they only have 2 full size beds. So we took it! Furniture was outdated. One of the phones in our room did not work. The bathroom was tiny, with no vents (bring matches or air freshner) If someone is in the bathroom the person in the bedroom can hear everything, even with the TV on.

I guess I should look at it as a case of getting what you pay for. For starters, the hotel accepted my Priceline bid of $95/night. With taxes and fees the cost came to $112/night, which was a great bargain for that neighborhood. It is undoubtedly among the most upscale downtown districts between New York and Los Angeles. The Ritz-Carlton is 2 blocks away; the Drake is diagonally across the street. Rooms at the Drake start at $359/night. I found the Knickerbocker staff to be astonishingly unhelpful, for an (allegedly) 4-star establishment. The doormen seemed to set the tone. I arrived by cab with several pieces of luggage. No one came forward to assist me even though at least one fellow appeared completely unoccupied. A couple of nights later I again arrived by cab. Two uniformed doormen, whose names were Atiku and Bonus, stood and chatted with a friend while I exited the cab. Neither man paid me the slightest attention. In most other 4-star hotels, the staff goes out of their way to greet you cheerfully. I noticed that in the Knickerbocker they generally avoid eye contact. I also thought it interesting that at checkout the desk clerk did not ask me how I had enjoyed my stay. At checkout I noticed there were several plaques on the wall, attesting AAA had awarded the Knickerbocker Four Diamonds for several years up to 2004. However, there was no 2005 award. A check at the AAA web site confirms they did not make that grade for 2005. My room was small and mostly adequate. I had requested a king bed room on a non-smoking floor, and got what I wanted. However, I thought the mattress was a definite step down from other 4-star hotels, and I was not impressed with the quality of the linens and blankets. The room had a VERY noticeable mildew smell. I suspect the mildew was growing in the air conditioning ducts. I could mitigate the smell by turning up the fan or opening the window. Sadly, both options made the room drafty and noisy. The bathroom was small and everything worked. But it appeared to me the plumbing fixtures were the cheapest available. The bathtub fixtures were identical to the variety I see in Wal-Mart. The toilet was not affixed properly to the floor and wobbled every time I sat on it. There was a vent high up on the bathroom wall. It communicated directly with the bathroom in the adjacent room. This meant I was treated to every bathroom sound my neighbors made. The second day I was there, the Internet service crashed hotel-wide and stayed down for most of the day. I had no way of knowing this as I sat in my room and struggled to connect for more than an hour. I called the service's 800 number twice, trying to figure out what was going on. I ended up going to the hotel's tiny business center and paid $15 for 45 minutes of online time. At checkout, I saw the Knickerbocker had charged me $10 for Internet that day plus $2.50 for the calls to the 800 number. I looked at the menu at Nix, the in-house restaurant, and it did not tempt me at all. I never saw more than a handful of people in there. Fortunately, there were many excellent places nearby. Basically I would rate this place as a 2-star establishment that has somehow conned its way into the 4-star club. Considering its stellar location, the price of $112 per night was a great value.

It wasn't very special from a quality point of view, although we still had a great time and made the most of it. First of all, the front desk staff seems uninterested, unprofessional and unhelpful. Second, the Martini Bar is located right in the main lobby and as a result you are greeted with a cloud of smoke as you enter and leave. Our room was definitely not what you would expect from a 4 diamond hotel and was what really earned the rating I gave. It was small, but that is actually pretty typical for hotels in this location (right off of Michigan Ave across from the Drake). We arrived in our room at 10:30 pm following a lovely dinner and found the toilet seat to have *something* on it. As we were exhausted from trekking through the snow, we wiped it off and made due. But it was extreely digusting. The bed linens were nothing special or comfortable. The cd player didn't work. The worst thing was, the walls here are paper thin. We could her every word from the room next door as well as the every- -30 --seconds ringing of a cell phone or blackberry from the room on the other side. We called down to the desk and the woman hung up on me after saying she would ring the room. That was helpful (sarcasm). Luckily they(people with constant ringing phone) came home around midnight or so and we were able to get some sleep. In the morning, my husband took a shower and the tub filled with water and did not drain AT ALL-so, no shower for me. Also, the towels were really really rough. That may sound nit-picky, but I've never had that experience at an upscale hotel before. The bathrooms are extremely small with no frills. Very comparable to a Holiday Inn or other cheaper chain bathroom. The restaurant was ok for breakfast, but the smoking section is right at the entrance, so even though we were seated in non-smoking, we had to walk through the smoking section upon entering and existing. It took the valet 40 minutes to bring our car after they quoted us 15.

We were leaving on vacation from DFW for 14 nights. We stayed one night in one of their rooms, which can only be described as a shoe box. Ugh it was pitiful at best. At check in another guest and I stood there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to the desk from some back office. We gladly left the hotel for the airport via one of their shuttles (this was a scary trip btw, the driver overloaded the shuttle and it was super rainy. So it fish tailed the entire way to the airport). Now the break in! Half of our party returned to DFW after 7 days to find that both my Tahoe and their Cadillac Escalade had been broken into. I got this news over the phone... not good news when I'm in Hawaii. Don't stay here. This is a sorry hotel.

We immediately started counting the hours until our flight (which had been grounded in Dallas due to a mechanical problem). In hindsight, I would have rather slept on the floor of the airport. I literally felt my skin crawl when I climbed into the bed. The location was depressing with very little nearby except a couple of disgusting restaurants. The desk clerk said we could walk to the food or have pizza delivered to our room, but we opted to go hungry rather than jeopardize personal safety. Granted, we checked in late and left at 5 am, but all in all, my husband and I still cringe at the thought of having stayed in this place.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa", "Title": "\u201cTERRIBLE IN EVERY WAY\u201d", "Author": "Kc74112", "ReviewID": "UR70701412", "Content": "Rooms stink.

I booked this place through my travel agent itself who booked my whole itenarary. Only condition i had was that the hotel was close to airport (infact with in airport premises) This was a good fitment and was economical too. The Hotel arranges for Airport Pickup and Drop Shuttles and with advance notice they even arrange for Cabs early in the morning. The hotel is walking distance from Pizza Hut and a Chinese place. But they are on expensive side. If u r looking for a Mac D or a Subway they are long away. Though i did not have any issue as my friends visited me and i moved with them.

They did, but not as bad as the lobby. She told us where to park our car the next morning and we were off to eat. Had a terrible time getting someplace to eat and finding our way back to the hotel. Then slept in a tiny room. Skip the free breakfast. The scrambled eggs were actually slimy. Then we got chewed out by Oliver (the manager, strange guy) because we parked in the wrong place.

We were just looking for somewhere close, clean and quiet with a shuttle and breakfast. We called on arrival and were told to wait \"downstairs\" for the shuttle driver. Well, DFW has multiple levels of parking and roadways, but after a while we found the poorly lit location. We waited about 45 minutes and were finally picked up and taken to the hotel. The kid working the desk was nice enough, but not very knowledgeable. We checked in, were given two vouchers for breakfast and then, as we were leaving, he said, by the way, YOU CAN'T USE THE WATER, IT'S CONTAMINATED!!! Apparently, this section of the city had some sort of low water table problem recently. We were told it was ok to use it if we boiled it twice. Well how were we supposed to do that in a hotel room? We headed off to our room only to find that we were given two doubles instead of a Queen bed. So we call the desk and the kid tells us we have to bring the keys back and then he'll give us another room. so, we do and were given a room on the THIRD floor. Why? This place was far from full. The room was small, cramped and musty and, the decor was dated The tv only received a few channels. Disgusted, I got out the laptop to take advantage of the advertised free wireless internet. What a joke! the signal was so weak it barely registered. I called the desk and he told me it would be fixed tomorrow. I never was able to sign on. Apparently, it had been out of service for some time and they just keep lying to people. (I found this out after I called the internet tech support) It's clear they don't spend much to maintain this hotel and they don't care about the customer. The best part of our stay was when we left in the morning. oh, and the breakfast.......my partner said it was ok, but I couldn't eat for worrying about the water quality. I felt we should have been offered a room in a sister hotel or some other kind of compensation, but none was offered.

The second night we were walking into our room and witnessed a hooker coming out of another room and pulling down her skimpy dress. THe next morning we actually had a hooker knock on our door at about 9:30 in the morning. She was was trying to look sexy until my wife answered the door. She then realized she had the wrong room number to go to. The AC didn't work too well and the lock on the door didn't work right so management had to give us a master key to get into our room.

I am not familar with the DFW airport, I had called earlier in the day before my flight to Dallas to confirm that the shuttle would pick me up; the woman said to call when you landed and they would be there in 20 minutes. When I got off the plane I called, I was asked what terminal I was at (D) and then told to go to door LLD49 or something like that, in the courtesy shuttle zone. Anyway the woman yelled this at me, acted like I was troubling her for the call and when I called again because I had been waiting almost an hour she snapped at me again when I asked her if I was in the right place. Anyway after the surly driver, also the shuttle is not operated by the hotel it is operated by a company called RC Express, the shuttle starts at 4.40 A.M. or something and goes every 40-50 minutes. The property has had a few upgrades, the beds are very very comfortable, that was a very nice surprise. There was a fridge and microwave, well stocked bathroom. The hotel is not near anything reasonable to walk to and I don't think their restaurant is operational, so if you are arriving late make sure you have eaten something becase your options will be limited to the vending machine. I can't say anything about the breakfast, it wasn't being served at the time I left. This place is just fine if you need a hot shower, cool air conditioning and a soft bed at a resonable price.

Hotel was completely booked. Arrived late at night and was able to find a parking space, so I'll rate the parking as good. We booked an Oceanfront room and I loved the view and waking up to the sound and sights of the ocean. Room to me is your typical \"shore\" room. Double beds with small kitchen and pull out couch, not dirty, but not overly clean. Bathroom was basic, water pressure was awful, could hardly wash the soap out of my hair. Like others said, there was mold in the bathroom and on the ceiling in the room. I feel this was due to the fact that while the air conditioning blew cold air, it did not effectively remove the humidity from the air, and everything in our room was \"wet\". Forget about blow drying your hair! The rooms seemed to be well insulated, I did not hear much noise from anyone, except them sliding the door open and closed at 3 am at least 20 times. Balcony also very private, with cement from floor to ceiling on both sides so your neighbors could not see you. I actually really liked that. Gave plenty of toiletries and towels. Rooms on ground floor have stairs leading to beach, which I thought was nice, but the sand dunes blocked the ocean view. Might be good if you had kids and something to keep in mind.. Place had two pools, one inside, one outside, and two hot tubs inside. I didnt use either of them because Im not a big fan of public pools, and they were overrun with kids. I was impressed however, it seemed that they drained the hot tubs and refilled them at least every other day. Thought that was good for germ control. As big as the hotel was, we actually couldnt find the check in desk at first! Its buried in the middle of everything and really small, but they do have great fresh fruit at the front desk every morning! Atrium is nice with tropical birds, computer area, pool, hot tubs, koi pond and snack bar that had great frozen drinks! Only thing I didnt like, but that you cant really avoid, is the strong chlorine odor in the entire atrium, hits you like a ton of bricks when stepping out of your room. And yes, on some days, the birds were pretty loud and fiesty, and did wake me up, but honestly, they were more of a pleasure to hear than peoples screaming kids in the morning that drowned out the birds. Thought location was good, we stayed here so we could walk to Seacrets. Also, not too far from the boardwalk, but not walkable. Hotel is in busier part of town. Basically, you pay a rediculous amount of money for a basic room, but to me, that is the shore in the summer. They tried to keep the place clean, but you will have a constant flow of wet, sandy people in and out all day, so I think they did a decent job. This was a quick getaway, so I knew I would pay through the nose, and we did have fun. But for the same price I can go to the Carribbean, all inclusive 5 star resort with airfare, which is what I normally do. We had a good time and needed a quick getaway and thats what we got.

It would keep you awake so I opened the freezer and smacked the back wall of it and it eventually stopped. I would have requested a new room had we been spending longer than te weekend but they were advertising 100% occupancy so I don't know if relocating us would have even been possible.

First in 2010 and the second this past weekend. For both stays, we had an oceanfront king room. In 2010, there had been a recent storm which brought with it a swarm of little flies (maybe sand fleas?) which invaded our balcony. A call to the front desk brought the housekeeper to the room with a can of bug spray. She sprayed the heck out of the balcony and left the can for us if we needed it later. It helped a bit but then our balcony was covered in dead bugs. Needless to say, we didn't get much use out of the balcony for that trip. Luckily, we didn't have that problem this year. We had a AAA rate, but it was still a bit pricey for a Quality Inn. When we checked in this time around, we were given a 10% off coupon for the restaurant since we had stayed there before. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to use it. For both stays, our rooms were clean and comfortable but they could use a little updating. TV is not a flat screen but hopefully they'll update those soon. The bathroom was clean but was showing a bit of wear. The shower had a lot of small shelves for our toiletries which was good, but the water pressure wasn't very strong. Towels were soft and clean. We thought the AC was broken but it turned out the balcony doors (screen and glass) had sensors on them that would turn off the AC if the doors were open...great energy saving feature. We had a great oceanfront king for both stays and the view was fantastic! The bed was comfortable but it would have been nice to have a pillow top or memory foam layer. A big plus was the low noise level. A lot of hotels seem to have thin walls where you can hear your neighbor's conversation but we were pleased that we couldn't hear anything from our neighbors. The only noise complaint would be the birds in the atrium that would \"wake up\" way to early for us in the morning. It didn't last long though so we were able to fall back to sleep.

Looking back on the reviews, I see that most of the negative ones are from 2010 and older. This leads me to believe this particular hotel made some serious improvements over the past few years, because I was pleasantly surprised! Our experience was very enjoyable! First of all, Quality Inn Oceanfront has a GREAT location. Not too far from the board walk (this should not be confused with the Quality Inn ON the boardwalk), but not so close that you see light up signs, hear people at all hours, and smell fast food everywhere. It's kind of right on the outskirts of things, much like the higher-end hotels. We had a 5th floor ocean view room and the view was fantastic! I woke up just about every morning to see the sunrise from the balcony. The beach is right behind the hotel and was very convenient to walk to. The hotel amenities were well-above average. An indoor pool with 2 hot tub areas and a sauna. An outdoor pool. Towels provided, too. They have a fun playground with a pirate ship AND a castle! Even a BBQ area. When we weren't at the beach, we were at a pool! The inside of the hotel (near the pool) features an 'Atrium' with actual tropical birds, a koi pond, and turtles. It's a very nicely laid-out area! The front desk ALWAYS has a supply of fresh fruit on hand. The room itself also had a lot of great comforts. There were 5 of us (2 adults, 3 kids) and there was PLENTY of space for us. 2 Full beds and a pull out couch (with mattress protectors) worked fine for all of us. It even had a privacy curtain which separated the room. Other nice stuff included a small kitchenette with FULL SIZE fridge, stove, microwave, deep-well sink, cupboard space, and even cooking utensils! A safe and a a 'charlie bar' to lock the sliding door for added security. It had free wi-fi, which was a little slow but they also had a computer room/area in case you needed it, which was nice! Laundry service is also INCLUDED (you just need to get tokens from the front desk). We also received excellent and accommodating turn-down service every day we were there (thanks Rosina)! VERY kid friendly! A clown named \"Lollipop\" showed up every day after 3 PM to entertain the kids. Balloon animals one day, magic the next, dress up the next, and so on! Very fun for the kids. Kid-friendly frozen drinks are available at the outside pool as well! IMPROVEMENTS I'D LIKE TO SEE, IN CASE THEY ARE READING THIS: There is only one elevator for the WHOLE hotel. This was a pain. They could use more to accommodate everyone. I hope they work on that in the future. Faster WiFi would be nice. More computers in the Computer room. New couches/convertible beds - though the bed was comfortable enough for kids, the couch was very uncomfortable. An ice machine on every floor would be great too. :) SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUR STAY: - Book on OCEANFRONT room. The extra $20/night was worth it for the view alone! - Try to get a room ABOVE the first floor. The foliage blocks your view of the ocean, and all the foot traffic seems to make the sandy area you walk out to a bit unclean and noisy. - Take advantage of the free fruit! It's delicious! - Don't bother brewing your own coffee in your room. It's just not as good as the coffee at a complimentary area near the elevator. They keep it well-stocked. Use your 4 cup carafe in your room to carry it back! :D - Take advantage of your small kitchen! Stock up on breakfast and lunch items; save your big $$$ for dinner! - Make sure the name of your significant other is listed on the hotel room. Do this when you check in and you won't have any problems if the other person needs a new key, or linens, etc. - Get (or rent) a beach cart if you have a large family! It will really help lug things around for you!", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Oceanfront experience!\u201d", "Author": "llamasocks", "ReviewID": "UR133380934", "Content": "We brought a friend to OC to celebrate her 50th birthday and the Quality Inn Oceanfront was exactly what we had hoped it would be! I had read some other reviews that gave concerns about cleanliness, but I am glad that we made the decision to stay here. I really like reading about all the \"details\" in other's reviews, so will include the same in my review. We arrived for a 3 night stay in an oceanfront, ground floor room around 6pm on a Friday night; parking was available steps away from the lobby and check in was quick and easy. In the lobby there are baskets of complimentary fruit always available, as well as free local daily newspaper. Outside, across from the lobby, is the outdoor pool; just the right size and a great place to relax that is not \"sandy\". Outside the pool area is two children's play areas, as well as picnic tables and an outdoor (charcoal) grill. Past the lobby you enter the Atrium, which is an indoor area that houses the indoor pool, two hot tubs, tropical birds and fish pond/bridge, and the bar/grill. The indoor pool was fine, however, the hot tubs (unfortunately) were mostly inhabited by kids. 90% of our parties water time was spent in the ocean and the outdoor pool (which was great) so this didn't really bother me. We didn't eat at the bar/grill, so cannot comment on that either. The birds and fish were a really unusual and interesting touch to the indoor Atrium experience. On to our room, which was on the ground floor. The room was great for what we needed (oceanfront, enough space for 4 adults, with a kitchen). The sliding glass doors opened onto a patio with a small table and chair...three steps down from our patio and you were on the beach! You couldn't get a better location for ease of coming and going to the beach! The beds were comfortable, including the pull out couch. My only \"complaint\" with the bed were the scratchy pillowcases (I usually bring my own pillow but forgot). The kitchen had a full size fridge, a small 4 burner electric stove, and a microwave/coffee pot/can opener/toaster, and necessary plates and utensils. All in all we loved this hotel and would definately return again! Extra tips: Using the kitchen to prepare breakfast, lunch on the beach, and one nights' dinner really saved us money. There are ice machines on the 2nd floor (north end) and on the 4th floor (south end). Laundry on 2nd floor by the ice machine. The soda machines sell cans for only 40 cents. Be sure to grab some fruit in the lobby daily; it was fresh and not too \"green\" or \"overripe\". Free coffee with creamer cups (I hate the powdered stuff) and tea (Bigelow foil wrapped type) always available. If you are staying oceanfront and on the groundfloor, request a room closer to the north end; there is an outdoor back entrance with a ramp that makes unloading and loading the car much easier. There is a hose nearby this entrance to wash your feet or chairs when you return from the beach.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allentown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel on the beach\u201d", "Author": "Bret E", "ReviewID": "UR133304165", "Content": "Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. Pros: right on the beach with direct beach access, two pools (indoor and outdoor), outdoor pool was perfect and enjoyable minus several men that couldn't use a sentence without dropping the f bomb, decent bathroom with heat lamp and tiled, atrium was nice with parrots and fish, check-out was quick and easy, staff was friendly and attentive to our requests of additional towels and covers. Cons: we heard constant noise from the people above us all night long, they were constantly opening and closing the sliding door to the balcony, the air conditioning seemed as if you always had to re-adjust it (I guess it would turn itself off), outdoor pool closes at dark, indoor pool had such a strong chlorine smell we chose not to use it, bathroom had previously used soap in the shower upon arrival, pull out sofa had so many hairs on it we chose not to use it, the toaster in the room was covered in grease and didn't work well, trash under the sink, there was a condom box under the pull out sofa. I know all hotels can have issues, but some of the above should have been addressed. It's evident that the cleaning staff do not pay attention to detail and do not thoroughly clean rooms between guests. Another positive, we didn't see any bugs or critters in the room in our three days there. Overall a decent stay, especially for the location. For the $634 we paid for two nights I did expect a much cleaner room and more attention to overall cleanliness.

We had a little trouble finding the actual office but I think that was my Dad being a wacko and nothing against the hotel. We had an easy check in and walked through a very nice atrium with a koi pond, parrots, an indoor pool and a little cafe to the elevator (only oceanfront rooms have an elevator). We were on the third floor - the first has a balcony that steps out to the beach but I think the view might be a little blocked, second floor view may be blocked by palm trees but depends where you are on that floor) As it was our room had a very nice view of the ocean. And the balcony was nice to spend some time on watching the waves, I even saw what I think was a fox one night! The room had three beds - one of which was a pull out couch which was comfortable but I folded it up during the day for extra seating since the television is sort of in this room. Our A/C was set on 50 but it never actually got that cold, it was comfortable in the room though and at night the atrium lights are lowered to give a feeling of darkness in the hallway as well. I noticed in other reviews some people complained about the parrots sqwauking but I didn't have a problem with it. The birds are covered at the night and uncovered around 7-7:30 in the morning. When they are awake you can hear one every once in a while but it never woke any of us up. The kitchen was nice. A bit like cooking in a camper but with a bigger refrigerator. There were several pots and a frying pan provided, as well as a strainer. There were glasses, plates, bowls, mugs for six people. There was a two slice toaster and an electic can opener as well as a manual one. Also a bottle opener with corkscrew, a big spoon, pasta server, and holey spoon and silverware for six. I enede up buying a potato peeler and masher at the local Superfresh so bring those if you plan on doing mashed potatoes! There was a teeny dishwasher which was nice but the pots and strainer didn't fit so they had to be done by had. The stove was electric which I have at home so no problems there. For an idea of what you can cook, I made pork chops, peas, and mashed potatos and turkey cutlet, spinach and mashed potatos the next. The front desk has seasonings upon request but I brought my own. They provide towels and dishrags for the sink as well as dish soap and dishwashing powder. The bathroom was nice, not the typical hotel bathroom. It had a sink inside the bathroom, which I actually like batter. A nice big mirror along one wall and the shower worked well. The only weird thing about it was right across from the toilet was a full length mirror, a bit of a strange location for one if you ask me but whatever. We could take the elevator to the main floor and then walk out past a complimentary coffee and tea service to the beach (brochures and maps are through these doors if you are looking for them. One the way back in there was a curtesy hose to wash the sand off your feet before entering. I prefer the beach so I never used the pools but they looked very nice and there were always people in them but they never seemed over crowded. Overall, I thought this hotel was a bit expensive compared to what we usually pay but it was about average for the area, especially since it was right on the beach. It was a bit old (the mirror had some tarnish, the stove had a dent) but it was clean which is all I really care about.The staff was very helpful, the cleaning ladies were always very nice, we saw more of them than front desk staff- they always seemed to be cleaning something.

Rooms are a little dated but all of them feature full kitchens with four burner electric stove, apartment size refrigerator, microwave, compact dishwasher, coffee maker, electric can opener and a toaster. In the cabinets are silverware, glasses, coffee cups, pots, pans, and utensils. There is also free coffee 24 hours a day on the first level as you are heading towards the ocean by the elevators. We had a beachfront king room, and other people in our party had an oceanfront double. The beachfront room had sliding doors that opened to a small \"porch\" with two chairs and a table, walk down a few steps and your on the beach. the path through the dunes was right there outside our room. The other room was on the 5th floor with a balcony that had an awesome view of the beach and the ocean. It rained one of the days we were there, so the indoor pool and atrium were a blessing, since we were there with 3 grandchildren in our party. The indoor pool is nicely heated and has a 2 foot deep kiddie pool attached to it. There are 2 hot tubs located next to the indoor pool that really help ease the aches and pains from playing with the little ones all day. The outdoor pool is larger and deeper, with a 1 foot deep kiddie pool on the side. Next to the outdoor pool there is a pirate ship and a castle play area for the kids and picnic tables with charcoal grills for a cook out. The atrium area contains a small bridge over a \"stream\" that is surrounded by plants and contains many large fish and a turtle. There are also several birds in the atrium area, 2 large red macaws and 3 parrots were there during our stay. They open the cages up during the day while they take care of them, some of them climb on the to while others wander around the atrium. Rooms that were located on the street side of the building had balconies that overlooked the atrium. The atrium also contains a small restaurant and bar. The menu is limited to basic breakfast, lunch, and dinner fare, along with your typical bar food. The food we had was OK and it sure beat going out for something to eat when you don't feel up to it. The bar runs a happy hour from 4 to 7 which features $1.75 draft beer and $5.00 frozen drinks.The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, as was all of the cleaning and grounds staff and the bartender. With a full kitchen you have the option to go to the supermarket (there is a Super Fresh and a Food Lion down the road) and make a quick meal in the room.

When I arrived, I had a 3rd floor room with no elevator access (atrium view), so I had to carry all of my belongings up 3 flight of stairs. While the room was adequate, the room door was not sealed well, and the wind whistled loudly through it all night. There was a cheerleading competition in town, and the hotel had a DJ until 10pm in the atrium area - my room opened up to a balcony overlooking the atrium. When the DJ stopped, the noise continued until 3am, with both kids and their parents/chaperones talking and yelling constantly in the atrium area. At 1am, my room phone began to ring with kids looking for their friends. - obviously not supervised. About the 4th time it rang, I called the front desk, and they said they had no way of tracking who was calling, so I unplugged the phone. The next day things became quiet as the cheerleaders left, so I went out for the day. Before I left, I pulled the trash bags, and found old trash underneath them from someone's previous stay. Upon my return at 5pm, I found that my room had not been attended to by housekeeping, and when I called the front desk, I was informed that housekeeping was gone for the day. Being disappointed and tired from the night before, I decided to check out and move to another hotel. I did use the fitness room in the hotel in the morning, and it was very hot in there. I found a pair of earrings, most likely left by one of the cheerleaders. When I took these to the front desk, the woman working there tried to avoid looking at me and acted as if I was bothering her. In fact, the only person I encountered who was pleasant was the gentleman at the desk who checked me in and also checked me out when I left. I had originally booked the room because I read on line about the tropical birds in the atrium, but when I finally saw them on my second day, I was concerned about all of the kids whistling and trying to talk to them constantly.

We love the tropical atmosphere in the atrium area with the palm trees and exotic birds, koi pond and beautiful lighting. The pool area is as pretty as the picture and the hot tubs very relaxing. The entire hotel staff that we encountered were so nice and accommodating and at times joined in on our fun - Thank you Mr. Sticky!!! We started in a 2nd floor atrium view room but asked the next morning if there were any 1st floor rooms available. There was and the front desk clerk was happy to make the change for us. In our haste to move our belongings to our new room, I left a phone charger plugged in an outlet and my robe hanging behind the bathroom door of our old room. Upon inquiring at the desk about these items, they were quick to issue a door key to me to check it out as the room was still available. The maid had already finished the room and my things weren't in there but she turned everything in to the front office where I was able to pick them up later in the day. THEN, to bug the front desk staff some more, I realized later that night that I had left a special beer glass in the kitchen cabinet of our old room and asked if anyone had moved into the room yet. They said someone was in there but, shortly after, Mr. Sticky was at my door with my beer glass!!! He was just wonderful and could have really gotten annoyed with me but instead, had a great sense of humor and did everything he could to make our stay enjoyable. He even issued 2 free drink coupons to my husband for having to put up with me!!! When we returned home I checked their rates for spring break week (I work in a school) and went ahead and made reservations for a few nights that week - That's right Mr. Sticky - I'm coming back!!!

There was no breakfast at this hotel, but apples and over ripe bananas were available in the lobby. There was coffee and tea in the atrium. Never being to the area before, I assumed an Oceanfront hotel with a balcony meant that the balcony looked out over the ocean, when it actually looked into the atrium. All in all when it comes to hotels, my main concern is that it is clean. The room itself was very clean except for the tub which had hairs in it, the coffee pot had not been cleaned and had dried coffee in it. I striped back the bedding to check the mattress and it was clean, although about the cheapest mattress I've ever seen. I wouldn't stay there again due to the lack of an elevator and the bed being uncomfortable.

We came across this hotel by accident (Good thing we did) using the Choice Hotels main corporate site because of my employer's discount. Let me start off by saying, I have traveled all over the country and stayed in all classes of hotels, the staff at this hotel was without a doubt one of the BEST I have ever encountered. Traveling with two daughters (ages 6 and 12) can get on the nerves of even the most patient of parents. The Atrium with it's birds, fish and turtles is amazing! It gave the girls something to do in the interim while mom and dad gather up the stuff for the days activities or (try to steal 10 minutes alone) LOL! The pools were VERY CLEAN!, Nice temperature and never crowded. The Atrium Cafe' was a nice stop for a quick bite or cocktail and had a very friendly staff. We chose a King room on the first floor opening into the atrium. I would say it was a great choice. The bar was only steps away along with ice cream and \"Virgin\" drinks available for the kids. The first floor rooms on the Atrium side also offer a greater sense of \"security\" than most \"ocean front\" hotels. Access to the rooms means you have to pass the lobby or cafe' before getting to the room definately a plus for families. The staff was more than willing to offer suggestions on dining, entertainment etc. and when they had no personal experience they actually told you that rather than just throw you some \"tourist trap\" suggestion. One other thing that impressed me as an experienced traveller, the front desk staff actually asked me how we enjoyed a few places that they had not experienced yet, this not only showed that they cared about OUR stay but wanted feedback for future guests. Another personal touch, my 6 year old accidentally left her custom embroidered beach towel (hope her Grandma doesn't read this) at the pool. We asked the next morning about it and instead of them having just thrown it away or placed it in some box under the counter, it was returned to our room WASHED, DRIED, FOLDED and wrapped in plastic!!", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altoona, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Kathy215", "ReviewID": "UR115222618", "Content": "This hotel was wonderful.

The hotel staff were professional, helpful, and friendly. The location is perfect, the room and common areas were very clean, and the amenities were just right. We arrived early (10 am) to take advantage of a beautiful day on the beach. I requested an upper level room away from the birds, thinking their noise might bother us in the morning. The receptionist took my cell phone number and called when our room was ready at about 11 am. Nice! They gave us the room on the south end where we had the added bonus of a window in the living area (sofa and TV) thus making it ocean view! Our room was VERY reasonably priced- $116 with the AAA discount. This was the building that they call the atrium, meaning the rooms overlook the indoor portion of the hotel where the indoor pool, koi pond, tropical birds (5 or 6 in separate cages), and indoor bar/restaurant are located. This is the \"original\" building that has obviously been updated as the room was lovely. At some point they added on the oceanfront building, thus enclosing the atrium portion between the two buildings. There is not an elevator for this original building, however there is an elevator for the oceanfront half. The outdoor pool is lovely and also has an outdoor bar with seating and music. The pool is in front of the hotel, on the opposite side is the beach. Our room was large, with a full kitchen, king bed, and living area with sofa and TV. The bathroom was quite adequate, no temperature problems with the shower, no smell or dirt of any kind. Parking was not a problem and when we checked out the following day they said no problem, park and stay to enjoy the beach as long as you'd like. We brought breakfast foods and snacks and drinks and went out for dinner at Fager's Island which was fantastic. We were lucky to be there on a beautiful evening with a perfect sunset. One of my favorite things about the hotel was laying on the beach and being able to go inside for a frozen drink to take back to the beach. They also have a huge basket of fresh fruit at the front desk, plus coffee near the exit to the beach all day long. We didn't use the exercise room but I would if we had stayed longer. Again, the staff were all so courteous and plentiful, helping at the front desk, sweeping and cleaning the common areas, making everything lovely for the guests. The guests were also very polite and friendly, no problems with any inappropriate behavior or comments or anything.

The hotel provided everything we expected for a couple days at the beach. For me, its all about location and convenience from room to beach and this hotel is as close to the beach as you can get. Its also small enough that you dont have to navigate through a maze of corridors, hallways and elevators to get from your room to the beach like you do in many of the mega hotel/resorts. That is why I prefered to stay on the bottom floor, room 116, second room from the end and adjacent to the side entrance door. Parking spots are just a few feet from the side door, which made loading in and out a breeze. The bottom floor rooms are actually elevated up 7-8 steps from the sandy area right below the balcony which does have a slight ocean view despite the sand dunes situated between the hotel and the beach. This is very convenient since we just left the sliding glass doors to the balcony unlocked and were able to come in and out of our rooms throughout the day without ever having to go inside the hotel or ride an elevator. We just locked all our valuables in the safe and closed the drapes and really did not worry about anyone coming in the room and staeling our tub of popcorn. Nice to have a full sized fridge and kitchenette with all the basics. A/C worked well, bathroom functioned properly, although not roomy enough for two people at once. 2 double beds were adequate, I had to ask front desk to send maids to flip mattress after first night and that helped my back a little. The springs in my mattress were shot and very squeaky, it needs to be replaced. Its a shame that many hotels dont buy higher quality mattresses and have them replaced when they are worn out. It was evident that this was a very low quality mattress. My wife did not have any complaints about her mattress so it could have just been that one. The TV and remote functioned properly although it needs to be upgraded from the big box tv's of the 1980's to a flatscreen HDTV commonly found in hotels today. It would also be helpful to have a channel line-up guide printed out on one sheet and laminated for all guest rooms. The on-screen scroll guide did not always work and frankly is just way too slow in our fast-paced instantaneous electronic world. I made this suggestion to a front desk clerk and she thought it was a great idea and would pass it up the chain of command. Very small details, I agree, but its the little things that separate a good hotel from a great hotel. The pool area was very refreshing, perfect water temperature. pool towels provided, lots of lounge chairs, and tables with umbrellas for snacking. Nice landscapping with flowers, bushes, and some trees to block the late afternoon sun. One day, the outside pool bar was open with some musice playing and beverage service. It would be a bonus if the hotel provided a few floats to relax in while in the pool. The one thing that caught my attention and really needs to be addressed by the maintenance staff is the issue of cigarette butts and trash. I believe the entire hotel is non-smoking, so most guest smokers go out on thier balconies to smoke. When finished, they just use the sandy area below as their ashtray. Between the back of the hotel where the lower floor balconies are and the sand dunes, there is a a 20-foot wide area of sand with 10 palm trees planted, which adds a nice island feel to the surroundings. All throughout this sandy area between the palm trees are thousands of cigartees butts which I had the displeasure of walking through many times a day during our stay. In some areas, it looked as if entire ashtrays with dozens of butts were dumped in one pile here and there. I saw several employees watering the plants nearby, but never did I see any of them pick up any trash or rake up any cigarette butts. May I suggest to the hotel manager to furnish each balcony with a \"cigarette tower\" for extinguishing the smokes and to include raking up all cigartees butts in the sandy area as part of the daily maintenance routine. When I visit next time , I will report back on the progress that has been made in this area. This will really enhance the aesthetics of the hotel and convey an image that an effort is being made to counter the pollution made by thousands of sloppy and inconsiderate guests. My overall impression of this hotel is positive and I would not hesitate staying here again. With a little fine-tuning and addressing some of the details this could become my favorite hotel in OC. It has the perfect location, a touch of charm, it just needs to be brought into the 21st century with some modern updates and a litlle TLC here and there to realize its potential.

If you can't get an oceanfront room, try to get a ground floor atrium view or else your room will open to the outside on the street side of the building and you have to trek outside to get into the atrium. The ground floor rooms open right into the atrium - a huge plus if it is cold/rainy. There is always a basket of fresh fruit at the front desk and fresh coffee by the doors going out to the beach. Breakfast at the atrium cafe is adequate and the bar has daily drink specials. The rooms themselves are very clean. Ours had a nice little kitchenette with a fridge, stove, toaster, sink, dishwasher and pots, pans, silverware and plates. Most toiletries are supplied (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, make up remover pads, soap), poolside towels were plentiful and surpirsingly nice. The pool itself looked really cloudy, though it was well chlorinated and they do maintenance on it every morning before it opens. A few more chairs in the pool area would be nice too. The kids really enjoy interacting with the birds - a couple of them talk a bit and one dances with you. My only concern is that the place is really starting to show its age and it could use better touch up cleaning throughout the day. Some slobby guests left plastic cups laying all around the pool deck and it was hours before anyone came to clean them up and the atrium bathroom was gross. It may be in the hotel's best interest to have someone keep an eye on the pool area when it's really busy and take care of that kind of stuff. The atrium is usually pretty noisy with kids in the pool during the day and then their partying parents in the evening, but if you are looking for complete peace and quiet in Ocean City, you are in the wrong resort - go to Delaware.

The furniture was also dirty and there was a leftover beer top on the table that stayed there our entire stay. I am sure the balconies are never cleaned.

At night they cover the parrots with a vinyl cover...except one. One parrot has a white sheet with several holes (tacky rips) thrown over the cage.

I immediately went down stairs to report the problems which were address very quickly. Next, I found hair on the sheets. We called only to find out we had to go down stairs to get replacement sheets. The next morning we discovered, there was no fruit until later that afternoon. The fitness center didn't open until 9am. The room was freezing. One of the workers told one member of our party, he had to open the door to let some of the cool air out. The decor....all the interior plants were fake....plastic EVERYWHERE!. The canopy had a pile of dust. No one cleaned them! The doors of the fitness center had a pad lock. None of the fitness equipment worked.

Ms. Turner our housekeeper was friendly and did an excellent job cleaning our room and keeping things well stock and I would like to say thank you again to her. The indoor swimming pool was a definite plus since the weather wasn't quite warm enough for outdoor swimming.

Upon check in, the front desk politely told us that the previous occupants complained that the room had a smokers odor. They gave us a key to see if the room was acceptable. It was not, as it definitely smelled from smoke. They placed us in another oceanfront room on the first floor, and allowed us to check out the room before checking in. This room had no odor, and was in the process of being cleaned. The front desk was very polite, and we appreciated them warning us of the odor in the first room. The room was large and clean, with a full size refrigerator. Having two bathrooms in the room was great! Bathrooms were clean, beds were comfortable. A sliding divider was between the living area and the beds, and was convienient as I am an early riser. The carpet was buckled in a couple of areas, but that is to be expected in a beachfront hotel as the carpet must be vacuumed daily to remove sand. Was the wallpaper dated? I didn't notice. The furniture was clean, and all lights and appliances worked. Our room was cleaned promptly everyday at 10am. Indoor and outdoor pools were clean and pleasant. The hotel location was perfect, walking distance from the boardwalk, but far away enough to be quiet at night. While the hotel is non smoking, you will find many guests smoking on the balconies, and the odor can be annoying when you are on your balcony. The restaurant is open for breakfast only, and is reasonably priced. We would have liked to see it open for lunch as well. The beach cafe was only open once during our 4 day stay.

The AC thermostat system in our room could not be regulated--you either had it on or off, no in between. Luckily, we don't mind sleeping in a cold room with blankets. The woodwork molding around the entrance door was separating from the frame, such that the security latch could not stop a two year old.

Stayed 3 nights at the Quality Inn Oceanfront. I felt that the price of the hotel room was on the expensive side, but during my initial research found that it was a common rate for Ocean City. We originally booked a poolside room. I figured that the poolside room would still have a balcony and view to the outside, just not the ocean. So after checking-in we went to check out our 2nd floor poolside room. The room itself was fine, but it had no natural light. There were 2 small windows on either side of the door into the hotel room, but no natural light made it through them because the overhang from the walkway/porch above was so deep. And at the other side of the room, the sliding doors went out onto an interior balcony that opened up in the atrium, 'tropical oasis', area. If you don't want to see the sun or outside while staying at this hotel than this room would be fine, but I need some natural light. So we went back to the front desk and upgraded to an oceanfront room (which surpisingly was only $50 more total for our 3 night stay). This was the best desicion. Our hotel room was clean, not fantastic, but clean and the view was great. I agree with the previous reviewers comments about the tropical oasis/atrium. It didn't appear clean at all (we did not use the indoor pool or hot tubs at all). The birds in their cages were covered up at night, so they weren't loud all night long. But the covers were removed at 730/8am so if we were late sleepers they would have woken us up every morning. For this hotel I would recommend an oceanfront room on the 4th or 5th floor. Nothing lower; otherwise when you walk out of your room you are in the 'tropical oasis'. The beach at the hotel was perfect location, not too busy, and very easy to access from the hotel. We also did not use the outdoor pool, but it was always very busy. And in the middle of the parking lot. Also, the gym is very small and the free wireless internet was spotty.

After reading some of them, I was a little worried about spending my anniversary there. But because my wife and I aren't very picky, I decided to try it. Lets start from the beginning: The hotel was easy to find, and was right on the main road with a large sign. The parking situation which can be a pain in OC was easy and there was plenty available. There is a pool outside by the parking lot before you enter the hotel, usually filled with kids, but the area was clean, and so was the pool. Kids were usually kept under control by their parents. The entrances to the older part of the hotel are outside, on the road side, and have balconies overlooking the pool/parking lot area. The lobby was small, but the staff was helpful and friendly, and there was always a stocked fruit basket with bananas, peaches, etc. Through the lobby was the atrium. I was expecting more plats, and less open space, but it was nice and there were birds in cages for people to look at, and \"talk\" to! Also in the atrium is a bar/restaurant which is reasonably priced. To the south end is a pool and two hot tubs. The pool was a little dirty, mostly with sand from the beach, and one of the hot tubs was empty most of the time. The rooms were OK. Nothing special. When we walked in, it looked nice but felt a little dirty and moist. The kitchen area was nice, the broiler under the stove was NASTY, and I was scared to open it. We did use the kitchen though, and their dishes. The bathroom was kinda dingy, wallpaper was peeling near the top of the wall where there were a couple of holes. The shower did have mold around the caulk if a few spots. The reviews that mention water pressure problems were not exaggerating! NO PRESSURE! And the water temp is always changing. Not to extreme amounts, but enough to make me want to rush it. The bed/tv area was very nice, but the carpet was kinda nasty. The A/C worked fine. The balcony overlooking the atrium was just about useless unless you want to look at pasty old people and kids that are scared to go in the ocean. The birds don't make hardly any noise, and are covered during sleeping hours. The people in the room next to us were very loud and obnoxious. but they were friendly, and at about eleven every night they went in to bed. The ocean area in front of the hotel was nice and clean and supervised by a lifeguard. In retrospect, I'd stay there again.

So I'm hoping that my input will help someone else as well. First the PROS: LOCATION: Perfect!! It's located on 54th & Coastal Hgwy. in Ocean City, MD which is far enough away from the noise and crowds of downtown and the boardwalk but not so far it's a pain in the butt to get there when you want. It's close to the Convention Center (if you care), close to restaraunts, clubs, amusements, gas stations, and supermarkets. The beach is guarded/private, uncongested and CLEAN! HOTEL: Room Service - very accomodating, attentive, and on point. Decor - very tropical, \"beachy\", and clean. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept on in ANY hotel. Even my 16yr. old, fussy daughter raved of how she wished she could take the mattress home!! Our room was an non-smoking oceanfront efficiency with a spectacular view of the beach and ocean from the 4th floor. The balcony, complete with table and chairs was private with walls on both sides so you weren't staring down your neighbors throat. The back of the hotel also featured shaded hammocks that were incredibly relaxing enough to lull you to sleep with the cool ocean breeze caressing you, the waves crashing in the background - my gosh! What a treat!! Anyway, the room was big enough to sleep 6 people which included my husband and I, our three children plus my neice (ages 11, 15,16, and 18yrs old). The dresser and closet was even ample enough for us all to unpack and stow our luggage away without tripping over each other! The kitchen was fully stocked and came with a dishwasher and soap, stove with an oven, refrigerator and freezer. It took the headache & expense out of eating out all the time! The bathroom was decent enough with a tub/shower combo with a massaging shower head but my main reason for mentioning it in this review is that I was relieved that six people were able to shower back to back without the water pressure changing or the hot water running out!!! Loved the outdoor pool and pool bar. Loved the indoor heated pool, jacuzzi, and Atrium bar. LOVED THE TROPICAL ATRIUM, PERIOD!! I was very thankful that the hotel staff always left fresh laundered towels stacked in the Lobby so you never had to worry about dragging your own towels around! Loved the all day, all night free coffee and the fresh fruit in the morning! I was VERY thankful for the guest laundry room which was FREE!! The game room was perfect for the kids to keep busy whenever they got a little bored and for me and my husband to take on a game of pool when we got bored! I'm also thankful for the shower/changing room in the Atrium that allowed us to check out at 11am but still enjoy the pool and be able to shower and change before leaving for good. Oh and lest I forget, there's also an exercise room and tanning bed although I personally didn't utilize them as walking in the sand did my thighs great and I'm already black so tanning is kind of a mute point. (HA!HA!) Oh and there's also wireless internet on the Atrium side and wired Ethernet (high speed) on the oceanfront side where we stayed. The front desk was very accomodating in lending me an ethernet cable for my laptop. And one other thing! There's a safe in the closet in the room which allows you to set your own 4-digit code. I was able to lock up my laptop and all my other valuables while out of the room. This was one heck of a worry free vacation! I will DEFINITELY stay here again! It was worth every penny!!! And now the CONS: Well there aren't many. I wish they cleaned the jacuzzi more than once a day (too many sandy feet), it was quite frankly gross. And the parrots, although beautiful and fun became an noisy annoyance when they woke in the morning but I digress - they were only noisy if you opened your room door. :>) Our first night there we spotted a few micro-sized ant-looking bugs on the kitchen counter. When I informed management they said they would take care of it. When we returned to the room -poof- no bugs for the rest of our week long stay!", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat plac eto stay for reasonable rates\u201d", "Author": "Josie16", "ReviewID": "UR18985438", "Content": "My husband and I went down to O.C. for a long weekend and heard that it was a nice place to stay and was reasonable.

The A/C was blowing warm air all night. By the time we woke up in the morning our sheets were drenched. When i spoke to the management they told me the A/C controls are reversed and i was supposed to set the temp to 85 degress to cool it down. The following day the A/C broke again. This time the sensor for the door stopped working so the A/C would not turn on because the sensor indicated the balcony door was open and it does not work if the door is open. We called the desk and they sent a maintenece guy up at 10pm. He did not not know what to do, so for an hour he went in and out of the room accomplishing nothing. Finially i fixed it by playing with the sensor. In addition to the A/C, the cleaning staff was extremely rude. After telling the management about the A/C problems we had and the poor condition with which the room was cleaned when we arrived, the desk assured us we would get VIP cleaning that morning. After the room was cleaned we returned to our room only to find trash not taken out, NO towels, more food stains not cleaned, and some trash just pushed under the furniture. The only good thing about this hotel is the view.......the hotel itself is disgusting. After spending nearly $400 over a weekend i feel like i was truly ripped off.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "south jersey shore", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely NOT a Family Resort\u201d", "Author": "southjerseymom", "ReviewID": "UR7988031", "Content": "Took a quick 2 night trip last week to OC for some crabs on Father's Day. (Try PGN at 29th for the best crabs ever!!!). Read some so so reviews about the hotel and asked the family to stay in the car why I checked it out. First impression bad...trash all over sidewalk. Pool in back of hotel in parking lot. Windows leading to lobby were so dirty you couldn't see through them. We had booked atrium view because we live on the beach and don't really care about view. We were told room had view of atrium area with tropical wonderland of indoor pool and garden. Yech! Filthy indoor pool, bird cages full of poop. No way was I letting my kids in that pool. I knew I was in trouble. Asked to look at room. Steps up back of building rotted out. Room ok but looked out over discusting indoor pool and smelly birds. Asked to see oceanview. Room worse. Even hubby who hates that I am pickey about rooms said the place was a dump. At $179/night plus 11% tax we wanted out. Front Desk returned money when I politely complained that I just could not stay there. Definitely a senior week crash pad instead of the family \"resort\" advertised.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Mountain, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "cjajsmom", "ReviewID": "UR7438773", "Content": "We stayed from April 22 through April 25. Our oceanfront room was beyond our expectations after reading other reviews. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was clean and well-kept. The view was excellent. The parrots were fine in spite of the complaints of another reviewer. Their cages were cleaned daily (I only clean my parrots' cages weekly), they had new toys, they were covered nightly. Some were allowed to be out of their cages. Their wings were trimmed. As parrots go, I think these guys were happy and definitely seemed to enjoy the human interaction. The pool was clean. I was told by someone else that the hot tub was too hot, but I didn't try it. Fruit in the lobby was very fresh and abundant. The coffee area was clean and well-stocked. Coffee was always available. Most of the staff were very nice. There appear to be a number of play areas inside and outside. This is nice for families with younger children. The ground floor ocean front rooms walk out to a protected sandy area. A nice plus for families. We were given a great room rate after I asked for the rock bottom price. If you are used to a luxury hotel, then you won't be happy here. But if you are looking for sufficient accomodations, this hotel will be satisfactory. But -- there always has to be a \"but\" right? Our refrigerator clunked like a soda machine delivering your can every time the compressor went off. Try sleeping through that! We reported it Monday morning. Nothing was done. After two more nights of clunk-clunk-clunk, we checked out a day early. We were not charged for one night, so only paid for two of our three nights. The light on the nightstand sizzled and popped when my husband switched it on. We reported this also on Monday, considering it to be a fire hazard. Nothing was done about this either. No hot water was available our third (and final) morning. Front desk was inundated with calls about this while we were checking out. You could tell they were getting frazzled. Ice machines are only available on the second and fourth floors. I think they should have been available on every floor. We did not receive room service our second day. I guess the two hours we were in the room between 8:00 and 5:30 did not leave enough free hours for them to clean the room? We found a bag of clean towels hanging on our door handle. Would we go back? Yes, but with family in the area, I doubt we'll need a hotel room too often. But if we do, we would probably choose to stay here again.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quality Inn Oceanfront", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d89493-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Oceanfront-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$64 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">54th Street Oceanside</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "89493", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ce/03/ec/quality-inn-oceanfront.jpg"}}

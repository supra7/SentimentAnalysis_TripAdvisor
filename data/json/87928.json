The place should be bulldozed or burnt down,the indian manager should be banned from working in the hotel industry ever again and the people hanging around the place should be picked up by the police.

Great rate and now I know why. The room was filled with roaches and the mattress and box spring was molded and had holes in it. My son and I both could not breath after a few hours of being in here. We also received several phone calls throughout the night, it was someone saying they had the money and we better have the stuff or else... I asked the person not to call back, yet they kept calling. I went to the office at 645am and talked to the night manager and he said if we checked out we would not get a refund. This place is not safe. Even our room door would appear to be closed, however, anyone could push it open at anytime, so if you stay make sure you use every lock on the door to ensure your safety. There was cars in and out of the place all night even though they have a great camera system in place here but with the phones calls all night there is no doubt that they were people coming here to buy drugs. The only thing good I can say about this place is they have great internet connection and 200 tv channels. But overall this place is a dump.

I would not ever recommend this motel to anyone.

Where to start? The advertised rate on their website and on their marquee was for around $28/night, plus tax. Like many of the Orlando area hotels, they charge a \"resort fee\". This adds six dollars per night. The man at the front desk said it was a \"tax\", which is not true. It is a hotel charged FEE to make more them more money. Only the government can charge taxes. This \"resort fee\" was added to cover things like the shuttle, pool, local calls-none of which I used. What a scam. Anyways, the room was dated, but spacious, and appeared clean. However, looks can be deceiving (like their advertised rate). The tub was clogged, so by the time I was done showering, I would be standing in ankle-deep water. The toilet overflowed (thankfully after a later flush, so it was \"just\" water). The door did not always lock after leaving the room. Glad I checked it! Had to open and shut it a few times to get it to work properly. The breakfast consisted of coffee, an orange juice-like drink, and mini donuts. Lastly, the hotel can only be accessd from one direction. Coming back from Disney, I had to pass the hotel and make a u-turn on a busy road to get back to it. Needless to say, I will not stay their again.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cOh My Word\u201d", "Author": "i2snookums", "ReviewID": "UR29486982", "Content": "I knew that when I booked this motel it was not going to be one of the best, however, I did not know that they did not own up to anything they wrote one the web. The pool is not heated year round, the continental breakfast that should have had coffee, oj, donuts, and muffins, only had what tasted like tang for oj, coffee, and tang. the rooms should have been cleaned daily, by this I always thought they would change the sheets and clean the bathroom. All they did was make the bed and pick up the used towels and give new ones. As for the sheets, they use sooooo much bleach on them I had little burns on my face and hands and my eyes watered so bad I could not keep them open.

My kids loved the pool and the fact we could grill out and have a good old fashioned picnic right at the hotel. We arrived very late due to airline delays, and I was worried no one would be there to check us in. Well, to my surprise, there was a professional attendant there, friendly and helpful. She suggested places for us to go get food/drinks that late at night, as well as offered to help us with the luggage. Unreal! The room was spacious, clean and a microwave and fridge! I didn't expect that. I loved the fact that they conserve energy/resources and leave a remark saying that they wont change laundry unless we request. Eco-friendly, for a budget hotel..um, cool! Left the room attendants a small but moderate tip and yeah, worth it...awesome service all around. Continental breakfast was perfect, got us all going for the day. If you want a place to sleep, and a place to chill during your very busy and exciting stay in Orlando...this is the place. Major bang for the buck. If you are used to first class, and used to paying for a room that is beyond most people's mortgage payments, don't stay here...if you want a great room/pool/service for the money...STAY here..this place is exactly where I will continue to stay for years!

We found their ad in the Kissimmee Vacation Planner and a coupon for a $28.95 rate both years (they've now gone to a coupon rate of $32.95). We only spent time in the room to shower and sleep, but we couldn't stand to stay here again. The place is falling apart and after the hurricanes of 2004, its worse than ever. Major renovations need to be done, or better still, tear down the whole place and start over. We had an overflow in the toilet that took over two hours to get someone to fix. The roof had leaked during the hurricanes, but no repairs to the ceiling have been done. I can't recommend this motel to anyone, cheap or not.

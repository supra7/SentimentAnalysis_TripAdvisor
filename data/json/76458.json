Upon checking in the staff was great and very helpful. We stayed for three nights and on our second night there was a bit of an issue. Maybe the walls are thin, or our neighbors were extremely loud! But we were traveling with our two children and the sounds from the neighbors room were not something that they should be hearing. My wife complained about it to Quianna at the front desk in the morning. She was extremely helpful and said she would give us a free upgrade to their other building as soon as there was a room available. We were expecting a regular room but were actually upgraded to a large suite because of the unfortunate issue the night before. This actually worked out great for us, and our last night there couldn't have been better. The continental breakfast was actually pretty good also, and we made good use of the free wifi. If I'm ever back in the area I will be staying here again just because of the warm customer service we received by the front desk when we arrived with our issue.

I had been trying to book a room all day online and my connection on my iPhone was horrible at the amusement park we were at. I told the front desk about my issue and she honored the 2 day stay online price. I was a bit unsatisfied with the cleanliness of the rooms. They seemed to just be surface cleaned. The second day I stayed the room was a bit cleaner. Probably a different housekeeper. The breakfast room was dingy and jelly from the day before was still on the breakfast table. The toasters and juice machine needed a good daily cleaning or at least a wipe down. My other complaint would be while trying to eat breakfast there was someone spraying furniture polish cleaning the lobby. That is not a good smell for your palate. Also I would suggest the maids to eat before work and not use up the space and appliances made for paying customers. We were on a tight time schedule and there were three housekeepers in uniforms toasting their bagels in a leisurely fashion. The one maid kept using the toaster improperly shoving the lever up to check her toast instead of using the temp knob or the cancel button. So no wonder they don't work well with the daily improper use. They must have been on their union mandated break, until the matinence supervisor came in and they rushed out of the breakfast room. So while having your breakfast please clean the tables, juice machine buttons and tray, remove the stale bagels and Danishes, wipe down fridge, and tongs. Pretty good selection for breakfast just not the cleanest environment. The room could use some dusting, the light switches wiped down, walls wiped clean, the hair dryer was dirty, and the carpet needed cleaned. This is coming from someone who is very particular and wanted to save some cash. Shower was clean and so was the linens. Those are my important points. My other complaint was I decided to stay in the area another night and they couldn't accommodate a third night at a good rate after I checked out. Clean enough to sleep and shower.

I'll put you in a suite to make up for it\" With no where to stay and dead on our feet we agreed----until we saw the ONE bed we were supposed to share!

The beds were very comfortable, and the pillows were better than ours at home! The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was better that most hotels I've stayed in...a large selection including waffles, boiled eggs, yogurt, breads and more.

This Best Western was pretty terrible and not even worth the price we paid ($98 or something...). The lobby was fine but even walking down the hallways we noticed that it smelled old and in desperate need of a remodel. Our room smelled thick of deodorizer. We asked for a non-smoking room but halfway though my shower I realized that either smoke was being filtered in from another room OR someone had smoked there previously. We were in too big of a hurry to deal with it, so I just closed the bathroom door before we left for the night. Despite the smell, the bed was old and lumpy. The pillows were the size of throw pillows and very lumpy, too. After waking up though the night because the bed was SO uncomfortable, I figured out I couldn\u2019t get used to the smell either. We finally ended up leaving at 4 am because it was SO BAD. I asked for a full refund, but the owner only gave me $25 back. I did not feel this was satisfactory for how terrible the hotel was but I couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue anymore. I suggest paying an additional $23-$35 per night and staying at a Hampton Inn or something under the Hilton Family!", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener Ontario Canad", "Title": "\u201cFantastic people very accomodating\u201d", "Author": "Will1942", "ReviewID": "UR78546376", "Content": "I do a lot of business in the surrounding area and have found the staff at this Motel incredible, & accomodating at all hours of the day.

We stayed for 3 nights for a sports tournament with the rest of the team. The room was ok - desk area and wifi was there - so that I could work - that was nice. Breakfast lacked fruit - they had old bananas - did not replace on third morning. If you play sports (and they told me they cater to that audience) bananas are really a staple and should always be there for breakfast or to take as a morning snack. When I asked if there was room to check in for an extra night if we won - I was told that we prob would not get a room with 2 beds. A friend called a few minutes later and asked to reserve 4 rooms with 2 beds for 3 nights and were told it was available. Either way - the gentleman either did not tell me the truth or he did not tell my friend the truth.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201ccool best western nice\u201d", "Author": "jumps2876", "ReviewID": "UR8014965", "Content": "we stayed at best western crossroads during f1 weekend.place was busy but coustomer service was at the top level, hot breakfast, nice pool, and gold's gym for free. i would stay here and tell all the people i know to stay at this best western. great job and Thank you all the staff and management.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "TomSwift", "ReviewID": "UR7989926", "Content": "Stayed here on a trip from Dallas to New York. It's on the east side of Indi, which means if you're traveling east, you'll avoid morning rush hour the following morning. The place was clean, the room very spacious.

Many convenient amenities included. Could tell much of the room is new with some work ongoing. Breakfast was plentiful with hot add ons included and check out was same friendly experience. Hi-speed was included, quick, and even though I was quite a distance from the center of the hotel I had great signal strength with no drop offs to complete three hours of work .Micro, fridge, curved shower rods(I love these things!!) great mattress, bedding, and no highway noise that I noticed completed an overall great experience, good value, and I got points for my stay.

I'd go stir crazy after very long, not being able to open windows or have more of a suite-type room, but for one night, it was fine. The amenities were, as for all Kimpton hotels, very nice, but the prices of the minibar were exceptionally high. A Luna Bar for $6.00, really?? Location is very handy to UCLA and Westwood Village. You could walk there if you don't mind a fairly long walk. However, no one in LA walks, of course. Valet parking at $33 was another big ticket item. There is some street parking but it's a ways away. And the parking patrol is very active - we missed our meter while shopping at Westwood Village - missed it by 90 seconds and they'd already ticketed us! Yikes. We didn't feel quite as warmly welcomed as at other Kimptons - the valets and doormen sort of ignored us going in and out, no offer of help, so that was odd. The lounge also didn't seem that welcoming. We do like the Kimpton chain but this wasn't our favorite.

My recent stay at the Palomar on Wilshire in Westwood was most agreeable in every way. The knowledge that once I cleared the Los Angeles' airport and its feeder freeway that feeds on one's time,the 405, that what awaited me was welcome comfort (or comforting welcome) of the hotel, propelled me to its front door and cheerful staff. My room was perfect, the gym vital, the elevator greetings testimony to the high quality of my fellow guests, and for the first time, I did my business by inviting folks to breakfast and lunch at the cafe...which they were happy to do! And I didn't have to drive all over L.A! And thus discovered how many pleasures were in walking distance of the Hotel. Final hint; if a guest wants to visit Beverly Hills to see Ferrari's and Bentley's in their native habitat, or sample cosmetics in the manicured hands of Nieman Marcus demonstrator ladies, take the bus right down Wilshire and let someone else worry about parking.

Our check-in went great and the very friendly staff gave us a nice room on a high floor with a view. The lobby is small but very nice with modern decor. Nice restaurant and bar area located in lobby area. The pool is heated, but a jucuzzi would be nice on a cold day (which it was). Fitness center is pretty nice with water, towels, etc and a view of Wilshire. The cardio has built in tv's so don't forget to bring headphones. The room was small but clean and nicely appointed. Great flatscreen TV and 2 robes in the room. The problem started around 10:30 PM when i woke up to hear music and stomping in the room located above us. My wife had already been awake and said that it had been going on for a while. I called to ask if there was a club located above our room and the front desk person said no. When i told her about the problem she apologized and said that she would take care of it. It literally sounded like a bunch of kids were running back and forth in the room and jamming out to music (which was coming through the vents). After about 20 minutes things calmed down but then started up again after a while. I called down again (at almost midnight!) and the same (nice) gal was very empathetic and said that she would personally go up and take care of the situation (also offered to bring ear plugs up). She must have because it all stopped pretty quickly. I travel a lot and it has been quite a while since i have had this kind of a problem with noise. These people (above us) were flat out inconsiderate but there may also be an issue with proper insulation. All i can say is don't stay in room 1518! The front desk issued a credit of $50, which probably should have been more like $80 considering that it was really hard to get a good nights sleep after being woken up shortly after falling asleep The service was great except for at the restaurant.

I really liked this hotel a lot for the money. I did a lot of research first and was pleasantly surprised. We were very well received by the front desk and car valet service and that made us feel welcome right away. The lobby and hotel overall were very well appointed. It is very much a chic, boutique hotel. Sleek and yet comfortable. Our room was a type of suite. You enter into the living room suite with fold out double sleeper sofa, large flatscreen tv and desk and there are two sliding heavy doors which lead to the master bedroom which has its own flatscreen tv and king sized bed. The bathroom is accessible from the bedroom. It is a huge bathroom, and has an oversized bathtub as well as sleek shower stall. The only slightly odd thing was that there are these sliding frosted glass windows from the master into the bathroom, which we kept shut. If you are enjoying a romantic vacation for two, this might (and I stress \"might\") be enjoyable, but ....or maybe you want to watch the tv from the bathroom toilet. Hmmm....we all thought the window was a little weird, and even when closed, it does have some gaps which don't really afford you full privacy in there. Otherwise, believe me, the suite and bathroom were spacious and amazing. The windows are floor to ceiling glass and the view was very open and lovely. The sheets were a nice high thread count - which matters to a lot of us- and were very clean. Some of the furniture surfaces in the rest of the room, such as the desk, looked like they could have been more thoroughly cleaned, but the bathroom was very clean. It was great to be able to have our tv in the bedroom, and our teen daughters with their own tv in the LR. Now for just a few other negatives....The valet parking, which is $30 a day, got lax about giving us a ticket when they took our car, and on the day we had to leave, they couldn't find our car and acted like a bunch of clowns. Victor at the Front Desk is very in the know about everything in LA and Hollywood, and so was one of the women at the front desk, but there was another one who was kind of clueless and had absolutely nothing to recommend to us as an activity on a rainy day. (Yes, it does rain in LA!! And it was 47 degrees - totally flukey) So when it came to Universal Studios, the lady at the front desk told us to avoid it, but later on I overheard someone else saying that they went to Universal Studios that day in the rain when we skipped it and \"They were totally set up to handle the rain and take care of customers in the rain.\" Fortunately, they did all agree that the place for us to go for breakfast was the Griddle (Cafe?) restaurant, and though there were a lot of people waiting, we were able to get a table really quickly and were thrilled. There was also a bit of confusion when we first got to the hotel and asked if they were still serving dinner anywhere in the hotel. The guy at the desk told us we could get light fare/snacks in the bar and then another person at the hotel said they had changed the menu in the bar, and ran off to get the new menu which was identical to the menu which was in the bar in the first place....and then guess what? They had already stopped serving food a half hour before anyway. That's okay though cause the bar smelled like a frat house though the decor was super cool and the couches and chairs were set up in a really well thought out way. We ended up going up to our room and ordering club sandwiches from room service, which, as with most hotels, took a half an hour as they warned it would. So just a little Snafu there. All in all, I would probably stay there again because it had a very cool design and was a sexy boutique hotel with nice bed linens, but they need to get a little more consistent in their valet service, concierge and staff service and maybe just a little more on the cleanliness front.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice boutique hotel.\u201d", "Author": "drivinbrad", "ReviewID": "UR126659223", "Content": "I don't normally stay at fancy places like this but when you're paying $110 on Priceline there is room for an exception.

We had not stayed at a Kimpton property before. Chose this as a nice hotel near UCLA in the Westwood area. It is a boutique hotel on Wilshire Blvd in the neighborhood of Westwood. The hotel is comfortable and I thought the room was reasonable size and well appointed. The bath was small but not so small as to be cramped.(Word of caution-the tub is slippery because there is nothing on the bottom to prevent slips which my husband had. Ask for a rubber tub mat!) The room and hotel were very clean and well maintained. They have a pool and a nice but small pool lounge area with comfortable chaises and fireplace though it was never going which was a shame since it was cool enough and the fireplace in the lobby was going. I never figured out why the pool one wasn't fired up. Staff was very helpful and had genuine smiles. The hostess in the restaurant, Raquel, was extremely nice and when we told her at breakfast that we were a bit pushed for time, she gladly just took our order and made sure everyhting was brought to us ASAP. A rare treat to meet her. Everyone else also nice (except maybe the hostess on Saturday-not very friendly but oh well). When I asked the front desk man where to go to print my boarding passes he said just tell him and he would do it and he did while I stood there. When was the last time that happened to you??

The bed was comfortable with very smooth soft sheets, and the TV was large. Being a refurbished older hotel (a Doubletree in its former existence), the bathrooms are not luxe but the fixtures and lighting were fine and I appreciated the powerful Speakman shower head - much better than rainshowers IMO - and the curved tub/shower curtain rod which made the shower more spacious. They provide funky zebra print cotton robes and newspaper during your stay. It was very quiet for the most part except for Friday night when I could hear a group of people next door chatting and playing music.

We asked the front desk staff for info on the best way to get to universal studios. They suggested we take a taxi or that we take their VIP hotel taxi service. An ordinary taxi wouldve cost us $50-60 one way and the VIP service in a private SUV was $80 one way. They did not recommend we take the public transport and didn't really help us in that matter at all so my wife did some research on the net and found rapid buses that takes you to universal studios for 3 dollars p person one way. It would've been good had the hotel staff been more knowledgable in that area. The rooms are modern and clean. The concierge wasn't available on the first two days of our stay (hence our reliance on front desk for info) but he gave us useful information for Beverly hills on our last day which is only a $10 taxi ride from the hotel.

For this reason, I am giving a rating of four stars instead of five. I previously stayed at another Kimpton property in Scottsdale, AZ where there was a similar service (but they both dropped you off and picked you up) and I used it several times.

A nice place to get together and chat with other friendly guests every night...it was always busy enough to be lively but still plenty of nice wine to go around. Enjoyed a late night drink in the bar. Pricy and ok, but it was downstairs so I can't complain too much. Free WIFI and $10 in minibar if you sign up for Kimpton program. This neighborhood is great for a comfortable, safe walk around, including in the evening. Quick, convenient, healthy few a walk away in Westwood Village. There is even a small, beautiful cemetery just a block or two away where many celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe, have been laid to rest. A kind gentleman we met during the wine reception even took us before it closed for the evening to show us around - even wonderful social guests! We received good tips and contacts from the concierge for the few free hours we had. Quick and relatively (LA speaking) cheap cab to Beverly Hills or West Hollywood.

I entrusted the hotel and the valet with my vehicle, and they took it off the premesis for their own personal use. They had no permission to do this. They used my car and my liability.

She assured me that the valet's are reponsible individuals and would not take a guest's vehicle off the premesis. She said that she would investigate the incident and call me back.

The room was large with a sliding door separating the living and bedroom area. The bathroom was exceptionally large with a jetted tub that can easily accommodate 2 people. There is a separate shower and 2 sinks. Had a unobstructed view of LA which was nice. There are 2 separate thermostat controls for the bedroom and living room. There is an Ipod dock which is great and the wireless internet was reliable and fast. Location was a bit far. We took a cab from LAX to the hotel at 1030pm and it cost about $50 (incl tip). The area is nice with a few shops walking distance. Ralphs grocery store was only about 5 blocks away in the UCLA shopping district. Went for a run around the neighborhood, the back of the hotel is mostly residential. LA is so spread out so you need a car. If you are going by cab from the hotel which we mostly did the cost one way are: Paul Getty Museum $30, Griffith Park Observatory $55, LACMA $25, Downtown Olvera St $70. Most of the cabs have little leg room (because of the security partition) so if you are tall you can barely fit inside them. You can also rent a car from Enterprise which is nearby on Santa Monica Blvd and Selby. Our cost for 2.5 day economy rental is $140. We only took the subway once and didnt go on the bus so can't comment much on transit options. On departure the hotel had a $55 flat fee option for using a private car to the airport. It was definitely worth it. Service was average. Room was always clean. However, there were a few inconsistencies. On our 7 day stay we only got the paper once. We only got wine glasses on our first day after that they never restocked them. We requested a coffee maker and mugs were restocked 4 out of 7 days. The coffee they provided for our coffee machines was terrible. It tasted quite acidic. We ordered coffee from Room Service to see if it will be better, it wasnt. Food is great. We ordered the chicken club (highly recommended) and the short ribs (really good also). However we try to order the chicken club again (its that good!) at 1030am on our last day and Room Service said NO which was highly dissapointing. My friend also emailed the concierge several times before we arrived to see if they can do something for my birthday but he got no response at all. Don't expect them to go above and beyond. Payperview movie selections were good $18 each. We didnt know till after we made them but local calls are $1.50 each (no matter the duration) and apparently calls to Anaheim are considered long distance and they are $8. The gym is ok lots of cardio machines but they only had freeweights. The pool was great. We went around 830pm, only a couple of people there. Went to BLVD16 one night and had a drink each the place was pretty much empty at 11ishpm, not much goin on there. There were always taxi cabs available in the front no matter what time of day.

I was nervous about being next to a loud dog or a room that had residual pet hair from past visitors, so I requested a pet-free floor.

The valet staff was exceptional. They were quick, friendly and had a great memory about what/where I said I was going.

The second thing that came up was when I checked into the hotel they had already checked someone in under my reservation who had a similar name (different first name but his middle name was the same as my first name). The front desk clerk supposedly fixed the problem but I knew there would be issues when I checked out. First there was no receipt under my door when I woke up in the morning. As a frequent business traveler, I hate having to stop by the front desk when I check out and for business reasons I have to get a paper receipt. Additionally when I checked my AMEX charges before leaving my room I saw a $313 charge (not an authorization but an actual charge) from the hotel. As I feared they charged the person's charges who originally checked in under my reservation to my credit card.

We had to call and get it fixed. - The hair dryer was broken - turned itself off after a few seconds. - Towels were taken away but not replenished after the first night of our two-night stay. Another call to the front desk. - An appointment we had made for spa services was done incorrectly and had to be rearranged. - There was no coffee maker in the room, so we requested one. Housekeeping took away our dirty cups after the first night but did not replace them, so no coffee the last morning of our stay. - Turn-down service was not performed the second night of our stay. - There was no pen in the room to jot down all these notes. None of these problems were significant in and of themselves and we certainly could have lived with one, two or even three of them. Front desk staff was gracious in taking care of everything and even gave us a small discount off our final bill in light of the problems with they stay.

We wanted to like the Palomar but ultimately have to say we probably wouldn't stay here again. One more note. Part of the reason we stayed here was comments from previous reviews about the ease of parking on side streets. The LA Parking Dept. has placed ridiculous restrictions on parking all over LA and there are a lot of streets where you can't leave your car at any time without a residential permit. We found a couple of streets on the south side of Wilshire where you could park on Saturday night through Monday morning but you would have to move your car Monday at 10 AM.

Unfortunately the hotel got off to a bad start; after checking reviews on here I got a nice price from a booking website I use for a king suite. The hotel website boasts that they will match any offer from an agent, but when I called the hotel I was put through then to a central bookings number for the chain who were quite rude and said no way would they match the offer, and I could have a 'take it or leave it' rate which was much higher. By the time I had finished with this phonecall etc, I went back to my agent who had no more availability of the double suite (it was a same day booking), and I had to book a standard twin room (no kings available) at the same rate as the king suite. At the check in I explained what had happened and was told that as it was a Sunday their in-house reservations person was not working, hence not being able to match the price- So dont try to use this service on a Sunday!

We do not look for problems or inconveniences in our lives. We are patient, understanding and well mannered. My family has stayed at The Palomar in Westwood a number of times. We stayed there on December 18 and 19. We had a reservation to stay there on December 31\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We had booked our room well in advance. On December 27 Caitlin Ross of Kimpton emailed my wife to confirm our reservation, which we did promptly - the same day. Ms. Ross responded the same day indicating that she looked forward to welcoming us back soon. We were looking forward to it as well. The Hotel had my wife's email and phone contact information. We arrived early on December 31 - around 1:30 pm. We intended to drop off our luggage and spend some time in LA. When we arrived on December 31, we were told by Danielle DeHostos, apparently the Manager on duty, that there was no room for us at The Palomar at all that day. There was a reservation, but the hotel was overbooked. We were told that, instead, a reservation had been made for us at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. We were told that the room had been \"comp'd\". The letter / voucher that we were given for presentation to the Sportsmen's Lodge indicated that The Palomar was prepared to pay $159 for our stay at the Sprtsmen's. We went to the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City (a 45 minute drive with traffic), and were not prepared to stay at that hotel or in that part of LA - not even for free. It is not a comparable hotel by any stretch. The Sportsmen is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. [not to our standards, with] no valet, no doorman, no secure parking, and our room was on a smoking floor that smelled like 20 years of smoking. My son has respiratory issues, so the heavy smoke smell alone made the Sportsmen unsatisfactory. There was no elevator in the building that we were apparently to stay in. We had lot of luggage that we would not have been prepared to leave in the car. The broken street sign and the falling down front entrance at the Sportsmen were indicators that the Palomar didn't think much of us or our standards. I can spare you the balance of the details, but the Sportsmen does not meet our travel requirements. Let me know if any of Kimpton's executives would ever stay at the Sportsmen's Lodge with their family - I doubt it. I can't even understand why that was presented as an option for us, or why were not asked in advance whether that would work for us. We phoned Danielle at The Palomar a couple of times over a few hours to get help making alternative arrangements. My wife left a message for her. Danielle was on the phone. Danielle did not return the call. My wife later left a voice message for Danielle. The voice message indicated that we would not be staying at the Sportsmen, expressed our disappointment, and requested a return call. Danielle never returned our calls - still to this day. This level of neglect in all of the circumstances is shocking. After finding a Starbucks where we could look up other hotels that might have a room on New Year's Eve, we eventually found a Marriott in Long Beach (an hour drive with traffic). These events wasted over 4 hours of our time between driving and searching. Our plans for a day in LA were substantially changed by these events. We still haven't received a return call from Danielle. We don't need one now. To be clear, we were always prepared to pay to stay at a reasonably nice hotel - that should have been obvious from the fact that we were prepared to pay to stay at The Palomar. Given that we were in our car with nowhere to stay on New Year's Eve by no fault of our own, we were only looking for help in finding a satisfactory hotel to stay in - we were looking to get that help from the people who would know the hotels in the area and who had put us in the sorry position that we found ourselves in. If we had had any advance notice of the problem, as opposed to a confirmation of our reservation, we would not have needed that help at all. We are quite capable of booking a hotel room. I can't fathom how you could make a reservation, and confirm it, but not honour it. I can't imagine that the problem was only discovered on our arrival, in part because there was a letter personally addressed to my wife ready on our arrival. I can't understand how we could not be alerted in advance to the problem so that we could participate in a solution at our leisure by looking for other accommodations, rather than finding out on New Year's Eve on our arrival. We had responded to your December 27 email promptly, and our reservation had been re-confirmed. We had been staying in Palm Springs, and could have easily stayed there another night and avoided so much worry and inconvenience. Instead, you opted to wait until we arrived (surely earlier than most guests) on New Year's Eve, and then left us with a ridiculous \"take it or leave it\" option, which included ignoring our calls. In the circumstances, being abandoned on New Year's Eve in LA when travelling with children was completely unsatisfactory, uncaring, callous, and far below anything that we could reasonably expect. We paid for our stay in Long Beach - it was not \"comp'd\", as Danielle would not even return our calls. Ironically, it cost us $139 per room - less than the Sportsmen's. We booked two rooms to ensure our comfort. Frankly, we were not looking for a \"comp\" anywhere. I can pay for my hotel stays without any difficulty. We were looking for help in making things right after your apparent error in making and confirming our reservation, but then finding yourselves unable to honour your commitments and unwilling to provide us with sufficient advance notice of your error. Instead, we were ignored and left to our own devices in the grossly inconvenient circumstances of finding ourselves travelling with children on New Year's Eve with nowhere to stay and trying to fix the problem while operating out of our car. There are very few things that annoy me. These events annoy me from beginning to end. It is not the failure to honour the reservation (which is bad enough) so much as the absolute neglect that ensued. You put my family to inconvenience in the worst way that you could in the circumstances, and then treated us like trash thereafter. Shame on you. If I had any notion that this was the level of customer service that you would offer when dealing with an error that was entirely yours, I would have never, ever taken the risk of doing any business with you - especially not when traveling with my children. Being ignored is never an acceptable option for me. The fact that the incident is over now does not change the fact that we were ignored in circumstances that called for your attention - it remains unacceptable. To be clear, I don't need your attention now as it will do nothing for me other than take up more of my time. Please do not send me a sincere, heartfelt apology or a token of your after the fact remorse. I have no need for platitudes or charity. I do not need to know about any remedial actions that you have taken. An acknowledgement that you have read this note would be a nice touch. The purpose of sending you this note is solely to be fair to you by letting you know what happened. I do not want anything from you. My intention is to communicate with others who might be interested in how you treat your guests, as I'm more inclined towards making the world a better place. I enjoy that luxury. I wanted you to know in advance why that was going to happen and the source of it. I would not hide behind anonymity in doing so. I won't stay at your hotels in the future. I can't take the risk of the uncertainty and neglect involved.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul, South Korea", "Title": "\u201cWorth the stay\u201d", "Author": "karsmex", "ReviewID": "UR91370950", "Content": "I was traveling with 2 kids (3 year old and 1 year old) and my nanny.

Brought it to the MOD's (manager on duty) attention and it was resolved IMMEDIATELY. With that being said, I was in Los Angeles for a short turn around trip and didn't get to the hotel until after 8:30 pm. The manager, noting my tiredness (dead on my feet tired!) offered to send a complimentary glass of wine to my room to relieve some of the day's stress. As I had looked forward to the wine hour and then missed it due to work, I, gratefully accepted! I can't tell you how much I appreciated his observation and thoughtfulness..... this is the type of service that keeps travelers returning to the Kimpton hotels time after time! Upon rising the next morning, the documents I had been waiting for had been delivered to my email in the early morning hours while I slept. As the doc's had been promised to me by the night before so I could make 500 copies by 9:00 am the next morning, the front desk offered to make the copies for me (small charge to my room) so I wouldn't have to waste time looking for a Kinko's, etc. Once again, how do you spell G-R-A-T-E-F-U-L! It's this type of service that Kimpton is known for, but this hotel went beyond the normal expectations you would associate with a Kimpton property. My hat is off to the staff!

We had three rooms and they were able to accommodate us side by side. We really liked the location, the wine hour, and the stylish rooms. Check in was efficient and the woman at the front desk was very nice. We checked out the cocktails at the bar and they were inventive and delicious. Although the hotel is stylish, it is in no way snobby- I was expecting a bit of a cold shoulder, as we were a group with 4 children, but the welcome was warm. The kids (they are 16, 11, 10, and 8) loved the print bathrobes and the fruit infused water in the lobby. My only issue, and it did kind of put a damper on the night, was an issue that happened when the kids were in the pool. It was very cold (only about 15 C) but it is colder in Canada where we were coming from, so the kids went for a swim at around 5 pm They were having a great time playing \"shark\"- with lots of squealing, splashing and laughing that goes along with fun in a pool. (I should add that we were the only people in the beautiful pool area, as it was cold). The adults were sitting and talking around the outdoor fire and the kids were in the pool playing. It was 6 pm. Suddenly, a neighbour (the hotels pool area butts up against a residential neighbourhood, but due to a high wall and clever landscaping, you don't really notice) started screaming over the wall for our kids to shut up or she would call the police. Yep, at 6 pm on a friday night, the sound of children having fun..call the police. She yelled at us a few times. A few minutes later, a Kimpton employee comes out and tells up that they had a complaint, could we keep it down. We pointed out the time, and the employee agreed but still asked us to be quiet, which kind of put us off. We left the area soon after, the fun having been sucked out of that experience. I think if you live next door to a very large hotel, and about 100 feet off Wilshire in LA, you are used to a little noise...no? I guess it was the sound of children's laughter that was the problem...I can't imagine the neighbour was sitting outside, as it was chilly. Not the hotels fault, but a drag nonetheless. Needless to say, the kids didn't want to swim again in the remaining days we were there. A good hotel, clean, stylish, and in a great location.

First impressions do count. After conducting major research, I had very high expectations of this hotel. I was under the impression that I would be given first-class service. Boy, was I wrong. I am a faithful Yelper - I review everything. I myself own a service-based business, so I always go where other travelers rave about the service. My personal pet peeve is inflexibility in service. When we checked in at noon, the girl at the front desk was pleasant. But she wasn't overly enthusiastic, nor was she particularly nice. I requested a complimentary upgrade based on availability. Before she even checked, she said, \"We can put you on the south side where it's quieter, but that's about it.\" I told her we lived in the local area, and just visiting Westwood for a short stay. No response. I told her I am a Bruin and just coming back to visit! No response. I told her that I had high expectations of this hotel, based on the reviews I read on TripAdvisor, and that I am a faithful reviewer. NO RESPONSE. (Um, isn't \"charisma\" part of the front desk job descrip?) Anyway, I finally asked if there were \"suites\" available. She said, \"Yes, but there is a upgrade fee of $99, but we can give it to you for $40\". I said ok. 5 minutes later, the upgrade fee became $ 49. (how did it go up 20% in 5 minutes?) Since I was tired, I didn't argue. I read about the $1 upgrade for all these amenities. I asked her about it. She snidely told me that that was for customers that paid online their best available rate. Then she added, \"You definitely didn't pay what the room is worth\". Ok. I admit, I booked on Priceline. But 1) So what? and 2) How does she know how much I paid? For all she knows, I overbid and am paying more! Mentioning this gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Ready to jet to my room, I asked her for my child's gift. The Palomar website touted that all kids get free \"kid gifts\". She said that they \"ran out\" of these gift packages and then gave us a basket full of dinosaurs and bracelets. My husband took a dinosaur, and I reached for a bracelet, and she gave me a look like, \"No, you can't take both\". Finally, I asked for a crib and a high chair. (The website said that you can deliver a high chair to the room for in-room dining). She said no, we don't do that. I said, \"It says you can.\" She said, \"No.\". Then this other lady said, \"Only in our restaurant\". HOW HARD IS IT TO GET A HIGH CHAIR TO A ROOM? Especially since you say you do that on your website??!? They DID later deliver the high chair, but it was like pulling teeth. The hotel is pet-friendly, which is very nice. However, a pet-friendly hotel has consequences. There is an \"animal\" smell in the halls and carpets, and there is hair in the carpets. Our room - a spa suite - was pretty spacious. The set-up was nice, but personally, I thought there was too much clunky furniture. Also, I am not particularly fond of snakeskin (the cabinets have them). The decor is definitely very modern, and I realized I prefer traditional. I am not fond of red doors and such. The bed was comfy and it was pretty clean. The location was very close to UCLA - walkable, and overall, the hotel is very nice. We paid approximately $250 with taxes for the spa suite, and I thought the value was worth it, especially in this area. $33 for parking sucks. Internet is not free. The rest of the staff that we encountered seemed very helpful and genuinely nice. I guess we just had bad luck at check-in. I don't know. I think overall, it is a nice hotel. I was overly excited to stay here after the rave reviews on service. I think my expectations were probably a bit skewed because of the reviews.

The girl at check-in had thought there were rooms ready, but the system wouldn't let her assign us to any of them due to (it seemed) the booking code (Priceline) and so we had to wander Westwood until an appropriate room was ready. The room itself was adequate, but I wouldn't describe it as especially large or luxurious. It was a nice, well-appointed room for a hotel of this category and price point. Parking for $33 sucks, as others have pointed out. I find the \"that's what all parking garages in this area charge\" response to be offensive. As a guest of a hotel, paying it a fair sum for my stay, I don't think its unreasonable that use of that hotel's garage would be discounted or included. If I eat at a restaurant in the Westwood area its not at all uncommon to get validated parking for a period of time consistent with my meal. Seems reasonable that a hotel could offer the same to its paying guests. Also, the bar closes at like 10pm or so, which seemed pretty early by LA standards.

Lounges at pool are great and albeit there is limited sun, we were able to relocate to sun. Pool was a little cool but refreshing. Service was absulutely astounding; everyone was really ready to please - so refreshing. Didn't really like having to valet park the car at $33 per day (with tax), but the service was very fast. Enjoyed the location, as it gave me an incentive to walk around the area between the hotel and UCLA; loved the walks! Was a little hard to remember the location at night when driving back - all the high rises on Wilshire look the same at night - luckily I remembered the cross-street (Selby) with the light! Room was comfie, but it got a little warm at night - finally changed the AC fan to \"hI' and this helped a lot. Used the mini-bar as my personal refrigerator (put the stuff in the closet) and liked having a room safe and easy access to ice. Would stay here again. Free internet would have been nice (instead of $10 per day). But the front desk did my searches for me, and printed me out directions as needed.

It was our first time to LA, and we found the location to be very good for sightseeing, even though LA is huge and there's no way to be close to everything. It's located in Westwood near UCLA, just a few short minutes from Beverly Hills, Bel Air and West Hollywood by car. Lots of very trendy restaurants, bars and shopping within easy driving distance, as well as some of the most exclusive neighborhoods. It's near the 405, so although it was a 30 minute drive or so to Malibu and those beaches, it was very easy to get to and not really that far for LA. Only about 20 minutes from LAX (without traffic). Only downside is that there aren't cafes or bars immediately adjacent to the hotel, but the area around UCLA is packed with these and is only a few blocks away. As for the hotel itself, I really have no complaints. We got a good deal to begin with, and upon arrival they offered to upgrade us to a suite for just $38/night, which we accepted. The suite was great - quiet, roomy, trendy and modern (like the rest of the hotel), but tastefully decorated (not obnoxious as sometimes occurs when hotels try too hard). The bed was fine, even if not the best I've ever slept in, and the living and bath areas were very spacious and well furnished (the bath had both a walk-in shower and huge jetted tub as well as double sinks). Very large flatscreen televisions located in both the bedroom and living room area. The staff was also great - very friendly, helpful and professional, even the valets. They immediately fixed the only (minor) problem we had - apparently the housekeeper forgot to leave washcloths in our room, but these were quickly brought up. Although we did not partake, the bar and restaurant looked nice, and the hotel had a complimentary wine happy hour each night we were there. Nice touch.

But on one small point which is actually important for some business travelers, the Palomar's pricing model is not such a good fit for companies like mine that budget travel in advance.

The only thing I can even remotely begin to complain about is the fact that the valet was $20 a night and that's REALLY finding something to nit pick at. I'm used to New York where parking is like selling your first born. The room was clean and spacious and more than I needed as a solo traveler and would think a group of three would have been more than comfortable. The room also had a plethora of items for travelers who forgot an item at home or simply for those that like to travel light. The staff also arranged to mail a package for me so I didn't have to lug it back East on my flight. It looks as if the hotel offers a lot of amenities but since I am not social by nature, I didn't take advantage of those. The location is near Beverly Hills shopping and that was a day gone right there ;) I was in town for a celebrity charity event held farther down on Wilshire so I was happy with the proximity of that as well. I hadn't had Jack In The Box in years and there was one a short drive away. I have horribly poor sleeping habits but 2 out of my 4 nights were good. I have nothing negative to say really. I usually stay at a Four Season if there is one in the city I'm visiting but I am now a fan of Kimpton properties and stay at them in Chicago, New York and the newly opened one in Philly. Billed as 4 stars but in my opinion a very economical hotel. I don't make a lot of money and value where I spend my dollar and was happy I got so much for a good price.

Internet service was fast and complimentary. For the service and amenities offered by the Palomar Hotel, one could not do any better even if they chose to stay at a hotel at twice the cost.

One glaring omission was the condition of our toilet. When Eric the bellhop took us to our room he noted the toilet was making a strange noise and suggested we call the hotel engineer to have a look at it. I told him we would when we left for dinner since before that we would use the bathroom to get ready. This was the first opportunity for your hotel staff to rectify the situation. Eric could have moved us to a new room immediately since we hadn't unpacked yet. He did not make the offer. We subsequently discovered that the toilet was not working at all. When we returned to the room (after the engineer supposedly fixed the toilet) that night with two friends the toilet worked sporadically, but at least after several attempts the toilet always flushed. The next morning the toilet broke again this time permanently and AFTER I had already used it. My girlfriend and I had to use the shower with the toilet smelling and the toilets in the lobby downstairs before going out for the day. The front desk said they would send up the engineer again to fix it this time. I inquired about packing up our stuff and moving to another room but the person at the front desk insisted we try fixing it again. This was the second opportunity for someone at the hotel to adequately deal with the problem. When my girlfriend and I came back to the room again that afternoon I tested the toilet one time before using it so I would not be subjected to the humiliation of using the toilet only to have it not work for a second time. It only flushed once and then stopped working. This was the THIRD time that our toilet had broken after being looked at by the engineer TWICE. I spoke to the manager on duty and requested a room change which at that point was granted. It was the THIRD time before my request to change room was granted. We had already been in the room 24 hrs and had to re-pack our things that by this time were in various places around the room. I was the one who booked this hotel and vouched for its status as a \"luxury boutique hotel\" and quite frankly I was very embarrassed. A working toilet is hardly a luxury. I just signed up to be an In touch member with every intention of staying at Kimpton Hotels in the future but this horrible experience and the chronic lack of anyone with the ability to deal with it immediately would be enough to ensure I never stay at another.

The large, beautifully appointed bathroom was equipped with two sinks, a wonderful large shower, and a brand new, large soaking tub with jets. To save time, we ate one dinner and several breakfasts in the hotel's restaurant, which was great although a bit pricey. There are less expensive alternatives nearby. The hotel has a small fitness facility equipped with good treadmills, ellipticals and a recumbent bike and handweights and mats. It is clean and bright. We also swam laps in the rooftop pool, which is small but clean and adequate. You do have to contend with traffic sounds, but I had no trouble falling asleep in the sun on a comfortable chaise lounge after touring LA all morning.

Nicely cleaned and well maintaned, although slightly dusty (I've noted the comment about the slightly dated A/C, which may have been a factor). That said, when the room was cleaned on the first day, all sorted. Good quality bed linens, and nice bed. Bathroom nice size - could be bigger, but couldn't they always, eh?!? Comms provisions were very good also - free wireless internet (if you sign up as an In-Touch member, which was free!), and a 42\" TV with HD broadcasts, so you can watch TV in crystal clear quality. The only downside to this was that the HD signal kept cutting out on numerous days, which I queried at the time with housekeeping, and was told it was the inclement weather causing it. Funny how it worked fine in the bar area though! (A footnote to this - I raised this issue with the staff on my return to the UK, and had a very nice response from the Hotel Manager offering his apologies and a free upgrade next time, which seems very fair). All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and assisted where possible - happily lent us umbrellas to use during our stay, as we had 5 days of torrential rainstorms! We didn't eat in the restaurant here, so cannot comment on the quality of the food, but had a drink in the bar, where the staff were attentive and professional. The location of the hotel is great - if you're not hiring a car, it's a 5-minute walk from Westwood village, with an abundance of decent restaurants, diners, bars and a couple of great cinemas. All close to UCLA, so a nice crowd and a great vibe wandering around in the evening. Not too \"manic\" as you would expect in LA, but still very pleasant. Getting around was also easy - close to the 405 if you drive, and not far from I-10 also. If you're on foot, the 720 Metro Rapid bus stop is only 5 mins walk also, which takes you all the way along Wilshire Blvd (Eastbound) for $1.25 - a bargain, and very quick. In the 4 days we didn't have a car (we had one for the final 2 days), getting about was much easier than we expected, so save some money, give the legs a workout and get the bus!

Street parking seemed quite restricted and I'm not sure if there are cheaper parking lots in the neighborhood, so budget extra for that cost.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201clove the kimptons\u201d", "Author": "akltexas", "ReviewID": "UR42167962", "Content": "as usual a great experience with a kimpton hotel, the chain has become our preferred choice of hotels when traveling.

I have rarely seen a hotel with staff so happy and fun! I know this sounds strange in a review but it is the truth! The valet are all smiles and jocularity and the front desk check in..esp Brandon..I may have this name wrong if so sorry..the tall very handsome African American with a smile for miles, obviously very proud of the hotel, always has something entertaining to say that makes me feel very welcome... sort of like like being at a good friend's weekend condo instead of a hotel. Check in has always been a breeze and there is just something about this place that does not feel like a hotel. I have stayed in both a suite as well as a regular guest room. The beds are extra comfy with their piles of pillows,duvets, high thread count linens, and lux bed throws. There are animal print robes [free to wear during your stay] hanging in the closet as well as socks and pjs for those who want to start their shopping early! [you can purchase everything]. Each time I have requested a room on a higher floor overlooking the more peacefull neighborhood of Westwood rather than the busier side which looks out onto Wilshire. I have always been accommodated. The views are wonderful! Now, if you have the extra cash to stay in one of their suites , it is well worth the splurge. Two nice sized rooms, flat screen tvs in both, a wet bar,stocked mini fridge, with a gigantic bathroom replete with huge soaking tub,double vanities, and a spacious walk in shower for two. It is as nice a bathroom as I have had in a hotel. As for the regular guest rooms, they are a bit on the smallish side, but that doesnt dampen the experience of their uber elegant/hip feeling of style. I also like their pool area, which, like the hotel, has a cozy feel to it with a large privacy wall,lush greenery, and a wonderful wrap around sofa that stretches out along the shaded wall. There are also abundant chaises available for those who wish to soak up the California sun. There is nothing pretentious about this place, which I really like! The location is nice. You are away from the typical touristy hustle bustle of Hollywood Blvd.and the fussy 'hoi paloi' of the Rodeo BH area. [yet you are not far if you wish to venture that way] There is the great Westwood area about three to four easy walking blocks from the hotel. It is a wonderful mix of upscale eateries,sidewalk bistros and cafes, trendy clothing stores, as well as an Urban Outfitter,a Whole Foods,movie theatres and of course the beautiful UCLA campus. I understand it is an area that has recently been refurbished. Indeed, you will still see some of the signs of the older neighborhood, a scruffy street person or two, but it has a vibrancy to it reminiscent of smaller university towns all over the country. About 2 short blocks from the hotel..hang a left as you leave the lobby, there is a great coffee shop with killer breakfasts and good lunch fare, also a good place to purchase soft drinks and snacks at far more reasonable prices than the mini bar or hotel restaurant. If there was one thing negative about this hotel, it is the restaurant,which is also where the room service food comes from. Not so great and exhorbitantly..I mean off the wall expensive!!! I dont mind paying if the quality is there but sadly they do need to revamp both their menu and prices. They were about the same as the Beverly Wislhire Four Seasons..need I say more? The hotel is such a great experience and so well run it is ashame to have to give it a low mark for the food. I will have to say that the last time we stayed there, I called for reservations thru Kimpton In Touch of which I am a member [it is free and worth joining bc you earn points with each stay that allows you to build up enough for free stays and exclusive offers], and I was given an absolutely fantastic rate [better than any other hotel chain I called like Marriott and Hilton both of which I am an honor awards point member]. Along with the reduced summer rate, we were given four free beers a night,[we stayed three nights this trip, a week last time] which we could also order from room service at no additional charge. Pretty nice even though I am a wino! They also have an afternoon wine reception in the lobby as well as coffee and tea in the mornings.[I actually saw a lady in her leopard bathrobe getting her coffee..she too must feel comfy here at this hotel!]. As we checked out, our car was brought to us right away with the usual happy nods and greetings. One of the valets noticed that my daughter's car had a white scrape on the side, which she promptly told the concerned valet, she had done herself in her apartment garage. He actually took the time to bring out a special polishing cream that immediately made the scratch disappaear..wiping at it and polishing it to a shiny new sheen!

Our first impression was quite negative due to the front desk staff. They seemed stressed and overwhelmed, and were borderline rude to guests. One of the receptionists, Autumn, was particularly huffy and spoke to us loudly, in very condescending tones. When we checked out, the situation was similar -- not a smile, not a \"how was your stay?\", nothing. They need better training in guest relations. Luckily our room was very nice. It was on the small side, but nicely appointed. We especially liked the chaise by the window. The bathroom clearly hadn't gotten much attention from housekeeping; there was a curly hair next to the sink and we were only given one bar of soap, presumably to share between the sink and the shower/tub. The drains in both the tub and sink were clogged, so we had to call maintenance to fix the issue (which they did quickly, although with no apologies from management). Some previous reviews had mentioned that the air conditioning is loud, which is true. But that actually worked in our favor. It created \"white noise\", masking any kind of noise from the other guests. While it's common at hotels to hear doors opening/closing, TVs, people talking in the halls, etc. -- we heard absolutely nothing and slept really well at the Palomar. Oh, and the bed was extremely comfortable, too. We got a great night's sleep. Unlike other Kimptons, they do their wine hour in the hotel bar. There's a very reasonably priced appetizer happy hour menu (in the $3-$5 range) to go along with the free wine, which is generously poured. The pool is small but has a nice decor and good music playing (not too loud). However, in the time we were there, no staff came by to pick up the towels/glasses that had been left by previous guests.

Let me start writing by listing some of the pros and then cons. Pros: clean room, comfortable bed, good parking valets, free internet for intouch members, nice towels, coffee in lobby in the early AM (on the con side, maybe they could serve it later on weekends). Free wine hour (too bad it was Fetzer) Cons: ( all of which combined, make this hotel a 3 star) 1. Upon check-in, the valet took my bag, but not wife's. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 2. We reserved a vista deluxe room but were given a room with a view of another building (not a vista). When I asked for what I reserved, the helpful valet (not the one who took our bags) made a call and had us moved to the type of room we reserved. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 3. Looked for the concierge on 3 separate occasions, but he or she was never at their desk. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 4. Asked the front desk clerk for an LA Weekly to see what was going on in town, Her response \"we don't carry it because it would be too hard to keep in stock.\" It is a free paper, had come out that morning, should be available for guests in a 4 star hotel. The person who made the decision to not have it available to guests seems to have missed the point that it is hard to keep in stack because guests want to use it. Also asked for a Sunday paper at 10:00 AM and desk clerk seemed to be annoyed that I didn't get my butt up at 8:00 AM so that I could ensure I got one. Gruffly went to the back office and got me a copy. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 5. Free internet for intouch members was spotty and hotel was less than helpful in troubleshooting. This could easily happen in a 4 star. 6. Location sucks if one wants to walk to breakfast. I know it is LA and everyone drives, but it would be nice to walk to coffee in the morning. In all honesty, I grew up in LA and knew the location before booking, but think that others that are not familiar should have this info. 7. No and/or poor food or drink service at the pool. Went to the pool thinking there would be poolside service. After about 20 minutes of hanging out I went to the front desk to ask about food and drink service and to ask that the used towels in the pool area be cleaned up. I was informed that there is no regular drink service at the pool, but that I could order room service and have it delivered to the pool. I asked them to send a waiter. 20 minutes later the waiter arrived. I tried to order a margarita with a specific kind of tequila, but the waiter wasn't sure if they had it. I offered him three different options and asked him to bring me one of the 3 options. 15 minutes later he arrived not with my drink, but with a list of the tequilas they did have and then asked me what kind I wanted in my \"mojito\" At that point I cut my losses, informing the waiter that mojitos are not made with tequila, that I had wanted a margarita, and that it I no longer wanted anything because I had little faith that my drink would be correct or in my hand in any reasonable amount of time. This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. 8. Upon check out, valet once again took my bag but not my wife's. I am 6'4\" and 230 pounds, my wife is 5'7 and 135 pounds. Who do you think needed help with their bag? This shouldn't happen in a 4 star. All in all, this hotel looks like a 4 star, but IMO the difference between a 3 and 4 star hotel are in the details, which the staff and management of the Palomar have neglected.

It was a 1 BR king suite. Everything in the room was typical of a Kimpton hotel, very stylish and whimsical... The bathroom was OPEN to the bedroom, so if this is not something you're entirely comfortable with, just be mindful... my wife and I were fine with it though. Wine hour was very nice and classy in the lobby. They did not have a selection of bottled beer as the Kimpton Hotel Marlowe in Cambridge, MA has (another great hotel) -- this would be a great touch for the non-wine drinkers in the crowd. Restaurant was good, we ate there one night and were impressed with the food and service. My only gripe would be the charge for mandatory valet parking. I realize this hotel charges virtually the same rate as every other hotel in the area, so it's not really a ding on them. More on the fact that you have an area of the city that is pretty much unwalkable (but where in LA really is walkable?), where you're required to have a car, and yet you have to pay an exorbitant fee for parking... but I digress.

We arrive around 2pm saturday and score a perfect parking spot right in front of the hotel, so we dont have to pay the $32 for valet parking! We go to our room which winds up being #1618 and its next to the ice machine and very close to the elevator. Try to ask for a room away from the elevators, as the \"ding ding\" noise when it stops on the floor is loud enough to hear in the room. It woke me up a couple of times and i thought it was an alien spaceship lol. Wine hour was not in the lobby/living room like all the other kimpton properties I have patroned, but instead in the restaurant. So we enter and head to grab some Sangria and then the guy serving snobbishly asks us for our room keys! I pull it out and show him and he pours us some Sangria. Lo and behold, as more guests arrive, NONE of them are asked for their room key. I'd hate to think it was due to our age or our race, but LA is known to be snobby and stuck up, and I could expect this at Les Deux but not at a hotel! Restaurant had a happy hour for appetizers so we ordered some sliders and calimari, which were both very good. I would try a meal at the Blvd 16 restaurant if we come back. Checked out the pool area and its really small, so dont have high expectations coming in. Room was pretty nice, TV had lots of channels, was able to catch a boxing match on HBO and the nba playoff game. The View was nice, we were on 16th floor so you could see a ways a way. Only 2 minor issues in that it took a week or so for the difference in the lower rate to be applied to my credit card and a few days after check out I checked my statement and I had been billed for something from the bar. We did not take anything from the honor bar, and so had to call the property.

It is very close to the airport, a short drive to Hollywood/Beverly Hills etc., a slightly longer drive to the beaches - where else do you want to go? We walked everyday into the Westwood neighbourhood for great food/drinks and we also saw the opening of the Transformers movie and a concert by Lincoln Park all walking distance from our hotel. To the reviewers who complained about parking costs - this is LA - it costs money to park at every hotel, restaurant etc. - just get used to it. We also got a discount on the valet parking because we hired a Prius which was nice. To the reviewers who complained about the service - maybe you were rude and did not get the best service possible as we did, especially the lovely smiley valet parking attendants - they were so friendly and helpful and very sweet with our children.

It was for a two night stay. I found the accommodations to be extremely nice. The room was clean, the facility well kept, and the staff polite and helpful. You had your usual city noise that one would expect, but other than that, nothing more. The location was wonderful for us as our class was held just blocks away and within walking distance. The parking we used was valet, and we found them to be quick and courteous at all times. A Continental breakfast was included each day that consisted of juice, coffee, tea, a choice of bread and a pastry item. This was served at their onsite restaurant, which we did not have time to visit during lunch or dinner service. My only problem came with some missing cash that I had left in my luggage in the closet. I reported this to the front desk and mentioned to them that my door also had a problem with not shutting tightly and it required some extra tugging and jiggling. I doubt that the staff had anything to do with this, and most likely, after it had been cleaned the door probably hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut tightly and someone had taken advantage of that. They assured me they had never had this happen before and would have someone look at the door the next day. In retrospect, I should have placed my cash in the safe, but in all of my years of travel this was a first. I was grateful it was a small amount. I checked out the next morning, but hopefully, the door was indeed fixed. Also, I checked the credit card account I had used for this hotel a few days later and found a charge on it. When I called I was told it was for an item from the mini-bar. I informed them I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even received the key for the mini-bar and they told me it would be removed and it was. They were very gracious and apologetic. I mention this only so that you check your account after you leave to make sure you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been mistakenly charged for something as well.

Twice while we were there and asked questions regarding a charge on your room that we were unaware of, we got the \"well this is a 4 star hotel and this kind of charge is quite normal for this type of a hotel.\" I thought that kind of attitude was unneccsary, as we stay in 4 and 5 star resorts frequently and it had nothing do do with the unauthorized charge on our card. They finally rectified the unauthorized charge (with an attitude), but this kind of behavior was constant throughout the staff, and was just unnecessary. Also, I'm not sure if it was just an issue when we were staying there, but the TV's had very limited channels. Some of the few channels that actually worked had signal problems and very bad reception. We found this annoying when you just wanted to watch TV before bed and relax. They mention how amazing their hotel is constantly while you're there, one would think that having basic, working TV channels would be standard.

Parking is steep at $30 a day, but the valets are attentive and bring your car around promptly. These are all small details, but things that the we thought The Palomar truly overlooked.

This hotel was originally another brand and was recently refurbished as the Palomar. My room was attractive and quiet. The temperature control was good and the bed was very comfortable. The work station in the room was comfortable and efficient. Each morning the hotel had coffee in the lobby. Not just any coffee, but about the best coffee I've ever had. Each evening during my stay the hotel also had a wine hour in the lobby with different wines each night.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "MikeSD001", "ReviewID": "UR22459466", "Content": "I made reservations at the Palomar partly because of the good reviews here. It exceeded our expectations. Nice room, everything looked new and spotlessly clean. Neat modern arty decor. We got a complimentary upgrade to a room with beautiful view of LA from the 17th floor. The bed was big and comfy with a bunch of fluffy pillows and a really warm comforter (actually too warm). Most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in a hotel. The staff was great. We didn't need them much, but they were friendly, helpful and efficient when we did. The two nights we were there, the room was extremely quiet. Probably due to the high floor we were on and not many people being around. Some people have noted that the A/C is very noisy. In our room, it wasn't. We could hear it turning on, but the sound was not loud by any stretch. Nice touches - 42\" LCD HD TV, large room safe, plush bath robes, high quality shampoo/conditioner. The hotel is in a good location. We caught a movie at the theatre a safe two block walk away. Or you can walk to Westwood Village. Drive down Wilshire Blvd. and there are a ton of stores and restaurants. Hop on the freeway to the Getty Center (which we did and had a great time) or Santa Monica Beach. A few nits - you cannot control the water flow in the sink faucet, only the temperature. More than a few times, I ended up splashing water all over the place due to the high water pressure. You hang up towels to reuse, but they get replaced anyway. Parking is $30 a day, valet only. That didn't bother me much though given the low room rate. We got the AAA rate of $161 a night on a holiday weekend. What a great deal! We really enjoyed our stay.

Overall we enjoyed our time here and it offered good value, but we would not want to stay at this hotel for more then a night or two. If you have stayed at a Kimpton hotel, you know the room d\u00c3\u00a9cor is always unique and a little different. At this location, we did not love the look of the room. The colors were mostly black and brown, with some splashes of brighter colors thrown in. There were too many patterns in the room including a snake skin pattern on the face of the dresser. The room came across as too dark and busy, and not very relaxing. As others have mentioned, the room was a little small as was the bathroom. South facing rooms have nice views, North facing rooms overlook busy Wilshire Boulevard and condos. I believe the hotel used to be a Doubletree before Kimpton took over, and was not built from the ground up as a new hotel. The rest of the hotel is pretty nice with a good boutique hotel feel with a little clublike atmosphere thrown in. We did not use the restaurant but we did check out the pool. The pool is decent size but the pool area is long, narrow, and lined up very close to the building. There are two attractive conversation areas but only five or six oversized lounge chairs for sitting in the sun at a hotel with over 200 rooms. We were at the pool late in the afternoon so some were available, but this is not a hotel for very many people to hang out by the pool. Overall The Palomar is a nice hotel with a central location. The staff was also very friendly and the happy hour is a nice touch rarely found at big city hotels. But not everyone will like the rooms and in a great weather city like LA, the pool setup is not large enough for a hotel this size.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA,Dalllas,Tampa,Miami", "Title": "\u201cSimply the Best!!!\u201d", "Author": "yuh8n", "ReviewID": "UR21805908", "Content": "This is a world class property.

The lobby has a nice sophisticated-but-comfortable vibe and there are all types who stay here - couples, families, business travellers, and those on trips with friends. And there are also pets - we were startled by a beautiful golden retriever when we got off the elevator one morning! Service is very good overall - attentive, friendly and very helpful. The concierge, Paul, made some great recommendations for a Saturday night out including AOC, which we didn't realize until afterwards was such a highly-regarded restaurant. He also gave tips on when to arrive at Bar Marmont so that we could be sure to enjoy the Saturday night vibe and miss the line! A few small things. Room service, although 24 hour, is expensive and the restaurant closes around 10 or 11, so come prepared if you get in on a late flight! There is also a very limited night menu (from 11 PM or 12 to 6 AM). Also seems that there are a fair number of new staff right now. They are all trying hard and doing a great job but some of them don't yet have a good knowledge of the area/sights and some processes - like an early morning check-out - were a little slow. But everyone is keen and friendly - the most important thing. This hotel is in a nice area but you do have to walk a bit to get to shopping, etc. But it's LA so to be expected - just about anyone visiting the city should be prepared to rent a car. Valet parking is $30/day. A little pricey but definitely cheaper than the downtown areas of a lot of major cities - San Fran, NY.

Only thing missing was a balcony to enjoy the streetlife or hotel view and the WiFi reception was unfortunality rather bad. But nevertheless this hotel would be my choice again next time (hopefully again with a good Expedia offer 'cause their rack rates are kinda pricy for me, though worth the money). Final remark is that the hotel parking is also pricy (USD 30 overnight) and they only offer valet service. As an European I'd prefer to do the parking myself (although the valets are most attentive) but I simply find self parking more comfortable.

Public transport in LA is finally starting to improve and the stopping bus service down Wilshire (to the heart of Beverly Hills)stops very close to the hotel. The rooms are really comfortable and functional, WiFi was faultless, but as some reviewers have noticed some AC units seemed over noisy (only a problem in my second room). Complimentary morning coffee and tea in the lobby were a nice touch. I didn't have an opportunity to enjoy the wine tasting, but passing through the lobby at that time there seemed to be plenty of happy punters. The GM, John Douponce, used to be at that other tripadvisor/LA favourite Le Montrose, at which I have also stayed, and it seems that with this property the idea is to have take a 'boutique hotel' design style and bring it to a larger space.

All of the distinctive Kimpton touches are there - evening wine reception, premium morning coffee, very comfortable bed, L'Occitane toiletries, great upscale restaurant on-site. The Westwood-area hotel is easily accessed on Wilshire Blvd., which is good, since most area restaurants and shops will require a drive (or at least a very long walk). Everything looked new, which makes sense as the hotel was extensively renovated and has only been open as a Palomar for three months. The staff seemed friendly and eager, but unpolished (I generally don't expect to hear the terms 'cool' and 'awesome' being used by the staff during check-in). The rooms seemed somewhat smaller than usual, but were clean, and included both very nice details (42\" flat panel television, chaise lounge, ample lighting with touch controls) and disappointing shortcuts (no HD on the TV, cheapish furniture). During my stay I was able to enjoy a dinner at BLVD 16, the combination restaurant/lounge just off the lobby. The food was good, the service was very attentive and the atmosphere was festive--the restaurant was still quite busy at 10 at night.

I've stayed at most of the $400+ per night L.A. hotels, and for less than half of the price, the Palomar was exceptional. To echo bocafive's experience, we enjoyed the convenience of the location, fantastic value, quality and style of the renovations given it's an older hotel, the friendly and efficient staff, and free wireless access. The a/c might be a little loud as others have said, and the walls are on the thin side, but neither of those issues did anything to diminish the quality of our stay. The one thing I wasn't expecting was the huge wine reception crowd in the lobby when we arrived, which made it very loud and chaotic, but it was much more peaceful and quite attractive environment later in the evening when we returned from dinner. This location is fantastic for anyone visiting UCLA or Beverly Hills businesses, as the BH border is just a couple of minutes up Wilshire. Kimpton seems to be pretty generous with perks for its repeat guests --- I got a ridiculously low rate with free parking via an email offer as a prior Palomar San Francisco guest. I'd suggest that anyone considering a stay here (or at any Kimpton) sign up for their special offer email in case something like this is offered again. Overall --- sure, I'd rather stay at the Peninsula or the Beverly Wilshire, but I can only swallow their big rates on more special occasions.

Great linens, great big screen television, desk, FREE wifi, and a cool bathroom with stylish sink/ammenities. Of note, the hotel offers a free wine hour in the evening which was well attended, the lobby is eclectic with a fireplace, very comfortable. Hotel security was visable and reassuring. I did not get to the pool or restaurant. I want to give kudos to the front desk staff. My son and I went to Westwood village for a movie and could not find a cab to take us back to the hotel. I called the desk and they dispatched a cab to us in just a few minutes. When we were checking out they gave us detailed information to get to the Orange County airport. Great job!

The staff was very nice and accomodating. The problem is the hotel itself not the people. It is old and outdated. The rugs in the room were threadbare and stained. We all wore socks in the room always except when sleeping. The TV was old and big. I requested a refrigerator and it was old and scratched and so large it took up almost half the room. Years ago the hotel must have been lovely but it has apparently been left to deteriorate. There are alot of homeless people on West Baltimore Ave. which is why you need to ask for a key to the restrooms in the downstairs lobby. The bar does not get the local baseball games. We left Camden Yards that Monday night in the 8th inning and stopped for a nightcap at the deserted lobby bar. Apparently the owner will not spring for the fee so the guests can watch local Major League baseball games. As a total experience the hotel was not terrible considering we were out most of the time enjoying all Baltimore has to offer but I would advise anyone to shop around and compare.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton Junction, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed in the Radisson Lord Baltimore\u201d", "Author": "abcd1120", "ReviewID": "UR128084052", "Content": "I really wanted to give the Lord Baltimore a more positive review. I would certainly give five stars to their staff, which is professional and friendly and eager to help. Kudos to Daniel and Russell and Josh. They were terrific. Although the lobby area is exquisite, our room was a disappointment. Hotwire assigned us this hotel for an attractive rate, but after reading TripAdvisor reviews I was quite concerned. I called the hotel the week before our arrival, and asked for a clean and quiet room on a high floor. Upon arrival we were upgraded gratis to a business-class room on the 14th floor. Even there, the level of housekeeping left me uncomfortable \u2013 used soap was left in the bathroom, and the overall impression was that a thorough cleaning was needed. The wallpaper was stained. The bolster pillows on the bed were old and lumpy and unusable, but there were three smaller pillows that were fine. Our sleep-number bed was comfortable enough. The room had benefitted from some updates, including some bathroom renovations and new carpet. Because the room faced the street, it really wasn\u2019t completely quiet, but we were able to sleep through the street sounds. Perhaps I should have gone back to the lobby to address these issues, but we were tired from travelling and on our way to meet up with friends for dinner. Based on the excellent rate that we received on Hotwire, and the fact that they had placed us in a business class room, I\u2019m not sure we could have done much better. I am glad that we chose to pay the extra money for valet parking. After coming back from dinner at night, I am not sure how comfortable I would have been walking in the area around the hotel. The Radisson could have a beautiful hotel in the Lord Baltimore, but it would require quite an infusion of cash. Its five-star staff deserves a property it could be proud of. The moral of the story: I have always had good results using Hotwire, but I wouldn\u2019t take a Hotwire three-star hotel in the Baltimore Inner Harbor/Downtown area again.

The bed was comfortable however; the curtains on the window next to the bed had a mystery substance all over it. The drawers to the nightstand when opened just fell right out. The bathroom was no better the toilet ran and was hard to flush and the tub was five shades of dungy. The air in the room made a humming noise the entire time it ran. To top it all off the next morning we were relaxing in the bed and we heard housekeeping tap on the door so my husband got up to go over to the door and she came on in and when she saw we were still there she said \"oh sorry sorry\" and shut the door. So check out was at noon. My husband got in the shower at 11:15. At 11:25, housekeeping again knocked on the door. I got up and answered it. There was a woman with a vacuum. I said we would be leaving shortly. She held up one finger and started hollering for somebody else to come. Another woman comes down and says housekeeping...Yeah I get that. I said we would be leaving shortly. I said check out is at noon. And she just stared at me so I shut the door. If you want people out before noon make check out time before noon!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: The front desk staff and the staff at the breakfast were great and very helpful. The location was good, in the vicinity of the aquarium. That being said, the room itself was incredibly disappointing. The bathroom was dated and there was a significant amount of mildew in the corner of the tub. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling and mildewy as well. The bedroom felt dingy and dated. The fire sprinkler in the middle of the bedroom ceiling protruded out of a gaping hole... not very comforting! For $200 a night, I found this hotel to be a terrible value. I told the front desk staff person about the quality of the room upon checkout. He agreed that the room was unacceptable when I showed him the photo of the bedroom fire sprinkler posted here, and he refunded my $12 breakfast.

The staff is still very pleasant, helpful, attentive but a number of little issues takes away from a more pleasant experience overall. Issues this time around: what's the first thing most people do when they get into a hotel room?--throw themselves on the bed, right? Well, I did just that because I was tired after a long 2hr drive...but what happens?? 1. I almost fell off the darn thing! I called the front desk and right away they said they'd sent up an \"engineer\". He came up within 5 minutes. He knew right away what was wrong with the bed--it was off whatever holds it up underneath. He admitted it (when I asked) if it got that way from the maids/housekeepers making the bed and not putting it back in place. So, obviously this happens all the time. Solution--have the maids report when this happens so it can be corrected prior to a guest coming into a room!!!! 2. 1 tiny trash can in the entire room! 3. the freakin' sleep number beds suck--how many not so great reviews do they need to read to understand they need new beds??!!! I barely slept because I was so uncomfortable. 4. Got up in the middle of the night (b/c I couldn't sleep) and went to the bathroom--the light was sooo bright I had to turn it off and go in the dark! Solution? Either put a red light in the bathroom or even a simple night light! 5. The tiles caulking/tub were a bit cruddy. 6. the darn fan in the vent drove me crazy all nite as well! 7. and the vent in the bathroom didn't come on at all! Other than those things, everything else was fine!! They're using a new parking garage--the \"down under\" garage (under the Fallon Federal Building) for $15/24hr--don't be lazy don't do valet, it'll cost you an extra $16!!! To get into the garage you have to go around about 3-4 blocks but to walk to the hotel after you park is right across the street on Baltimore St entrance. Plenty of places in the surrounding area to get food so don't do room service. Fridge and microwave are extra. I stayed in Baltimore because I couldn't get a room in DC for $50 or under.

Today is Mar. 13, 2012. hello, please let me start my comments by saying your staff was very friendly and helpful, however your aging building is suffering from deferred maintenance that is starting to affect the guest satisfaction experience. Several small incidental deficiencies unfortunately added up to make me want to take time out of my busy day to make these comments... First day, the key card generator did not work, keys were not available and the busy staff was escorting guests up to the room one by one. After running in the cold weather I spent over 15 mins. 2/21/12, 5-pm waiting for an escort while freezing in my sweaty outfit. For a full day your wireless internet 2/21-2/22 did not work and I could not access my office files thus losing productivity. After internet was restored the printer in the business center would not print, an airline boarding pass in my case impacting travel plans. The toilet in 721 was not 'plugged', but a slow drain resulted in multiple flushes for solid matter. Also, in that bathroom I observed several small roaches on the floor. Finally, I obtained a serious 'cephalic' bacterial foot infection in your shower starting on Wed 2/22 probably due to inadequate cleaning that has required doctors care and possible hospitalization if these costly prescribed antibiotics don't work. As nice as the folks were, I am afraid I could not recommend this hotel. Glenn R. Tanner, PE Principal Engineer Marketable Ventures 23440 Hawthorne Bl.

PARKING: Hey guys who keep complaining about parking....don't valet park anything. Just pull up at the front of the hotel and ask the lady where the UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE is at. There is one within about a 2 minute walk of this hotel, it's marked with a giant blue \"P\" and you can get a weekly pass for like $10/day. I always use that one because I stay 2 weeks at a time in Baltimore. This hotel though old, has a lot of things going for it. Some good features/things about it are: 1) Location--15 seconds walk from the Metro, 15 minute walk from the Inner Harbor (aquarium, some restaurants, boat rides, etc. Edo sushi is awesome, the tapas place too has a great view, and the marble slab ice cream is yummy, and there's also a Phillips there in Inner Harbor), 3 min. walk from bushes where your dog can go potty. 2) Johns Hopkins discounts, Military Discounts, Govt. Discounts, you name it, they probably have some sort of discount for you. So, ask!!! There are also FREE SHUTTLES TO AND FROM AIRPORT AND JOHNS HOPKINS (multiple stops at different parts of JHU including the hospital). 3) Pet friendly rooms are available. However, if your dog messes things up, there are additional costs ontop of the usual pet charge. 4) If you want microwave and fridge, YOU CAN REQUEST THEM. They cost a bit extra but are worthwhile, if you plan on staying there a couple of days, because you can put left-overs in the fridge and re-heat...but if I were you, I wouldn't rent the microwave if you're in the Plaza level. If you're at the plaza level they have a community microwave that they keep quite clean. I usually just fix a cup of coffee for myself while I wait for my food to heat up. 5) They have PLAZA rooms. Get these rooms if at all possible. They have an awesome breakfast that includes OJ, cranberry juice, milk, coffee, scrambled eggs, grits, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit (blackberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, honey dew, banana, apple, etc.), yogurt, free waters you can bring with you, cereals, pastries, etc.. Amazing breakfast, and someone is always there in case you need anything during the breakfast. They also have \"Happy Hour\" in the evenings, which includes finger foods, wine, crackers, cheese, misc. munchies for free. You can also ask em for decaf. This is only available on the plaza levels; there are two floors. There is also TV, nice comfy couches, it's just a great area to hang out and get what you need done, and still be comfy doing it. It saves a lot of money on breakfast and dinner too, if you just eat a big lunch and eat there for breakfast and dinner. 6) There's a FREE LAUNDRY machine at the EXERCISE room. Bring your own detergent and you've got laundry covered. Yeah I know, weird place to have laundry right? But oh well, it works just fine and you can plop your clothes in there, exercise while you guard your clothes. There's already clean towels down there too, so you don't have to wait for room service to bring stuff up, you can grab a few on your way back. 7) You can request INTERIOR rooms if the street noise bothers you. 8) Management is pretty responsive; if you have problems, call em up, they're quick to correct it. I come here at least twice a year, two weeks at a time, and I've never had problems with the management being discourteous or not caring. 9) You can order food at any time of the night or day just about. Their crab and avacado appetizer is good; I don't remember the name of it but it's realy yummy and the price is good and it's quite a bit of crab. There's also a sort of general-convenience-store near the lobby sort of part of the hotel, and a coffee shop also sort of part of the hotel. The convenience store guy is really, really friendly and kind. He can answer a lot of random questions about Asian food and also about what's fun to do and at a good price in Baltimore. I ask him all the time, and he seems to have unlimited patience though I didn't buy a single thing from his store; he's just really pleasant and helpful. 10) They have a business center area you can do work/homework at. Overall, for the price it is at, it really is a pretty good deal; you just have to remember certain little things, like the underground instead of valet parking, the plaza level, the refridgerator, the free laundry, etc. It's cheaper than anything else you will find that is this clean and with management this eager to please. Yes they are an older hotel, but they truly try hard to please you; just tell them how.

So we went along with hopes that the complaints were erroneous and any issues we encountered would be minor. Not only were we extremely pleased with the proximity of hotel to everything we wanted to do in our two days, but our room was very nice! We were also very pleasant to the folks who checked us in, so that might be why they gave us a corner room when they couldn't accommodate our courteous request for a king room, if possible. There was another one of those numerous weddings going on (like in so many of the other reviews). The place was nearly full up! The golden rule \"treat others as you would like them to treat you\" goes a long way! The only thing that I have read in the negative and where I concur is the windows were dirty. And our sleep number bed wasn't working. But we got a good night's sleep, anyway! I like duvets and lots of pillows. All good! Yes, the area around the hotel can be dodgy at night, but we walked from shopping around the inner harbor to dinner nearby the hotel without any unsettling incidents. We were back by 11:30, and surprisingly met in the lobby by a uniformed office who wished us a good night. Oh, right! There are a few more points I wanted to include: 1. the rooms do provide hairdryer. I packed mine since it wasn't mentioned in room amenities -- could have used the space for other things on the way home!! 2. they do not provide microwaves or mini-fridges - this is not a dorm! 3. ice machine did not work on 11th fl at the time, but they have signs up to show you can get ice on other floors. 4. free wifi worked fine for me and hubby - useful tip: they allow you to send up to 10 pages to the business center for printing free of charge! 5. I didn't understand how to work the remote for the TV. They sent an engineer to come up pretty quickly - 15 or 20 mins and got it sorted. Unfortunately, they tried almost too hard to make things right. They called twice to make sure someone had come to take care of our issue. It's only unfortunate because we were trying to nap before dinner. On a funny note: trying to take things into my own hands, I called guest services and asked for a 'do not disturb' to be placed on our phone and they told me that \"it does not exist\". Hmm! Okay! 6. not that we needed it, but they do provide valet parking for $31/night I don't consider any of this a disaster, we're from NYC and we adapt. :) Would I pay full price for this stay? Nope!

We were in the midst of buying a home near Howard County and the contract had to be settled. The hotel is very nice, but the room was beyond small for the price. I cannot say anyone was particularly nice (cordial yes to some degree). Would I personally recommend this hotel? I'll give it a 3. Did I expect much more? YES! It's the Radisson.

(For those of you who arent too sharp, this year we went to a Ravens game.) My biggest complaint this time - The shower drained slower than molasses in January. After my buddy showered I had to wait at least 40 minutes or stand in a cesspool or dirty water. We also had a 3rd guy in our room and literally requested a cot 3x.... It was even in my original email to the hotel. (I've got an email to prove that.) We called 2 more times and we were told they no longer had a cot. We kindly said \"You owe us a room, because this guy isn't sleeping on the floor.\" 20 minutes later they found a cot. Wow - Amazing. I wish the magician who made a cot out of nothing can do that with money. The location isn't bad as it's centrally located and about a 5-7 min walk to the inner harbor. Sure if you walk a block or two in the other direction it gets pretty sketchy but guys... it's Baltimore.

The shop, while providing good coffee and decent sandwiches was even slower than the elevators. I felt bad for the poor lady that had to run the understaffed shop all weekend.

We received these as a result of problems at a Radisson Hotel in London in 2009 -- problems I've long since forgotten. These certificates have been languishing on my desk. Her Ladyship and I had to go to Johns Hopkins Medical in Baltimore, so I thought this was a good opportunity to use these certificates. I read the reviews of the Lord Baltimore on Trip Advisor and had some trepidation -- but one reviewer correctly said that, in life, you generally get what you pay for. As a result, I booked a Club Level room and said that I would happily pay the difference between the certificate value and a suite. I e-mailed the hotel directly -- twice -- using the e-mail address for the actual hotel on the Radisson website. I never received a reply. When we arrived, after a long drive from Vermont, our reservation was in the system -- but the young lady at the front desk knew nothing about my e-mail messages. She took our two certificates and gave us keys to what they call a \"junior suite\" on the 18th floor. When we were shown to the room we first went (in retrospect) to the small living room. The fold-away bed from the couch was open, and the lights were off. You can imagine our initial horror when we entered a small room with a fold-out bed. The bellman turned on the lights, and then had to go around to the other room -- the actual bedroom -- to open the locked interconnecting door. It's as though we weren't expected. The other bedroom was fine, except for an upholstered bench that had been placed at the foot of the bed -- meaning there was about six inches to squeeze between bench and cabinet holding the TV. The room was tired -- although not frayed. I'd say more faded than frayed. It was clean. Bathrooms were unspectacular. I was unable to take a shower because each of the two small bathrooms had a shower/tub combination, and the floor of the tub was very slippery. On night 1 (of 2) the toilets kept spontaneously flushing. Fortunately Her Ladyship and I are heavy sleepers, and were tired from the road trip to Baltimore. On the evening of night 2 I called Guest Services, using the button on the phone, and asked the lady who answered the phone to please make reservations for us at the Rusty Scupper. She said that the food at this restaurant 'wasn't good,\" and recommended another restaurant. I listened to her sales pitch: her recommended restaurant did not have a view of the water. I explained that the Rusty Scupper might be a \"tourist\" restaurant, and might not have the best food, but Her Ladyship and I wanted a view of the water. I told her to please make reservations at my choice at 8:00 PM and to call me if there were any problems. I also asked her to have maintenance repair the toilet while we were out at dinner. She told me I should stop by the front desk and request this. I couldn't understand why Guest Services couldn't take ownership of this problem and get it fixed. When we got to the restaurant -- it was a pleasant walk -- there was no sign of our reservation. The restaurant was happy to accommodate us, and even gave us a free appetizer to show us the food was good. (It was -- all of it. And great service -- and view.) When we got back to the room we just shut the doors to both bathrooms. The bed is a \"sleep number\" bed. I like gadgets and was looking forward to playing with the settings. I could only find that two worked: rock hard and very soft. I won't be running out to buy one of these beds for our home. On the morning of our check-out we thought we'd have the complimentary continental breakfast in the lounge. Very strange stuff: no orange juice, for example. Only what appeared to be prune juice. We also found we were locked out of our room, and were given the explanation that \"this happens a lot\" -- as though the hotel had no control whatsoever over its own software. We spoke to an Assistant Manager and he was extremely apologetic and even helped us with our few bags. He took notes of our comments and promised to follow-up. He was very impressive -- but it's too bad the rest of the hotel fell short. I wouldn't stay here again, and wouldn't recommend it. The location was fine -- but there were lots of other hotels with (essentially) the same location. We didn't run out the door screaming, but when we return to Johns Hopkins Medical in January I think we'll try another hotel. (Oh, almost forgot. Unlike others we didn't have a view of an alleyway, but of Baltimore. I think.

Even the following day, we had the privilege of thanking Jay when we say him in the morning, and Anthony quickly recognized us when we called for our car and our car seemed to be immediately brought to us. We encountered a minor heating/air conditioning issue in that the heat was never switched on in our room, We called the desk and within about 10 minutes, two lovely gentlemen where in the room fixing the problem. I had also called the front desk to inquire about breakfast options, Kevin, who was the manager on duty was able to quickly look up our reservations and provide the necessary vouchers. Breakfast was lovely, We had envisioned mass chaos with so many women trying to get to the same place at the same time, but it was actually quiet and relaxing.

I called the hotel direct, asked about their location to the Grand Prix track and about their parking. The woman that answered the phone at the front desk was very acommodating and I had a good feeling about the place. We live in the Philadelphia area so driving to Baltimore was no big deal. We arrived and were immediately welcomed by a nice gentleman out front. I told him I wasn't sure if I was going to valet park or self par and he said no problem, go inside and check in and then let me know what you decide. When asked about leaving my car out front he said it was no problem until we decided. BTW, I did decide to self park. He opened the door and we were welcomed by a classical lobby and friendly front desk people. We got a slight upgrade on the room that I had requested on their website when I made the reservations. $15 extra a night for a corner room. It had windows on the two outside walls as well as one in the bath. It made the room feel very spacious. The first thing I did was check out the bathroom since there seemed to be a consistent complaint about the cleanliness. No problem here. The bath was very clean and tidy. The bath ammenities were of high quality and the towels plentiful. The TV was not a flat panel but I am not in a hotel to watch TV so that has no effect on my rating. The bed was a Sleep Number bed and one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. We were greeted everytime we left and returned to the hotel.

Baltimore is a city and there are some homeless that one will encounter but nothing agressive or untoward.

As I returned back to my car I noticed a line of concrete that laid perpendicular to the street that my car was parked on. I followed the line of concrete debris to discover concrete debris on the roof of my truck (there was a walking bridge above where the concrete dropped from). I brought this to the attention of the 1-3 doorman and they said they saw nothing which further infuriated me. There was no guidance as to protocol. I later reported this to the front desk and they called security to fill out a report.

Well As I was getting mt car out of the garage I notice a screaming Porsche boxter that was next to me as I was driving out of the garage parking house. This Porsche was weaving his engine and screeching his tires weaving through traffic. As I was driving back to the hotel to get my baggage to put in my car, I notice that in this Porsche Boxter was the hotel valet guy dropping off the boxter to a guest who checked out. I must say I was pretty shocked.

We needed a place that was pet-friendly since we were traveling with my dog. It seemed to be a great value online - historical building, great location, and pet-friendly. We booked and were so excited for our weekend get away. Little did we know that it would be anything but. First of all, THE PICTURES ONLINE ARE MISLEADING. The place does have a musty smell and could use some renovations. However, I wasn't really turned off by that because I still thought that the architecture and historical feel was almost a treat. Secondly, I WOULDN'T CALL THEM \"PET-FRIENDLY\". We called for an early check-in a few days before and while we were on the way. They told us that they could not do anything until we got there. I explained to them that we had a dog, so we'd really appreciate having an early check-in so that we could have a place while we toured around the inner harbor. I even offerred to pay an additional amont (in addition to their over-priced pet fee). They wouldn't budge. Also, there is no place to walk your dog, except for a small strip of grass down the street. The security officer at that building yelled at us, eventhough we cleaned up after our dog. Not too pet-friendly to me. Also, see my notes on the drugs below. Third, WATCH OUT FOR THEM TRYING TO UNNECESSARILY CHARGE YOU FOR PARKING. Although parking was included with our reservation, they tried charging us again. I had to pull out my reservation confirmation (thank goodness I had it) to haggle over this as well. Their parking deck is not really convenient or safe, but at this point, I was fine with it because we were able to get early check-in afterall and barely avoided paying for parking twice. Fourth, IT IS SOOOO SKETCHY. It wasn't too bad during the day, but I didn't feel comfortable or safe being outside the hotel at night. On our walk back from the baseball game, we saw people smoking weed, guys selling weed, and many females trying to sell themselves...I could go on and on. I was pregnant at the time and really felt unsafe. My husband even wished he had his gun when we walked to that strip of grass to take the dog out when we returned. Fifth, CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS SO BAD THAT WE CALLED THE POLICE TWICE! We returned to our room at the end of the night exhausted and ready to get some sleep. However, there was a family reunion going on in the ballroom across the hall, which was playing music rediculously LOUD! We couldn't even sleep. There were people hanging out in the hallway. We went downstairs and requested a room change, and the manager told us there was nothing they could do. Really? Nothing? No other room? No possible room at the nearby Radisson? He wouldn't even give us our money back so that we could go elsewhere. The manager had no control over the building and the family reunion and all of their local friends had taken over the ballroom, the lobby, the hallways. I told the manager that it was so late that the noise had to be in violation of a noise ordinance and that, if he didn't do anything, I would call the police if he didn't do anything. He said we would comp the pet fee, which was not enough at that point. I called the police when we returned to our room. While we were waiting for the police to arrive... Finally, WE COULD SMELL MARIJUANA IN OUR ROOM AND IN THE HALLWAY. It was clearly being smoked in several rooms on the floor. Keep in mind I was PREGNANT and had my dog with me. Breathing in marijuana was NOT something that could be tolerated. I called the manager. The manager, knowing I was pregnant, told me there was nothing he could do, so I called the police AGAIN! The manager was clearly flustered and seemed like he knew he was in trouble. Instead of righting the wrong, he decided to throw us out of the hotel. Clearly, it was a move to save his job. So at about 2:30 am, me, my husband, my dog, and my unborn child were excorted out of the hotel while an illegal, out-of-control party was going on all around us. The manager re-charged the pet fee to us that he previously comped. We also were not credited the fee for the room.

Let's start from the beginning . . . the front desk clerk didn't give me adequate instructions on the elevators (there were 5 of them\u2014all numbered 1-18). She failed to tell me that only elevators #1, #2 and #4 went to my floor (17). So, I got on unknowingly got on elevator #3. I rode it up and then back down. I got off, went to the front desk where another desk clerk told me what I should have been told to begin with. So I got on elevator #2 and it did nothing. I got off a third time and was handed over to a bellman who finally got me to my room. I get to my room and . . . it's hot. The air conditioning was set on 85 degrees. So . . . I stood in the hallway for a bit while it warmed up. I was supposed to have a city view.

I actually picked up the internet wirelessly, but from the hotel next door because it was actually faster. Thank goodness I am a Kimpton (the Hotel Monaco is next door) member and got it for free! I was also not impressed with the hotel's CSR program (or lack thereof). There was no opportunity either in the lobby or in my room to recycle anything, they used bottled water in the rooms, and standard lightbulbs rather than CFL bulbs. In this day in age, not the way to impress a business traveler in the meeting and event planning industry. The biggest positive of the stay? The bed was wonderfully comfortable. Sleep number--which I had never slept on before but may purchase because of the night sleep I had here. Day 2, however, was more of the same. I went for a run in the morning and came back to a 10 minute wait at the elevator because only elevator #3 was working properly. Elevators #1, #2, and #4 (remember from earlier--those are the ones that go to floor 17) didn't seem to be moving at all, so I went to the front desk and they again had a bellman help.

Positives: Great location, only 3 blocks away from the Inner Harbor, access to the Baltimore Subway as well as bus stops for most of the crosstown bus routes are less than 30 feet from the hotel entrance, First Mariner Arena is a block away, a very courteous & accommodating front desk staff (despite having full occupancy due to the Death Metal concert & Lacrosse Tournament that was occurring on the same day. How ironic!). As for the room itself, it wasn't half bad. We had a nice view of the Baltimore Skyline. The hotel also has free Wi-Fi, albeit slow as molasses. Im sure in 1928 this hotel was a showpiece that rivaled any hotel south of NYC. Negatives: The hotel is old. Plain and simple. The A/C unit controls in our room as well as the bathroom decor was a throwback to when Jimmy Carter was president. The Sleep Number beds were OK but loud when you attempted to turn them on. The wallpaper was literally coming apart from the wall. The modern decor & accoutrements of most newer hotels are not available at the Radisson Lord Baltimore. The room could also use a nice cleaning from the carpet to the sticky guest book that had gunk all over its pages. The hotel valet staff is severely undermanned & somewhat clueless. Also, what hotel in a major American city has a taxi stand that literally shuts down after 9 pm?? Finally, Beware the elevators anytime close to check out time. We attempted to beat the rush around 11 AM and still had to wait 12 minutes for an elevator to the lobby. . Overall, I'd recommend the hotel only if you get it at the Hotwire price. Any higher than that, I'd say skip it and stay at the Hotel Monaco or the Hilton. **Like most major cities, Baltimore has some sketchy parts that those from more rural parts of the country (ie.Flyover Country) may find somewhat \"scary.\" This hotel is located in a particular location that brings out the best & worst of the local gentry.

The room is fairly big, comfortable, and I'm in love with the Number Bed. But, as much as I loved the place at first site (I just turned 28, but I do love these old places), certain things have me confused. Confused on whether I love this hotel or not. Besides the fact that the food is good, incredibly affordable, and the place is close to places of interest, there are quite a few cons... First, the gym. It's convenient to have a gym and it's one of the reasons why I booked this place, but the weights equipment need replacement. As my partner say, \"We better don't use this bench press or we'll end up in The Final Destination 5 Movie\". I was a bit disappointed not to be offered a room upgrade. I booked this place for $150/night... By the time I checked rates before booking, they were offering for $99. So, I thought they would upgrade me, but they never offered even though I'm an American Express card holder. Also, where is the fridge... No fridge?!! And the fact that they are a 3 star hotel should be no excuse. Another thing that has surprised me, especially about Baltimore, is the amount of people asking you for coins on the streets! Around this location this is nonstop! But, the fact that they allow this people in here to use the bathrooms disturbs me... I understand that when hotels are recognized as historical places, their lobbies become kind of public, at least that's how it is in NYC so I assume here is the same, but, The Plaza Hotel would never allow the type of people I'm watching come in here to use the bathroom in the lobby.... What is up with that? When we checked in, someone quite scary got off the elevator and it just gave me the worst inpretion. But now, I understand why... Now, my question is (hopefully management is reading this) how do you allow these folks in? What if they go upstairs to the rooms and hallways???? After tonight, sitting here enjoying my amazing long island ice tea (oh yeah, the bartender should let people know what is not part of the happy hour \"premium\" drinks, but still, he's a good guy. Everyone forget things at times.) and eating my great burger, and chocolate cake, I'm kind of glad I'm leaving tomorrow... This area doesn't feel safe.... This hotel doesn't feel safe with the kind of people they let in this place... Would I stay here again...? Yes, as long as they learn to recognize worthy customers, and their security improves... Oh, a tip for you guys: the air refreshener you use in your hallways (smells amazing), should be used in the elevators too. They are old (which adds to that antique charm), but when you allow those people who are asking for money outside to come in and use them, the smell is just too much... I could not recommend this place until security improves...", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cnot what I expected.. in a good way!\u201d", "Author": "justagirl019", "ReviewID": "UR107434560", "Content": "so after reading reviews, I was expecting the absolute worst. nope! it was clean, comfortable, spacious. everything you need.

Check in went very smoothly though we were given a king room though I'd requested two double beds (and had to pay an extra $10 for the double room). The room was well appointed though it was a bit out-dated. Our three year old discovered dirty q-tip swabs while playing on the side of the bed and I picked several stray hairs off the comforter. Upon entering the bathroom I noticed that the tub was filthy (and also had stray hairs). I performed my customary Lysol disinfectant ritual and my husband called guest services to have someone come do another cleaning while we went to dinner. When we returned the room seemed much cleaner though the bath tub seemed to be permanently dirty. The advertised sleep number beds did not work but the bed was fairly comfortable anyway so my sleep was pleasant enough until I awoke to my 4 year old screaming bloody murder - almost literally. There were SEVERAL spots of blood on his bed sheets and he was not bleeding. I contacted guest services again and was placed on hold for about 3 minutes. When the representative finally took me off of hold she gave me instant attitude. I immediately asked for the manager, who of course was not there. I proceeded to remove the sheets and quickly prepared to depart the hotel even though we'd decided to stay another night in Baltimore. When we checked out I brought the dirty sheets down to the front desk with me so the staff could see that I was not exaggerating. The manager refused to acknowledge that it was blood and said that he and the director of housekeeping would have to investigate the stains. Really?? After waiting another 10 minutes for housekeeping to respond we decided to follow our agenda and return to the hotel after lunch. When we got back we again had to wait for the manager who informed us that the stain was not a blood stain but he was prepared to compensate us with a $40 reimbursement.

I travel frequently and stay in Hilton or Marriot Brands. I am not going to rewrite what others have written, but will verify that this is a disgustingly dirty property, with an unhappy, and rude staff. We stayed here this past week. Aside from the fact that the place needs a complete remodel and the staff needs to learn about customer service, we encountered some real safety issues. The higher priority issue is the fact that the battery holder from the fire alarm was wide open and empty. (Rm 528) I notified the front desk and they sent a short, squat, older lady to change it after I had already changed for the evening. She told me she would have to step on my bed, and truthfully even then I don't think she could have reached. (I am 5'4 and could not have reached, and am taller than her. Also, this would disprove a defense of me removing the battery.) I would not let her step on my bed because that is unsanitary, and the fire alarm had no battery for the entire stay. The second item is sanitation. I could write a book about the gross, potential health hazards we observed, but the biggest is the fact that the two long bed pillows in both rooms look like they have not been changed this year. The front was clean, however the part that touched the clean linen and the back was full of several other people's hair, and disgusting stains. We notified the desk, and they offered to give us new cases, but really the entire sheet set was contaminated. The rest of the room was filthy too. We did tell the desk, and offered to talk to management. The response was, \"...and they don't believe me when I tell them that we get housekeeping complaints.\" Again we offered to support the case, but the gentleman acted as if it is useless, but would take care of it himself.

I stayed the weekend of Aug 13. The hotel offered valet parking at $31 per day which I paid since it is really difficult parking in downtown Baltimore. The valet took my car Friday night at check-in and returned it to me at check-out Sunday. SIGNIFICANT POINT \u2013 just to be safe, I removed my personal info (insurance/registration, etc) from my car and placed all of my music CDs OUT OF PLAIN SIGHT and UNDER the driver seat. I did not move or access my car all weekend. At Sunday\u2019s checkout it never dawned on me to check and see whether any CDs were missing. I simply moved them from under the driver\u2019s seat where I had placed them and went on my way. It wasn\u2019t until Wednesday \u2013 yes, 3 days later \u2013 when I was looking for a particular CD that I noticed it was missing. After doing a full inventory, I realized 6 CDs were missing! And anyone who buys CDs know they are not cheap; on an average of $15 each. I immediately called the hotel Wednesday morning who referred me to Park America. I left a voicemail for the Park America manager who never returned my call. I finally spoke with him when I called him back Wednesday afternoon. Of course there was nothing he could do because \u201cit was 3 days later and how do I know for sure someone else didn\u2019t take the CDs\u201d. I then called the hotel to alert the management that the parking facilities they refer their guests to might steal from their guests\u2019 cars. I spoke with two managers over the course of two weeks and they were attentive and assuring. I certainly appreciate their customer service skills. I also spoke with someone from the Park America offices in PA \u2013 who I felt basically blew me off reasoning since I didn\u2019t know my CD\u2019s were missing until 3 days later, anyone could have taken them. Of course I understand the \u201cwe are not responsible\u201d disclaimer presented by Park Amercia and the Radisson and realize any expectation of compensation is moot. I just never imagined I would have to apply that principle to the very ones I entrusted with my car in the first place. And to know that my car was delibertly searched - remember, my CDs were out of sight UNDER the driver seat and the only ones with access (I left all doors locked) were the Park America, Inc attendents who had my car key. My overall experience at the hotel was great, the service was nice and if not for this incident, I would certainly go back again. I can respect the hotel\u2019s position that mine is only the second complaint in over a year and this is not the norm. The fact is my CDs are missing (no, not misplaced or just overlooked in my van \u2013 they are gone). And they were taken by a facility that I trusted because they were trusted by the Radisson. So no hard feelings, just exercising my right to write a review and share my experience and offer some friendly suggestions if your hotel parking is managed by Park America, Inc or any other valet parking facility for that matter - definitely completely remove all \u201cdon\u2019t want these stolen\u201d items. Apparently hiding them under the driver's seat is not a deterrent LOL. Be sure to inspect your car and contents of your car thoroughly before you leave the hotel. And if you find like me that you actually don\u2019t discover your property is missing until a few days later, don\u2019t take it personal if it is implied you stole it yourself :) Oh, and the irony of this whole thing \u2013 they were Christian CD\u2019s LOL!

You've got to be kidding me. Let's start with check-in. Went smoothly, though I was informed there were no rooms available with two beds. We were told to call later and they could send up a cot. THE ROOM: The room seemed nice at first glace. King-size Sleep Number bed. I guess that's a nice touch, but not nearly enough for a three-star rating. Upon closer look, the wallpaper was disgusting and peeling, with some tears. There was no updates to that in more than a decade. The room had air conditioning, provided by a window unit that wasn't very powerful. In addition, the unit was too small for the window, so a piece of plywood was duct-taped next to the unit to keep outside air from getting in. You could see several openings on the edges. THE COT: Later, we called about the cot and were told it would be an extra $10/night. Was not told that at check-in and find that ridiculous when they have no rooms with two beds remaining. THE BLOOD: While it wasn't apparent until the second day, one of my friends noticed red dots splattered on the wall near the vanity. This was not paint. It could only be blood. Not sure at all how it got there. We decided to stick with the room since it was the second day, but this was eerie. There were similar splatters on the wall outside the room. THE ELEVATORS: There are five elevators at the Lord Balt. At least, that's what it looks like. We only ever were on two of them, and the waits were tremendous. In a high-rise hotel, this is unacceptable. THE CLUB: Apparently, there's a \"health club.\" We visited it (only one elevator goes to it), and found they have taken out the hot tub and only have a few weight machines and treadmills. Horrible amenity. THE GOOD POINTS: Free Internet was nice. The location is OK. It's close enough to the Inner Harbor to walk during the day (be careful after dark). However, with a lot of construction in the area, it took 15 minutes to drive from the hotel to the self-park garage ($15/night vs. $31/night for valet). Also, the lobby is very beautiful and makes you feel like you're staying in a stately hotel. Well, you'll soon realize you absolutely are not. I would never recommend someone staying here unless they're looking to save a lot of money or are desperate. There are PLENTY of nice hotels in Baltimore. This is not one of them.

Our original rep quit, we were not assigned a new one right away, when we did get one she was NOT attentive.

To say that that the stay was disappointing is an understatement. The manager of the hotel was unapologetic for the most part and saw no need to give a discount for the poor service we received because he had already provided discounts upfront.

And if you can sneak into the Calvert Ballroom (if the doors are unlocked), you'll see gorgeous period chandeliers and paintings along the walls. In its day, the Lord Baltimore was clearly the place to be. Today, in terms of a place to stay, the Lord Baltimore is just average. We found the facility to be clean and the staff friendly. Food was mediocre. Parking is a pain since you're relegated to a musty underground garage across the street. Overall, the hotel lacks the buzz of activity that you might find in a more popular facility, so you get a somewhat tired impression of the place.

Location - about 4 blocks from inner harbor and 2 blocks from the light rail (to the airport).

The equipment was old, creaky and requires good oiling! Inebraited youngsters in the evenings in the hallwaysw and the elevators.

I am so tired of hearing about the Hotel area! Really? it`s Baltimore ! a city with high crime. You have to be careful no matter what hotel you stay at.

The valet who brought our car up appeared high and reaked of smoke, and with his eyes half open it was easy to tell what he does in his spare time. He half-heartedly \"helped\" us look for the phone. When we went to call it we noticed him reach into his pocket and fiddle with a rectangular object, the outline of which was suspiciously like our phone. The phone (having been turned off in the interim) of course went straight to voicemail. My boyfriend went inside to speak with a manager and I stayed outside with the car. While I was waiting, the valets (four of them now standing in a group) were making audible comments that we were assuming the phone had been stolen because of the race of the valet. I found this extremely offensive, especially given the facts that I am not racist, and that I could STILL see the outline of a heavy rectangular object the size of an iPhone in the valet's pocket!! I don't care what color your are, if you are shifty-eyed, high, and have an object in your pocket the same shape as my phone, i'm going to assume you've stolen my phone!

Should have looked further - behind the lace curtains were 'blackout ' style curtains to darken the room, which I did at night so the sun did not shine in the room first thing in the morning. I also don't understand people complaining about the location; it is around 3 blocks from the Inner Harbor, not miles away and it is not at all isolated - it is located in a very busy area. Hotels sitting right on the Inner Harbor are around 200-300 more per night.

Tony immediately told us that all the places we saw at the Inner Harbor were going to be terrible, full of high school workers who would be sweeping around our feet trying to rush us out the door while we were eating, because we were dining after 8:30. He said we absolutely HAD to go to Mo's Crab and Pasta, a TRUE locals place and that he would even get their van to pick us up. That should have been a tip off. How many locals places need a van to pick up their customers? We stupidly took his suggestion, waiting endlessly for the van and then were escorted up the stairs at Mo's, even though there were plenty of tables in the lively downstairs dining room. Then it struck--we were being sent to tourist hell. I couldn't say if they have a special menu with special prices in tourist hell, but we were the only people on the entire floor except for one other table of tourists. Service was awful, food just slightly above awful, and the crabcakes were $33. I'm not reviewing the restaurant, though.

Check in was easy...the valet took our car, and the front desk told us we could check in immediately (at 11:30 A.M.) as long as we didn't mind being near a service elevator. We said that was okay, and we were sent on our way. The king size bed we \"requested\" (even though I thought this meant it was reserved) was not in this room; instead we had a queen size Sleep Number bed. The Sleep number bed is terrible! Ours kept changing...we'd set it on the same number, and an hour later one side would be rock hard and the other would be sinking down. This was nothing but a glorified air mattress, and I'd never sleep on one again. The hotel was an easy walk from Inner Harbor, 5-10 minutes. We did notice that at night, there are some street people around, but they never bothered us, and we didn't feel unsafe at any point in our walk. The shower, as another review said, was very strange with water temp. You'd be showering, and suddenly the water would get very hot, then it would go back to normal, then very hot again. The bathroom, though, was clean, as was the rest of the room. One thing that seemed odd is that the alarm clock was unplugged when we got into the room, and I wasn't wearing a watch, so it was a bit annoying to track down the time so we could set the clock. We were on a hall basically by ourselves, but you could tell when walking through the halls to the elevator that the walls were pretty thin. There is noise from the outside, but since you're in a city, that's to be expected. It wasn't anything that kept us up at night. Also, there was a strange odor in the lobby, but luckily it didn't permeate the room. Check-out was easy as well, and we had about a 15 minute wait outside until the valet brought our car. Overall, it was a clean room, and we weren't in it that much.

From the start, the hotel allowed on-line check in and I was given the opportunity to request an early check in and a higher floor. We arrived at 10:30 am and our floor on the 14th floor was ready for us! We were so pleased that we could check in and get some much needed rest. The room looked standard, although the BF was a bit disappointed with the price we were paying for the room for what we got. It was a bit darker than some of the other rooms we visited. (Our room had one King size bed, while the rooms with two doubles appeared larger and were more lighted.) We also had no view since it faced the other buildings. The highlight was the Sleep Number bed, of course. (I did notice some dark stains along the white comforter though, which is not so pleasant.) And the closet door/mirrors were broken. They were sliding doors and we were missing one altogether! Also, it looked like they never vacuumed the closet ever because of the carpet discoloration. When we met up with the wedding couple later on that day, they were disappointed to learn that their personal welcome bags were not given out to their guests yet. They had to speak to the staff to remind them about the bags, which was frustrating on their part. The next day, we were disappointed to see that all of our toiletries were not replenished. It was quite apparent we needed more soap and shampoo, except that we didn't get anymore. When I called down for housekeeping (the various buttons on the phones didn't work, I ended up hitting \"O\" for the operator), they said they would take care of what I needed. After waiting almost half an hour, I heard a staff member in the housekeeping closet down the hallway and went to catch up with him myself. He apologized for taking so long, but in the end, I had to send the BF off to the wedding rehearsal without me since it had taken so long. On the very last day of our visit, we heard someone fumbling with the door and by the time we crawled out of bed to check, no one was there. When we did leave our room to catch up for the post wedding brunch, our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was missing, but we got another one and put it on our door after making sure it was closed. (I can only assume it was housekeeping trying to get in, but because we had both the door locked and the dead bolt on, the key didn't work.) Returning back to the room after brunch, I noticed our door wasn't closed completely. Looking around, nothing appeared to be missing but it certainly upset me that someone had attempted to come into our room. (I'm assuming housekeeping came in, saw that we were still checked in, and left.) We had requested the late check out, which is 1 pm, which was pretty easy to do. When we asked the bell hop about airport shuttle services, he was pretty friendly with helping us out. However, when we returned in the evening to request such a service, a different bell hop said it was too late for an airport shuttle. (Airport shuttle from the hotel is $15/pp.) And when we requested a taxi, he half-heartedly went outside to wave one down. He came back to tell us that he had called for two taxis and that was it. We ended up walking up a couple of blocks and waving our own taxi down. ($27 flat rate to the airport from downtown Baltimore) The light rail is also about three blocks away and that will take you to the airport too. Overall, our stay at the hotel was just okay. There was nothing particularly special about our visit and service was alright. There were some really nice employees while there were those that were just average. The cocktail hour and wedding reception was a different experience though. The waiters and bar staff during the reception were professional, friendly, and had a smile on our face.

Not a chance, just looked like they crammed a king bed in a regular room. Decor was moderately upscale, but undone by stains everywhere (lamp, ceiling, etc.). Coffee maker was tiny and almost impossible to operate without spilling water. TV was small for an allegedly \"upscale\" hotel. The service was another black spot. While I went to the front desk to ask about a new hair dryer (i.e. one that worked), a loud fight broke out between a manager and a housecleaner--very unprofessional. Another telling sign of the bad mangagement was a women next to me checking out complained that her tv was turning on and off all night keeping her awake all night! You might imagine that the desk manager would immediately apologize and try and offer the woman some kind of remediation for this.

We were extremely happy about everything UNTIL we returned from our romantic evening out. It started with the line that snaked from 1/2 way up the block to the staircase in the lobby, the mob scene in front of the building, the security guard who had to identify us as guests before allowing us to enter the hotel, the empty beer bottle stashed in the elevator, and the absurd loudness of the music and the screaming people which caused not only the floor to vibrate strongly, but the bed as well! When I called the front desk (both times) I was told that the 'party' had a right to be there as they had paid their money and had been cleared by the management. Oh! And not to worry, the party would end at 3:00AM! During the second call I was assured that we were not the only guests who were complaining, there had been \"many more\" complaints and that I should \"feel better\" knowing that I wasn't alone in my irritation! Both times I stated to the desk clerk that we (the paying guests) had a right to a quiet night's sleep, and that the party's rights did not supercede our rights. My only request was for a decrease in the volume so that our bed and floor would not vibrate...this was refused, \"I can't do that.\" Since there were no apparent rules governing the usage of the ballroom the music and noise continued to increase, to the point of being able to hear every word of every song clearly through ear plugs! Finally, shortly after 2:15am the police swarmed the hotel (No, I'm not joking!) with full lights and sirens from multiple sides, brandishing their nightsticks, and the music abruptly stopped at 2:17am. In addition to the police, a fire truck and fire rescue vehicle pulled up, with full sirens and lights. The next morning there was a stream of vomit in front of the elevators on our floor and drink glasses strewn about. In fairness to Radisson, their 100% money back guarantee if they are unable to resolve an issue is true: the hotel removed all charges from our bill and 'comp'ed the stay, but only after we were persistent about the matter, initially they tried to get away with taking 1/2 off of the bill. I would not choose to stay there again, however, my fiance' stated that he would choose to return, since they 'comp'ed the stay he feels that the matter was resolved and that they've maintained his patronage. The building is beautiful, our room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable...but you will need to make-up your own mind, and if you choose to stay there MAKE SURE that you ask what events will occur during your stay and MAKE SURE that you are put in a room on one of the highest floors they have to offer.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cRude Untrained Employees\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4052280", "Content": "I just came back from a wedding and although the wedding was beautiful...I would NEVER AGAIN go back to the Radisson in Baltimore. When we checked in (my husband and I) we wanted to confirm that we will have a room next to my parents room since I called the day before and they said this is no problem. So the lady says to me, \"no, it is not possible\". I said \"I called and they said it's fine\". She said \"there is no record in the system that you called for this\". Now, fine, if for whatever reason they were not able to accomodate us with this, they can at least be somewhat apologetic rather than THERE'S NO RECORD OF THIS! And she was nasty about it too. Then we go upstairs to our room and I wanted to find out what time the bus will be coming to take the guests to the church. I called the front desk (which each time you do this, it automatically connects you to security somehow and they NASTILY connect you to the front desk) and I said \"could you please tell me what time the bus will be coming for so and so's wedding\". The girl NASTILY says \"I DON'T KNOW\"! So we sat there in silence for a few good seconds until FINALLY she goes.....HOLD ON! She gets back on and tells me to look at my goody bag I was given at check in (from the bride and groom). But when I say they are NASTY their, I mean NASTY. Then at the end of the night after the wedding, a big group of us went to hang out at the hotel bar. My sister gave her ATM card to the bartender and ran a tab. She was hesitant to do this but the miserable bartender was annoyed having to debit her card per drink. So at the end of the night she asked for her card back and the bartender says \"I ALREADY GAVE IT TO YOU\"! Well, she didn't. So my sister went back to her room w/ NO bank card. Then she calls her account the next day only to find out they charged her for 3 nights instead of one. Reason being (which makes NO sense) because she ordered room service they had to put her back into their system in order to go ahead with the charge. So they automatically checked her out in their system before 12noon, so when she ordered food they put her back in and ended up charging her another night (actually 2 extra nights because she ordered room service in twice). I have seriously never seen more incompetent untrained RUDE employees in my life. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT stay at the Radisson Plaza Lord Baltimore in Maryland.

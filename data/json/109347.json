{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice, Most troubles were from the power outage...except...!!! Went with a few friends and found it roomy, and quite comfortable. We took use of the internet in the room, very convenient, Not tooo many issues. Except for the fact that there was a power outage the night before we arrived, and there was a new girl at the front desk when we checked in, so somehow or another, we were never placed in the computer. Six or seven the next morning we had a man trying to get into our room b/c they had issued him our room. Later that afternoon our keys had been disactivated and we couldn't enter our own room. Most of this though can be blamed on the power outage. All of it actually...EXCEPT the UNSPEAKABLE magazines found under our matress!!!!!! Left from a former resident of that room. Quite disgusting really.", "Date": "Jun 30, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR540671511", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "angenehmes und ruhiges Hotel   showReview(11448584, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR214006723", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d109347-r2231255-Quality_Inn_Suites_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "109347", "Price": "$108"}}

Our party consisted of myself, my husband and our 21 year-old daughter. We were in town to visit our son at BU over Parents Weekend. First of all, getting ANY hotel during this weekend is 1) a challenge and 2) expensive. It is the same weekend as the Head of the Charles Regatta during which 300k people descend on the city. In addition, there were several other college events on the same weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.all within about a 7 mile radius. I booked the Terrace through a third-party provider \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the least pleasant part of our experience, but I will save that for another review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and got a rate of $209.99 per night. Pricey for this hotel, but hey, the demand is there and it was by far the least expensive option when compared to the few others that actually had rooms. And we booked several months prior. I cannot stress enough how unbelievably friendly and helpful the staff is at this hotel. At check-in Jing was a doll. Our reservation indicated one queen bed, and even though they were packed, he managed to get us into a room with two doubles so our daughter actually had a place to sleep. He did all of this while smiling and being genuinely friendly the entire time. It really set the tone for the entire weekend. The hotel has a funky, LA-boutique/bungalow hotel style feel to it. A low-slung design nestled amidst a leafy residential neighborhood on the back side of Comm Ave. Whole Foods is a pleasant, quick 2 block walk through the neighborhood. The grounds are well groomed and very, very clean; even with the falling leaves, it was kept neat. As others have mentioned, the parking is free which, in Boston, can save you upwards of $50 a day. I am a super freak for cleanliness in hotels. I know it sounds weird, but the first thing I do is turn down the comforters and check out the sheets. In this case, crisp, white and clean and passed with flying colors. Nice, full pillows and the mattresses are topped and soft. I then move into the bathroom and inspect the tub, shower and corners of the room. The Terrace shower has the higher-end bowed shower curtain rod which provides additional room and the liner was fabric; a super alternative to the cold, often moldy plastic variety. The tub was spotless and the water pressure and temp was perfect for long, hot showers. Pantene hair care products are provided along with face and body bars and a hair dryer. (A fantastic addition would be a swing-arm lighted magnifier mirror, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me.) The towels are commercially stiff, but snow white and much thicker than you might expect. The first night in, we walked the 2.2 miles to BU West. It took about 40 minutes and we were moving, but it felt good after our 8 hour car ride. (We could have hopped the T at the Washington St. stop which is right down the block from the hotel; very, very convenient.) We felt very safe on the walk and we passed several quaint restaurants on the way. The walk back was an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.our very own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heartbreak hill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd going up that last stretch! The breakfast is far more substantial than you might imagine and actually offered a bit of variety over the course of our 2 day stay. There is a diverse array of breads \u00e2\u20ac\u201c muffins, fruited, bagels, farmhouse white and even toaster-ready French toast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and all of the condiments; fresh fruit; mini-cheese omelet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and sausage (perfect for breakfast sandwiches); made-to-order Belgian Waffles; yogurt and hot and cold cereals; regular and caffeine-free coffee; tea; hot chocolate and orange and cranberry juice. (Add this value to the money saved with the free parking and you can see how this would impact your travel budget.) The dining room can get full depending on your time of arrival and the census, but if you cannot find a seat, simply use the provided trays to carry your food back to your room. Alicia, the dining room attendant on duty during our stay, is charming. She smiled and chatted with us all while never stopping the seemingly incessant chore of restocking and making coffee; another high mark for the stellar customer service that is obviously a standard at this hotel. (Of course, your experience will be impacted by other diners, and there were some class A jerks in there when we were having breakfast, but Alicia smiled through everything and continued to do a great job\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I have no idea how they put up with some of those people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6travelers, mind your doggone manners!) There are two computers in the lobby and free Wifi. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even need to break out my netbook as I hopped on their machine to print out our BU parking pass. The gal on front desk duty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am so mad I forgot to get her name \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was beyond helpful in so many ways. She helped us print several documents and then came to check out our situation with our remote which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. When she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it to work, she summoned a maintenance guy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another super friendly, skilled staffer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he had us fixed up in a few minutes. While in our room waiting, the front desk attendant filled us in on where to go and we ended up taking her advice on lunch at The Joshua Tree in Davis. (A great find for reasonably priced burgers, good service and a cool neighborhood.) So, to wrap up, I would highly recommend the Best Western Terrace Inn in Boston. The facility itself may not be the Four Seasons, but I can tell you, I would put the level of customer service up against the best hotels I have stayed in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6including the Mondrian AND several Ritz and Four Seasons locations. I am not even kidding; these folks could work at ANY of those places. If it is any indication of how comfortable guests feel while at the Terrace, just check out how many repeat customers there are\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we met multiple families in the dining room who never stay anywhere else when in Boston. People do not go back to places that are dumps or where the staff treats them poorly; no matter the price point. Bravo to the staff and management of the Terrace. You do a fantastic job.

The room looked clean enough, was tastefully decorated and had a refrigerator and microwave. When I went into the bathroom there were ants all over the floor. I killed about 15 of them. That wasn't too bad, I was more concerned with bed bugs... I checked but thank goodness didn't find any. I did find more ants though, crawling on the chair next to the bed. After being itchy all night thinking about ants crawling on me, I slept with my clothes on and sweatshirt hood on my head. That wasn't the worst of it though...during the night I kept getting a faint smell of vomit. I don't know if it was on the rug on my side of the bed or the side of the chair or on the mattress. It wasn't a strong odor but every so often kept getting a whiff. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, disgusting!

As other reviewers have noted, the Best Western offers free parking in a city where a downtown hotel would probably charge at least $20 a day. It's a short walk to the Green Line of the T--though remember that it makes a lot of stops and is not as fast as other mass transit trains in the city. You can get to Boston University or Boston College easily by the train, and that branch runs surprisingly often. we were in town for a Bookcrossing convention being held at Boston U. and found the hotel location and trains very handy. The neighborhood was very pleasant and nice for taking a walk in at night--we felt safe there. Driving from the east on Comm. Ave., watch for a sign painted on a nearby building that tells you how to make a U-turn and turn right after a Gulf station--it can be a touch tricky to get to driving but the sign is very helpful. At the hotel itself, the room numbering system is confusing, so pay close attention to the desk clerk as s/he explains how to get to your room. The room itself was small but clean and functional. It doesn't bother us at all, but some people would prefer an interior corridor to a room like ours that one can reach directly from the street. Check-in was efficient, if not particularly friendly; checkout was friendlier and efficient, too. breakfast was okay--average for this type of hotel--but quite crowded. Noise control was subpar and is why I bumped my review down a notch to three circles. You could hear footsteps easily in the room above, but what was more of a problem was the noise through the adjoining room connected by a locked door. The door insulated noise from next door poorly, and the people next door came in loudly at 2 am and I could hear all of their loud conversations until past 4 am. The noisy neighbors are not the hotel's fault, but they could work on noise control. For my wife's part, she loved the hotel (the next door guests didn't wake her up :-)) .

The hotel price was good, and parking on site was free, which is a big plus. Some cons: There was continental breakfast, which is over by 11am, so if you are on vacation or are out late and want to sleep in, you will miss it. We were in room 503, which overlooked the street (Mt. Hood Rd), if we wanted to leave our curtains open to get some light to make up for the dim room lighting, anyone walking by could see into our room clearly. The curtains also sit right on top of the heater, and since it was cold and we wanted it on, but not at the risk of being a fire hazard that made it annoying, I just tucked up the curtains onto the window sill and luckily they stayed without falling. The room was clean enough, though housekeeping did not come the first day we were there, so after a long day exploring Boston we came back to an uncleaned room, no made bed, and no clean towels for the rest of the night or next morning. There is a fridge in the room which kept our drinks cold enough, and there is a microwave that was working. There is a coffee pot but we only got one pouch of regular coffee and 4 decafs, and the pot only makes one cup at a time. The room was smaller than we had thought, the bathroom is tiny and if you are with a significant other and would like to both use the bathroom when getting ready in the morning, forget that, it's too small. The tv channels were fine and there are movies offered, $13.99 if you want to watch a movie still in theaters, and $11.99 for any other movie (guess that's where they make up for the free parking). We got a good deal from Hotels.com with every second night half off, and that was the seller for us, plus when we called the hotel they said we were right near everything, we were near the train that takes you to everything, there's nothing really in walking distance but the train, 7-11 and whole foods around the corner. There's no restaurant or bar on the premises but you can take the train if you want to go out, there's also no room service so you need to bring food with you if you want to eat in. The trains stop running at 12:30 so if you plan on a late night out, you'll have to cab it back to the hotel, if you are not driving. Overall I would recommend spending a little bit more for a nicer hotel, maybe further down commonwealth ave. The hotel is also hidden behind a Gulf station so we almost missed it when we were looking for it and the parking lot is pretty hilly in the back area and not a lot of parking on the side we were on by Mt.

Once inside our room - we were horrified. The room had been decorated in the 70's and had never been updated. It was extremely shabby and the bedspreads and carpet were stained. Worst of all was the disgusting smell of smoke and stale air. It was so bad that we told the front desk clerk that we didn't want to stay there - the clerk informed us that he may have to charge us anyway. We told him fine, knowing that we would stop our credit card payment and make a formal complaint against the hotel. Our trip to the Boston area ended up lovely. We checked into the Doubleday Suites and were very happy there. The rate at this hotel was actually less expensive because a two room suite was $199.00 and accommodated our family just fine.

The hotel was very clean, seemed to be in a very safe neighborhood, and provided an adequate breakfast. It was a one block walk from the Green line (B branch, Washington St). However, the hotel is rather far from downtown. The trolley ride is very very slow and tedious and I found the green B line trains to be the most infrequent. As such, it usually took us at least 30 minutes to get to downtown. In addition, on the second night, we were kept awake by a loud party from about 2am-3am. I called the front desk, but found them to be extremely unhelpful and completely unconcerned. The hotel was the best value that I could find that was still in a decent neighborhood. Again, it was clean and there were no problems with the room itself.

There was also no kitchen and the hotel lists that every room has a kitchen (it must be saved for Priceline customers). I was moved promptly to a room a bit larger, with a kitchen, and at least it was in tact. Pros: - Staff was nice, unexperienced, but nice - Location was quiet, residential, and right next to the T Cons: - Very dirty! The bathroom was infested with house centipedes...I saw a family of them. - Bathtub did not drain (took about an hour after the shower was finished. I asked everyday for it to be fixed, but it never was. - Large groups stay here. While the neighborhood is quiet, the group can have lots of parties. - Non-smoking room smelled of thick smoke.

I would have liked to rate this hotel 5 stars but an annoying thing happened when I stayed there recently. I made reservations for ***3 rooms*** at this hotel 5 months prior to the date because it was Boston University graduation weekend (my wife and I and 2 other relatives were coming up). I called several times over the 5 months to make sure we stil had our ***3 rooms***. Each time we were reasured the reservation was there for ***3 rooms***. We got a letter from them stating since it was a busy weekend our deposit was non refundable if we canceled within a few weeks of the date. Not nice but we accepted that since we were coming for sure. We arrived on the day, came in at 1:30 pm. They told us they had our ***3 rooms*** reserved but they were not ready yet. No problem, we would leave our luggage there, see the sights of wonderful Boston and return after dinner. Just to be safe, I called at 3:30 pm to see if we needed to do anything else for our ***3 room*** reservation. \"No\" they said, everything was taken care of, we had our ***3 rooms***. We returned at 9:30 pm to be told we had ????? 2 rooms, not 3. \"We overbooked and since you had 3 rooms we thought you could get by with 2\" they said nicely (I have no complaints about the weekend night manager, he was stuck with the situation he didnt create). All of Boston was booked, it was late, they gave us $20 off each room, and gave us two rooms- a suite with two rooms the relatives had to share and a room with two single beds for me and my wife. The next morning I requested and got an additional room. Upon checking out I asked the manager how this happened and he said \"We don't do this on purpose, it just sometimes happens\". That was it. You other travellers can tell me if this happens frequently to you (has never happened to me in 49 years) I emailed the Best Western office, they said I would hear within a week (haven't heard anything in 1 1/2 weeks) from the Terrace Inn. We got by ok for one night, it wasn't THAT big of a deal but my questions are: if you can take ALL my money if I don't show up, why can't you make sure everyone who puts that money up has a room? Have you looked into this \"mistake\" to see how often it happens? Wouldn't it be nice to respond to questions referred from the main office? So I suggest they study the overbook policy OR drop that no refund policy on busy weekends.

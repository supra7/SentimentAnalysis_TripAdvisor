Central Location!! The hotel is new, chic, and very stylish! We stayed in a Courtyard Queen room, and it was fabulous and VERY clean! Definately would stay here again when I return to SF. Contrary to other reviewers, my wife and I did not find the neighborhood that bad or sketchy. SOMA is reinventing itself and just like any big city the area has its share of bums and needy people. We stayed there for 5 days and frequently returned late at night and had to walk 2 short blocks from the F-line and BART to the hotel. Never once were we approached by anyone. When visiting any big city, just maintain your awareness and don't be so afraid of the unfamiliar. The Good Hotel is a gem of a find in a plethora of other name-brand subpar hotels.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR573330460", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "EDFLAW"}, {"Content": "Bad Location The hotel is nice. The location is not. I wouldn't stay there again if given the chance. It's rough to walk back at night (I'd say anytime beyone 8 pm). It's only about a two block walk from BART but the station is on a corner frequented by some scary people. We didn't have any confrontations but it was pretty uncomfortable. Once you're in the hotel, it's fine. They have nice decor, the beds are comfortable etc, but if you're planning a stay in San Francisco and have no need to be in this location (SOMA), I would skip this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR888979933", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "TravelGalMilwaukee"}, {"Content": "the good hotel is ok just date 19 september 2008We arrived at about 10.30p.m to the hotel, i really found that the area was very bad. If I had been on my own or with another female I would have checked out the next day.The Hotel website describes the area as edgy it really should be dodgy.We had a courtyard room which was ok it was clean and big enough. With one small window does have a feel of a cave. The staff were helpful, there are not a lot of places that you can eat nearby we ended up with a subway from across the street when we got in.Really loved San Francisco and only used the hotel to sleep. would not stay again.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR310263301", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "hill1"}, {"Content": "Nice place, tough location Not a bad hotel, renovated to be modern and trendy. Flat TVs, WiFi. The downside of the place is that in keeping with the minimal theme, there's really no place to sit in the room besides the bed or a high stool-like chair made from wire. I think the price is a driving factor to stay there. Also, being a block from the BART train to SFO is a good thing.The first room they gave me was an interior one. Avoid it. The one tiny window looked out onto a light well. It'd be hard to know if it was daytime or nighttime in that room.The downside is that most people will be approaching the hotel from Market Street. Lots of street people hang out around there. They don't seem dangerous, but still, it can be unnerving to see people sleeping on the sidewalk of the Federal Building across from the hotel.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR177390759", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "wiredboy"}, {"Content": "A good time at a nice little place We had a very nice stay at the Good Hotel this week. (It is NOT closed for renovation! It is open now.)Not only was the room cute, clean, and affordable, but the housekeeping staff treated us to champagne and strawberries (with dipping chocolate and whipped cream) when they saw our marriage certificate lying out on the dresser!My favorite touches in the room were the vertical blinds hung above the bed that showed Chinatown on one side and a bicycle on the other side and the hidden message goodnight on the ceiling (which only shows up when the lights go out).", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR880656481", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "FiftyNinth"}, {"Content": "Cute hotel, bad location Just came back from San Fran last week. We toured almost all of Cali from San Diego, Irvine, San Fran  Napa. We loved the hotels we stayed in San Diego  Irvine, Beautiful, good housekeeping and comfy beds. When we arrived at the Good hotel Thurs. night in San Fran and it seemed it was in a bad neighborhood. We had not gotten any dinner and asked the front desk and where to eat. They told us of an Italian place, was not really interested. I wanted to go to the mall, which I heard is near by. He told us it was not a good idea and to beware of the pockets alleyways were the homeless, drugged people hang out. OK, So we ended up looking for the Italian and getting lost. We went one block up and that was not a good idea, especially with two small kids. The hotel itself is ok. The rooms look like an Ikea showroom, the furniture was eco-friendly and not comfortable. The y change towels daily, but did not vacuum during our 3 days stay. I know because I stared at crumbs for the 3 days. Gross. The only highlight was the bathroom. The had the dispensers for the shampoo. conditioner,  body wash in the showers.If you're don't mind an OK room and bad neighborhood, then stay at the Good Hotel", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR544599733", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "jfinnelli"}, {"Content": "Cute hotel..not so cute neighborhood Just got back from a weekend in San Francisco and stayed a night at the Good.Pros:Cute eco-friendly clean and renovated room in the courtyard. Had a queen room-was smallish but we were in there just to sleep anyway. Nice flat screen TV on the wall. Soap and shampoo/conditioner dispensers in the bathroom instead of those annoying mini-bottles. New bed with recycled wood headboard. Neat metal drop down table in room rather than desk. Nice lobby with flat screen TVs and a free photo booth. Within 2 blocks of the BART station and 1.5 blocks of the Muni F streetcar line that takes you to Union Square, China Town, and the Wharf. Great price for San Francisco.Cons: Biggest con was the neighborhood. They're clearly trying to revitalize it but it's swarming with drug dealers, beggars, people passed out on the sidewalk, etc. I was ok during the day walking back and forth from the hotel to the trains but I refused to walk at night-we took a cab.Also, the hotel lobby area is still being renovated-so there's no bathroom in the lobby or restaurant; we had to go across the street to use the restroom because our room wasn't ready yet. All and all, I don't know if I'd stay there again because the neighborhood was scary enough to keep me away. But if you aren't bothered by that sort of thing, it's boutique-y and cheap and close to the train lines.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR978620187", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "jenihalo"}, {"Content": "hotel refait \u813f neuf       la chambre du good hotel", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR309578568", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "fouinette"}, {"Content": "\u74a8\u0443\u6025\u9287\ue042\u5122\u9289\u55d0\u5045\u9289\u51a6\u5057\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(20753594, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR235061755", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81959-r22564806-The_Good_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "HotelID": "81959", "Price": "$131"}}

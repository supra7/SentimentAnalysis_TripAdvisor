The room needs renovation and very small by Marriott standards.

The concierge lounge is closed on weekends and usually at other Marriott properties, the hotel will give you a breakfast voucher if you are a platinum member. Well, not at this property.

Really liked the informal and large bar/dining area. Limited menu but the food was very good, just not too many choices. Observations (as opposed to complaints): Internet was expensive but you did get one small bottle of water per day. No in-room refrigerator, which is a shame as you are right across the street from a Super K. No in-room safe. Closet was OK but you had to close the bathroom door to get into the closet.

The room was adequate with comfortable beds and plenty of storage space. The bathroom consisted of a bath/shower and toilet with the sink outside the bathroom. Unlike many hotels, the vanity area was very small and there was very little room to set out toiletries, especially with two persons using the sink. Housekeeping did a good job of keeping things clean, except for two large black smudges on the draw drapes. The hotel is located very close to the Rio Vista trolley stop which made getting around very convenient. I would also like to recommend a very nice coffee shop about a block and a half away (if you're at the hotel, head toward the plaza with the Sears that will soon be a K-Mart - the coffee shop is in a professional/residential building on the corner, across the street). They have delicious breakfast sandwiches, great coffee and pastries for breakfast, all reasonably priced. They also have free WiFi, which brings me to my major critique of this Marriott. I fail to understand why mid-price hotels, such as Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Expess, etc., offer free WiFi in the guest rooms, while Marriotts and other upper-end hotels charge, as in this case, $12.95 per day for the privilege of getting connected. They even charge for the two \"business center\" computers off the lobby, requiring you to swipe your credit card. There is also no free breakfast, and the least expensive cooked item on the hotel restaurant breakfast menu is $14.00. Adding in the parking charge, it just seemed like the guests are being nickled and dimed when they are already paying a premium price for a hotel room.

It only poured out scalding water. So as not to be late for the conference I was attending, I didn't waste time asking why the housekeeping staff hadn't fixed the problem or notified someone before I checked in. Nope, instead, I called the front desk and asked for someone to fix the problem and let me know by phone when it had been fixed. Crisis resolved, right? Nope. I did get a message saying that the problem was fixed in the afternoon. Yay. Right? Nope. Around 10 PM I went to shower before bed and, you guessed it, the shower was still broken. This is the point that I called the front desk and asked to be moved. While I was moved, no one offered to help and I was stuck hauling all my stuff to another room. No one offered any compensation for the trouble and no one apologized for the fact that this pretty significant issue had not been resolved. I tried following up the next day to ask for some sort of observation of this poor customer service and I had a really hard time reaching anyone. I'm a pretty reasonable person and I've never once complained about a hotel experience so the fact that I went to this step really says a lot about how bad the overall experience was.

Worst of all, though, was the total lack of outlets near the desk: to plug in my laptop I had to dive under the desk and plug into a wall outlet that had a 3-outlet extender in it that had only one open space. That said, the hotel had some great features- a nice pool area, a great fitness center, and a stylish lobby.

Everything else was clean and in good shape. We didn't use the wireless internet because it was kind of costly so I cannot comment on that. Housekeeping was efficient and quick to clean the rooms. The pool is really quite lovely. It was kind of cool when we were there so the pool was usually all ours except for a few sunbathers. Lots of towels, chaise lounges and 3 pretty cabanas with furniture and hammocks. It was clean and well kept and relaxing with the music and large fountain. In the evening there were really yummy rocky road cookies in the lobby. But act fast because it's not an endless supply. Parking was $14 per day but we just parked along the street of the hotel for free with not much further to walk than from areas of the paid parking. Every room has a balcony which is nice to step out on for fresh air or just to look around the area. We faced I-8 but were never disturbed by road noise. We didn't have any trouble with the elevators being too slow. There are only 3 so if the hotel is packed I suppose it could get slow. This hotel is in a great location. It took 20-30 minutes to get to a lot of places we visited. Blocks to the San Diego Zoo, just a few miles from Sea World. We drove up to La Jolla to see the seals and Scripps aquarium and that didn't take long at all to get there. And if you want to go to the beaches, probably 20 minutes to those. And lots of shopping (high end and average) and places to eat. Now onto those beds. Oy! I don't think I've slept on anything as torturous as these beds! Hard and slightly sunken in the middle - and SMALL! They are only double beds! Who even offers double beds anymore? They tried to make them more comfortable with some kind of mattress cover but it fails to resolve the problem of the old, hard mattress. C'mon Marriott!

Indeed for any city. We stayed for 2 nights midweek while visiting the Zoo and Wild Animal Park. As a base for both, Mission Valley is excellent as it's not downtown and neither is it out in the wilderness. I've stayed in a few Marriott hotels in the past, and regularly visit one for work meetings. I find them to be very dated to the 1990s and sometimes older. The Marriott brand has really done itself no favours with the d\u00c3\u00a9cor in this or any other hotel. The dated feel permeates throughout leaving the guest with a disheartening feeling as you move through the hotel. The rooms are clean, however very dated. CRT television with very poor quality reception on almost all channels apart from ESPN. The internet usage was included in my rate, but is severely lacking in juice. The 'Wired for Business' LAN network for instance seems to be on a 10 Mbit network, which is a older technology and causes massive latency issues for anyone trying to establish a VPN to their office (especially trans-atlantic ones!). The restaurant is sparsely decorated and poorly laid out. Focus appears to be on the bar rather than the restaurant. However the food is very good. The New York strip is excellent as is the Caesar Salad. Again however, the Marriott's price-point kicks in. The food is very expensive here. Breakfast for example, which is excellent in both service and quality, is very expensive again. Over $40 for 2 people for what could count as a full Irish breakfast with coffee. Overall this is a good hotel to stay at. Given San Diego is plagued by conferences and business meetings from what I've seen and read, hotel prices are expensive as a result. My advice would be to stay perhaps further out, maybe in Escondido or something if you could find a nice hotel. Marriott Mission Valley is an OK hotel, but beware that it is both expensive and dated.

That's ok though, there was no reason to have a view anyways.

The trolley is just across the street from the hotel and runs until midnight during the weekend. It stops every 15 minutes. For $2.50/person/trip (or $5 all day) the trolley will take you all over San Diego, which is a great plus! We left our vehicle at the hotel the following day and took the trolley to Old Town. When we returned, our car was safe in the parking lot. As for the hotel.... It's in a business area, but it is kept very clean and is nearby to shopping and restaurants (if you'd prefer to not eat the hotel restaurant, we did not eat there). There's a beautiful pool (and hot tub) along an amazingly manuicured area. Although we arrived to the hotel early (noon), they were able to give us a room on the 8th floor with a balcony and king-sized bed, overlooking the pool area. Our room also came with a mini-fridge (however, I'm not sure all rooms are equipped with one). There was a nice breeze that came in through the sliding door at the balcony and we slept with the door open to take advantage of the fresh air. At 5pm, they have cookies and milk in the lobby. The front desk is more than happy to help you with directions and ideas (even providing maps) of things to do in the surrounding area. They were the ones that suggested us leaving our car in the parking lot the following day and taking the trolley into downtown and the surrounding areas. The hotel is also very family-friendly.

Overall experience is quite pleasant. Oh, make sure you check your bill on the TV everyday. I checked it the night before check out, and found that there was a mistake on the billing. They charged a Bar tap to the wrong room so I got a $16 charge. I called the front desk telling them that I've never been to the bar and they took it out immediately.

The hotel offered valet and self parking. I opted for the self parking since the hotel was not crowded and I parked literally 100 feet from the back door of the hotel. There is limited on the street parking if you dont want to pay the 13 bucks for self parking. The hotel is located near an open air mall equipped with a Macys, Outback Steakhouse and all of the mall regulars. I got a good rate using AAA. The hotel was very convenient to downtown and the marina. The room was clean and a bit dated but the housekeeping was awesome.

The showers had those cool rainforest type showerheads, however, the pressure was lacking completely.

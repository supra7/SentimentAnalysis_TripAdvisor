{"Reviews": [{"Content": "home away from home I have stayed in Union Square, Nob Hill and now Jackson Court in Pacific Heights. This was the absolute best. This felt like a home away from home. The managers were unobtrusive, but were there if you needed them. The location was beautiful. We combined lots of walking with cabs. Union and Filmore Streets have wonderful boutiques..much more unique than Union Square. The views are amazing. I was there with my 2 daughters and we all loved it.can't wait to return!!!!", "Date": "Oct 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR505469504", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "janes1053"}, {"Content": "A wonderful place to stay! We stayed at Jackson Court for 7 nights in July 2008, in the Blue Room.We thought this was an excellent place to stay. The location was lovely - Pacific Heights is a quiet residential area and Jackson Court is only a 5-10 minute walk from some really lovely shops and restaurants on Filmore Street. It is not close to downtown or Union Square which is partly what makes it so lovely! It is easy to get to these areas by tram or bus. We are reasonably fit and pretty much walked everywhere from Jackson Court.The room was very clean and spacious, and the decor was lovely. We used the free internet connection okay and the bed was super comfortable. We arrived very late - after 1am - are were still given a very friendly greeting by the night staff.We particularly enjoyed the breakfasts - you help yourself in the kitchen and can either take it to your room on a tray or there is space for 4-6 people to eat in the kitchen. There was a fresh fruit salad, cereals, yoghurts, bagels, muffins and toast.Overall, I thought this was an excellent place to stay - the price is quite high but for a treat I thought it was worth it. I would definitely stay there again, and would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR155641127", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HappyHappyH0lidays"}, {"Content": "Fantastic place!!!!       red room", "Date": "Nov 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR184137872", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gepmo"}, {"Content": "Great Place A very special day , I proposed to my fiancee.

The room was comfortable but the bed was too soft.However, there are a few problems. The place is looking a little shabby and needs new wall paper and a new coat of paint. Parking is very hard and once we found a spot, we didn't dare move the car. The breakfast was a joke: a carton of juice, some Philly cream cheese, and sliced bread out of a bag. No fresh based bread, no fancy cheeses or fresh squeezed juice.Overall, I expected a little more at this price.", "Date": "Aug 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR891719252", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Czernobog"}, {"Content": "Great Place We have never stayed in a Bed  Breakfast before.

When we were escorted to our 3rd floor room I was a bit worried as I really am not into antiques,etc but really it was a very nice hotel in an excellent location. The service was very good, the evening tea was nice and it was very quiet throughout the hotel. Breakfast was average but you don't get a meal included anywhere in SF and taking it up to our room on big trays was nice. They do need to update the televisions.The area is great for shopping and eating- Chez Nous is really good and it is a very pedestrian friendly area.", "Date": "Jun 26, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR805294235", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "larkoolaw"}, {"Content": "one of a kind Truly one of a kind, this wonderful mansion turned into a bed and breakfast is like no other.

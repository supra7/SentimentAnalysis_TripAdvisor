It has a very tired look. The entrance lobby was almost non-existent, no atmosphere of luxury here. One good thing about this place is that it is the only one in the whole of Las Vegas which seems to accommodate children. It has a floor above the casino, which they call Midway where there are lots of games for the children where they can collect hundreds of tickets for doing not much, and then cash them in for really pathetic prizes. They don't care a damn. Also the circus acts above the casino is a novelty, but overall doesn't make up for the threadbare feel of the hotel.

It is a great hotel if you have kids because it is very kid friendly with lots of things for them to do and you really don't have to worry about them. The downside is hat it is at the VERY end of the strip and it is quite a walk to get to other hotels but then you can take the bus anywhere you want. My main complaint was the shower. The pressure was horrible but worse than that you spend more time adjusting the water temp than anything else. Once you get the right temp and you think you are good to go it either goes veyr cold or very scalding so you adjust it up and down then up and down some more. The room and beds were comfortable.

I have kids, did some research, and found Circus Circus advertising to be the \"kid friendly\" hotel on the strip due to having the Adventure dome. When we got there, the hotel from staff were beyond nice and very helpful. Things that went wrong; 1. Sent wedding dress to be dry cleaned and told the bellhop to call us with a price BEFORE the dress was dry cleaned and steamed. Never got a call, found out it was $75 buck when I went to their desk at 7 pm the night before the wedding. 2. The room keys are plain and simply ridiculous. I had 2 seperate rooms with 2 keys to each room and most of the time only one key was working and had to use the adjoining door to get in. The hotels excuse was it was getting demagnetized. I specifically put my keys in it seperate pocket with NOTHING by it. 3. At 2 in the morning myself and my wife were walking back to our room. As we took the elevator to the second floor and walked out, right in front of use were two males smoking a marijuana joint. The entire 2nd floor of the hotel reeked of marijuana for the next 2 nights. The hotel had NO cameras inside of the hotel only on the outside, so a fight could happen in the hall and they would even have footage for the police. A room could be broken into and owell no cameras. In closing this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had in my entire life. I have stayed at some cheap run down motels on the side of the highway and they would have 5 stars compared to how Circus Circus runs their business and keeps their rooms. I am going back to Vegas next year for our honeymoon and I can gaurantee we would even think of staying here wether they are cheap or not.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boonville NY", "Title": "\u201cThe BEST and ONLY Casino/Hotel to Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "pupsrool", "ReviewID": "UR126844514", "Content": "I have been to Circus Circus many times and keep going back....It is a FUN place to visit and no matter where you go for food....it is DELICIOUS and very very reasonably priced.

We paid a lot but we felt like cattle. The place was big and like a high school cafeteria with people everywhere. A little kid at a table by us was sucking on the salt shaker. Lots of kids in that place as expected. Lots of unruly parents. The room cost was only $27 but they tried to initially place us in these barracks, like five buildings that run along the side of the hotel that look like mini hotels about two or three levels high. That would have been horrible walking to the main building which is endless walking anyway. LOTS OF WALKING to your room or any attraction from your car or room. We ask for a room in the actual hotel building and not in the barracks. They abliged. There is plenty to keep you busy here for a couple of days and lots of machines if you gamble. Looked like some fun machines that are unique. Rooms are dated but clean.

We had requested the casino tower and we didn't know what to expect. (I was surprised since they always ask for i.d to look for the match?) But thanks to the guy that attended us we still got a room at the casino tower #348. I liked it because we were between the elevators to go down to the casino and the hallway to go to the adventuredome and the parking lot. Our rooms were very nice, no fridge or microwave but it was clean and comfortable. Our view was a light outside our window but I can't complain since we weren't going to be there all day! I wanted my kids to go try out any new rides in the adventuredome but they never wanted to leave Midway. We saw the circus acts and they had fun playing games. We bought $4 t-shirts and souvenirs for 99 cents at the Midway store. I saw downstairs they have souvenirs all for 99 cents and a place that had everything for $10. Our buffet was $22.00 for the four of us with the coupons(Buy 1 get one free) that they gave us. We had gone to the bank nearby, washed clothes, and since we were around there we ate at Dennys that was next to a Walgreens . Breakfast totaled $25.00 and my husband shared his plate with my son and I did with my daughter so we wouldn't have extra food! We should ate at the hotel buffet instead but you live and learn! Our spring break went by fast, we won a little pocket money at the casino, the kids came back with a bag full of stuffed animals, we all had fun. Oh, something else that took us a while to learn-I used to think of getting there, checking in, find my room, and go eat somewhere downstairs but it doesn't work that way! Stop somewhere to eat lunch, dinner, snack before you get to the hotel.

The hotel is great, very clean, has everything you need a few shops, resturants, place to buy tickets and ALL of it is great value for money. Breakfast is great has a great range of buffet food, everything you could want from cakes, cooked breakfast, salads,toast,yoghut, everything, tea, coffee, pop, juice and mre.I would say go down before 9.30am because it does get busy but there is always plenty of food. We didnt go for lunch but the evening meal was just the same plenty of food and something for everyone with icecream and cakes and food from all around the world. The kids part of the hotel is great away from the adults section and plenty of games entertainment for them, and its handy that is also has a Mcdonalds inside the hotel. It does have loads of other food places inside the hotel so you will never go hungry. There are 3 or 4 casinos inside the hotel and all the staff work really hard coming round asking if you want drinks ( any kind) for free. The best thing is right outside the hotel is a bus stop, which HAS a ticket machine ( most of them dont ) where you can buy a 24 hour pass for $5, 2 day pass $7 and a 3 day pass $20. The buses are 24 hours a day and every 10-15 minutes. You can buy your bus tickets on the bus BUT you have to have the right money and you CAN NOT buy a 3 day pass off the bus ONLY at the machines. The rooms are basic nothign special but the beds are very comfy, big, it has a tv, barthroom, iron and ironing board, huge wardrobes everything you need from a bedroom. I would NOT pay more to stay in the other hotels as you can go into ALL of them and look around them, eat in them, play the slots, table games. So you are not getting anything more for your money maybe a posher bedroom but how much time and you going to spend in it when vagas is a 24 hour place ??? and it really is 24 hour never sleeps. I would recomment this hotel because it has EVERYTHING, and it is amazing value for money. There were decorating the main areas in the hotel when we were there but to be honest it was all VERY clean and well kept. one tip if you tip the waitress in the casino $1 she will look after you and always come back to see if you want more drinks. It is a big area and sometimes you will wait 30-45 minutes before you see a waitress it is the same in ALL of the hotels.

I always imagine The Strip to be where the action is. If you're staying on the strip, you're in the action. Not the case. I booked Circus Circus for kids.They enjoyed the rides for a few hours but that's as far as it goes. We stayed in the Sky View Tower overlooking Down Town LV. The view was still nice enough but the room was not great. Firstly, the key to our room randomly stopped working. With 3 children, this is not helpful. So we walked back to the lobby. If you don't get lost, it's 15 mins walk. Then returned back to our room again and the key still wouldn't work. Back to the Lobby and they sent security up. They fixed the problem but I felt like something was wrong (was someone in our room?) Thankfully the room looked normal and we didn't have any valuables to steal. The shower wouldn't work properly and when we finally got it working, it dripped for 2 days after. The shower area itself was not really nice. Had water stains in the shower area. It was okay but I don't like showering in a place that alot of people use and is old looking. Doesn't feel hygienic to me. Also, they have a light in the wardrobe. I leaned on the outside and it started sparking. Thought that was a bit of a fire hazard. Also, when it came time to explore the Strip, it felt as though we were walking forever to get to anything. The Sahara accross the road has closed down so that has effected the atmosphere. There is a dark spot accross the road. Next to Circus Circus there is a big car park (another dark spot) and a huge vacant allotment (construction site). We walked several blocks before we got to ANYTHING. Not fun with kids. Especially when there is multiple news stands covered in naked women along the way. The kids complained that they were tired before we reached any action. Maybe this is a temporary thing and things will be different when construction is finished but until then, catch the bus! In general, vegas is still vegas. The room was cheap enough. The kids enjoyed the rides (at an additional cost). The buffet was average. The service was fine. The casino was fine (not great). There are better places to stay. There are worse places to stay.

Wanted a Strip hotel and this was one of the cheapest. A little dated as it is also one of the oldest hotels on the Strip but who cares when you are using it as somewhere to bed down. Our first room was in the Skyrise tower and was spacious and clean with a queen bed. The room safe was locked by the previous occupant when they left and we had to call for it to be opened. Security was with us within 30 mins to unlock it. Our second room was in the West tower. We were upgraded to a suite for the trouble we had with the safe on our first visit....very nice of them :) This room was also spacious and clean with a kingsize bed, far bigger than UK kingsize and so big you could play hide and seek in it!!!! Do not forget to put the 'do not disturb' sign on your door as the maid can call as early as 8am!!! We decided to go for the 'all you could eat' breakfast buffet each day as this would put us on till teatime and was good value for the price ($13) This hotel caters towards families in this 'grown-ups playground'. The large adventure dome would be great for the kids as well as the indoor circus acts and amusement area. The hotel also has a Tix4Tonight counter that sells cut price show tickets from 10am each day. Access to the rest of the Strip is good with the Deuce bus stop right outside the hotel. $7 buys a 24 hour ticket which will also take you on routes away from the Strip. As the bus runs 24/7 along the Strip and stops outside most hotels, this is very handy for getting back late at night without using taxis. It is very popular so be prepared to stand.

Now dont get me wrong this is not a 5 star resort but it is very affordable while still being clean. Even the bathrooms are kept clean down on the casino floor. Now in the casino itself the wallpaper & paint could stand some refreshing but the place IS old, so its to be expected, they do manage to keep the carpets pretty clean for as old as it is & as much traffic as it sees.

We went to the pool also a few times, it was clean, lot of security, two lifeguards and they really don't tolerate drunk people around the pool. Saw people being escorted out of the area by police and hotel security cause of their behavior. Something worth to do is rent a car so you can see all the attraction on the main strip. Almost every hotel has a self parking area that you can park your car for free, very good when you have little ones that get tired fast! Also we went to see the variety show at the \"V\" theater in Planet Hollywood, very good show for the entire family, it was quick numbers and kept going from one act to the other with no downtime. Only down part, it's general admission so first come first serve for the seat. With our car we went out of Vegas to Hoover Dam. A must see! 45 minutes drive from downtown Vegas. We didn't do the tour cause we didn't have shoes on, they do not allow anybody in without shoes, so we walked and saw everything by just looking and realise it was enough for the kids.

The Adventure Dome was fun for all but there weren't many rides for my 12-year old. She was a few inches too big for the kiddy rides, and was too scared to go on the bigger rides. Lots of fun on the bumper cars, the 4-D movies and we all loved the Happy Feet ride. We spent 4 hours there and that was plenty of time.

This was our second trip in less than a year to Circus Circus and our kids won't stop talking about it. Even though it is one of the oldest properties on the Strip, Circus Circus has done an excellent job updating the rooms and facilities. The Adventuredome provides lots of fun rides and games. The midway area with all of the carnival games, video games, skee ball, and circus acts keep the kids excited and entertained and was a great way to let the kids burn off a lot of energy. They won TONS of prizes! Circus Circus has a wide variety of dining options. Our favorites for great food and VALUE are the Pizzeria restaurant that delivers to your room, the Westside Deli with lots of choices, and Blue Iguana Mexican Express. For the parents, the casino has a wide variety of slots and table games. Slots Of Fun is adjacent to Circus Circus and is also a great place to play. The rooms are very clean and many of them have been recently remodeled. The room prices can't be beat! The ONLY downside I can give you is that if you arrive on Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to stand in a long line to check in. The Circus Circus is the 14th largest hotel in the world and it fills up on the weekends because of their low room rates. Even with every position at the front desk staffed, the line will be long but will move at a good pace. Just set reasonable expectations for check in on a weekend night and the rest of your stay will be worth the wait! One other thing- this place CANNOT BE BEAT if you have kids. If you do not have children, or if you don't like children, then consider another property because this place is full of families with kids. LOTS of kids.

It was next door to the drinks and ice machines, and an Elevator. My husband was very upset that his trying to make it a special occasion had failed. We were moved to another room - 32nd Floor West Tower. This room at least had a view, but also had 2 large beds instead of one, and was 100sq feet smaller than what we had paid for. We had to fight to get a refund for the difference in cost, it was not offered when the room was changed.

We booked a west tower room and they are actually quite nice, they have done a good job on them.

We called down to have someone take care of these 2 issues, they said someone would come and take care of it....and we ended up having to wipe down the toilet ourselves and never got to use the safe for our entire stay. We also had rooms with adjoining doors, and unfortunately all this did was give us the lovely sound of a crying child late at night and in the early morning. The rooms are not sound-proofed at all. Bring ear plugs! The lobby and casino areas are definitely in need of upgrading, but we didn't expect too much. This hotel is on the north end of the strip and the only nearby casino is the riviera, which means if you want to eat anywhere that has good food, you have a long walk ahead of you or need to take the bus or a cab. If the buses ran reliably every 15 minutes like they are supposed to, this would not be a big deal, but quite often we would wait 30 minutes or more for a bus to show up, and when one finally did, it was usually packed. We actually ended up switching hotels part way through our trip for this very reason. This hotel has cheap rates on weekends, so if you are only going for a weekend and don't plan to be running back and forth to our hotel, then stay here. If you know you'll want to stop in and drop off shopping, or change for dinner or a show, I would recommend staying somewhere else unless you want to take cabs everywhere. One really nice part of this hotel is it has 2 tix for tonight booths, one in the lobby and one in Slots of fun. It was great to get our shows tickets before we left the hotel.

I agree with the other reviews that the food had no flavor the blue Iguana mexican place had no flavor whatsoever.... The food looked nothing like the pictures... (we had the ultimate grande burrito) it was a dollar more for rice, for beans and for sour cream... 3 extra dollars and then it was 3 bucks for each drink as well... They only sold one size! We didn't even bother after that to try their buffet as we had read these reviews before we left.. The room in the Skyrise tower was alright but everyone was right about the outdated TV. The beds were comfy and loved the pillow... Loved the pillow so much in fact I ordered one off amazon. The bathroom was alright too until we realized the things in the shower were not ours (we all assumed they were each others things eww) and were left by the guest before us,,, they were still in the bathroom when we left as well. we had 2 rooms adjoined and only one key out of 5 total keys worked... they mixed the keys up too... we were supposed to have 3 keys, my family members was supposed to have 2 keys and their key worked only on our room... (Thank Goodness we had the ajoined doors left open to each others rooms) The slot on her door was completely broken.. It did not even light up at all... Our keys all had to be re-keyed. After spending forever in a long line to get that done. Ugg (forget it we sucked it up and used the one key... until after the incident when security took me straight to the front of the line to get it done) We also signed up for and received players cards when we got to the circus circus and mine quit working, so I went to get a new one... everything was supposed too and should have been transferred over to the new card but... I lost all of my points... The kids 14 and 8 had a blast at the Adventure Dome and at the Midway carnival games. The circus acts were much better then we expected! Those were actually spectacular and a joy to see!! The kids loved it!!! The roulette table on the other hand had an admittedly strung out on crack guy at the table... He was clearly messed up and kept saying loudly how he needs to stop doing so much crack? Rockin Ritas was full of hookers... They were bragging about being hookers and the bar tender seemed to know they were hookers too... It is so sad that the Circus Circus is turning into a drug and prostitution hub for Las Vegas! So all in all we had a good time and bad time all in one trip... It kinda evened itself out with the good and bad... Circus circus not great but just Okay. We also stayed 2 nights at the Flamingo and 2 nights at the Cosmopolitan... So the circus circus was defiantly a downgrade but was perfect for the kids!!!", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201cNo wounder it has been 15 years since I visited!\u201d", "Author": "Richard C", "ReviewID": "UR125718343", "Content": "To be honest, I would not be going any time soon!

Without wanting to sound prejudiced, we felt that we were in a gang environment in all public areas. Having visited almost all of the hotels on the strip, this seems to be the only one that is happy to allow time share touts to slam you every ten steps that you take.

The lobby is a little outdated but the skytower rooms are nice and I even had a decent view of the valley lights at night. The room is updated and the beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was clean and the shower head was nice, with a lot of hot water. The only two complaints that I had about the hotel are petty but I still think relevant. The first is that I have recently started a training regimen and since I get up before everyone else I was going to hit the gym both mornings I was there. I could not find the gym, I asked a few different workers and they didn't know, I asked the front desk and they stated that it was in the main tower but I still couldn't find it. Really it didn't matter, I ended up walking down to the other end of the strip and back and I'm actually glad that I did it instead of hitting the gym. The second complaint is about the buffet, yes I know they give most customers a few free passes but it is seriously lacking. As dumb as it sounds, when I go to any buffet (hometown for example) they have different toppings to put on your salad, even if they are just basic carrots and peas. Here they had a bowl of iceberg lettuce and another of mixed greens and four different types of dressing, that was it, I didn't even see croutons. Overall, I would stay here again but only in the Skytowers and I would eat at the buffet but only if I had free passes, the last day I was there I went to Luxor Hotel and for the exact same price their buffet was loads better. It's not as bad as most of the reviews state, also I checked in at 6 pm and there were only two people in front of me, so I would avoid 3pm since that seems to be a common complaint.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hazel, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed Our Time\u201d", "Author": "Leticia H", "ReviewID": "UR125575564", "Content": "I was very pleased with the service we recieved at Circus Circus and not to mention the excellent rates we recieved and free stuff!

If you are staying in that tower, I highly recommend that you switch towers. My husband and I stayed in the West Tower which was very nice compared to the Skyrise. The Skyrise is very outdated and ugly. Low celings, smaller rooms. The West Tower was a lot newer and very nice. The first night we went out and didn't come back to the hotel until around 3am - full of energy and not wanting to end the night, we stopped at rock and rita's to have a few more drinks...WE FELL IN LOOOVE!

The bathrooms were very tired looking and old, be warned when you flush the loo, it's so powerful the noise will make you jump!

Room was spacious with Flat screen TV, free wi fi , iron and a safe in room was also given. Beds were comfortable and room was clean. Food joints in the hotel were not so good and the variety was not there so if you are looking for some good food you need to look for other restaurants. Hotel offers all you eat buffets which serve breakfast , lunch and dinner for different prices and the quality is ok so if you wish to have a hearty morning break fast and then start seeing different places around vegas then it will serve your purpose. Casino there is just about fine. Drinks are expensive so better to have your own supply in the room :) Bottom line value for money.

It is a little further up the strip than the majority of the other hotel/casinos, making it necessary to take the deuce bus down the strip to explore (just a little past easy walking distance). We arrived at about 10pm on a thursday night and stood in line for around 30 minutes to check in as there was only one receptionist on duty. We were 'upgraded' to the Casino Tower from the Skyrise Tower due to this wait, which was nice as it put us in a more convenient location (I'm not sure the room was nicer, however!). The room is spacious and fairly well thought out, although there is a little bit of a shortage of storage space (although the same can be said for hotel rooms everywhere). One fairly major downside is that they only change the linens if you request it, and despite our requesting it, the sheets have only been changed once in our fortnight long stay. The towels etc are replenished daily however. There are plenty of restaurants on site, but we've avoided the buffet so far because of mediocre at best reviews. Rock & Rita's and The Garden Grill were both nice but fairly average. The Pizzeria was pretty good, and delivers to your room, and the Westside Deli seems expensive at first glance, with deli sandwiches coming in at around $7.99, but they are stuffed full and very tasty. Overall, while this clearly isn't one of the best hotels on the strip, it's easily worth the money, and it's slightly inconvenient location is balanced by the fact it has free circus entertainment acts and an addictive arcade to keep you busy here, and the Deuce bus stop just outside the door for when you want to go exploring. As a minor point, as the pools are all outside, they shut them down during the winter- so even though it was 21 degrees C plus (60's), easily warm enough for swimming, they consider this too cold and aren't planning on opening the pools until 1st March (this information was super hard to find out!)", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI'm sure Circus Circus would have been great in the 20th Century\u201d", "Author": "Alan504022", "ReviewID": "UR123900692", "Content": "Circus Circus is at the far end of the strip and at the time of us visiting it was almost by itself as the casinos at the top of the stripped have been knocked down and new ones are being built in it's place.

She chatted with us and made us feel welcome and comfortable. She also upgraded us to a tower room but did mention that what we'd booked (something in the Manor) was the \"motel\" and one would definitely benefit from paying a little extra to stay in the tower. Anyway, we found our way to our room and though it had older furnishings it was nice and large with a decent view of the strip. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom (again, older fixtures) was clean and well maintained. We had breakfast the next morning in the hotel (don't remember the restaurant) but we were given a savings passport full of coupons to use at various restaurants and shops around the property. Breakfast was cheap, delicious and plentiful. No complaints there. Overall we actually decided that should we ever come back to Vegas that the Circus Circus will be a contender over the other more centrally located, \"higher end\" and more expensive hotel we had chosen to start!", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Ireland, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNearby the convention center\u201d", "Author": "The_Wayfarer2", "ReviewID": "UR123156690", "Content": "I've stayed here several times when visiting shows at the convention center.

I think Circus Circus has seen its better days long ago and the rides and games for the kids is what keeps it up and running- if all the famalies with children were not there it would have been pretty empty as well. I would highly recomend this to those that are bringing their kids to Vegas. As far as a casino in general it seems out dated in a way i cant really desrcibe - but i have seen and been in worse.

Having said that, all hotels have free parking so you can always drive around - it is a huge hotel so avoid peak check in times otherwise you will be queing for hours, as it happened to us. If you see a huge queue, go for a walk and return late in the day if you can - you may (will) not get the requirements requested when booking.

There were enough towels, and our room was cleaned daily. The decor wasn't shabby or ugly at all. We arrived expecting the worst kind of room and the room definitely exceeded our expectations. Didn't eat at the buffet or inside the hotel, so I cannot write about that. There are numerous kids running around the place, so that was a negative for us. Other negatives include the long walk from the Strip entrance of the Casino to our room, and the fact that the Hotel is so far north on the Strip, it's about an hour walk to the Bellagio/mid-Strip. However, as we only used the hotel to sleep, the location didn't really bother us too much. Plus, there is a bus stop for the Deuce right out front that will take you down the strip for $7 (one day pass). For the price, this hotel is a good value. We definitely wouldn't mind staying here again, as long as we got a room in the West Tower.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rolling Meadows, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive but awful.\u201d", "Author": "sagekilz", "ReviewID": "UR122139887", "Content": "Traveled to Las Vegas for the Christmas holiday and we are not gamblers, rather travelers. That being said we went to Las Vegas because we had never been and wanted to go somewhere exciting and warm. We booked Circus Circus mostly because it was inexpensive. Negatives: The hotel is ALL THE WAY at the end of the strip - want to go anywhere plan on a LONG walk or LONG bus ride. You could tell the hotel was built in 1963 and was refurbished in 1993, with nothing updated between or after. The room was a Las Vegas hotel room but everything was mismatched. The door was the original door but the bed was from last year - nothing matched. Everything was dated, badly. There was no individuality to the place, just seemed like a tourist stop. The gambling areas were grungy and run down, almost \"ghetto\". By far Circus Circus has THE WORST buffet in the western part of the country - 5 choices of food 6 different times (chicken, pork, rice, mash potatoes and pasta). They also cleaned our table, completely off, before we were done eating. Children running around obnoxiously without supervision and no staff implementing order (random kids were sitting at our table putting our silverware in here mouths). Go to the Wynn for a much better experience. In addition to all this, the layout is a disaster. You have to go to different sections of elevators for almost everything. Nothing is laid out in a manner that makes any sense, everything is scattered. While walking down the main inside \"strip\" of the hotel, you are hassled every 15 feet with someone trying to sell you something. It gets real old REAL quick. Every restaurant seems to close at 1 p.m. Nothing was ever open to do anything. All food we ate in the hotel was brutally bad. We had no good experiences relating to food within the hotel. Positives: The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on, hotel or personal and pillows were amazing. Room was always clean when we came back from the Strip. Hotel was clean and kept up. The bar Rock 'n Rita's was a blast and I highly recommend it. Overall we picked Circus Circus because it was cheap and we paid for it dearly.

Maid came in every morning and re-did the place with fresh towels and soaps so when we came back in the evening it was very welcoming. One thing I missed was a coffee maker every morning and had to walk 10 mins to get coffee. There are timeshare guys in the hotel who will approach you and try hard to get you to attend their presentations for free shows or dinners. If you want to avoid them, just say you are leaving the next morning and the conversation will end quickly. The buffet at Circus Circus was just OK not great or fancy. The Casino is huge and does have a stale smoke smell to which you get accustomed in a while. The $5 blackjack tables and the dealers were fun. This was my first time to Vegas so had to try the slots as well. Played video poker for a few hours and lost 40 bucks but it was all fun. Booze is free and keeps flowing as long as you tip the cocktail waitress. We also spent a lot of time at Slot A Fun which is just outside the hotel. It has a $1 blackjack and craps table with virtual dealers and believe me it\u2019s a lot of fun. Again booze keeps coming for free and I tipped a dollar for every 2 drinks. There are security guards in there so I did not see any bums in there. There is a bus stop just outside and a daily pass is $7 and 3 day pass is $20 which will take you to the strip every 10 mins 24/7. There are shuttles to/from the airport to the hotel every 30mins.

Also I just turned 21 and only one person who wasnt even a cop or security asked if I was 21 and I thanked him. Circus Circus has to beef up security.

The steak (I had a New York strip) was ok but had the \"air\" of tenderising agents about it, far too soft if you know what I mean and boy do they know how to charge for it. best given a wide birth IMO.

Just like other big hotels in USA, this one too has a very welcoming lobby and a huge one at that. The rooms are very big and enough even for a family of four staying together. I would recommend this hotel mainly because of the fact that while the parents wish to sample or have a look at the slot machines and get a taste of the gambling tables, the kids can be left in the company of their hotel staff, who are ever helpful to accompany them and take them around the kiddies / games area. There are lots of games for the children, almost like a theme park where there attendants roaming around in the guise of clowns and make the kids feel special and occupied. I had the good fortune of living this experience and also winning a couple of games, where I also won a huge tiger soft toy as a prize!

We were desperate and had to act on it as it was only getting later and later. The desk lady told us all they had left were manor rooms, which were set up like a motel but not to worry, they were safe and had been recently refurbished. Ha! I sincerely hope who ever did any refurbishing was not compensated. It looked like they had sat 2 new chairs in a room that was otherwise my age (30ish). Check in was friendly and quick but I felt a little duped with the whole refurbished room thing. It had been a stressful last few hours trying to find a decent place and I was quite upset with the condition the room was actually in. We had to make the best of it and make sure our kids were fine. Parking was well lit though I wouldn't walk out there by myself. Entrance into the Manor buildings are room key slot controlled so there is no access to the rooms from the outside of the building which made me feel a tiny bit better. The room was dingy, dark, very worn and seemingly neglected. Peeling, splattered, and stained walls. Disgusting carpet. And a bathroom that belongs at a backwoods truck stop. I was hesitant to let my kids even on the floor to walk. The toilet sprayed everytime flushed. The light switch was loose. The sockets were loose and faulty. Just, bad and dangerous. The ac unit was loudly on and off all night. I would have preferred it to be on all night as the walls are paper thin and I could hear the men next door talking and making other.....noises. Thank god we had a small box fan to drown all that out. I will say the beds were fairly comfortable and the pillows were nice. The sheets and towels were clean and there was ample room to hang clothes in the ridiculously large entertainment center. There was also a cooler to keep my babies milk cold so that was a plus.

The beds and pillows where amazing, every holiday i have been on, im always looking foward to coming home and getting into,my own bed, but i could have easily stayed in that bed for another week! Room was spacious and airy and never smelt of smoke! The reception is a little dated but the helpful staff make up for that, the buffett breakfast was delish and the casinos had a really good atmosphere with a great mix of people having fun! The midway for the kids is really good, my little man was in heaven, the circus acts where good and the adventure dome an added bonus. We went out to other hotels but i could not wait to get back to our own hotel, as i found some of the larger ones to feel more like a shopping mall than a hotel and the position of them in the hustle and bustle at night time can be a bit manic. My only negative for this hotel, is i feel the pool area is not large enough for the number of guests staying in the hotel, but that is a minor negative and i will definately be staying at circus circus again.

When we got to the check in agent, we had excellent customer service from her (and I regret now not getting her name so I could put the praise to a person) and we found that both my friend's room and mine had been upgraded to the West Tower for no charge. Yes, there's a resort fee. But I didn't mind paying it when we received our special offers from the hotel, and mixed in with the discount we got on our shows from the Tix4Tonight people.The West Tower rooms were fantastic. I highly recommend them. While I didn't get much of a view from my room, I wasn't staying in the room for the view. The beds were soft, the bathroom was clean, and I was ready to call it good. The Tix4Tonight should be the place to go to get your show tickets. We got our Blue Man Group (front row center!) for almost half off. And the next night we saw Mystere (Not as good as Ka) for almost half off too. I know I saw the Price is Right show for at least half off. And it's located right in the lobby. Plenty of places to eat and shop right in the hotel. As far as the casino aspect goes, plenty of cheap table games and slots. I was a fan of getting breakfast in the morning and then setting down at the three dollar blackjack table and waking up to back to back 21s. ;) As far having two many kids around, I didn't see all that many. Yes there were some but it's a kid's themed hotel. My room was always quiet, so who cared what they did? Bottom Line, I was pleasantly surprised at the all around experience at the Circus Circus. And I will definately come back in the future.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201clovely holiday\u201d", "Author": "karensmith33", "ReviewID": "UR119716131", "Content": "Just back from a brill 2 week holiday in vegas.

Lastly the buffet is open til 10pm and after a huge day with the kids checking out the after sunset displays, it was great value for money. WEAKNESSES: The decor is old, even the waiting area is dingy, dark and a little foreboding. The bizarre set up of lifts and car parking leaves you lost most times you need to go to your room.

This time, we wanted something on the north side and our Alaska Air package included this hotel. Needless to say, it wasn't the best, we've been to the worst motels, and Circus Circus was adequate for our needs. Who stays at the hotel room in Vegas?? To start things off, we rented a car. The first complaint I had with the hotel is the cracked/broken roadways in and around the hotel. There weren't any clear signs for valet or self-park until I was inside the hotel parking lot. There were 2 separate garages in Circus Circus, and there weren't a sign at all about the Skyrise tower parking without driving to the KOA campground. It was a 3pm Sunday, the check-in wasn't long. Since we prepaid for everything, the check-in lady even offered us some choices (possibly due to the request in ahead of time we wanted a newer room with less stink). We were offered the West Tower or Skyrise Tower. I wanted to stay away from the main casino, therefore I picked the Skyrise Tower. We were given good instruction and a map, the walk from the main lobby to the Skyrise Tower is a long one, but it is about the same in any hotels in Vegas anyways. The casino definitely smell old, but not stinky. It just smelled exactly like the older hotels in the old downtown Vegas (Fremont St.). We were given a room on the 28th floor (tower has 29 floors). My gf and I were pleased about the strip view. The room was clean, it had the basic like TV, phone, 2 queen beds, a chair. The bathroom was the bad one: faucet handle was striped and the faucet in the shower leaked a little. No big deal for us, we live in an apartment that is 10 times worst than this! We just don't use the washing basin. We left a note to housekeeping the next day and I hope they do attend to it. Because the Skyrise tower is on the other side of the hotel, there were fewer traffic/people there. There were a few slot machines there and surprisingly there was security guards roaming around pretty much all the time. I feel safer there already! We occasionally we heard people screaming from the Adventure Dome during Fright Dome. In the morning there were trucks backing in, the beep sound might be an annoyance. Overall amenities were simply old, AC is on the noisy side but works. Linen sheets were old and had holes in them. TV were 27\" CRTs. Towels smelled like bleach and feels like sandpaper. On the bright side, pillows are amazingly comfortable and we slept extremely well during our 3 nights stay. Free wifi is also good too. We walked by the restaurants inside the hotel, they didn't look that good even-though we were given a coupon book. I couldn't comment on the quality of the food. We are self-served people so I couldn't comment on the staff other than the check-in lady. To summarize, if you are looking at just a place to crash with all the basics, Circus Circus Skyrise tower is a good choice. If you are looking at a resort that you will be planning to stay and play there, go somewhere else.

With its big top attitude and its indoor amusement park it very well may be. The beauty of this particular hotel doesn\u2019t lie so much in its size or even the circus like atmosphere. The charm lies in the fact that it was something new and relatively untried along the Vegas strip. Rather than build to suit the gamblers they were hoping to attract, this particular hotel was wise enough to offer something new and untried by appealing to families with children rather than solely to gamblers. The gamble seems to be paying off in a city that is known for both its hits and its misses. Other hotels and casinos are also working to cultivate the family friendly image that Circus Circus has basically proven. Not only did this hotel build The Adventuredome Theme Park they also decided to make accommodations even more family friendly by accommodating RVs at the Circusland RV Park. This offers a great place for families to stay that might not otherwise grace the theme park, hotel, or the casino. Don\u2019t forget that there is a casino involved and that is the primary purpose of this gigantic hotel, resort, and theme park. The casino makes the expense of building it all very much worthwhile and brings in big business of its own each and every day. In grand Vegas style there is also the requisite onsite shopping and of course full service of wedding options in addition to a wedding chapel and banquet facilities in which to hold the reception of your dreams. The shopping at Circus Circus offers everything from ultra exclusive boutique shops and salons to stores such as Under $10 and the trading Post, which offers fad jewelry and other kid friendly gifts. This hotel has a somewhat unique concept that sets it apart from the many others along Vegas\u2019 strip. If you are traveling to Vegas with the family I very much recommend at least checking them out and comparing prices and packages with the other hotels and resorts in the area. Keep in mind that comps are like money in the bank particularly when they involve food or activities that you were planning to do even without the comps. So you may be able to negotiate a much better deal even if you\u2019re paying a couple more dollars a night by having free parking, complimentary meals, or tickets to events, shows, or attractions. Now we\u2019re on to my favorite part of the discussion. Dining options. Circus Circus does not disappoint when it comes to offering variety to its guests. In addition to The Steakhouse, there is The Garden Grill, Mexitallia, Pink Pony, Circus Buffet, Pizzeria, Westside Deli, and Barista Caf\u00e9. The food offerings accommodate varying budgets and familial needs by offering some kid friendly dining choices to visitors and guests as well. The good news however is that if these restaurants aren\u2019t appealing to you there is another hotel, casino, or restaurant next door that has different fare to offer. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Las Vegas along with the family there are very few hotels that will offer the overall environment of fun and wonder that you will find at Circus Circus. In addition to the wonderful rooms, the great food, the casino, and The Adventuredome Theme Park you will find that the shows here are as kid friendly and entertaining for the entire family as the atmosphere in general. This is a great vacation destination anywhere.

However the buffet was rubbish but it was free so used it! As for the room - good sizes, but they absolutely stank of stale smoke. When I got back to the UK my wife thought I had been smoking as my clothes (ones I didn't wear and were clean) had to be washed as they inherited my room smell. Seriously it is bad. However, after the 2nd day we didn't notice as the hotel smells the same so we got used to it! We used hotel as a base and went to others every night to get out of this hole. Kids were not an issue for us, they were not allowed in casino, and kept themselves to the adventuredome so cant complain. I definately would not stay at this hotel again, how anyone can say they would never stay anywhere else is beyond me apart from maybe they have not stayed anywhere else in vegas. I have now done MGM Signature, Luxor and Mandalay Bay (all with wife so wanted to do it in style), but CC is really a hole compared to these places, but of course costs more money. As for its location don't believe anyone when they say its convienient. It is the most INconvienient hotel on the strip (along with the Riveira). 25mins walk from the Monorail, at least a $15 taxi to get to the next nearest hotel, but the deuce is located outside. Didnt use it as could not bear standing in 100 degree heat waiting for it, and the money we saved staying at CC meant we could taxi everywhere we wanted. I thought the swimming pool was quite good though, had a bar, and not too crowded but we did go at 9am every morning before most were out of bed so dont know how busy it got later on.

We traveled with a small group who had special requested to be either in rooms next to each other or close to one another which was initially done for us. After our first night my girlfriend found a cockroach in our bathroom, when I went to make sure she wasn't just seeing something I saw another one! We called the desk right away and initially were told that we would have to leave the room for 3-6 hours while they spray. After some arguing with the desk they told us we had to be moved to the 29th floor and away from our group and had to be placed from a king bed into 2 queen beds. To say I was frustrated is an understatement. After we tore through our bags to make sure no bugs had stowed away in our stuff we moved rooms, this required us to change elevators twice to get to the new floor with an ok view of the strip through very, very dirty windows. The hotel its self is nothing to write home about, its kept mostly clean but not that great. The slots and tables were never ever full, the games were very old. The shopping in the casino and hotel are only useful if you are 10 years old or working the streets at night. The distance from the actual strip, where the rest of the major casino's and hotels are located, is much to far to walk and required a cab, $10 average to get to the Treasure Island, or the monorail that is about 3/4 a mile away from the hotel and is $28 for three days of riding. If you plan on doing a lot of stuff on the strip don't stay here because the walking and cab costs will eliminate the saving of staying at this horrible hotel rather then paying for one on the lower end of the strip. I will say this hotel seems to be catered to kids with the Adventure Dome and Circus show, very small scale, they do each day. The Adventure Dome had more closed rides then it had open and we never saw it very packed with anyone.

Since this trip was all about a 9-year-old's birthday weekend (who loves 5-star hotels), I took a chance here. As stated, do your research before booking hotels anywhere and don't complain otherwise. The West Tower was Circus Circus' \"top-of-the-line\" so that's where we stayed. Honestly, the room was bigger than expected, but I certainly didn't expect carpets to be shampooed or windows to be clean, and that's what we got. There's no refrigerator or microwave in the room and a quasi-functioning hair dryer. I think that the drains need to pumped, as well. I knew ahead of time not to expect a 5-star resort, so I really can't complain about anything. Customer Service: Top notch from Bellhops, lobby staff to casino, Adventuredome, shops and restaurants. The staff is not trying to hard, yet they are extremely accommodating for all your needs. West Tower: Not the manor (too many complaints about this because people don't research the rooms and get stuck with these motel style rooms). Connected to everything...Promenade with shops, Adventuredome, casino areas, restaurants, Midway Circus area, cafe, elevators, escalators. Restaurants: A little variety of everything all over the hotel. From Seattle so need espresso blends, which are on main level hotel cafe and Krispy Kreme. Casinos: Since I was not here to gamble, didn't do it, but they are all over the main level of the hotel in different areas. Children can pass through walkway areas marked by carpeting lines. Caution! Smoking everywhere in the casino areas. Adventuredome: Even just leaving another Disneyworld trip, we found this indoor amusement park full of fun for everyone. There are kiddie rides, thrill rides, in-between rides, arcade games, carnival games with prizes to be won and little snack stands along the way. The Adventuredome is air conditioned so enjoy the thrills in comfort. Shops: So many Las Vegas souvenir and general items at inexpensive prices. Note...sales tax of 8+% is added. But, everything is so cheap that it's hard to tell that you pay sales tax. There's even a salon if you need a quick mani or pedi, or even your hair styled. Elevators & Escalators: Enough to get you to where you are going. There are at least 2 dedicated elevators for certain floor levels so as not to overload the rides. If you try to catch one at peak hours of check-in or check-out, there may be a small wait time. Overall: The resort is huge, as with all major resorts along the Strip.

So we stopped in at Rockin Ritas for some nachos. Their late night menu doesn't have a very good selection but it's easy and fast.

Had a big CC margarita glass for $10 and refills $5. So strong! They definitely don't cheat you. Next morning I walked over to Slots A Fun. I use to have a blast here but not this time. Guess early morning is not the time to go. The slot tickets wouldn't work in the cash out machines and cashier was closed. Had to go back to the cashier in the CC to cash out.

It had a king-size bed and a lounge area, very spacious, and a lot bigger than expected. The bed was comfortable. The only complaint we had was the air-conditioning which seemed to be turned off in the middle of the night and wouldn't turn back on. We had to wake up to switch it back on again. One tip is do not accept any room at the Casino tower on the 3rd floor. It is the corridor that links the hotel tower to the adventure dome. So there's a lot of human traffic throughout the day. We were on the 7th floor and it was very quiet at night and we had no problems sleeping. I like the convenience of the Ticket4tonight booth located at the lobby, where we could get last minute tickets for same day shows. As we rented a car throughout our 4-day stay at the hotel, we parked at the self-parking garage. It was located next to the hotel lobby. We always try to park at Level 3 where there is a bridge connected to Advanture Dome. So, we didn't have to walk through the casino to get to our room. Circus Circus is located north of the strip, which is great as its not as busy as the middle strip. It was easy to get in and out of the hotel in the car. We used Industrial Road behind the Hotel to get to I-15 to get to the strip to avoid the traffic conjection. We also drove out to Hoover Dam without having to drive throught the strip.

More importantly, there are MANY children in the way who are OUT OF CONTROL and UNSUPERVISED, to the point were they are crawling on the floors. You can hardly move because of the crowds of people, who stand in the middle of the hallways for no reason. Security-wise, ANYONE COULD JUST GET IN THE HOTEL ROOM HALLWAYS... The POOL HAD NO SECURITY & NON-GUESTS COULD JUST WALK TO THE POOL. ANYONE AT ALL COULD GET IN HERE. The pool was also the ugliest hotel pool I have ever been to. Just a water hole in cement. It is definitely worth it to spend a couple hundred more and go to a DIFFERENT HOTEL! (South of Circus Circus and Riviera). There is no air conditioning in the room hallways, which is extremely disrespectful to us paying guests.

You could tell school was out since I'd say 25% of casino population were kids. Public areas of the casino were quite noisey and a bit crowded as a result, but casino tower rooms were quiet enough for a good night's sleep. A convenient \"deuce\" (city) bus stop about 450 feet from the main entrance made getting around Vegas by bus easy enough and a bargain if you buy the 7-day pass at the special weekly rate. The kids should be expected since the circus portion of the casino and the \"adventure dome\" is a great and fun attraction for them. I didn't see any kids who didn't look like they were having a great time. The security folks do a good job of keeping them out of the gambling areas of the casino. Slots were reasonably loose and the table games well-staffed. Table limits were mixed and it wasn't hard to find a table where the minimum bet fit your budget. The room was comfortable and clean. Shower was difficult to adjust water temp. until I figured out the secret is to take a shower in the evenings, not in the AM when most folks seem to. Water drained slowly from the bathroom sink, so I reported that to the maid who saw to it maintenance folks came up and fixed it while I was away the same day I reported it. I'd recommend folks who are bothered by the childrens' presence to stay there when kids are in school. West tower and casino towers are convenient to the main portion of the casino. The others are a long walk and (I've heard) not so well maintained. Plenty of places to eat at Circus-Circus and prices are good for a strip hotel.

The line to check in was over an hour long. After having checked in we had to wait around 10 minutes for an elevator to our room that was in the supposed 'nicest wing' of the hotel. The room itself wasn't too bad but was absolutely freezing when we got inside. There were dirty footprints on the ceiling of the room (how someone managed that, we werent sure). When we made our reservation we asked for a roll away bed to be in the room when we arrived, which it wasnt. We had to go back downstairs to a desk and ask them to send it up. We picked the Circus Circus because of the rides and kid-specific activities but when the kids saw how crappy the place was, they preferred to sit in the room and watch TV all night.

When we had to leave our hotel we had to ask reception was there any possibility of staying on a few extra days, they were gona put us in a west tower with crazy prices, and woman on phone was very rude to girlfriend about it she just hung up.

There was mildew on each of the shower rings and the shower was dripping non stop before we even arrived. Maintenance was friendly and fixed it quickly. There was something sticky on the carpet gum, syrup, pop ????? Which drove me crazy but we never called to the front desk otherwise we would have had wait and show them exactly where it was. All the staff were very friendly and very grateful for the tip we left for housekeeping. After checking in and unpacking we headed down to the main floor and we were overwhelmed by the masses of people. Tons of families with multiple children everywhere. The tourists here just plow through you. No excuse me, or holding the door open they just keep walking. Very cuthroat. The kids were walking through the casinos - they were not allowed to loiter near machines. The buffets were ok. Obviously not gourmet. We we lucky enough to receive the Kids eat free coupons which we used for breakfast everyday. Saved us a bit of money. The buffet does have a great drink station with milk, juice, coffee and pop included in the buffet price. My sons 12 and 8 enjoyed the midway the most. It was 25 cents to 50 cents for the electronic games or $1 or $2 for the carnival games. Half the price of the games at Excalibur. We didn't go to the adventure dome. Check out was fast. Be wary of all those people who ask you how long you are staying or if you would like a free show. They are trying to sell you a time share. Very very aggressive. I think they were the worst part of the trip. Annoying!!! Even the guys on the strip handing out the nudie cards weren't that annoying. Our last night there, the fire alarm went off at 3am!! When we went down to the front desk in the morning and asked what it was. The front desk girl says \"I don't know, I wasn't here\" ????? When we left Circus Circus we took the shuttle bus. It was 28$ or 7$ each for the four of us. We gave the driver $30 and he just put it in his pocket and didn't even ask us if we wanted change. He then says airport, takes your stuff off and drives away. Most shuttle bus drivers ask which airline so they can drop you at the closet door. Not this guy. Plus the shuttle was burning hot inside. We should have taken a cab. Circus Circus is fine, if you are just looking for a place to put your head down. It is old, smoky and dark inside with kids everywhere and kind of a rough crowd.

This makes it a good place for families with kids and a great place for families on a budget with kids. We just stayed there for 9 nights in july 2011. Here are observations and updates to comment areas from previous reviews: Yes, it is crowded, lots of kids running around, they will bump into you from time to time, unless your children are angels this is normal kid in crowd behavior. Check in was 5 minutes, short line, friendly staff, but a few minutes after we chicked in the line was quite long. Tip: as check in time varies greatly have one parent deal with taxi and luggage and the other head straight for check in. Rooms: We were in the West tower, rooms were remodelled (you can tell by the granite backsplash in the shower laid over the original wallpaper) room did not smell like cigarettes, was made up each day was perfectly acceptable Tip: We were in a room adjoined by a door to another sound travels via the crack below the door, to deaden the sound we put the quilted and a n extra pillow to cover the crack and this reduced the sound completely. Food: The buffet is convenient and inexpensive but bland food. Tip: if you eat here stick to things that are hard to screw up: The carving station, turkey especially, corn, and mashed potatoes with gravy. Pasta as with all buffet pasta is insipid. Amenities: Adventuredome was an absolute blast for my 8 year old, if you have a child who just reached 48 inches they will not want to leave this place. there are $4 and $5 off coupons at other hotels for adventure (sponge bob ride at excalibur for one) using one of these it's $22 for hte whole day a great value. Tip: go at 10AM weekedays when it opens and it is empty you can do all the premium rides in an hour, this is less than it takes to ride 1 ride at disney world! and these rides are funner! Midway: the carnival area was super fun for both my 6 and 8 year old Tip: there is a dart game for $1 where any child under 12 automatically wins a stuffed animal my kids went home with about a dozen stuffed animals as a result. Circus: There is a schedule of the circus acts for hte week on the 2nd floor by the stage , acts performed promptly as scheduled to large crowds, the acts were fun and free. Those saying they did not see any acts the whole week were simply too lazy to follow the schedule. Gym: it is small but functional with weight machines and cardiovascular, it appears they have waived the gym fee they used to have as you know longer require a special key to get into the gym. Gambling: I was a first time player of texas hold'em and the games which get going around 10:30 AM were great. a good mix of tourists, regulars who knew each other and were very friendly and very helpful friendly staff. It is small stakes poker that I played for serious gamblers you may want to go elsewhere. Some floors not have their own ice machine if this is a big deal for you ask to be on a floor with an ice machine. elevator wait times vary. Tip: if lobby is crowded to go up just go up the escalator to floor 2. press down, go to the lobby then up to your floor. The RTC bus is a good value if you plan on going back and forth from the strip more than 1 time in a day.

The lobby is dark and shabby looking. Looks like it hasn't been updated in years. This hotel caters to families ( I didn't know this when I booked) so the entire place is full of families with multiple children. There were kids everywhere at all times of the day and night. There is a domed amusement park attached to the hotel so it's wonderful if you have kids but maybe not the place for you if you don't want constant noise and crowds.

We were told we had a \u201cvery nice room,\u201d but it was a typical two queen bed hotel room and not much space. They do not have suites for a family of four which was disappointing. The carpet had several stains on it. The bath tub drain was clogged and even though we call every day it was never fixed.

Our room was in the Casino Tower. We chose this hotel not such because of the price but because we brought our 17 and 15 year old sons and thought it might provide them some entertainment while my husband and I enjoyed the casino. The room price was a nice incentive but....remember what you have always been told...you get what you pay for. The room was horrible. I've seen better at a cheap motel. The furniture was banged up and broken and sparse to say the least. The beds were comfy I'll give them that but considering the over-all condition of things I was worried they were probably not very clean. There were no towels in our room at check in and it took several calls to get any. We also had no shampoo (thankfully I brought some). There was a dead, bloody bird right outside our window and that was the extent of our view. The rest of it was the roof of the casino and all the air conditioners. There was no cell phone reception unless we leaned over the window and considering that it's the 20th century, perhaps more than 2 electrical outlets might be nice. None of us could ever charge our phones!! The buffet was sub-par. We have better chain buffets here in Michigan. We were accidentally over charged for an additional person, then they took that off and recharged our credit card not taking into account that it takes 72 hrs to remove a charge so we had 2 charges for dinner on our c.c the whole time we were there. Thankfully we had enough to cover it. Had we been asked we'd have paid cash for the meal. It was difficult to find anyone in the entire place whose 1st language was English. 90% of the staff were Hispanic. Those who weren't, were Asian. Everyone seemed sad and sullen, especially in the Adventuredome. What a bunch of sorry looking folks. The Adventuredome was a total disappointment. Nothing but a carnival you could find in any small town with a few rides that I wasn't too sure were safe considering the over all state of things. It was jam packed with kids who seemed to have no supervision. We were run into constantly. The clientele of the entire place was pretty rough. Our kids ere bored and annoyed most of the time. You'd think kids would have more sense than to plow into my 6'2\" 200 lb linemen son, but no one seemed to have any respect for anyone's personal space. The pools were small and jam packed with little kids. While the life guards were quick to tell two Asian women that they had to get out of the pool since they weren't wearing swimsuits (the women looked like they had no idea what the life guard said and they also looked as if perhaps they were dressed appropriately for their culture) they were totally nonchalant about the puddle of vomit that we all saw a child produce on the edge of the cement near the water. A life guard came over and dropped a towel on it and walked away. At that point we left since we'd already been kicked twice by out of control kids who we couldn't ask to be more careful since they didn't speak English, and since the pool had a strange smell. The casino was pretty fun. It wasn't jammed pack and we did alright. Being novices to casinos we don't have much to compare it to but we did enjoy ourselves. Everything was way over priced in the shops ($8 for 2 2-liters of soda!) but for the most part the staff in them was pleasant. The Circus act we saw was a girl \"stretching\". That was about it. We never once, the whole week ever see one clown. Perhaps owing to the low cost of the rooms, the clientele of the hotel seemed kind of sketchy As a family of middle class, midwestern folks, we felt really out of place. We waited a long time for this trip and were all really excited. I guess we were pretty naive and should have listened to the people that warned us to pay more and stay somewhere else.

The buffet one night was good, all food well prepared, but a little over priced at $14.99 for dinner (not the buffet we remember from 20 years ago where the selection was much larger and the price a little more reasonable) No coffee pot in the room and no room service available until 11:00 am, so we bought a coffee pot and cups in order to have coffee when we woke up. Left the coffee pot behind - hope somebody gets some use out of it. The bed was very comfortable, so that is a plus.

We arrived, reception was huge and pleasant. The queues to check in were not but after seeing the other hotel lobbys this seemed to be the case everywhere. Receptionist was very polite and courteous and explained everythin brilliantly and how to get to the room as the hotel is pretty big. The only thing at first I wasn't 2 happy about was a 7 dollar phone use fee but it worked out gd as we had to phone to confirm excursions and it would have been a lot more expensive. Our room was in the main building the casino is huge, after seeing the other hotels it could maybe do with a little updating in there but there is nothing wrong with it and there was constantly keeping it clean and tidy always hoovering, I never saw that in the other hotels I must admit. When we got to the room(964)I couldn't believe how nice it was after reading the reviews it was really spacious and clean. The decor was a little old fashioned but that was the style it looked recently decorated. Had a massive comfy bed, tv, plenty of drawer storage, an open closet area and a large bathroom with hairdryer, bath, shower and again clean!housekeeping were in everyday, beds changed what looked like everyday, we saw them cleaning another room a few times and they were very precise even down to hoovering the mattresses! Definately no quarms on the cleanliness at all! When we first saw the pool area we were really surprised 2 big pools and 2 spas. Lots of sun loungers. Towel hire. Drinks and snacks bar. And plenty of life guards. We constantly saw management telling people to get out of the pool if they were fully clothed, they did not stand for it at all. They regarded safety really high too. The only downside was the pools were always really busy and with how many children were there it was noisy but this is not a disaster. After sneaking a peek at other hotels the pool was admittedly not as visully appealling as theirs but was perfectly adequate. We only ate at one restaurant in the hotel which was rock and ritas and that was only for breakfast. The breakfast was really good, service could have on the first couple of times been better but it did improve. The only reason I would stay at another hotel next time is because of the location, you could walk to the other end of the strip which we did everyday but you will get a lot of blisters!

Rated as #1 for kids- no way! Avoid the lure of inexpensive rooms at all costs.\u201d", "Author": "PickyGypsy", "ReviewID": "UR114682399", "Content": "We were passing through Vegas during a cross country trip and decided to stay a few nights to have some family fun. I did a search for the \"best Vegas hotels for kids\" and Circus Circus was rated #1. I have always heard that it was a fun, activity filled \"resort\" and was so excited for my girls to get a break from travelling. On the CC website, there was a \"special\" running that included a massive coupon book ($150 of savings) and standard room rates of approx $35/night. I was a bit concerned about the low cost but since we were able to select our room online AND because the hotel is so well-known and on the strip, we figured that it should be a decent place. We went ahead and booked 3 nights. When we arrived, I was pretty disappointed that it was so far from the actual \"strip\" but it was easy to find and somewhat open compared to other hotels that I've stayed at center-strip. The first issue was check-in. There were only 2 representatives but a massive line of guests waiting to check in. It felt like airport security and my husband was in line for more than 45 mins. Once he got keys, we made our way to the \"Manor Lodge\" even though I had specifically requested a different room. I didn't know that the hotel had a KOA on the property or that they had separate buildings (Manor) from the main casino. That's where we were. I don't know if the regular rooms are better, but avoid the Manor rooms completely. These buildings have parking right next to them, which is nice, but they are situated away from everything except a small outdoor pool. There is security around the complex, but it still felt shady. Once we got into the building, I was knocked out by the odor of stale pizza, vomit, alcohol, smoke and who-knows what else. In order to get to our room, we had to navigate a dark, low-clearance hallway that was strewn with pizza boxes and bags of fast-food garbage that seemed to be placed outside he majority of the doors. It was fun fighting with my 2-yr old who naturally assumed that we were at some kind of buffet, haha. But I wasn't concerned about her tantrum because the hall was also filled with various noises: screaming kids, fighting drunk couples, people having sex (from what it sounded like), and many of the doors were wide open. My 12 year old started crying and begged us to leave after passing one room that had a large man in his underwear (dirty tighty whities-classic!) who was holding a beer in one hand while chasing a naked toddler around the room, screaming obscenities because the kid was crying. The remaining 4-6 children and 2 other adults were randomly sprawled around the room, paying no attention whatsoever. This was before we even made it to our room, we were forced to stand in front of the open door because the hallway was blocked by a group of drunk, loud and confused international travelers who were trying to figure out where they were. Our room was stinky, dirty and bare. We had an old tube TV (not really important), 2 queen beds with minimal bedding, a night stand, and a view of the parking lot and a highway. The AC made the room damp and brought out the smoke smell (this was supposedly non-smoking). People were smoking all through the building, I'm a smoker but don't smoke indoors and never around children, it was like being in a bar restroom. The floors were littered with what looked like wet toilet paper and didn't appear to have been vaccumed in awhile. There was mold and mildew throughout- ceilings, walls, corners of bathroom and tub. The bathtub faucet was dripping so fast that it seemed like it was on. Half a roll of toilet paper, one washcloth, one towel, no hand soap...I've stayed in all kinds of hotels and motels over the years-good and bad- but I've never not been able to wash my hands. The bedding had obvious mascara and lipstick marks on sheets and pillows, as well as what appeared to be urine. Everything in the room looked dirty. The only thing that kept us from losing our sanity was reading through the coupon book...haha. There was nothing of value in it, things like : free small cup of coffee with a purchase of a dozen donuts, buy 2 entrees and get a free well drink...stuff like that. Needless to say, the decor is beyond dated which really isn't something that I normally care about-I look for clean, safe and comfy- but the old, tattered and abused wall coverings/furnishings do nothing more than accentuate the filth. As I end this warning/review, I want to clarify that I'm an average, mid-30's, upper middle woman who has spent my entire adult life in the military-I've travelled a lot, lived in tents for 12-13 months at a time and am not that demanding when it comes to lodging...I even spent a significant portion of my mil career inspecting and procuring food/lodging for mil members while deployed and travelling through developing nations. Circus Circus Manor lodging is not even close to what I would expect to find on the Las Vegas strip. After a few hours of torture, we called the front desk to say we were checking out early. They were accommodating and friendly but had already charged our card for the 3 day stay. We had that fixed, hopefully it sticks, and booked a room at MGM Grand for about $100/night. Pretty good deal, I've stayed there for a few conferences and they're great and affordable.

There was a line, but with plenty of representatives available, the wait wasn't long. Upon checking in, you are provided with a layout of the hotel, which proves to be very helpful to newcomers. My room was located on the 27th floor, in the West Tower. *Note: If you want to check out later than 11am, the hotel offers the option for a fee, which is perfect for anyone with a late flight.* Now back to the room - It looked great, the bed was incredibly comfortable. I did encounter some noise disturbances on the second night around 2am, though. It sounded like a plumbing issue, which lasted about 15 minutes. Despite that, I would have to say that the hotel was a great value. I especially liked Midway, the games and circus acts were a lot of fun. Another thing I appreciated was the fact that the bell desk can take care of your luggage in case you want to browse around after you've checked out, as long as you pick it up at the end of the day. There are plenty of souvenir shops located within the hotel that offer reasonably priced items. Definitely try the pizza as well as the burgers at Rock & Rita's. As others have mentioned, if you're going to stay mainly on the strip, take The Deuce. If you want to do more shopping, there is The Downtown & Strip Express.

This is an enormous place, I booked it online the night before and having not visited Las Vegas before I had no idea whether the location would be any good. It is a bit further from all the main hotels such as Belaggio etc so you'll need to take a bus to get you further along the strip. The room was somewhat tired looking and quite oldfashioned but had everything you need i.e. comfy bed and hot shower. There is wi-fi available in the room but you have to pay for it, I think it was about $5 or so, not sure exactly. It took a while to check in as there was a long queue but the lady that checked us in was extremely friendly and gave us some tips where to go and how to get there which we appreciated. I think location could have been better, it's not too far away but Las Vegas gets to busy in the evening and the traffic on the strip was awful so what would have probably been a rather short bus journey to all the main hotels/attractions turned into 45 minute trip. Although I have to say the female bus driver was hillarious, bossing people around, telling them where they can or can't stand etc so I think the comical value of that was worth the money we paid for the bus ticket.

Where do I start?\u201d", "Author": "Juggernautron1", "ReviewID": "UR112489474", "Content": "So, took my wife, 12 year old son and 7 year old daughter to Circus Circus. Valet was fine and check-in was fine. I actually had no problem with the resort fee which included wireless internet, coupons, etc. We stayed Thursday-Sunday, checking in Thursday at 2:00 p.m. celebrating my son's 12th birthday. It went downhill from there. Stayed in the West Tower on the 35th floor. Room was so dusty, I mean, really dusty and dated. TV didn't work and that was important because the kids were going to watch pay for view in the evening when my wife and I were downstairs together. Took forever to get that working. Now for the big complaint. We all did not sleep well. Couldn't figure out why. Then I see my daughter and see mucus in here eyes and nose. She blows her nose and black and red crap came out. Same thing happened to my son, wife and myself. We thought it might be an adjustment to the climate, but we're from southern California and it's honestly not that different. So, we chalked it off to an aberration, until the same thing happened on Saturday morning. My daughter was the only one struggling with her health at this point and while she tried to be a trooper, it was obvious that when we were at Adventuredome (the only good part about the trip) she was clearly not herself. We stayed June 2nd-June 5th and as of today (June 9th) she is still having nasal problems that she never had before. Even took her to the doctor who said that she was definitely exposed to some horrible air conditions. Not a big shock there. Well that's the big one, I'll give a synopsis on the other negatives. Some college kids checked in next to us Friday night and made horrible fraternity type nose till 4:00-5:00 a.m. What the hell are they doing at Circus Circus? Food was pedestrian at best, I mean I was a grunt in the Army and the buffet was barely edible. Player's Club? Horrible. I've stayed at the Sahara, Excalibur, Las Vegas Hilton, Tropicana, Luxor, Monte Carlo and the Riviera and Circus Circus players club is a joke. I played video blackjack at an average of $2 a hand. Probably played a 1200-1500 hands over 3 days, plus my wife at the nickel slots and you know what the cash reward was? $3.00. I gambled half the time at the Sahara and got like $35 cash reward when it was all said and done. So I took the food credit of $21 and went to the buffet Sunday morning before the drive home. They said I couldn't use the kids eat free and my $21 food credit at the same time. I told them was a crappy trip this was and if they ever want me back, they better accept both. Manager came, was rude, unapologetic and said, you can use one or the other, then walked away to leave me with the cashier. My wife looked at me and just laughed because that's all we could do. Minor things like a pool across the street, 40 minutes to checkout and 20 minutes for valet to bring our car around are like I said, minor. So, my daughter is on antibiotics and I'm still seething about what a horrible experience that place was. My advice, if you have a family, stay at the nearby Las Vegas Hilton, which is great value and walk your kids to Adventuredome and see a couple circus acts. That's the only thing they have going for them.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201crip off\u201d", "Author": "Chrissy0927", "ReviewID": "UR112092770", "Content": "Was on a family vacation to Vegas and stopped in Circus Circus to see the circus and was very disappointed.

You can buy 24 hr bus passes for like $ 12 trust me its worth every penny. The adventure dome was fun for an hour or so, but not too many rides for older kids to last all day and at a price of $ 24 per person for an all day pass you would LIKE for it to last longer than about 2 hours, GREAT for younger kids though! I found the variety of places to eat was nice and decent prices right in the hotel (didn't have to venture out to look for much of anything).

I got to Las Vegas with no map or research of where to go or what to do, but luckily they have magazines and pamphlets of everything you need to know on the desk. They also give you a booklet of vouchers to use including free rides at the mini theme park, money off food and free gambling lessons. On the ground floor they have desks where you can book Grand Canyon tours, tickets to shows, phone cards and stamps so they have everything you need under one roof. The restaurants and shop within Circus Circus are pricey, but there a couple of supermarkets across the road so you can take food back to your room to eat, but for lunch/dinner I walked down the road to The Fashion Show where they have lots of fast food places (including salad bars \u2013 they\u2019re not all unhealthy!) which is probably the cheapest place to eat on the Strip. The maids clean your room to a really high standard and the staff are helpful and polite. They have shuttle buses every half hour to take people to the airport so you don\u2019t have to worry about a thing! To get to Circus Circus from the airport, you just ask for a shuttle bus which drops people off along the strip and only costs $7!! Circus Circus may be further up the strip away from the main attractions like The Bellagio or Treasure Island, but I consider this to be something positive because they have bright lights and music playing until really late down that end, so it was nice to be able to leave it all behind and go back to my quiet hotel room.

They were excellent about the short notice. Upon arriving, we had no issues with checking in and were taken to our room almost immediately. The only issue we had was that we could not get adjoining rooms and therefore had to get two separate rooms to accomodate 2 adults and 4 kids. The rooms aren't large, and are very old looking. If you're looking for glitz and glamour, this is not it! The tv did not work (not a good thing with 4 kids) but when we called down they were quick to send maintenance up to remove the broken tv and replace it with a new one. We were told at that time that there were still rooms not renovated and these happened to be a couple of them. Fair enough considering such short notice that we didn't get the best rooms. All of the staff was super nice and quick to try to accomodate with any requests. The circus itself was okay for the kids and there were several games for kids similar to those you'd find at Chuck E. Cheese (pay to play - win tickets- cash tickets in for small prizes). The pool closed very early and we couldn't use it at all, which disappointed the kids. Not really walking distance to anything, especially with kids in tow. So we ended up driving the strip instead of walking it so that the kids could see all the lights and hotels and what not. Casino was okay.. i'm not much of a gambler so i can't comment too much on that. It's definitely nothing fancy though, so if you're expecting something like what you see on tv.. this is not the place for you!

We also got the all day buffett, you are better off getting the Rio/Planet Hollywood 24 hour Buffett pass those were WAY better than circus circus. The best thing about the circus circus was the 1/2 price show tickets booth.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. In the casino they offer lessons for people who haven't gambled before which we really enjoyed and found very useful. In the reception area there is a discounted ticket booth which we found very reasonably priced - we got last minute tickets for Penn and Teller for around $40 each and got our seats upgraded when we arrived at the show so ended up only 8 rows from the front. The only downside I would say we found is that the circus acts aren't out of this world - they very much seem to be aimed at children / familes.

They do charge a resort fee which I already knew from reading some of the other reviews. Part of that entailed free Wi-Fi which could be testy at times was nice...some of the resorts charged an additonal fee for this service. I had read that the West tower had the best room and that part is accurate. Very comfortable king bed and decent showers. Our room had a flat screen tv and also had a hair dryer and iron and ironing board. Maid service came daily and always had our room cleaned before 3. It is a little down on the strip but not too much of a walk. We enjoyed the exercise. The casinos were a little dated but still nice too play. They have a really nice artist who does beautiful sketches. Rock and Ritas had excellent burgers and very decent prices. Overall I would love to stay here again.

It takes you all the way to the other side of the strip and even to fremont street. Back to circus circus... The pool was like a pool you see at a KOA RV park. Small...and a bit ghetto. The second pool was closed, and appeared to be under construction. It is by far the smokiest casino on the strip. The salon is a joke..I walked by and it was an old hotel room converted into a dank little salon that appeared to be as old as the hotel.

We got a 3 day bus pass for $20 - which is unlimited travel on the Deuce for those days - this meant we could get to either end of the strip really easily from the Hotel and there's bus stops either side of the street right outside - better than paying for expensive taxis, which we found tried to rip us off by going down the freeway instead of the Strip to and from the airport! Overall, if we visited again, we would stay somewhere else, but only because there's not much around the hotel restaurant wise - other than McDonalds, Dennys and the Peppermill and would have preferred a bit more choice - which there's an abundance of down the the other end near the Miracle Mile mall etc.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "scomal", "ReviewID": "UR98739646", "Content": "we found our stay here overall a bit disappointing. the rooms were nice and clean and big enough.

However there are bus stops right outside that will take you to freemont street ;) and back towards the strip, Heres some tips, When taking the bus from freemont street be sure to get on the duece and not the express, the express does not stop at circus circus. Be sure to purchase your bus tickets at the stand at the bus stop because the drivers prefer you to do it that way,it makes boarding quicker.If you are a drinker pay attention to the drink specials the resorts and casinos offer.

Didn\u2019t have any problems checking in but they do have an 800 number for express check-in if you prepay your stay. I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because of nostalgia. It is not as bad as some of the reviews on here say. Yes, it\u2019s an older building and they could do more to maintain some of the exterior (e.g. graffiti in the parking lots and dirty windows). But if you have kids and/or on a budget, you can\u2019t really go wrong with Circus Circus. Come in with the right mind set and don\u2019t expect Bellagio opulence. You\u2019ll have more fun if you do. Other things to keep in mind: -Most Vegas hotels now charge a resort fee in addition to your nightly rate. Circus Circus at least has one of the cheaper ones at about $8 per night which includes two free Adventuredome rides, two free drinks, and free wireless internet. -Stay in the West Tower rooms. I have not seen the other rooms but these rooms are considered an upgrade. I was satisfied with the contemporary feel of the room \u2013 granite countertops on everything, modern d\u00e9cor, and still relatively plush carpet. Plus the elevators to the West Tower were near the check-in lobby and valet. Short walks to most of the eateries. -There are families and kids of all ages throughout. This could be a positive or negative depending on what you want from your Vegas vacation. So expect some noise, strollers, and kids running around the common areas. -Midway and Adventuredome have some good diversions for kids & kids at heart \u2013 free circus acts; midway games (most are only $1); thrill rides; and 3-D movies. You can leave your older kids here while you hit the casino. Most of my first memories of Las Vegas involved Circus Circus. It still provides a fun place to take your kids while in town and value for your dollar.

The big news is that I caught scabies from this place! I noticed three little bubble/pimple looking bumps/bites on my arm the morning after our first night in the room. I didn't think too much about it though. Then the next morning I noticed more bumps/bites and then everyday afterwards. I suspected bedbugs and did some research on line and used that information to search the beds. I didn't find anything and thought well maybe it is a spider or mosquito in the room. One week after our trip I began to itch like I have never itched in my life. I saw a doctor and was diagnosed with scabies. These little suckers live under the top layer of your skin and it takes 2 to 6 weeks before a person notices the severe burning and itching caused from their burrowing into your skin and laying of eggs. As soon as I knew that I had scabies I retraced my whereabouts by two weeks and I was at Circus Circus with these weird bumps popping up on my arms and hands every morning. I immediately called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager. The first manager that I spoke with was in charge of booking rooms. I explained what had happened and was told that I would need to talk to Risk Management but that no one was there so I would need to call back the next day. This surprised me since that meant whoever was staying in those three rooms that me and my family occupied stood a chance of picking up scabies that night. So anyway, I called Risk Management the next day, informed them of my situation and they told me that I would need to contact security to fill out a security incident form. I told the lady that I wasn't after a free room or any payback for my horrible experience and was simply calling so that something could be done to eliminate the problem to happen to someone else. Once she realized that I didn't want anything in return she said \"Thanks, we will look into it\". If I had to guess about it, the issue never made it past her hanging up the phone. Looking around the hotel it is pretty evident that it is pretty old and dirty. The place smells like an ashtray. It was my mistake for even staying there but I was attracted to the fun things that they have for kids and the cheaper price.

The Adventuredome had some Halloween thing on and all night until 12pm you could here this chainsaw noise coming from the Adventuredome. However I got around this by leaving the room until that time - good excuse to gamble! Just beware if you plan on staying there around that time of the year. Rock N Rita's was a great place to eat - they had a good $5 menu after 11pm. And the room came with a bunch of vouchers for cheap drinks and stuff. I had read reviews of security being an issue and I can vouch for this. I had bought a new handbag in Vegas and switched over bags. I'd left my old bag out on the table with the side zipper closed. When I got back to my room that evening the side zipper was open. Mmmm. I was lucky I'm not the sort of person that leaves valuables unlocked.

Oh how we are so pleased we stayed there. Despite the reviews the hotel staff were lovely!, we even got a free room upgrade when we asked, they were cheerful and helpful too! The hotel is very clean and of a good basic standard. The room was clean and comfortable with use of a free T.V, iron and board, safe and hair dryer (yes, all free!) The hotel had lots of different eating areas, such as Mcdonalds, Steakhouses, pizza's etc, but the all you can eat buffet was of exeptional value (they do this for breakfast, lunch and dinner) it was also very clean, they follow good hygiene procedures. My husband and I went without children and enjoyed what the hotel had to offer, but if we had children this would have been the place for them to stay, all the children we seen in the hotel were having a wonderful time. The only little thing I found to be a pain is that the free circus acts were shown one at a time with a 30 minutes interval between each act? however they were entertaining, plus there's lots of fair ground games to keep everyone entertained until the next showing. The only thing that you need to be aware of in ALL the hotels, is the information points trying to give you free show tickets, basically they are some sort of time share schemes, trying to get you to sign up to giving up so many of your holiday hours to go through rubbish, time wasting time share info ( they don't tell you this when they get you to sign, it's all in the small print that they convieniently skip over) just be firm and say no thank you and that you know all about it and your not interested, It's not a big issue tho. If you are booking to see shows and to go on trips don't book with your holiday company, in the hotel there is a box office called Tix for less, they are also scattered around the Las Vegas strip and they sell all of the show tickets half price, these Box offices are safe to use, we booked all of our shows with them and saved lots of money in doing so. We will be returning to Circus Circus again, it's great value for money and has left us with fond holiday memories.

But, we only stayed here one of the three nights in our package--intentionally--because we had a timeshare week exchange at the Grandview Resort for the rest of the week. We flew in on a Saturday night red eye from the East Coast, and checked into Circus Circus at midnight. We had only a few minutes wait in the check-in line. The lobby and front entrance of the hotel are very drab and dimly lit. The carpeting looks like it has been worn out over two decades in the lobby. There were also a ton of kids and older teens hanging out at that hour, mainly due to the Halloween week \"Fright Dome\" in the Adventuredome attraction, which I gather is pretty popular in Vegas. We didn't take this tour, but it looked like fun if you're into that spooky/scary stuff. Anyway, our room was in the West Tower, and it was perfectly fine. It was clean and spacious but certainly not the fanciest. It had a nice flatscreen TV. The view was great of the strip, facing the old downtown area. The best thing about this room was the bed! It was a nice king-size bed with the best mattress and pillows and sheets. Of course, we were tired after our flight, but I definitely slept like a baby, and this bed was far better than the one at the Grandview. We ate in the buffet the next day as two all-day passes were included in our package. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality and selection. We had brunch and dinner there. The food was fresh and at the correct temperature. The dessert selection was great. We also ate at THE Steakhouse on a subsequent night with a coupon. This is absolutely the BEST steak we have ever had! Melt in your mouth filet mignon. The service was superb. We also tore an ad out of the Vegas magazine from the room and had a pretty good bottle of wine with our meal at no extra cost. The mashed potatoes were fabulous, so was the salad and vegetable (asparagus with bernaise sauce), and the Bananas Foster for dessert was out of this world. The classic elegant atmosphere in this restaurant belies the rest of the hotel, which overall I would describe as sort of tawdry and seedy, but entertaining nonetheless. We aren't big gamblers but tried the video poker machines to no avail. In fact, this was the worst place for our meager gambling the whole week, and we actually had the best wins at Bellagio, the complete opposite in terms of quality hotel from Circus Circus. But we did enjoy our stay here, and we had free drink coupons from the Fun Book at Rock n Rita's bar, where the bartender was entertaining and talented. There were big crowds here during the weekend, but it really thinned out by Monday when we returned to use some more coupons. All in all, I would say that this place is not nearly as bad as the reviews make it sound, if your expectations aren't set too high, but it also is definitely outdated and kind of drab overall. The West Tower rooms are fine, though. We didn't use the pools, nor did we see the Manor Rooms, and I don't think I would want to use or stay in either from what I saw from the outside. The place is geared towards those with children, and it appears to be a real bargain.

Yes, the furniture is somewhat worn and tired. The rooms, however, as spacious and the hotel is on (the end) of the Strip so you can walk or take a cab or shuttle to other places in the city.. There are plenty of on site eating and shopping venues, not to mention the Adventuredome.

Our rooms was spacious and clean and didnt smell of smoke (what alot of people complain about on here). The rooms were conjoining rooms and were just what we needed. There are plenty of resturants and places to go in this hotel inc mcdonalds perfect for the kids. The circus acts are good and definatly go and see the bartenders at rock and ritas (Fab Fab Fab!!) Overall i would recommend this hotel to everyone wanting to go to vegas. With or without children!! Location of the hotel is good as its a 20 min walk to the main strip and by the stratosphere and the riviera. The only thing i will mention is that as we were taking an infant youd think they would put a cot in our room but they didnt and it wasnt untill we requested one we were told we had to pay $120 for the week!!

There were a lot of people here milling around, half of which looked drugged up. It seems to be the hot spot for 20-30 year olds looking to stay cheap and have a good time despite the circus theme. There were tons of security guards in the morning which had me kind of worried. It's very easy to find, and easy to park. Pros: The hotel is huge. The parking is free for guests..and everyone else - so you can end up parking pretty far. There are PLENTY of choices to eat and shop. The adventure dome was campy and expensive and we did not venture in to check it out further but other people seemed to be enjoying it. We were given a coupon book which included free drinks, free games, and all sorts of other goodies to enjoy, we should of taken advantage of it but we were leaving upon check out and checked in nearly 3am after 14 hours of driving. The beds were very comfortable, the room was pretty clean. It's vegas so we expected burned everything, and stains around as all hotels have them. Check in & out was a breeze. The bathroom was huge, and water was hot - thankful for that! Cons: It took us nearly 25 minutes to get down from the 10th floor using the elevator. We had over 100 lbs of luggage with us that was nearly impossible to bring down the stairs. We had to actually take the elevator up to go down. If they stopped on our floor they were packed with people, and it ended up being very frustrating. Make sure you give yourself PLENTY of time to get down to check out, visit the casino, etc if you are planning on using the elevators. Tips: Make sure to book a tower room.

The soap given in the bathroom left mine and my fiance's skin sooo dry and scummy feeling. The \"conditioning\" shampoo also felt like soap in my hair! One other complaint I have is that the housekeeper that morning seemed so eager to get us out of the room so he could clean. We were woken up at 9:00am by the housekeeper, who then came back four additional times within 20 minutes, knocking on our door and attempting to open it. We yelled at him every time to come back later but the man simply could not wait! Check out time was at 11 but we felt so rushed by this guy that we wound up leaving the room before 10.

If you have been to L.V. before and want to do all the things you didn't do first time, this is a perfectly adequate base. If you are going for the first time and want all the glitz, stay somewhere else or you might be disappointed. Rooms are genuinely fine, but always look for upgrades (usually free - if you smile nicely). It is at the end of the strip, which is about 4 miles long. The tram thing was $1.60 when we went, but seems to have shot up in price, as with the buffet breakfast/lunch/dinners - $7.99, 12.99 & 15.99 then. (with an exchange rate of near $2 to \u00a31). But I understand from friends and reviews on here, that has long gone. L.V. is now very expensive. But is still the most fun you can have with yer pants on. MUST go to the Canyon. It is just indescribeable. You'll see. MUST also go to P.F. Changs for a chinkey, and the Cheescake Factory for the meal of your life. Must go the Freemont Street for the night time light show. It's bonkers. Just an observation, but is seems most of the less kind reviews come from Americans themselves. It seems that their demands and expectations are far higher than those of the British tourists and will argue the toss over a speck of dust. \"No Wi-fi connection\"!!! Really, you are on holiday in Las Vegas. Just take your brain out, leave it in the drawer beside you bed and enjoy the mind-blowing experience. That's all Las Vegas is there for.

Imagine it would be ideal for families with kids as in the hotel is a circus show and theme park as well as good value buffets and also a good basic pool area. Location-wise though it is quite far away from action which seems to be further south of on the strip around paris & bellagio.

I want to give the most honest review that i possibly can becuase i dont think its fair when people give a misleading review on hotels, and i have stayed at many as i travel a lot! The circus circus is a very dated hotel in las vegas, it is on the old side of the strip and is a good 15-20 minute walk up the strip to get to the where some of the action is happening, and where all the new modern hotels are. But there is a bus outside the hotel that runs quite often but you seem to find youself fighting to get on the busy as its always packed! The hotel is big, it has many little shops, bagel bars, Pizza restaurant, an italian restuarant, which i cannot comment on because it was closed when we were at the hotel. Upstairs in the hotel there was a mcdonals which i found very handy, didnt even have to leave the hotel for a quick lunch! There is a donut stand which sells lovely donuts too, its a bit hard to believe that there was so many food shops & shops all going on inside a hotel! Our rooms were very big! we each got a king size bed and the bathroom was nice and big too, the rooms were clean, but the only thing is that its just 'dated'. If i was to tour around america again or if you dont care where you stay you just want somewhere cheap then stay at the circus circus, but if this is a special occasion like your wedding i would highly reccomend just spending a bit more cash and stayin in a newer hotel, further up the strip! There is circus acts going on all day in the hotel was are quite funny, but only for so long! There is also a theme park which the rides you do have to pay for, but most of them were closed when we were there. There are 2 pools, and a small bubbly heated pool, only thing is when you are laid there sunbathing it doesnt feel very private because the pool is surrounded by the hotel carpark!

Not really a problem for us as we didn't spend much time in the hotel itself. On arrival the check in was quite quick but as expected the room was a bit dire, the shower head pointed to the wall and had to be propped up with the flannel, the room was definitely in need of updating. Despite it being a non smoking room it smelt very strongly of stale smoke. Everything in the room was just shabby due to careless people and high foot fall no doubt. The room was also very dark as no ceiling lights. Just in need of a major update and lick of paint. We decided to upgrade to the west tower as it was relatively cheap to do so and they are the nicer rooms that are shown on the hotel website. This room was much better, air con nice and quiet, strip view and although still chunks missing and cracks in various pieces of furniture much better. The beds were also much more comfortable although cigarette holes in the bedding each time it was changed and iron burns on the blankets, again just careless people previously but in a better hotel wouldn't have been re-used. Room still smelt of smoke but this did wear off towards the end of our stay. Did try the buffet for breakfast and there was a big choice and everything was OK. Is at one end of the strip but an easy walk to shopping mall and the Wynn, Encore and much needed air con to the rest of the strip! Will definitely be returning to Vegas but not to this hotel.

The beds are comfortable and sleep really well. It was very peaceful and quiet on our floor every night. The cleaning staff came everyday and were very thorough. They were so thorough they took 2 items of clothing w/ them when they changed the sheets on our first morning there. Don't get me wrong, I'm really glad they change the sheets daily, but with them they took a cherished navy blue t-shirt - a stark contrast to the white sheets! Anyway, none of the ladies speak english (ok, maybe one or two) but it was near impossible to speak w/ them about my lost item. I ended up going to the front desk (which always has a long line - will say more about that later), but a concierge helped me find a manager who was kind and assured me that I would be reimbursed for my shirt. They did just that on the day before we left. But here's a word of warning - DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE BEDS WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM. YOU WILL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN! Turns out they send all of their linen to be laundered off-site which also does laundry for other hotels in the area, so retrieving anything is like finding a needle in a haystack. They have a lost and found, which I bisited, but to no avail. This is a huge property and as LV is buzzing w/ tourists all year round, and the city never sleeps, there is a constant parade of people through this lobby and main floor at all hours of the day and night. Expect long lines at c/in and c/out times. When we c/in it was late at night on a Tuesday. The lines creep slowly and the lobby is full of uncomfortable and worn out parents w/ kids who run amok b/c they are either tired or restless and hungry from travelling. This is fine for families w/ young children who have alot of patience. If you have teens, they may enjoy the in-house amusement park - Adventuredome. My kids weren't fazed by it. We live near Six Flags over GA, so that's what they are used to. Around peak c/in time it's a good idea to stay away from the lobby and elevators. The elevator corridor was so jam packed one day, I couldn't get close enough to see the doors. I also noticed their breakfast buffet usually has long lines also, so if you plan to go there for breakfast - get up early! They've got a nice fitness center, but you must get a card key from the front desk each day you want to use it. The key you use the first day will not be good on the following day. They deactivate them. We enjoyed the pool (although the trek to get to it is quite a journey), the casino was okay (didn't win anything), and we didn't try the restaurants. The location is great. You can pretty much walk down the strip to where ever you want to go. We went off-site for our meals. We especially enjoyed the dinner buffet at the Hilton and breakfast at Coco's in the Palace Station. Don't miss the Fremont Street Experience. There's alot of shops and casinos there and the video show is charming. Wear comfortable shoes, it encompasses several city blocks. Avoid the long lines in the lobby at all costs - it's not pleasant. Some kind soul told us that we could c/out over the phone from our room. We took advantage of that and it's a good thing b/c our last day was no different than any other. Weekdays and weekend days, there is always a long wait. The staff is courteous, but the wait is tortuous. Another good feature is the show ticket counter. They sell tickets to the Vegas shows at discounted prices. The free internet was also a great amenity. We stayed at this hotel b/c we got a great deal. So i would recommend it for that and for people w/ small children w/ the temperment to deal w/ crowds. Otherwise, I would recommend some place else for couples looking for a nice romantic getaway..I'm pretty sure even the people who work there would say this is not the ideal place for that.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cCircus Circus - Avoid at all costs.

The carpet \"base board\" was peeling away from the walls. There were hairs on the sheets, gum wrappers on the floor and stains on some of the \"clean\" towels. The carpets throughout the hotel and in the rooms are filthy. A built up filth that you know will never come out. It's one of those hotels where you feel like undergoing a de-lousing once you're free and clear from the place. The rooms in the west tower are all connected to at least one adjoining room by a poorly sealed, thin door so you share your neighbour's smells and noise.

The staff were absolutely useless and their answer to everything was, \"I'm sorry, there is nothing we can do.\" The location is poor being at one end of the strip about a mile and a half away from the majority of other hotel casinos like the Flamingo and the Bellagio.

This most recent trip in July, however, has changed my mind about the hotel and I will NEVER enter the building again. When I arrived on July 29, I was initially impressed - the check-in process was quick and streamlined - an improvement from prior visits. When I got to my room, the visit quickly went downhill. On the surface, the room looked clean until I started noticing all of the dried red spots on the floor - yep, it was a blood trail that led to the door and back to the window. I finally confirmed it was blood when I saw all of the dried blood on the window glass itself and streaking down the doorway. I can ALMOST forgive blood on the carpet - that could be tricky to clean between guests, but on the door and window?!? So at this point, I'm grossed out but not entirely angry with the hotel. Accidents happen and I needed to get down to my conference anyways. When I got back to my room a few hours later, I pulled off the top comforter of the bed and found the pool of dried blood on the top sheet and velux blanket. This is when I decided something needed to be done. I called the front desk and was put on hold for about 10 minutes. Finally someone answered and sounded annoyed that I was bothered by the blood - she really acted like this wasn't out of the ordinary. When I asked if anything could be done about it, she responded \"Like what?\" - I said to start with, I could get a new room. She responded that there were no rooms available at that time of night but she could TRY to get me in another room tomorrow. Out of frustration, I asked if I could at least get some new sheets and blanket and she said she'd page housekeeping. Two hours later, housekeeping hadn't arrived, I was exhausted, and threw the blankets/sheets in the hallway and just went to bed. The next morning, I went down to speak with a manager who was far from helpful or friendly. They said they could look for a new room for me but couldn't make any guarantees. I went over to the conference and came back to the hotel early afternoon to check. Much to my disbelief, my room hadn't even been cleaned! By the end of day 2, they hadn't replaced the sheets or blanket - housekeeping didn't even come to my room. Beyond frustrated, I decided to accept defeat and sleep on my sheetless, blanketless bed.

The hotel also had problems with the alarm system going off throughout the middle of the night. If you are bringing your children to Vegas, this is the hotel for you. There are circus shows every hour or so on the Midway. There is a great carnival/fair style Midway where your children can spend all of your money trying to win cheap prizes. I actually enjoyed the Midway more than anything else at the hotel. The biggest plus to Circus Circus is that it is located next to Slots of Fun.

Having my 12, 14, and 15 year boys with me meant that I would need to keep them entertained without cramping their style. Circus Circus seemed like the place for us since I felt comfortable letting them go the Adventuredome on their own as long as I was in the same hotel and could easily check up on them. In early June I went online and booked a 2 night stay in the west tower. The website listed the west tower rooms as having been recently renovated, and the website pictures depicted a decent looking room. So at 12:30 pm on Wednesday July 21 we showed up at Circus Circus with a carload of stuff (we're staying in Vegas at 3 different hotels over a 12 day span) only to find that Valet parking was full and we would have to carry our things into the hotel without any assistance. Once we found a parking spot in garage 2 (a good 5 minute walk to the check -in desk) I grabbed as much as I could from our car and stood in the check-in line while my boys made another 2 trips to the car to bring all of our things into the hotel. The check-in line was quite long and only 4 check-in clerks (but about 15 EMPTY check-in stations!) were on hand to check people in. After waiting about 30 minutes in the check in line, we were given our key to our west tower room on the 16th floor. Upon entering our room I noticed that the curtains were closed and thus it was quite dark. At the time I thought that it was weird, but I now believe that it was done intentionally so that the stains on the carpet and chair wouldn't be noticed. And believe me-there were ALOT of stains. The worst was the bathroom. It looked liked somebody was dying their hair and splattered dark brown dye all over the walls. Even the word \"disgusting\" is an understatement. We decided to suck it up and just try to stay in the room as little as possible. I realize that Circus Circus is a family-oriented hotel, however I was amazed at all of the families that had babies with them. I felt bad for all of those parents that were trying to navigate through the smokey, packed hotel and casino with a baby stroller. However, is Las Vegas really a place that you want to bring an infant to? Getting around Circus Circus is hard enough without having a stroller! The place is seriously packed from about 10 am to 10 pm. In summation I would have to say that this was the last time I will ever stay at Circus Circus again. The fact that they charge more for the \"newly renovated\" west tower rooms is a joke and only makes me wonder about how bad the other rooms are,", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value and we had a lot of fun\u201d", "Author": "Wildman_Aussie", "ReviewID": "UR72340440", "Content": "I get really tired of all the blah blah blah bad comments from people that have payed $22 per night for a hotel in Las vegas and expect 5 star service and 5 star rooms.

With prices so low (even during peak season) it was running at 100% and there are a lot of rooms so every room was being turned over every day = lots of people checking in The layout of the hotel sucks too. But you will quickly find your way around. Getting lost is part of the fun as you will find stuff that you otherwise wouldnt have found anyway. We had 3 rooms in 2 towers during our visits and none of them really had a view to die for. We considered the expensive rooms which we virtually double the price of our cheaper rooms but couldnt really justify it (one of our party had one and it was nicer but we put the money towards meals and fun stuff instead) The hourly circus shows are great. They only run for 5 min or so but they have some top notch performers!!! The kids love this place. So much to do and see. The pool was OK too. Again low expectations and you will be happy. The adventure dome was great fun. Lots of fun to be had. Make sure you use the vouchers from the discount book you get on checkin! Great range of restaurants to choose from. Keep an eye out for the sprukers and you will pick up some discount vouchers which make them even better value. Again if you dont expect 5 start service and you will be fine.

I am very disappointed!~\u201d After hearing what I just said, he didn\u2019t apologize, but upgrade our rooms in the nearest West Tower. However, the first 2 rooms he gave me were un-cleaned! What a shame! I had to run to the front desk again. The fun thing is he was very surprised that he told me, \u201cThe computer shows the rooms were cleaned!\u201d Hello! There must be some problems going on between room service and front desk customer service!! Such a terrible management!! This time he gave me another 2 upgarded rooms and even sent some lady to go with me to check the rooms!! Don\u2019t believer me? Search yourself, man!

Parking can be pretty atrocious! My bed had a blanket with cigarette burns even though it was a non-smoking room. The mattresses were below average in quality.

We were already planning a trip to Las Vegas in June to attend a bridge club tournament at the Riviera and when we received in the mail a complimentary three-night stay room offer and generous comp free play at Circus Circus. It had been some time since we've been to Circus Circus, and we had never stayed at your property before. It's to be noted that friends of ours received comp rooms at the Sahara (for two nights) as did we, however, having stayed at the Sahara before, my husband and I opted for Circus Circus instead. It was more than apparent we made the right choice. When we called to book our room, the customer service rep. was polite and considerate. We requested a smoke- free quiet room... away from busy corridors, elevators and ice machines. They set us up at the farthest end of a hallway on the 22nd floor which was perfect. The wait at Circus Circus' registration was 20 minutes, but the counter person said we were VIP guests and could have stood in the shorter line had we wanted to. The sign posting for \"check out\" and \"VIP\" check in appeared to be the same line, so we were reluctant to stand in it and then have to return to the 20 minute line as well (lessons learned for next time). We were pleased to see that our accommodations were modern, beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. The only issue we had was the room was still being cleaned when we checked in (between 5pm - 6pm). We would like to acknowledge the customer service support we received from Mimi Arrigoni at the Players' Club. It was excellent! She took the time to explain to us the new comp system (and its benefits) and even came out from behind the counter to illustrate how to download our points to a machine. She patiently answered all our questions and encouraged us to return to talk with her if we encountered any difficulties. This level of customer service far exceeded expectations and encourages us to return again to Circus Circus. We were delighted to see generous food comp points on our card as well. We enjoyed eating at least five times over our stay at your various on-site restaurants, all of which were above average in quality, selection, and service. Our bridge partners, on the other hand, were not happy with their dated accommodations at the Sahara [e.g., & dreary room, bad view, low water pressure, small 19\" wide-back TV that couldn't be seen from across the room, lights that didn't work, etc.]. We waited with them while they checked in at the Sahara. Their line was 35 minutes long, and when the keycard didn't work in the room door, they were instructed by the bell boy to stand back in the line to resolve the problem. I addition, their generic comp offers had so many limitations on them, the one coupon they attempted to use took three visits to the players club and still they did not get the comp promised. Our only concern with the Circus Circus property was the access from the parking garage / gaming level to the \"mall level\" (near the amusement park). It was not handicap accessible. We noticed many elderly guests struggling to maneuver the steps from the lower gaming area to the store/vendor/eatery area. This area did have additional steps to one side (along a wall) that could and should be modified to add a wheelchair ramp. Again, thank you for sending us the complimentary stay offer. We welcome any further offers and will surely want to visit Circus Circus again in the future.

We had previously been in San Francisco and LA. Circus Circus is quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in (and i've been on a few cheap 18-30 holidays!). The stench as soon as you walk in is overwhelming and continues throughout the whole hotel. Originally we were placed in a 'manor' room. I cannot describe how horrible this room was; stained shower curtains, brown stained towels...i could go on. We complained about this and got moved to another room in the Skyrise Tower at an expense of $50. Basically we were moved to the same room but 20 floors up minus a fridge and working a/c. We persevered with this room, with the faulty a/c, with the smell, rubbish view, lack of fridge and terrible tv. The rest of the hotel appears to be provided to rip off its customers. The restaurants contained within in are way over-priced for the food they are providing as are the tatty shops and bars. We wouldn't have minded paying the price if you were getting a good service. From start to finish this hotel was a nightmare I would not recommend it to anyone not even my worst enemy. During our trip we visited downtown las vegas and the stratosphere etc (which are further up the strip) and even these hotels appeared far superior to Circus Circus and didnt smell like they hadn't been cleaned in 100 years! If you are unfortunate enough to have to stay here be prepared to pay for the safe in your room and a 15 minute walk negotiating prams and thousands of screaming children before you reach the entrance. Also the hotel, which has two enormous towers of rooms, provides two pools. Not two large pools, two medium sized pools surrounded by a road with no privacy what-so-ever.

I booked the room with the safe to store my computer.

I was told that a privacy sign on the door would keep housekeeping from calling me about cleaning, but was later told otherwise when I contacted the front desk housekeeping and told them no calls. There was a line at the Cashier cage without an exit (June 11th) and people had to squeeze by and make contact with others. I had my big bag and did not want to bump or be bumped so I took the little rail down as two or three people thought it was a good idea until the lady started giving a gentleman behind me a difficult inquisition. The gentleman said that it made the most sense to have an entrance and exit but the lady acted like it was the end of the world in a civil way. I thought the single Cashier cage lady was not a reflection of the other polite and hospitable workers that I had previously met at the cage. Circus Circus is like a large compound with some 3744 rooms or so. I am not in the Towers but the manor which has had a lot of people go through it. People in the next room were jovial and quietly carrying on until around ten and then the floor was asleep. Security patrolled the grounds with good numbers. All the staff appeared to be very hospitable and polite. The towers might be a option if I stay here again. I was riding on the bus and some people staying at Circus Circus stated that someone identified themselves as the manager and needed their credit card information as their card did not process.

We weren't expecting pure luxury but this hotel really is like a naff holiday camp with 3000+ bedrooms dumped on the top. Check in was ok, the service received was at the level you expect from a check out in your local supermarket but it was reasonably fast and we were ushered off to our room fairly quickly. Having read other reviews we knew that our \"Manor room\" was not likely to impress but it's fair to say it was one of the most depressing hotel rooms we've stayed in. Positives - the room was big and acceptably clean but the negatives were that all the furniture was in a really bad state of repair, both the fridge and air had to be turned off at night because of the noise and the view from our window was a bush. The corridors and lobby area smelt of years and years of cigarette smoke and this gave such a bad first impression. The poor cleaning staff were vacuuming on a daily basis but I think the only thing worth doing with the carpet was burning it. We braved a few of the restaurants in the hotel but only at times when we were too tired to go out or it was too hot to venture outdoors.

The buffet however was simply awful, I knew we weren\u2019t off to a great start when we had to follow a lady carrying flag to be seated but the entire restaurant area smelt of wet dog and the food tasteless and overcooked. Couldn't get out of there quickly enough.

So lets get things straight Circus Circus does not sell itself as being a high end luxury hotel nor does it set out to compete with these high end hotels situated down the strip but that does not mean you lose out on everything. I stayed in a West Tower Deluxe King size room and it was fine. The room was clean and large and the staff were friendly and very helpful. The room was cleaned every day. Just make a note that you do not book a manor room which is basically a motel type lodge building away from the main hotel, and then there is the West Tower rooms (where I stayed), which are at the back of Circus Circus so a 5 min walk from the lobby to the main street, or there is the main tower rooms which are in the middle of the resort complex approx 2 mins from the main street. Some people have reported extended wait times to check in. I think this is all to do with timing and whether you get there just before a large crowd arrives to check in ahead of you or you arrive at the hotel during a quiet time. I got there with only 3 people in front of me and was checked in within 10 mins. I pre-paid for my stay so could also use the express check out service, so there was no time wasted in leaving. The Hotel is brash and yes a bit chessie but that's how it portrays itself, any hotel with a clown neon sign, and in door theme park and a puts on live circus acts has to be bright, noisey and full of large groups of families staying there. To be honest I only used my room to sleep in and used the local coffee shop to buy soft drinks and a few snacks as most of the time I was out and about. The hotel decor does look a bit lived in but not shabby. The bottom line is if you are looking to visit Vegas but are on a limited budget, then Circus Circus might fit the bill. It sits at the top end of the Northern strip, with the Encore & Wynn Hotels about 500 mtrs down the strip, Treasure Islands (TI) a bit further and then the main resort Hotels in the heart of the strip are about a 10 min cab ride away or if it's not roasting at 40c then a good 20 mins walk. I cannot comment on the food at the Hotel as I tended to eat out, but dont expect top 5 star selection, but there is a deli, a fast food counter, a steak house, pizza place and the main buffet restaurant. I cannot recall a separate bar but there places dotted around selling beers and drinks, plus a couple of news agent type shops. As an aside I brought half price tickets to see a show for a Saturday night performance from the Hotel 1/2 price ticket counter and the seats were fine and I saved about $40 a ticket over normal box office prices. So would I stay there again, then on a limited budget the answer is yes, as Circus Circus represents very good value for money, but if money was not an issue then I would go for a more luxury style hotel nearer the centre of the strip. To put things in perspective, in Circus Circus I paid about $8 for a cocktail in a plastic cup, in the Wynn it cost me $20 in a nice glass goblet, so you get what you pay for.

You get what you pay for here. We found a cheap last minute deal and booked it a week before going, stayed 4 days, 5 nights, for \u00a3500 including flights. Check in was very quick, we were given alternative room options as we had no choice when we booked, ended up in a tower room, which was huge with a partial view of the strip, decor in the room and bathroom may have looked a bit tired and dated but we only used the room to sleep and shower and change. I f you want pretty wallpaper etc pay alot more and book into one of the newer hotels. Very family friendly, numerous places to eat, all looked alot cheaper than other buffets on the strip, we only had Room service Pizza, v.good. A McDonalds next door too. The Adventuredome was mainly for families with children, at a push teenagers, (not people 25-28 like us!) so if your expecting Alton Towers, dont bother going but go on the 3 rides at the Stratosphere, v.scary and spectacular views. A Deuce Bus stop outside slots a fun next door, $3 one way trip, $7 for 24hours, $15 for 3 days, get a ticket from the machines at the bus stop, easier than carrying cash. Stops outside most hotels, avoid the ace bus, that has limited stops and is only single decker, was always full. Avoid the bus between 11-2, always full and security at each bus stop to stop pushing and over crowding, get a cab and tell them not to go down the strip but the back roads as its quicker, about $10 to the mandaley bay at the other end. Book trips either before you go or ring the companies direct, dont use the tour desks they add on between $65-150 on the price acting as a middle man, we booked a helicopter ride over lake mead, hoover dam and the grand canyon for $220 per person, with Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters, or there other name, Grand Canyon Fun Trips very professional, excellant servcice, picked up from our hotel in comfortable mini bus taken to theire own air strip, weighed upon check in and assigned helicopter with two other couples, this trip was spectacular, pilot was very informative, Grand Canyon was amazing, best way to see it in my opinion. Pick up the voucher booklets and guides from inside the taxis or in the hotel foyers and look though you save loads with the couypons and offers in these. If you want to see a show, see either O at The Bellagio or Love The Beatles at The Mirage,ht eonly words for them both are Spectacular, amazing, wonderful! we payed the higher prices because we wanted good seats and they were amazing seats, for both though I wouldnt have wanted to have sat in the first 8 rows as your too near the stage and dont get the full effect, we sat on row k for The Beatles and J for 'O', excellant seats with the best views! Breathtaking! Gamble at the Bellagio, we loved it in there and you get free drinks when you are at a table or slots for a while, just tip the waitress and she will come back more often. Take I.d if you look under 25 they will ask you for either alcohol or gambling, my partner is 28 and does look his age and he got asked so take I.d so you dont get turned away. If your going in the summer months, be warned its getting hotter. on 4th June it was 120 F in the day, 103 F at 6pm, but take layers though, it may be hot outside but inside ht ehotels, casinos and shops the air con is artic!

We contacted House Keeping by \u2018phone at 8.55pm and again at 9.20pm. Although assured towels would be sent, these requests brought no response and I had to go down to talk with Reception staff. They had no success in discovering why the towels had not been delivered because House keeping were now apparently closed. I was assured that the matter had been logged which the front desk seemed to think was a satisfactory response. I did not want the matter logged. I wanted towels! They could offer no time scale as to when the towels would be delivered and seemed mildly irritated that I demanded to know. Only after I asked for a different room if they couldn\u2019t complete the servicing of the present one, which would have caused them additional administration work, did they make some calls and promised that towels were on the way immediately. Immediately turned out to be 15 minutes later. Finally, at nearly 10.30 towels arrived \u2013 only an incomplete set but sufficient for us to have a long overdue shower. We gave up on the dirty carpet! No-one seemed at all interested in solving the problems and no staff member ever thought to offer an apology. We gave up on our plan to visit the casino after all the delays. How can that be good business for Circus Circus? When we checked out the following morning I found an additional resort charge that was not listed at the time of booking. It was explained as covering various free offers and facilities like wi-fi and telephone and only started in March (I booked last September). I was then given, too late to be of any use, an explanation voucher booklet that I should have been given when I checked in! There was no way to make a complaint at the time and, though we were directed to their website, there is no email contact address offered there either. They clearly don't want to hear from you. Verdict - this juggernaut hotel operation is too big to be interested in its customers. It just wants to process you and move on to the next customer. The surroundings may be plush but the rooms are tired. Don't bother - you would get better service from a cheap motel.

The still have the midway level located above the casino. The Midway is a place where the kids can play video & carnival games while you are down below on the casino floor. There are still circus & trapeze acts there also. The hotel/casino is clean & well maintained, though dated compared to most of the new strip establishments. Being one of the only places in Vegas that welcomes visitors with children, there are alot of kids everywhere. This should be obvious to anyone considering Circus Circus. If you do not want to be around kids, go somewhere else. Circus Circus is on the north end of the strip, away from the \"action\" of the mid strip area. The Deuce bus has a stop right in front of Slots of Fun (next door) for easy transportation to the rest of the strip & Downtown. The 5 acre adventure dome kept our 12 & 14 year olds occupied for an entire day - they wanted to go back for a 2nd day. While the kids were in the Adventuredome, I found a table of double-deck black jack that had reasonable rules. There is also a McDonalds next to Slots of Fun that has a dollar menu for a quick bite that does not break your budget.

The luggage check guys were also very friendly and were joking around with eachother which was entertaining. 2. The Rooms: No complaints; you get what you paid for. Had two beds, a little closet, working tv, desk, 2 chairs. They were clean and big enough for two - four people. They were a little tacky and out dated but it didn't really bother me. The first time we stayed it did take quite a trek to get to our room but we didn't mind - again, for the amount of money we paid we didn't expect much. Second time we stayed, our room was much closer to where we would leave and return to the hotel so we go lucky the second time. 3. Pool: Only ventured down here once.

Room service staff were VERY nice...said goodmorning everytime we ran into them when we were leaving for the day; always smiling. 5.

Extras: Buffet was not worth the money; A LOT of kids running around - but what do you expect from a hotel with a circus theme?; Adventure Dome is good for kids but not so much adults; same with arcade upstairs - was fun for about 5 minutes but with so many kids you start to feel old real quick; casino is not very big but it's good for some late night gambling before bed; free circus acts were actually pretty impressive - would recommend checking them out since they are free; visit Slots'o'Fun next door - it smells really bad but it has cheap drinks and cheap games and has a fun young atmosphere", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "wigan", "Title": "\u201cnot the best but ok, would pay more next time to stay somewhere better.\u201d", "Author": "smithy65", "ReviewID": "UR65019242", "Content": "We arrived at Circus Circus by taking the shuttle bus from the airport. We were dropped off at the side entrance where the hotel reception is located. Check in took about 20 mins . On arrival the hotel appeared to be a little tired and in need of a bit of freshening up. It was apparent that in it's time it had been a fabulous hotel. We were allocated a room in the sky tower on the 18th floor. Lifts were quick and slightly confusing as not all of them went to the same floors. On arrival to our room we were surprised at the size of the room. It was very large and clean. The huge king size bed was comfortable. The bath was very low and appeared to be quite small. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which took me back a bit as i thought that it would be standard practice as we are led to believe that the Americans are a nation of coffee drinkers. The hotel has what is known as the Medway and this is a floor dedicated to children where various funfair games can be found, a Mc Donald's and a variety of free circus acts throughout the day. There is a large dome downstairs that contains quite a few fun fair rides, roller coaster etc . There are various shops and stalls dotted throughout the hotel. The corridors are massive and very long and it can take even the quickest walker at least 20-30 mins to get from their room to the front entrance. There are quite a few places to eat in the hotel but i did not use them so cannot comment on the food quality. Meal times smelt a bit greasy which made me feel a bit queasy as i walked through which is why i did not try them. We did not have a strip view but was not disappointed at night when all the lights were on. We could see the Stratosphere and towards Fremont Street. There was a main casino and slots o fun which had more slots and a few gaming tables. The hotel was not as nice as the ones on the main part of the strip and the services offered was not as good as others offered elsewhere but i think this is reflected in the price. I am a firm believer of you get what you pay for. Over all this hotel makes a good base for travelling about and is more geared for families which is not apparent in the other hotels available. Personally I do not think Las Vegas is a place for children in general as there are quite a few porn leaflets and lots of advertising dotted about. (not in hotel but on the streets.) Las Vegas is as advertised and very much so an adults playground. Unique Qualities: Hotel is geared up with the family in mind. Circus acts run daily at no extra charge. Hotel has the largest indoor theme park in America. scams When we were sitting drinking coffee on the boulevard we were approached a few times by people who claimed they were stranded and needed to get home, i just need $17 to get home etc. One claimed he was not a bum he had a home but needed fuses for his very large camper van to get home. He rattled his keys and said $10 should see him right. Things to do. The fountains at the Bellagio are special. When I first watched them I found it to be quite a touching experience. I never imagined that water could be so beautiful. As this is a free activity it should not be missed by anyone. grand canyon I booked this trip before travelling from the UK online. It was a really good day out from start to finish. The coach guide was superb and gave a lot of information on the way to the Canyon. The coach was very comfortable and the whole booking experience was easy and hassle free. The Grand Canyon was awesome. The 2 1/2 mile walk around the rim was easy and disabled friendly. Everyone visiting Las Vegas should try and get to the Canyon as it is a special site to take in and one i will not forget. The coach trip was very long but well worth the effort. There are easier and quicker ways to get there but it was nice learning about all the places along the way on the coach. The IMAX film was ok. It was nothing special but added to the day. lake mead dinner cruise The Lake Mead dinner cruise was a really good excursion. Booked from the UK before travel we were thrilled with the service we received from both the tour operators and our cruise hosts. We had a night time photo stop at the Dam. The meal was tasty and well prepared. It was one of my favourite trips although i did enjoy them all. volcano at the mirage The free show at the Mirage hotel is one to watch. there are shows nightly on the hour from 8 till midnight. I was not sure what to expect but was not disappointed. the fremont street experience. The Fremont Street experience is just what it say's on the tin, an experience. We had a really nice time at Fremont Street. The light show is really good and the Queen tribute had people dancing in the street. There was a live band playing which encouraged people to take part and various stalls and shops selling all sorts of different things. A good place to view the show if you can get a seat is The Vue. It is a bar above one of the casinos at the start of Fremont Street. The beer was not bad either at $1. Another freebie not to miss. hoover dam The Hoover Dam trip is good for anyone who is interested in the creating of modern day wonders. The Hoover dam is an interesting place to visit if the history and the making interests you. If this this not your thing i do not think a tour specific to the dam will interest you. If you go to the Grand Canyon or Lake Mead you will probably find yourself having a photo stop here which will be enough for most people. Our tour coach to the Grand Canyon played a DVD on the history of the dam. laughlin We booked this tour before we went to Vegas from the UK online. It cost next to nothing $7.50 each. we were picked up from hotel before 8am and got back about 6.30pm. It was about 2 hours to Laughlin which is a town situated on the Colarado river. We were given a very good buffet lunch voucher on arrival to be used in the Colarado Belle casino. It was excellent and included free with unlimited soft drinks. To buy the lunch was more expensive than the whole inclusive trip cost us. We went on a boat along part of the river which was nice. The whole day was really nice and well worth the money. i would highly recommend this trip to anyone. we used allLasvegastours for all our trips and found them to be very efficient and good.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds UK", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as reviews say!!\u201d", "Author": "JGGLeeds", "ReviewID": "UR64895579", "Content": "Despite initial concerns after reading tripadvisor reviews of circus circus, it definitely was not as bad as I expected.

The shops were nice and there was lots to do. The only annoying thing was the staff that try to give you a \"free\" vacation for a couple of hours of your time. This got old very quickly, we got stopped 3 times by these people. The buffet was nothing special, but what do you expect for $13? There are better buffets in Vegas but you will pay a lot more for them. To me, it was worth the price but not a lot more. The Garden Grill was good, we went for the all you can eat prime rib for $12.99. The first slice was excellent, the second you could tell was an inferior quality peice of meat. Still prime rib, but probably a cheaper version. Still the first piece was big enough for most and was worth the money alone. The staff were very rushed in there but friendly. I broke a bottle of beer accidently and they replaced it for free even though it was my fault. There is a lot of variation in the casino and the games arcade is great for both kids and adults. The circus show is fun for both also. The games are reasonably priced. The adventure dome was also a great bit of fun, however be warned that it is only open Friday-Sunday. The hotel has a bus stop right outside to take you further up the strip or straight to downtown. Slots of fun is also next door which is a very small casino, but kind of nice. This hotel is at the end of the strip, but you can walk all the way up, it's only about 3-4 miles which is not too much if you want to spend the day checking out all the other hotels/casinos.

Casino is nothing great, but you can lose or win money there just as easily at any other place. The trapeze show and circus themes probably play well with younger kids.

So for as long as it lasts we can still enjoy this piece of old Las Vegas. My main reason to choose this hotel for few nights was because of the Fear and Loathing Las Vegas scenes that were recorded here and it also featured in a couple more movies. This place was one of the first casino's on the strip. This place is super kid friendly, they house the biggest indoor amusement park in the USA and kids will enjoy themselves there all day. The pool is pretty simple, and can get very crowded. Rooms are basic but clean. There's also plenty parking space, that won't be any problem in anywhere in Vegas really. Their buffet is bad tho, worst I had on the strip ever and I had quite a few. It's not expensive but for what you get it's bad.

Loved Vegas, the hotel was ok. It did smell funny, I stayed there as a kid 25 years ago and had immediate dejavu for the smell, an odd combination of airlessness and smoke. Definitely one of the less classy places on the strip, especially as we were 'upgraded' to a disabled room in the main tower which was fine but faced away from the strip (no hotel in Vegas is honestly busy enough at present to justify putting guests in dodgy rooms) and was missing anywhere to put our luggage, it spent three nights on the floor in the bathroom which was a disabled friendly bathroom and therefore huge. Housekeeping steadfastly refused to take our leftover takeaway food despite it sitting beside the bin for the entire duration of the stay, it was too large to fit into the small bin but it had empty chinese food containers sticking out of the top, a bit of a giveaway. As a place to sleep its safe and cheap, some of the guys on the airport shuttle were locals (to Nevada anyway) and they apparently got the room for $ 22, a lot less than we paid but thats what happens when you book from overseas. There are much nicer places to stay but they cost a lot more, and the cheaper ones are less well placed, less comfortable or come with fewer amenities. If you came to vegas for a luxury break look elsewhere, if you need a place to crash get the best deal you can online and get through the lobby/casino before the smell sinks in. If they offer an upgrade to the disabled room its your choice. There is a pool around the back somewhere, and all the usual casino features, the kids fun park is good for the 4-11 year olds, and the Stratosphere (with several good rides) and the Sahara (rollercoaster) are the closest casinos'. Its a short walk to the monorail through the Sahara, and its not a bad walk up the strip (4miles, you are right at one end) especially at night. The casino is nothing much, try the Treasure Island or the Bellagio after the fountains, and definitely go down to Fremont street for the light show and the vibe, the casinos there are fun, some in our group thought they were better.

Looking to save some money, we were attracted by the low weekly rates and the many places to eat listed on their website. However, once we arrived we discovered it's a much older hotel, with most of the resturants closed during the week to save labor costs. The rooms are very basic with low end bedding, TVs and furniture. Long lines at Check-In are caused by staffing shortages at the front desks. However, I was impressed with the positive attitude and helpful nature of most of the hotel staff. The front desk supervisors were directly involved to resolve a few minor issues with our room. Ms. Pamela Li, front desk supervisor was extremely helpful and conducted herself in a very polite, professional manner.

Knowing we had limited time it made sense to stay there so we could do some rides and the midway, and in that respect it was a good choice, but given other circumstances, I would stay elsewhere in the future.. Service: Upon arrival around 4pm on a Saturday there was a small line at checkin, maybe 6 families ahead of us. We moved through the line quickly and although we had reserved a room in the main tower we were placed in the Skyrise tower with amazing views of the north strip. It was an easy checkin, and the man that helped us was friendly and gave us some great info on things to check out with our kids. The Resort: I have been visiting this resort for 30 years and the biggest issue I have is the design when they added on. All the casinos in Vegas are fairly big, but most were designed that way. Circus Circus seems to just have buildings and parking structures dropped wherever there was room at the time so to walk from the Skyrise tower to the main midway is literally 10+ minutes. In addition since its mostly families you are dodging strollers, and one thing that comes with the low price is rude people which was a big issue for me. Our kids only went on a couple rides and I am glad we didn't buy an all day pass because the Adventuredome was packed and the lines were very long. Its probably better suited for older kids that are of age to roam around on their own. Since my kids are small and we accompanied them to the rides it was a tedious experience to say the least. The main midway and Circus acts really feel like they did in the 80's with a lot of the same games, however the crowd is more of a Chuck E Cheese with children that are not well behaved and are willing to step over the little kids to get to what they want. The staff however at the main midway were wonderful with the kids and the circus acts we saw (trapeze and acrobats) were awesome as always. The pool area is small, but I cam only speak to that from the view from my room, because the pools close at 5pm. Yep thats right, its Vegas, the city that never sleeps yet at a resort geared for kids who LOVE to swim, there was no pool open at 7pm when we wanted to take a dip. This for me is a deal breaker and probably one of the main reasons I will never stay at the hotel again. Rooms: We were in a room in the skyrise tower, is was large enough for our family, the carpet looked fairly new, there was granite in the bath area and it felt very clean. This was a typical room for a budget hotel in Vegas, and I have no complaints about our room with the exception of the beds. The pillows were thin, the blankets were thin and the beds were hard as rocks. The towels were fluffy soft but we only had three and when I called down for more, it took 2 hours to get them and buy then I didn't need them anymore. My suggestion is to call down for extra towels and pillows upon arrival. You do get a great funbook when you check in that includes free high speed Internet, two rides in the Dome, two midway games, free drinks and a few other things, so its not all bad, its just not all good. In summary, its still the same old Circus Circus, overrun by kids and people pushing strollers. If you have young kids and don't have a lot of time it will work, but honestly if you are going to be in Vegas for any amount of time I would stay at Excalibur where its still kid friendly and smack in the middle of a great group of hotels versus this one which is in the middle of nowhere and overrun by kids. Its a great place to visit for the day, but I don't know that I would ever stay there again.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "pune", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay with kids\u201d", "Author": "nixtrips", "ReviewID": "UR59304112", "Content": "My kids had a blast.

We checked in on a Monday night at 11pm. The check in line was extremely long and took us about 45 minutes before we were waited on. They were completely understaffed with only 3 clerks to check in a HUGE amount of people. This didn't seem to matter to the clerks, they didn't move any faster. Knowing that the West Tower rooms are the most up to date rooms, my goal was to get a room there. After a very long time searching through every possibility, the clerk offered us a suite with a jacuzzi tub (but only slept 2 and there were 4 of us) or we had to take a room in the main tower. He said that there were rooms in the West Tower that hadn't been cleaned, so there was nothing he could do. He considered this room in the main tower to be an upgrade from the original room they had us booked in. I said \"we're not going to be overlooking a roof or something, are we?\" he assured me that we were not. YEAH - RIGHT!!! The room was not only overlooking a nasty roof, but the carpets were stained, the bedding was stained, the lamp shade was torn and left that way..... need I say more? We slept there (I didn't sleep) that night and called to the front desk in the morning to request a room in the West Tower. I must say that they were very accommodating and after holding for a few minutes, came back to the line and said we have a room ready for you now in the West Tower. The room in the West Tower was SO much better than the first room we were in. Still, by all means, NOT an upscale place by any stretch of the imagination, but well worth the $30/night price tag. We had a rental car and actually liked staying on that end of the strip. It was much easier to get around in without being stuck in the strip traffic. The hotel lobby, shops, casinos, Adventure Dome, and all public areas of the hotel were clean and in good shape. However, like the title says, it was definitely more like a ZOO than a Circus!! There were mobs and mobs of people there.... obviously, for the same reason we were there... the price! We went into just about every other hotel there and never saw a check in line anything like at Circus Circus.

Peoples seem to be trashy as in one incident when a couple were sitting down near the buffet and the guy was in the woman's lap while she was picking his teeth. Also, I would not spend a dime here on gambling and went over to Belaggio, Wynn, Paris, and Venetian. The pool area looks like it has the original pools from the 60s and was towards the back of the hotel and not nice at all. Only good thing about this hotel is slot-a-fun outside.

We are in the US for 5 months and have a pretty strict budget. Pretty much the title sums this place up. We paid $50/night for the newly upgraded West Tower rooms and they were fine. They are clean and modern and the beds were comfortable. There is no fridge and any of the rooms (unless you request one for $15/night) but they do now offer free wireless internet (its slow (~100k/sec). If you are coming with kids this would be a good place to stay. The Adventuredome is heaps of fun and there is circus shows on every 30mins from 10am - 12 midnight. However, the circus is full of smoke so if you care for your kids well being, i guess it would not be such a great place. The cheap rooms generally make everything else cheap around the place. The Cafe that is open was OK in price and the buffet is cheap also. Drinks are cheap at \"slots of fun\" so if you are looking for a stay in Vegas on a budget this is an OK place to spend it. However, all that \"cheapness\" results in cuts all over the place. There is never enough staff on the check in/out desk. There is generally only one bar maid at each bar. Pretty much when u finally get a drink, you join the line to get the next one. They go on about having 3 pools however only one was open (I assume to cut costs on heating and life guards at the others). They have this HAWKER alley where you have to walk from casino to casino that are forever asking you to buy their cheap crap. This is OK at first but wears thin after about 1 hour. The final nail in the coffin for me was when we asked to stay another 4 nights they made us move from the 33rd floor with a great view to the 9th floor with a view of the filthy roof of the casino. We spent most of the morning trudging around the casino from one room to another. When I complained no one apologised or even seemed to care. If it wasn't for my partner I would have checked out immediately. I would recommend that people take advantage of other hotels great rates. For example the Luxor (4 star) has a rate of $140 for 3 nights at the moment. If you stay for 6 nights its cheaper than Circus Circus anyway! To sum it all up.

I booked the Circus Circus through a vacation package with US Air. They listed the hotel as a 3 diamond..they are crazy. I went with my daughter and nephew on a 4 day get away. We booked 2 rooms with the package and were told the Skyrise tower was remodeled and has pillow top beds. My room was a complete disaster. The beds were older than I am ( and my daughter is old enough to gamble) , the sheets were stained with black stuff. My shower curtain had toothpaste smeared all over it. I moved the nightstand to plug in my cell phone and there was a pornographic magazine and a nasty rubber glove on the floor!! The window was so dirty I would not touch it to try to open it. My heat register was full of peanuts and would not turn on. My nephews room had no soap or shampoo and had the same old nasty beds. I called down stairs and they offered to change our rooms. When we went down to the other floor the hallway was party central. Adults running up and down the halls acting like idiots and the smell of pot was overwhelming. We decided to go off the property to eat and maybe find another place to stay. After several hours we came back and decided to spend one night there. The final straw was the ice machine didn't work. After a 10 minute walk we made it down to the check in desk and spoke with the manager. She upgraded us to a mini suite in another tower. The rooms were very large with nice beds, but still no 3 diamond. The windows were so old that I thought there was a heat vent on the floor, it was the wind blowing through the windows! My hair dryer did not work and my nephews television worked only if it wanted to. My faucet on the shower was so hard to turn off that I had to use both hands. I also had a family with a newborn next to me and could hear it crying. My nephews room had two large windows on either side, both with a view of a brick wall. No coffee pots in the rooms. The safe costs 50 cents every time you open it. The property is over run with little kids and you walk forever to get from one spot to another. There are sales people everywhere asking you to try something. I did not even attempt to eat there. I have stayed at several hotels (TI, Mirage, Terribles, Riviera and the Orleans) in Vegas and do not consider my self a picky person, but this hotel is way below my standards.

I called in directly to book. Lisa was VERY helpful and HONEST about her which room to book. she said DO NOT book manor rooms. she informed me that the room i was booking had been remodeled and was alot nicer then the older rooms. i took her word and booked! (other rooms were in process of upgrades) we waited about 15 mins to get to counter for check in. which surprised us since the line was super long. they were very nice and offered to let us in our room even though we arrived very early. We stayed on the 16th floor of the west tower. Our room was very clean, no smoke smell, newer furniture and decor. nothing out of an aladdin movie lol. first thing i did...checked the bathroom..CLEAN! It was quiet and comfy..just what we wanted! the view was of the garage and mountains, but hey we didnt go to vegas to look out our window. house keeping was very prompt in bringing extra towels. our iron wasnt working so they brought a new one up right away. Ate once in the buffet, because the lines were always super long and the food wasnt the greatest, but hey it was cheap lol. the westside deli was actually very good, huge portions, couldnt finish our plates! we love food, so we tried alot of other places on the strip not just CC. overall, the food isnt top quality, but its worth the price! I didnt like that the rooms were way in the back and had to walk through everything to get to/from rooms/strip. The vendors didnt pressure us like some folks experienced. we said no they backed off. i didn't notice the \"cigar room\" smell alot of folks talked about, and im usually very sensitive to cig smoke. it was like any other casino. We headed out to walk the strip.CC is towards the end, it didnt seem that long, but it kind of caught up with me half way. but what else would you expect while walking for miles and drinking?! the housekeeping lady suggested we use the duece next time...BEST idea ever! cheaper than taxi, and the stops were at good locations unlike the Monorail. $5 for 24hours was a good deal! we took that thing everywhere! only bad part..no open containers of liquor..so just chug before you get on LOL even though the place is more focused on familes and kids, my fiance and i werent bothered by the screaming kids and familes. we just brushed it off. the adventure dome was actually fun! we enjoyed playing the carnival games and winning crap LOL it was worth the laughs! seemed like alot of parents dumped there kids there to hit the casino... overall, i would stay there again. for the price i wasnt expecting Bellagio service or rooms. but it also wasnt the nightmare people described. if you could ignore the kids and being towards the end of the strip...you'll enjoy it! just walk or duece! you're in vegas so have fun!!!", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIt was good.\u201d", "Author": "AnthonyF3", "ReviewID": "UR56965592", "Content": "We stayed in one of the new rooms.

The girls from my team would come to my room every morning for breakfast and we had more than enough room in my room for all of them. The room was away from everything and it was pretty quiet.

This may be something others take for granted but I have been in hotels before that just disregard this and clean the room anyway. Sometimes I don't want my room cleaned.

When I'm in Vegas, I spend 90% of my time somewhere else. Who the hell needs to spend that much for a place to sleep?

( the view was of the Riv, but we were on the 29th floor) We stayed in the West Tower, which from what I hear was only recently renovated. The bedding and drapes don't quite match, but I wasn't there to critique the interior decorator, I was there to celebrate! The staff was great when we called down and asked for extra pillows and towels, and brought them up within half an hour of our request. They did shut off the water over night for maintanence, (which we forgot at 4 am) and when the toilet backed up, which was our own fault, the facilities staff was quick to come up and unclog it for us. The walls are a bit thin ,we could hear the kids next door watching TV, but thats why they make earplugs. :). The consierge service was great when we decided to buy tickets for the Luxor's Titanic exhibit and they got us discounted passes to the show. The Casino itself is super smoky, but I guess you just expect that in Vegas. The midway was fun, I won about 8 stuffed animals, did better there than I did at the slots! :) Its defintley an older hotel, and made more for families, but the beds are comfy (considering I arrived with a head cold and spent most of the first afternoon sleeping, it was as comfortable as one can be when they can't breathe:) ) and the price is reasonable.

Our first stay was fine and we had a great wide window with a brilliant view, the only bad point i must say is the pool is a little scatty and worn down! it was full of older people who have obviously over tanned. If going out for a fag on your own try and take someone, i was approached by alot of old men aswell as women asking me to work with them (prostututes) around the hotel area near all the restaurants. I didn't eat there much at all as the restaurants there are a bit pricey, however the buffet there is amazing! as a brit any food weather its greasy or not is brilliant, they had a wide range of different foods from savoury to muffins and pancakes and free re-fills, i think it costs about 20 dollas or less for breakfast, it certainly fills you up throughout the day! There is a few places around... opposite there is the Rivera which has a diner called Kadys and the portions there are just as good, and steaks the size of your head! In the hotel the beds very very comfy, i haven't had a goods night sleep in forever... the cleaner topped up our toiletries daily and gave us plenty! I heard some people do complain about smoking but its Vegas! what do you expect? you can smoke in every hotel so the smell will stick with you with your stay. I stayed in a non smoking room but in the corridors it did still smell of smoke but did not seep through the door. There is also a CVS shop which is a bit like a boots but way better just up from circus circus, google it before you go! its perfect to stash up on the little things such as drinks and crisps as-well as chocolates. At the stratosphere hotel just a 10 min walk away is another restaurant called Roxys which is a 50's diner with women doing hoolahoops and singing whilst you eat on roller-skates, this is defiantly good for kids who want to have fun whilst eating! i ordered a hotdog thinking it would be small as i wasn't that hungry and it was a foot long - be aware of the size of the portions they are HUGE! but worth the money. I had no problem with the hotel in all, within the room the tv channels were all fine and alot of you been framed american version was on so thats good for kids too as-well as adults. Oh another point try your best NOT to touch the rails on anything, i got around 300+ electric shocks from that hotel and every-other one, as vegas is so dry it does cause a hell of a lot of electricity so be aware and watch where you touch! all in all this isn't the best hotel to stay as it is far away from the strip! catch the deuce bus just outside as it stops outside each hotel and its around 3 dollas a day or 15 for 3 days, its worth getting this, i learnt this the hard way by using the monorail at the Sarah which was double the price plus a fair walk down back to circus circus which can really hurt your feet after a long day... oh remember to wear sensible shoes! i learnt the hard way by getting 11 blisters which caused me to have to walk on bare feet in nearly every hotel", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hood River, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable they get away with serving such sub-par food\u201d", "Author": "aprildon6", "ReviewID": "UR54420432", "Content": "We chose Circus Circus because of price and proximity to the trade show we were attending.

We liked the budget of circus circus since we had decided that we wanted to spend our cash in the casinos. So that's how we decided to go for Circus Circus. The drive from LA to Vegas was totally exhausting, so we crashed the moment we reached Vegas. The hotel beat our expectations by a good margin (it is a massive hotel complex), the check-in line was long given the number of tourist buses coming in but the service at the front desk was quick and before i could park my car my wife was ready with the room keys. There are a number of shows and activities going on all the time and the hotel is right on the boulevard so you can walk to most casinos (but given the length of the boulevard it can be a very lengthy walk for some at the other end of the strip) The rooms were very good, comfortable and clean. We didn't order any room service so cant comment on that.

My actual main problem with it was that it is at the top of the strip and a bit out of the way to be honest, most of the other hotels you want to look around and some better night spots are much further down. Plus we were out in a Manor Room which were a right trek to the front of the hotel where taxis were. We ate in the Garden Restaurant (I think that is what is called) twice, was good value, good service and good food. We ate brekkie a couple of times in the cafe, food was ok, value good, service ok. My verdict would be, if you can afford it book somewhere in a better location like the MGM or NY NY, or if you want more from your hotel then somewhere to crash, look elsewhere. However, if you are on a budget, only need somewhere to rest your weary head and don't mind a trek to some of the good parts of the trip, then fill your boots - it is fantastic value.

I had read many reviews and seen video footage of the hotel itself just to see how it favoured as we got an amazing deal with the hotel for the time of year we went (beginning of October). From the descriptions at first, we were a little worried, but once we got there there wasn't anything to be worried about. Apart from the little lack of cheer in the reception department on check-in, everyone else couldn't have been nicer! Being one of those guests who's easily pleased with even the tiniest details, I found this hotel fabulous! From the huge array of slot machines and games to choose from to the wide selection of places to eat. I LOVED the idea of getting a Krispy Kreme donut at 2am (open 24 hours and staff are absolutely lovely!). There were a couple of things I found odd. 1 was the safe in the bedrooms where you had to deposit a quarter each time you opened and closed the safe. This meant constantly having to make sure we had change ready. But, once we had gotten used to this system it was fine, but for next time I feel the safe's could be modernised with the key-pad systems for entry (I work in a hotel myself with this system and it does prove effective). Also the bath's in the bathroom were too low down to the ground. This does make it more difficult for people with knee problems (as my mum has) to get in and out of a low-ground bath. Again, once we were used to the surroundings we were fine. Another point was on check-in you are usually asked to present a credit-card to charge back any extras to the room. This did not happen and was an essential we were expecting, particularly to make phone calls from the room. It was my parents wedding anniversary during our stay and I had booked them a helicopter ride over the Las Vegas Strip and so had to phone the day before to confirm they were coming. When I went to use the phone thinking reception would answer and say I needed to produce a credit card, I had a particularly rude woman on the phone from the internal switchboard telling me I had not left a card at reception (I was aware of this and was prepared to say I'd go to reception to do this) and left me feeling like a complete idiot for doing something we weren't asked for on check-in! This is a daily part of my prodedures in the hotel where I work and it can be a disciplinary issue if you don't take a credit card and the guest leaves without paying! So, why the receptionist who checked me and my parents in didn't ask for a credit card I'll never know. Anyway, despite the little hiccups the holiday was wonderful (as I expected it to be lol). I wouldn't think twice about booking with this hotel again. The theme of the hotel was unusual but really worked for the city we were in (anything that isn't unusual in Vegas just isn't Vegas!) and the staff are very friendly and welcoming (well, apart from a few at reception). The Midway is great for kids as well, with the added advantage of having McDonalds on the same floor! The Adventuredome was a little disappointing in terms of modernised rides. Although I had been planning on going on the roller coaster, there was no clear path/signage for the queue so in the end I didn't bother. Perhaps this could be updated for any future riders! All in all, a great place to come and relax and for any families with kids it's a great place to spend quality time together riding the roller coaster, playing the Midway carnival style games and dining out. Also the casino is absolutely fantastic for gamers just beginning the Vegas style gambling or the experienced pro who can just hop on and off different machines scoring the jackpot. Particularly play the \"Deal or No Deal\" slot machine - 1 of my favourites and managed to win $40 on my last night!

I on the other hand thought it to be clean, the check in was quick and the rooms were also clean and of a decent size. After seeing all the other hotels I now do understand their initial disappointment as all the other hotels are a lot more modern and this one could do with a revamp but as I said before, it was clean and the staff were friendly enough. This hotel is definitely one for the children, as the name suggests, and there were a lot of children about and at times it did feel a little claustrophobic. I would say that this hotel is not one for a romantic getaway or a luxury holiday as it was extremely busy and it's not really the sort of atmosphere that couples might prefer. Food wise we were eating in the buffet the first two days which was all you can eat, then we realised we could buy a bowl of cereal from the westside deli which was better value as we weren't really eating much in the buffet but the food there was fresh and we had no complaints. The lady running this was really nice and made us feel very welcome! Area wise Circus Circus is close to the Stratosphere and we walked to The Wynn (beautiful) which then leads onto the strip but it is a 15 minute walk whereas if you were staying in the actual strip, hotels are only 5 minutes apart. However in the grand scheme of things it isn't that bad if you don't mind a walk and we quite enjoyed walking our breakfast off! Taxis to the strip only cost $15 or so so we tended to walk there and get a taxi back. On the whole I don't think I would stay in this hotel again unless I was on a very tight budget but for the first time experience it did the job and if you do go to Las Vegas it's definitely worth a look - they have shows with acrobats and the theme inside is good with the nightime lights very good too!", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cBargain Hotel?\u201d", "Author": "dawgbro", "ReviewID": "UR52581628", "Content": "I came to L.V. in hopes of drying out a little and maybe even getting some sunshine.

After what seemed liked a long wait to get checked in and a surprise cash deposit requirement for the room telephone I finally got to my room. The front desk service was polite and nice. The extra deposit for the phone seemed like gouging to me though. The room was tidy & clean for the most part though a bit small. There was limited television available. A nice king-size bed in my room w/good pillows. Room had a good air conditioner which I used and it was effective. There was no view from my room window and the window did not open. Overall the room was pretty comfortable. The location for this hotel/casino is excellent. Near the northern end of the strip it seemed right in the middle of the downtown,(Freemont Street Experience), and access to the other venues on the strip. This hotel is a theme park and it obviously is an attraction for family's with kids. If you don't have the patience to be around kids for god's sake don't stay here. You could not walk through the hotel/casino without being bumped into or cut off. This tried my patience greatly. Too many baby strollers moving way too slowly. When you'd try to go around someone would jump right in front of you. Shoppers and people chatting clogged the narrow corridors of this venue. Choking off any right of way or easy passage. The buffet is something I would recommend that you do not do unless you like feeling like cattle. Long, long lines waiting for mediocre food. A complete waste of time. However, this venue does have other restaurants that serve good food but you do have to watch your times when you go. I would recommend The Steak House and The Garden Grill for food but depending on your timing you may have to wait a bit for these places too. I did venture out onto the strip for breakfast a few times and found a good, convenient restaurant across the street and down a block with no waiting and good food. Circus Circus has everything a traveller could ask for and then some... like all the hotel/casino's do on the strip. One could spend there entire stay inside the venue and never leave. It is one of the older venues and seems a bit dreary in comparison to other newer venues. The table games in the casino were only half open making it difficult to get a seat at a black jack table but if you're patient you can get on one in pretty short order. The acrobats in the Midway were very good too. Too many kids to enjoy the Adventure Dome but I'm not a kid. If I was I probably would love it. Nice looking roller coaster and water slide rides among many others. More like a carnival with too many booths to waste money on, throwing, tossing, shooting, etc...I didn't partake in only toured.

The hotel and casino is a junkyard to say the least. I stayed in the west tower which is supposed to have better rooms. My disappointments are for the following reasons -- 1. The room service is available from 6 / 7 am up to 2 pm. After that you cannot get anything delivered to your room. 2. We ordered some French toasts in the morning (room service). The quality of the food was horrible. As an added bonus it was very pricey. Two plates of French toasts and a small pot of coffee did cost me more than 30 bucks whereas the same thing I got in another hotel for little over 20. 3. Room carpet looked horrible. 4. Quality of the bedding was poor. Every morning all of us had body ache. One may argue that in a cheap hotel that's what I should get. However I had much better experience with a cheaper hotel (Orleans as an example). 5. The shower is below par. 6. The maids do not clean everything. I saw some white stuff on our bed cover after we checked in. They did not care to pickup magazines / papers left on the floor. 7. The entire hotel has a weird layout. It is very big and due to the strange structure it is not very easy to get to one point from another. 8. The parking lot is very much crowded and like the structure of the entire hotel is confusing. 9. I dont know why so many people come to this place, probably because of the Adventure dome, but boy is this place crowded or what? You can collide with hundreds of people to go from your room to the parking lot. No other casino is even comparable to Circus Circus. As a result you will get all the hassle of a theme park in a hotel. 10. The food quality is bad in many restaurants of Casino e.g. Pizzeria (I guess that's the name) and definitely the buffet. In a nutshell do not be lured by the lower price of the hotel.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aviano", "Title": "\u201cOk for the money, but rooms need refurbishing\u201d", "Author": "tntxfour", "ReviewID": "UR52267899", "Content": "Took the kids to the amusement park for part of their Christmas.

The carpet was in really bad shape with lots of very warn spots and places where people had put out cigarrette butts etc. The one cushioned chair in the room was well stained. My only other issue with the room is the tv. When you turn it on, you get a menu with following choices: Local channels Adult Movies Fairly recent movies ($11) Taped tv shows (CSI etc. for $9 Circus (clown channel as my daughter called it) Only about 10 channels in all. Not cable by any means. Also, I wished they were more discrete about the adult movies. So to put it bluntly, I only paid around $55 per night, so I got a good deal, but you do get what you pay for.

I was afraid after looking at bad comments but it turned out perfect. You have Very large rooms. They might be a bit outdated but in VEGAS you are in your room for a short sleep and that is about it. The only bad (very bad) thing I have to say is that rooms are not sound proof and so you will hear people walking around, CHILDREN screaming, running, the staff cleaning the other rooms around and we were lucky but I am sure you can ear couples playing the love game on top of your room or even on the sides. Or worst people might ear you....be quiet there are children around...:-) As for the food, we went at the buffet for 1 breakfast and 1 lunch and we were very very happy with all the choices. You can go healthy or not your choice. There is plenty of variety for beverages also. Also the pizzeria is great. Don\u2019t order a large if you are only 2..:-) Unless you want a mid night snack when you come back at your room after your night of party. There are subways, MacDonald\u2019s and plenty more 2 minutes from the hotel and all over VEGAS. CHECK IN: what I found a bit weird is that they charge 20$ for early check in so we left our luggage and went on the strip right away. CHECK OUT: very quick and nicely handled. LOCATION: You are about 5-10 minutes walk from the amazing Strip and about 10 minutes walk from the SAHARA and STRATOSPH\u00c8RE resorts on the other side. It takes about 20 minutes on the taxi ride unless you get a private ride directly to your hotel for 50$ per person. The non-private ride (bus that contains 10-15 person) is around 25$ round-trip per person. Security safe: Another thing i found weird is that the security safe in your room cost 50 cents each time you open it. Another way for them to get to your money. PLANNING YOUR MONEY: I got that idea on a web site and it worked great for us and might save your trip. Put all your money on the bed. Decide how much you want to spend on food and drinks each day. PUT THAT MONEY IN ONE ENVELOPS PER DAY SEALED. Put them in safe What's left is for your gambling and shows. Split that amount in SEALED ENVELOPS 1 per day. Leave the hotel room with your daily envelops. You should have one for your meals and one for you gambling. NOTE that drinks are free when gambling. All you need to give are tips. (50 cents or 1$ per drink). We played blackjack so you often get a 50 cent chip for blackjacks and I used these to tip waitresses and dealers.

Free drinks for the players! Souvenir shops, a mini roller-coaster park right inside the hotel, restaurants - this hotel has them all, although places aren't as luxurious as in the Bellagio. There's also a chapel for those with serious intentions (or who just got too drunk!). About the hotel's weak points: it's very big and pretty crowded, you have to pay attention on how to get to your room, how to get to the reception and how to get to the restrooms, once you're in the casino. There are circular places in the casino (the McD zone) and it's easy to get lost. Or lose your children. The staff proves to be helpful in these situations. Another issue (typical to Las Vegas) was getting in the hotel after police closed one end of the Strip in order to get some guy - in order to enter the Circus Circus, we had to pick a different route, so be sure you have a GPS (very useful on all US teritory). I highly recommend for people who don't wanna spend too much money on a room (you'll just sleep in it, there are so many attraction out there), yet wanna be able to have fun in a nearby casino, and stay close to the Strip.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cVery Friendly Staff and Hotel But too many kids!\u201d", "Author": "KaneTheUndertaker", "ReviewID": "UR49458576", "Content": "We went to Las Vegas for the 1st time in 2007 and stayed at Circus Circus as a part of package deal to go to the Grand Canyon, From the moment we checked in the staff were nothing short of top notch, Giving us good advice, Guilding us around such a big place ( We have nothing like this in Australia) I put my hand up here for not doing my homework as i didnt know the place would be packed with kids!

We were 4 Scottish & 1 Canadian on a road trip travelling from Alberta, Canada and then heading back up California Coast and Las Vegas was to be one of the main stopping points on our trip. We were visiting Vegas for the first time and after reading mixed reviews about most hotels in Vegas we decided to stop reading the reviews & just book so Circus Circus it was . At a very cheap price per night our party of 5; two couples and 1 other opted for 3 rooms. At check -in we were greeted by our polite but very straight to the point receptionist and allocated 3 rooms in the Skyrise tower 17th floor I think . Up to the rooms we went and were pleasantly surprised rooms very clean, good decorative order, modern TV and clean bathroom with basic amenities. After spending many hotel nights in North America and in Europe and working in 4 & 5 star hotels on both sides of the atlantic, these rooms for the price we paid per night get no complaints from us!! They were serviced everyday to a good standard. We didn't encounter any problems with the hotel itself, free car-parking, buffet restaurant -ok its not fancy but if you didnt fancy walking in the heat to somewhere and wanted a quick breakfast or dinner it is fine. The Casino has the same machines in it as as all the others and the shops not fancy but if its cheap souvenirs your looking for thats what you get. The Swimming Pool is not the biggest and if you are someone who wants to spend all day at the pool then you might be a bit bored at this small area. Fitness Centre is well equipped. The hotels location is about 5-15 minutes walk from Caesars Palace, Mirage, Fashion Mall, Treasure Island & the Wynn hotels etc - no problems walking to and from. Recommendations for Las Vegas -- see the Love Show in the Mirage - fantastic Take a Taxi to Fremont Street experience and eat at Golden Gate Casino for cheap old fashioned Vegas experience! The Peppermill restaurant just 5 mins walk from Circus Circus ( take a right and its on opposite side) glass low rise building open 24 hours - not fancy but great food & drink pancakes and hot and crispy chicken wrap recommended!!

We had read bad reviews about the hotel before we arrived so were a bit wary. However we need not have worried. We arrived at 5 pm in the evening and were given all relevant information about hotel, including a map which is very useful. We were initially given a smoking room but as soon as we told them neither of us smoked it was changed. We were on the 28th floor of the tower which had a great view down towards Freemont. The room was spacious and had plenty of room to store clothes. We asked for an extra pillow which arrived within the hour. Towels were changed every day and room kept spotless. I am a very fussy eater but this hotel provided everything from a quick snack to a full meal. The all day, all you can eat, buffet was tremendous value at $20 each. It runs from 7 am to 10 pm which allows for an evening snack if required. It consists of food from various regions both at breakfast (you could have 4 courses if required) and dinner (we never stayed in for lunch but took fruit and rolls in the morning which we took with us) which included a carvery style section of turkey, beef and ham. Admittedly there was not much choice of potatoes but there was veg and also a comprehensive salad bar which could be utilised. There was soup to start with, the salad bar, various desserts and an ice cream machine, fresh fruit, drinks, cakes/pastries. I really do not know what people expect from a buffet but we were very satisfied. There are plenty of other reasonably priced choices for food throughout the hotel including McDonalds and Subway. We played the slots in the Casino but there was little else by way of entertainment. We also took advantage of the 3-day bus pass obtained right outside the hotel which allowed endless travel up and down the strip. Before our retirm home the Business Centre in the hotel arranged our boarding passes for the three return flights home and also contacted the limo company taking us back to the airport. Admittedly there was a $6 charge for this but it gave us great peace of mind to enjoy our last day.

We were given the West Tower, and when we walked in, it was nice and spacious, with a flat screen tv, and marble sinks and walls in the shower. It definitely looked remodeled, even though the hallway looked kind of like an old apartment. But after a couple of days, I didn't even care about that!

We weren't planning on spending our entire day at Circus Circus, so it was more than adequate for our needs. The cleaning staff was really nice and left us extra things when we asked. The Circus buffet is hit and miss. If you want fancy dining, then you're going to the wrong place. If you want just enough food to stuff yourself that is still good quality, then $20 for a all day buffet purchase is a steal, considering each meal is at least $11. And if you don't want to eat that, I'd recommend the McDonalds, the best food ever. Don't bother paying for WiFi, just go to the fancy McDonads next door, and use their free WiFi. There's a Starbucks on Paradise and Sahara just 10 minutes walk north. The casinos in general were smokey, so Circus Circus wasn't any worse. I made $100 in the penny machine on my first day, so that was a treat! Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the place. I'm not into the fancy, shiny hotels. Those places are fine to visit and play the casinos, but they seem to posh for my tastes. And it was nice and quiet in our room, so you could even take a quiet nap in the afternoon. I didn't take advantage of the Adventure Dome, so I can't comment on the rides or anything else in there.

The pool remained in the sun all day which surprised me considering its location to the towers. Circus is in waking distance of the strip but it is quite a walk. Fashion show mall is only 10 minutes away but the main bulk of the strip is quite a distance which was annoying in the heat of summer (we went in september not exactly the hottest month).

Southwest Airlines Vacations and the Circus Circus website essentially offered the same deal \u2013 a free hotel room with purchase of the airfare. (We booked through Southwest Vacations.) Despite some of the negative reviews here, I can\u2019t really argue with \u201cfree\u201d. So off we went. As other people have noted, Circus Circus is an older property located toward the north end of the Strip. And with all the construction on the adjoining properties, there is less activity going on in that area. As a result, the traffic around the hotel isn\u2019t as bad as in the main part of Las Vegas Blvd. Plus, and the hotel has direct access to Industrial Road \u2013 the access road on the west side of the Strip. (Most of the hotels on the west side of Las Vegas Blvd have access from Industrial Rd and Frank Sinatra Drive, but not always direct access. So you can avoid the traffic on the Strip by using the back way, but it is not always clear how to cut back over when you want to.) On the other hand, you will need a car, particularly in the summer. There seemed to be plenty of parking at Circus Circus, but the garages are older and the spaces are kind of narrow. The public areas at the hotel, including much of the casino floor, seem rather cramped compared to the newer hotels we walked through. The Promenade area around the AdventureDome is often packed. We walked through the midway area and the AdventureDome. The circus acts and the rides looked kind of fun, but we don\u2019t have kids and there were other things we wanted to do. The hotel has two smallish pools and two hot tubs. They are well-maintained, but it takes some walking (and at least 2 elevators) to get to them. We only ate at one of the restaurants \u2013 the Pizzeria. If you are hungry and tired (we were), the food is adequate. However, we paid $30 for a personal pizza, a calzone, a glass of wine and a soft drink. There are much better options in Las Vegas. A decent hotel room can make just about any place bearable, and Circus Circus delivered that. We stayed in a Main Tower Room. It was somewhat plain, with few extra amenities, and dated d\u00e9cor. Some of the furniture was worn here and there and the clock didn\u2019t work. Plus, they put us in an end room with a view of a concrete wall (the West Tower). However, the room itself was spacious and clean with a comfortable bed. And since we were in Vegas we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in the room anyway except to sleep and change clothes. Our experience with the service at the hotel was generally good. We arrived late and there wasn\u2019t a line for check-in. There was a significant line at check out, but the hotel offers a self-check out and I only had to drop off the card keys in the box. Housekeeping did a good job. And I was pleasantly surprised about the elevators. For the most part, they were fast, well-maintained and conveniently located. The only exception was the pool elevators, which were slow, hard-to-find and hot. And on one occasion, the doors didn\u2019t open. We had to ride back down to the pool deck and take the other elevator. All in all, I can\u2019t really complain about Circus Circus. Yes, it is aging and it is not as nice as some of the newer hotels. But it is kind of fun in its own way. Most importantly, it makes a decent base of operations from which to see other parts of Las Vegas. And we got a great deal.

I shared with one buddy and the total cost for 5 nights including taxes was $212 - so $106 for each of us. We stayed in the Main Tower as we want quick and easy access to the casino. I have never stayed in the Manor and can not comment on this section. Our rooms were dated for sure, but clean, functional and comfortable. Since we had the \"poker room rate\" we were able to check in in the VIP line which was quick and effcient. Location of Circus Circus can be an issue for some people as it is further down the Strip, but I find the walk down the Strip not to be a problem - although this time it was very HOT, but we also drive down to Vegas so we have a car to get us around. Service was great - friendly and fast everywhere we went. One complaint is that the Casino Cafe is not open 24 hours anymore and getting something to eat at 3am was a little tough, but the Westside Deli was open and a Chil-dog hit the spot for sure. The other place we ate ate - the Garden Grill - where we had all you can eat Prime Rib for $5.99 as we had comp coupons from the poker room was incredible - best Prime Rib I have had in 20 years. Also Slots-of-Fun next door was great for a break from poker - cheap table games and cheap draft beer - toms for fun and energy there. As well the McDonalds next to Slots-of-Fun is the nicest one I have ever been in and the most efficient - they have it down to a science there getting you r order and food out fast. We did not go to the pool so I can not comment on this. As for the poker room - we love it - fast cocktail service freindly staff and I always win there - up about $400 playing $3-6 limit over the time I was there. They also have a freeroll tournament in the poker room on Sundays if you play 15 hours during the week - I played this and won $280. Circus Circus is what it is - a very cheap place to stay that is works in certain circumstances - a week with buddies in Vegas. Or staying with children as there is lots to keep them busy.

Almost everything about the casino was old and in need of urgent upgrade. The carpets were worn, paint faded and just overall old fashioned.

The next lift was rusted and had holes in the walls big enough to fit your hand through!! The rooms were clean, but again old fashioned, worn and a tad smelly.

Having heard that Circus Circus was a great place to stay & fairly central to other popular Las Vegas attractions, we booked a Manor Room. On check in, despite having pre booked & prepaid our accomodation, a receipt was presented to the counter assistant advising that the accomodation was prepaid & I was not to be charged for the room. The receipt also advised that a non smoking, Manor Room had been purchased. The counter assistant, who was rather rude insisted that a single, smoking room had been booked for both of us to stay in, in which she asked for my credit card to charge the room. The receipt was again, bought to her attention in which she huffed rudely & advised that an inprint of my credit card would still be required so as $1 a day could be charged for the local calls for the phone in the room whether it was used or not. When questioned as to why I would be charged for a service that I would not to be used, she said it was Circus Circus policy & that the site where I booked the accomodation would've advised me of this before I booked. I have booked accomodation through this site plenty of times aswell as stayed at plenty of hotels & never have any advised me that this is their policy. Once she finally organised the room that I had paid for, a map of Circus Circus was shoved at me across the counter & the lobby circled aswell as the block of the Manor Rooms we would be staying in. Having quite a bit of luggage with us as this was the final stop of our trip, we had no assistance whatsoever moving it to our room, which was a good distance away from the block where our room was located. Upon reaching the room, which was at the very back of the block the hotel was located on, the front door was stuck, the block smelt of cigarettes & there was crumbling plaster in the hallway. The room itself smelt of cigarettes, the carpets had not been cleaned for sometime as there was bits of dried food & nail clippings aswell as dust in the corners. The bathroom, although fresh towels were supplied daily, was very old, the wall paper was peeling above the shower, there were black marks on the floor of the shower where the non slip coating had worn away & what looked like brown glue all over the top of the walls. The toilet also had difficulty flushing & the shower dripped loudly constantly. Despite having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, the housekeeper knocked loudly each morning before trying to access the room with her own key.

We booked our reservations through Orbitz.com & got a decent deal for a Saturday night. The hotel does charge a $1/night charge for use of the phone for local calls, which is nothing compared to the $10-15/night resort fess that you find at some of the other places (plus higher rates). The rooms in the West Tower were real nice. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable & the room stayed very cool. We had a room on the 22nd floor with a view of Las Vegas Blvd. Unfortunately with the location of CIrcus Circus, there was only a view of the Riviera & some construction (but I have never been to Las Vegas one time where there wasn't construction going on). The hotel is located at the far end of the Strip, and does require a little bit of walking to get to the main area. A little tip though: get a pass for The Deuce. Its only $5/person for a 24-hour pass, but you can ride in a double decker bus as much as you want all up-and-down the Strip. It even picks up right in front of Slots-A-Fun which is right next to Circus Circus. The elevators were extreamly packed & trying to get a stroller on one of them was hard. A maintenance employee let ride the employee service elevator b/c we were waiting for an elevator for 10-15 min due to every elevator that stopped was full. The only complaint I had was that being a weekend and during summer, a peak season, there were very few cheap, sit-down dining options around 7-8 pm. An error on my part by assumption (or for living in the laughlin area where at least the cafe is open 24-hours in each casino), but I assumed that there was at least one 24-hour restaurant. Of course, this is a review of the hotel portion, not the food & beverage, so I can't fault the Hotel for that. My 16-month old loved the Advenuredome, even though she was 1\" too small to ride the small rides. She got to play games & watch the rides in action, which was exciting enough for her. As well, the Midway & free circus acts really got her attention too. The games range from $1-2 and you win the usual stuffed animal prize. Overall, we will stay there again.

Was a pretty basic room, slightly dated, only real complaint were the pillows that come with the bed. Instead of eating at the hotel we instead ate lunch every day at the McDonalds right next door, probably the nicest McDonalds I have ever been to, plus it was cheap. Gambling was nice and cheap with $3 mininums for Blackjack and Craps. Looks like the casino has hit on some hard times, one gambling table section was closed the entire time we were there. The other was only half open most of the time and Craps opens at Noon. Played most of the time at Slots O Fun which is the little building right next to and owned by Circus Circus. Never had a problem finding an open chair at a table or space at the Craps table until our last night, which was a Friday night. Slots O Fun seemed to get a little more business than the tables actually in the main Casino, though it does have easy street access which probably contributes to that. The Deuce has a stop right in front of Slots O Fun, $3 for 1-way, $7 all-day, $14 3-days. Also has a stop on the opposite side of the street at the Riveria.

I had never been to Vegas and was really concerned about staying at Circus Cirucs after reading all of the reviews, however, when we arrived late Tues. night we were greeted by FRIENDLY employees who were glad to accomodate us. We were upgraded from a manor room to the skyrise tower without any request or extra charge. We arrived in our room on the 22nd floor and were greeted with a beautiful view of the strip. We had a large king size bed, large chair, desk table, television, and two end tables. The room was very large and the bathroom large, as well. Marble sink countertops and marble shower walls provided us with very clean amenities. The sheets were clean, along with everything else in the room. Others who have written bad reviews obviously havent seen what we did. This hotel is great if your on a budget, or with children. Yes, it was crowned with families, but aren't they entiled to family vacations, too? The only complaint I had with circus circus is its location at the end of the strip and that I didn't get to stay longer. However, it is near the stratosphere and if you have a chance, with all the extra money you will have staying at circus circus, you should visit the restaurant Top of the World there, it was EXCELLENT! Not to mention the $3 blackjack offered @ circus circus!

Her once-clean and sumptuous decor of white satin and silk had deteriorated and like her apartment, Mae too clung to her ing\u00e9nue attire even though her dresses didn't fit quite right and were turning dingy. That's the Circus Circus or, as I like to call it CC. A hotel that's day has come and gone and it doesn't seem that the owners (MGM Mirage ) mind too much or maybe like Mae they're too old to notice. CC is for the bargain hunters, frat boys, or other individuals that don't really care where they stay as long they're under a roof. At the last minute, my company decided to send me to a convention. My other compatriots were booked at the Hilton next to the convention center but by the time my plans were made the Hilton was full. The company's travel agent chose the CC for me because it was one, the closest hotel to the convention center that had a room and two, it was inexpensive. After all, my colleagues were paying a special convention rate of $59/night and CC was going to be $70/night for me so it all seemed reasonable. When I arrived, I waited in line, as one often does in Vegas, for 35 minutes to check in. The reception personnel were friendly, but advised me \"there is a $1 per night room charge for the telephone\"; a little tidbit conveniently not mentioned on any confirmation forms. Upon receiving my room key, I was told I had a Manor room. Sound lovely? It's not. To get there I had to go out the back door, across the street and walk a vast parking lot to the building with my room, which also happened to be next to the Strip's only RV Park. Obviously, not a good sign. What can I say, the room was dirty and I had to wheel my luggage the quarter-mile from reception myself. (The room is big actually for an old hotel, I'd estimate 300 sq. ft., plus or minus, but unfortunately they haven't updated it since the late 1970's or early 1980's and when a room and furnishings are that old you just can't get it clean.) Not happy, I returned to the hotel to try to get another room; and for a mere upgrade of $10 per night, I did get a room in one of the towers. Once again, I have to say, the reception and bell staff were very friendly and quick to come and retrieve me. My advice---don't stay in a Manor room. They did send a very nice bellhop who picked me up in a golf cart so I didn't have to walk anymore. He carried all my luggage and escorted me to the new room all the while assuring me that I would like the tower room MUCH better than the Manor room. He was right, it was better. It had been updated in the early 1990's, it didn't smell and the bedding and bathroom appeared to be clean. Unfortunately, these old hotels aren't built as well as the new ones. My adjoining door wasn't doubled nor insulated and I could hear the children next door wake up and scream every morning at 5 a.m. They played and danced on the marble tile as their laughter vibrated under the door and into my entry, the sound of their parent's voices echoing a song of discipline each morning as the left to parts unknown around 7 a.m...just 30 minutes before my alarm clock was set to go off. The food at CC didn't fair much better. The supposedly great steakhouse is anything but that and most of the other options are just oversized portions prepared from large foodservice distributor offerings. It's kind of sad...this hotel is from the classic Vegas era of time; it has been featured in several movies and a lot of money could make it a beautiful again. The owners could keep the circus theme and the family aspects of the place, like the Adventure Dome, and create an adults only carnaval area within the hotel, which could appeal to a wider demographic of potential guests---it could be something unique. All the people I came in contact with who work at Circus Circus were nice, so that's a plus, but that's the only thing going for this hotel.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona City, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cCircus Circus sucks!!!!\u201d", "Author": "seresad", "ReviewID": "UR33932992", "Content": "I took my family to Vegas for the very first time for all of us and it sucked!

From there we walked into the casino, which was like any other. but what was truly amazing was 'Midway' an area in the middle of the casino earmarked for entertainment.

My daughter won a soft toy and was on top the world. She also won 20 $ of free play at the slot machines.

However the bed looked a bit dodgy and the building was tired. And a funny musty smell all over. The safe was there but it had no door on it. I decided I couldn't stay in that room. I went back to reception and paid 164 dollars for an upgrade to the main tower. How great a decision it was. The room was the exact same standard as the widescreen rooms at the Excalibur. Very modern and fresh the room was. The bed was very comfortable. The whole room was spotless. Loved the big flatscreen tv. Towels and soap etc and bed sheets done daily. I was really impressed. I also felt safe in my room. I don't think I'd feel the same if I was in the Manor Rooms. As for the casino, I'm not a gambler, but it had a nice buzz about it. The buffet however in my opinion is terrible for the price. Eat elsewhere. The Garden Grill restaurant is nice for steaks. I ordered a bottle of Fosters to drink with my dinner. The waitress then came out with a second bottle of Fosters in a bucket of ice with the cap still on it. All smiles she told me it's a complimentary bottle. Great I thought. She then said if I open it I gotta pay for it. which was strange. But overall if you get a tower room you cannot go too far wrong at Circus Circus. You might have to walk a bit to get up the strip.

The free circus acts are fun to watch and lots of activities are available for children. The $1 daily phone charge does come with free, unlimited local calls. Internet is $12 a day. While I hate that the Wi-Fi isn't free, I don't think any hotel on the strip has free Wi-Fi. Overall: Know what you want. You can stay here, on the strip, and take the \"Duece\" bus up and down the strip for $3 a trip or $7 a day. You'll have a decent room, hotel level amenities and all the requirements to have a good time without shelling out a lot of money for lodging. If this is in line with your desires and expectations then by all means stay here. If a luxurious stay with a spa is what you are seeking then this is not the place for you.

The CC is an older casino on the far North end of the strip. It's about 2 miles from the center of the strip. The West Tower rooms are the newer more modern accommodations. Overall: For the price, this vacation was a steal. The hotel appeared to have a smell of chlorine throughout the elevators and halls. Probably due to the pool and water rides in the adventure dome. Room: We stayed in room 3724 of the Skyrise tower. We arrived late Thur night and the West Tower was booked. Check in was quick and the staff was friendly enough. Our room had a king-size bed, tiny tv, closet space, two night stands, three drawer armoire, table, two chairs and a small drink table. Plenty of room for two people. Bed: Firm but comfortable. Nothing special but it was serviceable for sleeping. Sheets were clean, no weird stains or anything. If I had to gripe about something it would be the pillows. They were about two steps up from airline pillows. We had three and requested two more from housekeeping. I found that sleeping on two of them worked out fine. Bathroom: Large granite counter with two sinks and a walk-in shower with granite walls. It was very clean. If I had to pick the biggest pleasant surprise about staying at the CC it would be the bathroom. Shower water pressure was a bit weak for me but that's about it. Note: We only used our room to sleep, shower, and change in. Most of our time was spent at the craps tables or on the strip. If you like to enjoy your room more, then another hotel would probably suit you better. Con about CC rooms: The CC is older so it is designed to make you walk through the entire casino before you get to your rooms. No big deal, but sometimes it gets to be annoying. There are only two exits on opposite ends of the casino to get out. Casino: We only played craps, but the pit bosses and dealers were the friendliest in town. The casino is older but appears to be maintained. The casino is smokier then the newer hotels. Location: The worst part about CC is the location. We like the exercise so we walked the first two days. After logging about 12-15 miles we decided to buy a deuce (bus) pass. The deuce runs every 8 min until 11pm (I think) and then every 18 min. Cost is $3 one way, $7 for 24 hrs and $15 for 3 days. It gets crowded at night, but in the day it is fast and comfortable. Kids: We do not have any, but the Adventure Dome seemed to be a great place for kids. There was a roller coaster, water ride, free falls, and many others. Plenty of activities to keep kids occupied. All day pass was $24.95, with two coupons in the CC book for $4 off. You will receive these books at check in. Anyone worried about kids bothering them, shouldn't worry. We were staying right next to the elevators on the 3rd flr, which has the pool and we never heard any noise. Also, the casino floors are kid free. Check out: Fast and no problems. Left our bags with the bell hop for 4 hours with no issues. Taxi: Cost about $20-$23 from airport. Don't take the tunnel. From the airport, you should probably take paradise rd.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cDirty and cheap!\u201d", "Author": "jenniesarina", "ReviewID": "UR31312819", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for five night swith my husband who attended a conference.

Is it? It depends. The price is okay but in these repressed times, people are finding phenomenal deals for just a little more further down the Strip. To give you one example of how it may not be the good deal you believed it to be, CC has the audacity to charge an extra dollar per day for the telephone that is in your room whether you use it or not (how tacky). Re: Location: not too bad (before the summer heat hits) if you have business at the convention center which is about a 10-15 minute walk away. For overall location, not the best on the Strip since most action is on the other end; Rooms: plain d\u00e9cor, colors dark and drab, room lighting absolutely terrible (they seem to be trying to save money by using very low wattage bulbs), the beds were the absolute worst I ever have slept in here and abroad\u2014they should have been thrown out years ago; service can be poor and management appears to have questionable control over maid service and engineering departments to name two departments. When I first complained, a manager told me they didn\u2019t comp on poor service when it involved amenities\u2014Are you kidding me? If management doesn\u2019t stand behind the hotel and its services, who does? They did comp me in the end, but I had to insist, complain repeatedly, and then only for that night\u2019s room rate (twice). Heck, they should have offered me a free future return or a stay in one of their other hotels for all the grief and discomfort I endured. Slots: I found the $1 slot payouts to be generous when you play 3 at a time, below that forget it; Food: quite mediocre and expensive given what the competition offers. Consider that the Belagio offers a phenomenal buffet for about twice what Circus Circus charges, the service is better, they offer great wines at a slightly extra charge, and if you stay at Circus Circus, I recommend eating at the Subway or McDonald\u2019s located right out front. For breakfast, go to another hotel and get a good meal for a couple dollars more, maybe less; Parking: Free right out back, a very nice amenity. Overall Service: the people who work there are nice enough, it is just that they don\u2019t appear to always have the support or authority to get something done. Layoffs too have left the hotel and its facilities extremely short-staffed leading to some morale problems and serious delays and breakdowns in service. My overall recommendation: If you are a businessperson, professional, traveling without children, or visiting the U.S. for the first time, shop around for other hotel offerings.

We stayed in the Manor Rooms which are not actually in the hotel.They are basically 4 big rather ugly buildings in a car park about 400 yards outside the main hotel.The rooms were fine though not really a 3 person room we`d been promised-2 queen size beds not the 3 singles I`d asked for and so a fold up bed was provided when we complained.The room was over crowded for 3 guys but it didn`t bother us since we weren`t there to spend anything other than the minimum time in the room.

The hotel - yes it is dated, it was built in the 1960's but for somewhere to lay your head and shower after walking all day it was perfect. The hotel is at the end of the strip but it's not to far to walk.... Hotel - Takes about 45 minutes to check in but got upgraded to one of the recently renovated rooms, plasma screnn, pillow top xlarge bed...tidy and very spacious. The hotel casino's do smell of stale smoke but this is only because smoking is allowed in the casino but we had a nonsmoking room and it was fine. The buffet restaurant is a little bit canteen style but is one of the cheapest buffets on the strip - u get what you pay for. Breakfast is $10 and you have unlimited bacon, waffles, pancakes, eggs, bagels, cereal, fruit, yoghurt and fruit juice etc - enough to keep you going for a good few hours. Dinner was ok but the food is very same-y and you get your usual deep fried chicken, beef stew etc. The shops seem to be a little over priced for soft drinks and snacks, there is a supermarket as you come out of the hotel on the left which we didnt find until the last day but it is a lot cheaper and has much more vaiety - think it's where the locals shop! Few things about Vegas, i got some tips from trip advisor which really helped - The DEUCE - it's a big gold double decker bus that runs up and down the strip 24 hours a day and comes along every 5-10 mins in busy times. Worth getting a 3 or 5 day pass as you can get on and off as many times as u like and it does come in handy just to sit down for 5 mins to go to the next hotel! Shopping - we went to the las vegas fashion outlet in Primm - u can get tickets from the top of the fashion show mall - it takes about 45 minutes to get there and goes twice a day. Shops ok there, has a Gap, Timberland etc and the usual bargain shops - things are cheaper there but not as good as the outlet centres i have been to in New York. The Las Vegas outlet (which is where the last stop on the deuce is) is just 5 mins outside of vegas, not great, has converse and a few other shops i have heard of but all the others i had never heard of. Went to Grand Canyon on a bus trip but would advise flying for that bit extra as you have to get on 3 different buses and takes hours!! Was amazing to see the grand canyon though and well worth going. The hotel is a great place to stay if you want to be away from all the noise and hustle and bustle. There are a lot of kids there as there is an indoor theme park and a circus there but we dont have kids and you dont really get invloved in any of it if you are just looking for a cheap place to stay. The pool was fine and had a lovely large warm jacuzzi that is nice to relax in after walking all day. Overall i would definately recommend Vegas and Circus Circus as for what we paid - i could not beleive the value for money and friendly staff.....", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doncaster, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOK - eat elsewhere though.....\u201d", "Author": "summerskaz", "ReviewID": "UR28168506", "Content": "Stayed here a couple of years ago so my review may be a little out of date if things have changed.

The location is ok, at the top end of the strip. We ate in one of the restaurants within the hotel. The food was dire. A 10 year old chicken breast, was like eating string, and when we complained, we were met with abuse and told that we should have sent the food back as soon as it came, but as it was covered in breadcrumbs, one had to bite into it to taste it!!!

The first impression you get when you walk into the lobby to check in is that maybe you've made a mistake. We got checked in fairly late (11pm) and decided to take our bags to the room and explore the casino. When we got to our room we found the toilet was broke and did not flush properly, the faucet in the sink could not be turned off it had a constant flow of water coming out of it and there was still trash in the trashcan in the room. Instead of initially giving us another room they sent a maintenance guy up and he proceeded to tear the toilet apart trying to fix it. I'm not kidding, he had toilet parts all over the bathroom floor, a complete and utter mess. Come to find out the toilet would have to be replaced. We had to call down to the front desk and request another room and an hour later we actually got one. After we got settled into the 2nd room we went down to the casino. We walked around all of 15 or 20 minutes which was all it took. My wife was nervous due to all the seedy gangster like characters that were walking around the casino, we felt completely out of place so we returned back to the room. Needless to say as soon as we got up in the mornin we went down and got a taxi and got the hell out of there and didn't return until late in the evening.

I see a lot of complaints about long check in times. Circus Circus has created a solution to this, you just need to be informed. Circus Circus has created an express check in service. All you have to do is call a number, give them your room preferences and they will put you on the express check in list. I had my wife call and check in while we were driving up to Las Vegas. Upon arrival, we found a check in line with about 50-70 people. We then found a line with 2 people, marked \"Express Check-In\". We saved ourselves at least an hour and were headed to our room within 5 minutes. Believe me, though, we got lots of angry glares from the uninformed travelers who had been waiting in line much longer than us. Our room was on the 33rd floor(we requested to be as high up as possible) and in the corner of the hotel. It was very secluded and quiet. We opted to pay 10 bucks a night extra for an updated room in the West tower. It was very clean(though I will admit I found a hair on two of the three pillows) and comparable to rooms at higher level hotels. Do yourself an enormous favor and pay the extra 10 bucks a night for the updated rooms. If not, at least request to be in a tower. The manor rooms cost as much as the tower that isn't updated, but they will put you in either if you don't specify. After getting settled we decided to get some dinner. The \"Casino Cafe\" that we enjoyed on our last visit now has limited hours and was closed so we tried \"Mexitalia X-Press\". We didn't expect much from it but the Mexican pizza I ordered ended up being pretty good. Prices are about the same as a typical chain restaurant, i.e. Applebees, Chili's, etc. and portions are pretty big. I brought half my pizza back to the room. We relaxed in the room awhile and watched TV on the flat panel before heading down to the casino. We decided to go to \"Slots A' Fun\", which is a casino located on the Circus Circus property that is home to primarily vintage slot machines that still accept pennies, nickels, quarters, etc in lieu of credit. The casino also features 16 oz draft beers and margaritas for $1.25, though my wife said the margaritas had very little alcohol in them. I wanted to try one of their gigantic $1.99 hot dogs from the snack bar but it was cash only. The casino also has a Subway but we were a little turned off to find their prices were literally twice as much as a typical Subway(all of their footlongs were at least $10). We went back to Circus Circus and ate a cheap meal at Mcdonalds, which is located on the Midway level. CONS - The parking garage is ancient and kind of a pain in the neck if the place is crowded. It's also pretty filthy... when we arrived we found a soda bottle filled with urine sitting in front of a parking spot near us. When we left the next day it was still there. Also, we were told at check in that we would have a view of the strip. Instead, we had a view of the Adventure Dome and the manor rooms.

We lost countless quarters to games that did not work. I wish they would replace them or fix them. Two of the major rides in the adventure dome were not operational. The staff manning the rides really needed a cup of coffee or something. They all seemed bored to death and almost bothered to have to operate the ride. The Circus acts are amazing. My son loved them all. The large pool was not operational either. The little pool worked but the larger pool is better. All of the other staff we came into contact with were friendly except security. Our first night the fire alarm went off at 1am. We all got dressed and began to head out of our room when a security guard came by and barked at us to go back to our rooms as it was a false alarm. Everyone (kids) was pretty freaked out by the alarm and to have the guard yell at us like we were fools for leaving our rooms seemed pretty out of line. Last time I stayed here I had issues with security being rude. Seems they need some lessons in customer service. We had several excellent meals with great service at the Garden Grill.

We were supposed to be in town for only a day, but our car had trouble, so we ended up staying longer than the one night we expected. We had so much stuff between the four of us, and with our car in the shop in a strange city, I thought moving to a better hotel would be more of a hassle than just toughing it out. VERY BAD - our non-smoking rooms reeked of cigarette smoke, and the shower curtain in one of the bathrooms was so heavily laden with smoke we had to remove it \u2013 when we did, we noticed heavy black mold under the shower curtain rings \u2013 the ceiling to the bathrooms had mold collecting and the showers were also full of black mold. The fan in the bathroom was broken. When we thought we\u2019d only be there one night, I thought it was something I could live with, but\u2026. The beds were worse than pull-out beds, with metal springs that poked through and hurt my knees and body \u2013 just awful. I had to layer blankets I brought from home on the beds, just to not hurt myself on the springs. There was the smell of vomit in the hallways, and the walls were so thin, we had to turn up our TV to drown out the people next door \u2013 when we turned up our TV to drown out the adjacent room and hallway sounds, security knocked on our door to tell us to turn down our TV! When we ordered pay movies, they would play for about ten minutes, and then the screen turned blue, and that was that. When I called the front desk to report it, we were told to turn the TV off and then try again. When the same thing happened, we ended up double charged for the movies. We were offered a credit for the movies over the phone, but the credit was not reflected on our bill. When I complained about that, the front desk insisted that engineering come to our room to verify the problem before giving credit, and I told them the night they said this to me that it was already too late at night and I was putting my family to bed \u2013 engineering came over anyway at almost midnight. When I complained that we didn\u2019t receive credit back for the movies that went blank, despite engineering at our door, I was asked who told me I would get a credit, and when I couldn\u2019t remember the name, was essentially accused of lying, and treated pretty badly. We had two adjoining rooms, and the hotel applies a $59 deposit to each room for incidentals. When we returned to our room at night after dinner, security was there and locked us out of one room, but not the other, saying we didn\u2019t have anymore credit left on one of the rooms because of the movies that were ordered and calls made, and we had to go to the lobby at 11 PM at night to put down another deposit, even thought the other room still had the full portion of unused credit, and we were never credited back for the movies that didn\u2019t work. When I said we never made calls, I was told they charged a mandatory fee per day for local calls, whether you make calls or not. The next morning, we spent over an hour being passed around to different people, trying to get the movie charges reversed and the problems rectified, and someone eventually, reluctantly gave in. The refrigerator froze our food. The internet is $10 for 15 minutes, and in a hole- in- the-wall room, with a really rude attendant. I went to use the internet there to try and find another place to stay, and a rental car, but after my 15 minutes were over, again thought the hassle of moving would do more harm than good, thinking we would only be there one more night and could get through it. When we needed to rent a car, the Dollar Car Rental at the hotel said they had one car left, which was tiny and with crank down windows, for which they charged us almost $100 per day, and told us there would be both an early return fee if we brought it back early as well as their late return fee! They said if there was any accident that we not only would be responsible for the repairs, but would also have to keep renting the car everyday until it was fixed. Luckily, I only keep that car one day with no accident, and then after using the internet for another $10-15 minutes, found another car from Enterprise \u2013 a real car \u2013 for $30 per day with no early return fee! When we found we had to stay longer until our car was repaired, the front desk wanted to jack up the price to almost double what we had originally paid \u2013 when I went to the supervisor, Manish, he was very nice and agreed to renew our stay at the originally quoted price \u2013 he was the only person at the hotel who seemed to care and was really nice \u2013 everyone else treated us like criminals. We ate at the buffet once \u2013 over $50 for lunch for a family of 4 - while some of the desserts were pretty good and the salad bar was fresh, most of the main dishes were really bad, and I spit out several things into my napkin because they were that awful. They did have a really nice area for the KOA campground folks next to the hotel, which I found while looking to do some laundry. The KOA campground facilities were better than the facilities for regular hotel guests!!! Although I never camped before, I was wishing I was there instead of the actual hotel. Even though the KOA facilities were nice, the laundry room left some of my clothes in worse condition than before I washed them, and I ended up rewashing by hand some of our clothes back at the room. While I am sure the room would be passable for a one night, no expectations stay, there were just too many issues and problems for me to ever recommend the hotel to others, or ever plan on returning again.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "lubbock,tx", "Title": "\u201cImplode it soon!

We went February 9 through the 13th because of it being cheaper than being there the weekend of Valentines Day. We booked this trip on Orbitz and received a really great deal that included airfare and the hotel room at the Circus Circus. We arrived late on the 9th so there was very few people checking in. Our check in was very quick and easy. The man that did the check in for us was friendly and got us booked and to our room in approximately 5 minutes or so. I was very pleased with that after reading prior reviews that made it seem like the check in was a nightmare. The hotel is old and somewhat tired and dirty in places. It definitely could use a lot of cleaning and work to bring it up to par with others in the area. The stores in the hotel are generic with very little selection and high prices. There is a McDonalds and Krispy Kreme Donut shop inside the hotel. The room was in the west tower and we were on the 18th floor. The room was more than perfect, except there are few electrical outlets. This was a hassle because of several things that needed to be plugged in to be charges. Other than the outlet problem, I absolutely could not have been more pleased with the room. The bed was a king size and was oh so comfortable and nice. The TV was a flat screen that was on the wall. The room faced opposite of the strip and faced the adventure dome. Being on the 18th floor, we were above the dome and had a great view of snowy mountains. I loved the view so much and it was a highlight of the trip for me. It was really quiet in the room and in the hall. I only heard another person once the entire trip while in the room. The room and bathroom were extremely clean and had no problems at all. I was happy as could be. Check out was a breeze. It took me less than a couple of minutes to check out. If I ever visit Las Vegas again and I am on a tight budget, I will definitely consider staying at the Circus Circus again. However, one thing that may keep me from staying at this hotel again is the location. It is a pretty good walk to the middle of the strip and on the complete opposite end from the famous Las Vegas sign.

I booked my reservation on their own website and found quite a deal. I booked my stay to check in on 1/23/09 and to check out on 1/25/09. The rate was about 48.00 per night. Whenever I go to Vegas I always look for an in-expensive room rate simply because i hardly spend any time in the room. I like the online reservation system, plus this hotel only asks for the 1st nights room rate to book. When I arrived at Circus Circus I could tell the building was quite old and run down, I parked my car in the parking garage and it was very old, dirty and run down looking. However I could not complain about that simply because I was not paying 5 star hotel rates. I arrived at the hotel about 1:00 and the hotel check in process was a bit slow, there was a long line and only 3 employee's at the front desk. Once I reached the counter the clerk was very friendly. (just as fyi they bill an extra 50.00 once you check in as a security deposit, which they did'nt tell me about, I found out after the fact) I was placed on the 20th floor of the skyrise tower. Circus Circus has a total of about 4 different towers (I dont know how the other towers are) The room was quite a walk from the front desk. When I got to my room I must say for the price that I paid, I was quite impressed, the room was very clean and modern and was not (aged) looking at all. The bathroom was roomy and modern and had plenty of hot water, soap, towels, lotion, and shampoo. The bed was comfortable, and the window had a nice view of the strip. My only complain about the room was the tv, it only gets a few channels, and has poor quality. Be careful with the remote control and dont order any movies by accident, I did and had to pay 21.99 for it and they refused to waive it. As for room service, it is not 24 hours, the room service / food options during late night early mornings is not available. This is a great place for a family getaway, they have an amazing theme park, and nice promenade with stores, shops, etc. and even McDonalds for a quick bite to eat. As for the check out process, I checked out via the television set, which is much better than waiting in line.

That price is basically the price of the Comfort Inn/Motel 6 outside of Las Vegas. So if you book this hotel, don't expect luxury or contemporary decors, so definitely lower your expectations, because after all, they are charging Motel prices. However, from what I understand, the best rooms are the West Tower rooms, as the are renovated. The worst are the Manors. The in-betweens are the Tower Wing and the Skyrise Wing. I stayed at the Skyrise Wing. The casino area: However, the worst part of the hotel is the extremely nasty, dirty, and disgusting casino/gaming area. The air smells like [-], dirt, fried chicken.. just anything you can name. Air conditioning is lacking, and there are smokers everywhere. Carpets are old and dirty. Headroom is low, and just is not a good experience. Anyways, onto pros and cons Pros - Extremely low prices!! This is a +++ - Beds are quite comfortable - Large showers - Decent service/attitude - Great views - Abundant elevators Cons - Kind of away from the strip: it is 10 minutes walk from Wynn, which is the tip of the strip, and 20 minutes walk from Venetian, which is probably the center/center-north of the strip - Disgusting air quality at the casino/gaming area - Overall furnishings are old - Air conditioning in room is very loud - Dirty carpets - Very low headroom, felt cramped - Adventuredome was quite small - Just general small things, like some pictures in hallways falling off, or dents in electrical circuits - Small TV Also, I feel that since most people who stay here are tourists, they are going to visit hotels such as Venetian or MGM Grand. Then, after walking through these ultra-luxurious 5-star hotel and having set a high expectation, and going back to Circus Circus at night.. it is just difficult to get used to. Circus Circus might have been good elsewhere, but in Las Vegas where everywhere is so beautiful/stunning, it is just very difficult to get used to. I would compare this hotel to a Holiday Inn/Holiday Inn Express. Overall, I would not recommend tourists to stay here.

Not to mention the fact that we had to walk outside of the main hotel, across the street (over the river and through the woods) to even get to our room. When my husband, calmly called and spoke to one of the front desk workers, he was told that there was nothing they could do about the room except have someone come and spray it. I was livid!!! I asked them how they could so easily take money from people and put them in these types of rooms? Even if they had given me the room for free, this room would still be totally unacceptable. We contacted the online service through which we booked the room and had them call the front desk. The \"hotel\" (if that's what you want to call it) moved us to another room in a different building (still not in the main hotel, mind you) which was even worse than the first one. Once we were told we would receive our money back, we decided the best thing to do would be to book another room somewhere else.

Having never stayed there before, we were excited for the kids. The Adventuredome, the Midway and the circus acts all seemed like great entertainment for them. The hotel rate was very cheap (little did I know) so I thought we had all of the makings of a perfect fun family getaway. Upon arrival, the driveway area in front of the hotel was a disaster with people, cars and luggage everywhere. There was nobody from the hotel making any effort to keep a flow of traffic, direct cars, anything! After a nearly one hour wait in line to check-in (the lobby was full, and I mean full, of kids and luggage strewn everywhere ... imagine hundreds of families all trying to check-in at once ... where are they all supposed to wait? I literally felt as if I was in a crowded downtown bus station in the middle of a large, metropolitan city), we didn't get a lower floor as we had requested. Even though the reservation was flagged with this note, we got stuck on the 10th floor. Our room was supposed to be a non-smoking room. Even though I guess it technically was (I was told that it was, despite no signage to indicate such), there were cigarette burns on the carpet and edges of the desk. The room smelled horribly of smoke. To move to another room, we would have had to have gone to a much higher floor, so we opted to have housekeeping come and spray the room with deodorizer. When we opened the curtains to look out, the outside of the window was so dirty that we could hardly see anything, near or far. The biggest thing I noticed about the hotel, casino area and men's restrooms was how dirty everything was and all of the trash and debris that was strewn about. There were empty beer bottles, food bags, food remnants, cups and glasses laying everywhere. Trash cans were overflowing, people were throwing their trash on the floor because they couldn't stuff it in the cans, there was garbage stuffed behind gaming machines in the casino area, and the circus seating area was disgusting. I went there to see a performance with my kids and literally stepped in a puddle of beer while wiping ketchup off of the seats! The whole seating area was like this. And the worst part was that it looked like this upon our arrival on Thursday at 2:00pm, and STILL looked this way when we left on Saturday at 3:00pm. Our room service tray, which we received Friday morning at 9:00am, was still in the room Friday evening when we returned, so I set it out in the hallway outside our room. When we left Saturday at 3:00pm, IT WAS STILL THERE! Also, the room service selection is terrible. You can only get real food (breakfast, sandwiches, steaks, desserts) from 6:00am until 12:00 noon (six hours). From 12:00 noon until 6:00am the next morning (eighteen hours), you can only get pizzas from the Pizzeria for room service. Finally, for a hotel that attracts and caters to kids and families, there are no kids channels on the television. No Disney Channel, no Nickelodeon, no Cartoon Network, NOTHING! So if you have kids and plan to spend a little time in the room, don't count on any TV to keep them occupied. The only positive aspect of Circus Circus is the Adventuredome, a five-acre indoor amusement park with rides, games and a huge arcade. It was the main reason we came to Las Vegas and stayed at the Circus Circus. My recommendation: Avoid Circus Circus at all costs. Stay somewhere else and drive to the Adventuredome - you don't have to be a guest to use it and you don't even get a discount for staying there!", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "traveler77California", "ReviewID": "UR23312726", "Content": "We were getting into Vegas late night, so we basically needed a place to sleep.

I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews, but the price simply could not be beat! When we got there, check-in was relatively painless. We did have to wait for a while, even though the line was short. This seems to be typical of Circus Circus \u2013 the Front Desk never seems to have enough people on duty, and although they are quite friendly and pleasant, they are definitely slow. We also had to pay $1 per day for (unlimited) local calls, which was fine as we did not want to use our cell phones and incur roaming charges. We were given a non-smoking room in the Skyrise Tower. The decor was borderline garish and definitely dated, but the room itself was clean and relatively spacious. Can\u2019t say anything better or worse than that. Never had to wait too long for the elevators, and housekeeping was reasonable (they brought us extra pillows superquick when we asked). Given the price we paid, we really weren\u2019t expecting much. As far as location goes, it\u2019s a little far north on the Strip. If you have the time and the inclination, you could definitely walk to the other hotels (e.g., Mirage, Bellagio) to see the attractions. It is a bit of a trek (it\u2019s about 4 miles between Circus Circus and Mandalay Bay, which is the southern-most hotel). A better alternative is to take the Deuce, a double-decker bus that runs up and down the Strip. You can get a 24 hour pass for $5 USD. It comes quite frequently and has numerous stops. The Deuce made it very easy to get around the Strip, and also goes to Fremont Street. If you like shopping, the Fashion Show mall is minutes away from Circus Circus. Lots of shops, and eats, but is a little pricey. If you\u2019re looking for cheap show tickets, there is a \u00bd Price ticket booth in the Food Court. Alternatively, there are some shops beside the Riviera Hotel, e.g. Ross, which has great clothes for less (like a cheaper version of T.J. Maxx or Winners). The last couple of nights, we upgraded to a West Tower Room. They wanted $20/night extra, which was contrary to what the Front Desk staff has told us when we first checked in (she said it was $10/night), but ended up honouring the lower price. The West Tower Rooms are gorgeous ... decor was more modern (and has a flat screen TV), and the room definitely felt newer. Overall, a fairly decent stay. The only negative thing I have to report is the faint smell of booze, cigarettes and/or vomit when you walk through the common areas (e.g., Casino). A turn-off, but we really didn\u2019t spend that much time at the hotel. Next time though, I think I\u2019d prefer to shell out a little more money and stay in a more central location.

On a little more disturbing note we did witness some \u201cnegotiations\u201d for some \u201cpersonal services\u201d. At first it seemed 2 middle aged men were giving 2 women a hard time. It was hard not to notice as the men were very persistent and would not leave the women alone. It then hit us as to what was going on as they all got up and left the area.

We all decided to stay at CC due to a good package deal we found. All of us stayed in four separate Tower rooms that were one floor away from eachother. First, the awful: The main problem... the ELEVATORS! Ugh, it was so frustrating to get to our rooms or downstairs when half of them (not exaggerating) were broken. Several times we had to fold up our stroller and carry it and our baby up or down 7 flights of dumpy emergency stairwells. We were in the newer, nicer wing of the hotel, too! When we all decided to go to their pool with the babies, getting there and back was like being lost in Wonderland with Alice (the dark version, not the cute cartoon version). Before we got into an elevator in their manor-wing (the old dumpy wing), a staff member informed us that half of those elevators were broken, too. He also said that Fire Rescue had to come and save some kids that were trapped in one earlier that day! The heated pool was too cold, and their large jacuzzi was lukwarm, good for the babies. But it was so salty, I dont even want to think about how much pee was in there. There was a bar but it was closed. Alcohol would have helped the situation! On the way back, only two of those elevators were now working!! There was never any room in any of the elevators (think of canned sardines), stuffed full of impatient people (just like the wing by our rooms). So once again we went down yet another emergency stairwell, only to find that it takes you completely outside the hotel, and you have to walk all the way around thier parking garage to get back to the main lobby elevators. Which is really \"fun\" when you're all wet from the pool. UGHHH. The tile floors by all the elevators, and inside them were always sticky disgusting. I dont think that in the four days we stayed that anyone swept or mopped those dirty floors. Gross. Don't eat at Mexitalia Express unless you want a sore stomach after waiting 45 mintues for your \"fast\" overpriced yucky food. You're better off going to the McDonalds inside CC or getting a $2.99 JUMBO hot dog from their snack bar. The casino advertises $3 blackjack tables. Plural. Weds night, there was ONE $3 table, packed full all night. The next two nights, there were zero $3 tables. So we played the $5's instead. There was a pipe problem going on in our bathroom. Off and on, sometimes for hours, we would be treated to a loud whiiiiiiiiiiine from the creaking pipes that you even can hear from outside our room. Our neighbors were like, \"What is that noise?\" Which reminds me of the VERY thin walls. Combine that with hyper kids up past their bedtime that this hotel is full of, BAD thing for your sleep habits. The good: The drink service at the video poker bars is very good. The bartenders only comp wells and beers, and maybe wine, so don't expect a Crown n Coke for free. Just tip a buck or so after each free drink and you get a quick refill every time. The buffet was worth the price, although we liked the breakfast buffet much better than the dinner buffet. They both had a moderate selection. The Steak House was impeccably delicious, but was very expensive. The chef overcooked my $38 petite filet mignon, so I sent it back, and they were very polite about getting me a nice big steak that was done perfectly! Maid service was great. We had rented a crib for our baby, and they even made it up all cute by tucking in her doll under the covers. They mopped the bathroom floors! When I requested extra pillows over the over the phone, they were brought promptly. I feel bad because I realized after we checked out that we forgot to tip them! A few hints: I won't stay here again. I would rather pay $50 per night and stay in a nice hotel. Or even pay the same price and stay in the roach motel that is next door to CC. Its a one-story, without elevators! A few tips if you still want to brave this hotel: I recommend packing some snacks and a cooler with drinks and sandwich fixings for you and your family, and even bringing instant coffee, and some styrofoam cups. There is no coffee maker, microwave, or fridge in the room. Having a cooler was nice for us so we could give the babies milk when they needed it. The tap water is semi-bearable to drink, and gets hot really fast. If you dont have a stroller, then take the stairs, it will save you alot of waiting time....even if you have to walk all the way around the outside of Circus Circus!", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zirndorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cExpensive Youth Hostel\u201d", "Author": "tigAIR38", "ReviewID": "UR22390008", "Content": "My fiance and two of my family members stayed three days over thanksgiving at the Circus Circus. We booked the 4 Queens before and switched to the CC, when they offered a \"pay 2 nights and stay 3\". That way it was pretty cheap (230 Euros for two tower rooms overall). We stayed at the Stratosphere the night before and this was clean and good (review follows). The Circus Circus was neither good nor clean. When we first wanted to check in (4 pm) there was a line of about 100 people. So we turned and came back around 7:30 pm. It was way better now - only about 6 people queuing. Nevertheless it took about ten minutes until it was our turn. The receptionist was friendly, but he didn't know, if any shops are open on Thanksgiving, and he charged us 2 $ for each room. He explained, that this would be for local calls; we told him, that we have cell phones and wouldn't call from our room. Didn't have any effect. Our room was on the 19th floor. From the parking garage (full of honking cars during the whole day) we had to take the elevator one floor down, walk through the crowd in their shopping mile about 100m to another set of elevators. There are four elevators going to our floor, but half of them were out of duty for two days. To make things worse, there are two elevators in front of them, which serve the lower floors. Usually there was a crowd waiting for the first elevators and you couldn't get through to the elevators behind (which we needed). I went to my room to get my laptop and left after about 10 seconds. Nevertheless it took me over ten minutes to get to our car. I heard elevators passing my floor, but never stopping. Our room was the next unpleasant surprise: All lamps and the alarm clock were unplugged, which wouldn't be a problem normally. To plug the clock we had to pull the bed about 50cm from the wall; unfortunately we saw now, that the space there wasn't cleaned for as many years as the hotel is old. Good thing we didn't eat before checking in. Next to the curtains we found a bottle of nail polish, which survived the \"cleaning\" after the residents before moved out. On our floor we had some youth football team (there was some championship going on in town), who held their meetings and apparently their practise (running and jumping) in the hallway. No chance for some quiet time and even walking to the elevators was an enormous task. The rest of the hotel was full with aforementioned youth football teams and tons of families with lots of children. No one looked friendly and most of them seemed to imitate street gangs. As a surplus the casino smelled from cigarettes, cheap booze and in some corners urine; although we came home twice around 5 am we never saw someone cleaning outside the rooms. One elevator had a vomit-smell for three straight days. I guess i covered it all now. This was my fourth trip to Las Vegas and by far the worst hotel; even the now destroyed Stardust was way better.

The bathroom looked as if it had been renovated and was clean, as was the rest of the room. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was big by UK standards. Our only gripe was that there was no tea/coffee making equipment in the room. However that was not really a problem as there was a 24 hour Krispy Kreme concession on the ground floor just across the corridor from our nearest lift, so I could get our morning hot drink there. We had no problems checking in, or out, and didn't have to queue as other people said they did. The breakfast buffet, at $10.49 a head, was good value and the food was fine. We had dinner there too the first night which was very little dearer ($14 I think) - but that wasn't so good. We also had a meal in The Garden Room which was fine and reasonably priced. Circus Circus is huge and it did take us a while to find our way around it - and all the slot machines were a bit of a shock, but no different from any other hotel in Vegas! There is a pool, tho' it takes a bit of finding - again it was fine. The main problem with the hotel is that is is actually quite a long way from the centre of the strip - we were also offered Excalibur, and that would have been a better choice as it's much nearer where all the action is.

Like the previous reviewer I have to say it is a DUMP with a capital \"D\". I paid over the odds for this place as well (I found out that the rates are much much cheaper with lots ot travel packages ...but well you live and learn). So after lining up to check in for at least a half an hour I was given a room in the Skyline Tower that was just awful. I took one look at the bed and went \"no way\". I was able to upgrade - at $10 per night (where was the $5 a night upgrade one reviewer mentioned?)- to a room with a pillow top bed in the West Tower. It still was a very basic room - no door on the wardrobe (which couldnt really be called a wardrobe - just a hanging space - but there was only 5 coat hangers which made things a bit difficult). Very basic bathroom and toiletries very average. Trying to call down to reception was a nightmare - go through the choosing of numbers and then get put on hold for ages. They slug you $1 a day (mandatory) for unlimited local calls (of which I made none) and then the $10 a day for the upgrade. I had a fax come through that I had to pay $5 per page for and then of course there was the $11.95 a day Internet charge. I was not a happy camper at all. On top of all my woes, the walls were so thin I could hear the family next door quite clearly and it was very annoying when they came in late at night and woke me up and then of course they woke me up in the early morning too. After 3 days that family moved out and then even noiser peope moved in. I just HATED being here. The hotel is really too far away from the main hustle and bustle and you really need to take a cab to get anywhere.

We had a re-furbished room, which was very comfortable and very clean (it was very clean the 1st time anyway too) Hotel staff were great, and we always seemed to end up with the nicest (the staff that get the taxi's for you, are these doormen??) We did mile and miles of walking everyday, went to almost every hotel during our stay, saw most of the attractions, and walked to the sign (which seemed a lot closer this tme) An example of how great the staff were, one evening i had a fall in the Hotel room which resulted in me being taken to hospital to hve stitches, but the hotel staff were fab! They sent security to the room first to assess the damage, then the sherrif, the the paramedics. They knew we were messing around in the room, but not once did they judge us, nor did the paramedics. I recieved a letter from the hotel today passing on their best wishes in my recovery. Something i wasnt expecting at all. We flew with Virgin Atlantic, which i had done before, and have never been too keen on them anyway. But out outbound journey was horrendous!!! something you dont want at the start of your holiday. The service was terrible. We were served our 2 bitesize meals, but only once offered beverages after this. On a 10 hour flight i feel this is awful. When my friend found a hostess and asked for beverages he was told he had to wait until they had their break. I understand they need a break, but they were ALL on break at the same time, The hostesses werent even friendly either. Our return journey was much better. I have no other grumble what so ever about this holiday.

There are 2 pools, the one that doesnt have the bar was by far better, much quieter than the other and we walked round to the bar to get a drink in about 1 minute, there is also a nice jacuzzi too. The rooms were spacious, huge bathroom too, really clean too. Very confortable. The hotel itself is absolutely vast, it took us 10 minutes from the front entrance to get to our room, we got offered an upgrade to a west tower room for 5 dollars a night, take it if offered (we wished we had) it will cut your walk to your room in half, and the rooms there have just been re done. Lots of nice places to get something to eat in the hotel too, we ate breakfast everyday in the bagels and barista, lots of choice, cereals, fresh fruit, beautiful bagels and cream cheese (about 10 diffterent kinds of bagels) croissants, muffins ,sandwiches, really fresh. We also ate in the Garden Grill, good steak, italian food at reasonable prices. You can get a pitcher of frozen margarita for 10 dollars here. lovely! If you just want a quick snack, I recommend the Westside Deli, in the casino area where you get a giant footlong hotdog for 2.99. Just outside the hotel there is subway and mcdonalds too. You can catch the Duece bus right outside the hotel too, which will take you up and down the strip all day for 5 dollars, great to hop on and off of. You can also catch the Duece bus right along the other end of the strip to the factory outlets, great bargains there, Timberland, Converse, Adidas, Nike, Osh Kosh etc. Also, catch the Bellagio fountains, Brilliant..

Parking is excellent, valet parking is technically free (although staff work for the tips), staff were helpful and cheerful. There is a large amount of restaurants/bars etc so food is never an issue, aside from the Casino there is a good amusement arcade, regular circus acts, a selection of shops (which are slightly pricey) and the indoor theme park complete with roller coasters, haunted house etc. I can definately reccommend the wedding chapel - a wonderful ceremony, very romantic and professional in a lovely setting. The staff were very friendly although they will try and rip you off shamelessly when it comes to buying photos of the wedding. The price of rooms is also extremely good - ours was around $60 a night inc taxes, which is spectacular value considering we paid double that for a bog standard comfort inn place a few days before. The only issue we had was that the hotel was extremely busy, particularly in the lobby meaning sometimes a 10 minute wait for a lift and long lines at the buffet and you do get pestered slightly walking to the exits by the shop/stall owners trying to sell you things.

For the rest of the stay we were very satisfied. While a 3* hotel the room must of bordered on 4* if it weren't for a few little things. It is a hotel for families and much of the facilities were based on that theme but what we saw of them looked good and quite updated. If you want a romantic break - spend the money and go elsewhere. Like some areas of the hotel, the swimming pool needed some work. While the pools seemed clean the surrounding areas were not very attractive. Perhaps some plants and trees would look nice? At the end of the day, if you make sure you get a refurbished room in the West Tower then it is a quite adequate hotel. The Deuce bus stop is outside and takes you downtown or to the central area of The Strip and the posher hotels.

The Duece basically stops right in front of the Casino. 5. Nice variety of games including slots, poker and gambling available. 6. Loved the half-price ticket booth near the registration desk and the staff there was WONDERFUL! Here are the negatives: 1. The room was cheap because it was part of the \"manor\" rooms, which is 2 blocks _behind_ the casino! 2. The bathroom floor had tiny cuts and lacerations in the linoleum. The wallpaper had some discoloration. The bathtub backed up after being in the shower for more than 5 minutes. 3. Waiting 2 hours in line for registration is outrageous! Registration opened at 3:00 pm and I came back around 5:00pm. Even if I had come back around 10:00 pm, the line was STILL a 2 hour wait! 4. The casino is on the Northern part of the strip. It's so far away from everything else! Since they got rid of the Stardust, there are only 2 casinos nearby - the Riviera (across the street) & Slots o Fun. 5. Getting on the Duece was hellish at times. It was always packed with riders going southbound on the strip. 6. KIDS KIDS EVERYWHERE KIDS!!!!!!!!! They were running around, without parental supervision, acting like hooligans, and no one is around to make sure they are behaving! They have to walk on the casino floor to get to the Midway Area where the circus acts perform. I was hoping to go into a casino to get AWAY from the children! 7. Even though there are 2 pools, trying to get a chair near the pool is impossible. Circus Circus is an older casino and they have tried to make some renovations to update it.

There were cigarette burns on the Bedspread, which you could see was also very old by the visible fading. The first night, we had holes in our Sheets, and the 2nd night, there were tears in our sheets. At least they changed them, but that wasn\u2019t saying much. The TV was very small and only had stations with old episodes of TV shows, no premium TV, unless you paid for it. Even a Motel 6, gives you HBO. Aside from the room issues, about \u00bd the elevators were down which caused people to have to take the stairs down on our last day. We were on floor 16.

David, the clerk that checked us in was very polite, professional and a credit employee. Parking was free and convenient enough for me and my family. The whole concept of this worn out \"theme\" hotel demonstrates what any one that has been to a real circus lately knows. Circus' are not what they use to be and they all about the cash. Let's forget for a moment that this \"theme\" hotel has several casinos in it and that's why people go to Las Vegas. The AdventureDome is not meant for waiting parents or grandparents trying to show their grandchildren a good time. It is meant for buying a well priced \"all-ride\" braclet and letting the kids go crazy. Drop 'em and come back later or check with security for their whereabouts later. The main purpose that families come there is obvious in the name of the facility but do not get your hopes up. What you do want to do is get to the main circus level 1/2 before any shows on the small stage area as fast as you can. The acts come out 1 at a time, last less than 10 minutes then disappear until the next act 1/2 hour later. I guess they do that to have activities all-day long. The seating is horribly small and crowded. The buffet area is very crowded and more like a zoo.

Check in was OK. 2 long queues but about 5 or 6 staff moving people through. In fact the line looked longer than it really was due to the number of people who insisted on queuing up with their whole family. We deliberately booked a room in the main tower for the convenience rather than going for a refurbished room. Room was old, maybe a little tired but large with lots of room to put our luggage and it was clean. The beds were comfortable and the A/C worked well and wasn't too noisy. The bathroom was clean and functioning. The rest of the hotel was busy - extremely so at weekends - and there were a LOT of children, but then we were travelling with our own (14 & 16) so who am I to talk. The entertainment was good when it was there. We tried several times to see the circus acts but it was always too crowded or not on for an hour or something. The one act we did see was brilliant, if short (about 5 mins). Circus Circus is at the older end of the strip near the Sahara and at the moment is surrounded by building sites. In fact to get to any of the other themed hotels at the south end would require a 10 -15 minute walk at least. Given we were there in July it wasn't really walking weather. Unlike some of the hotels at the other end, the links with Circus Circus are not good. It does not link to other hotels and the tram is a long way away. We never managed the bus as we had a hire car and found it easier to drive. All in all a positive experience and a good introduction to Vegas. Would I stay here again? Probably not.

We felt safe and there was a visual presence of security patrolling the area. Check in was fairly quick. I think it is dependent on the time of day, etc. One thing we learned nothing is complimentary, not breakfast, not internet (like $13 a day) and everything on the strip is pricey. There are a number of on site eateries but did not eat at any on the property so can\u2019t comment on food quality. There is a small commissary on the property for getting basic food items and sundries. The Deuce (public transit) bus stop was right out front so that was convenient.

I kid you not it was as if someone bused in a couple hundred babies, elementary aged, middle schooled aged and high school students to this hotel. We checked in around 10pm and we stood in line for about 45 minutes. For someone reason there were only 2 people checking in. There were other people behind the counter but they were just doing their own thing. They did not help to check in even when there was a line of 50 or more people waiting to check in. Finally when it was our turn. The man was very nice. He gave us a map of how to find our room. Boy his explanation - from where our actual room was - is crazy! Room: I am not joking we had to walk 20 minutes from the lobby to our room. We stayed in a Skyrise Room on the 17th floor. Actual room is 1711. Unlike other reviews I have read our room was very nice and we didn't have a problem with our room whatsoever. It was just the jungle of kids and casino and people that work there are are always trying to stop you and offer you free tickets to shows if you go see this resort for 3 hours out of the day. No freakin way will I ever put my family through that crap. Amenities: We never used the Adventure-Dome, We are a child free for the moment. My husband show the price, we read horror stories about staying in the Manor so we figured staying in the Skyrise Tower can't be that bad. We ate at the Pizza place in the hotel twice and we liked it both times. We avoided the buffet because it was always packed. We avoided all of the other eateries in the hotel because they were too over priced. No one was ever in them. Location: It's far from the strip. Which was ok for us. We basically rode the Deuce Bus there is a stop right outside the hotel. We were there for a week. The first 3 days it seemed to be ok to take the bus. It's double decker, and air conditioned. However as time went on and more and more people checked into hotels the bus stops became unbearable. At times we waiting in the hot 110 degree scorching heat for more then a hour and a half I thought we were going to die. At that point there are more then 50 people waiting to go on the bus. When a bus finally shows up it's already packed with people and maybe only 10 people can get on. It's not a fun experience. We did rent a car for 2 days. We traveled to Hover Dam, Red Rock and The Grand Canyon. We got a great deal through American Express only having to pay 22 dollars a day. When we turned that PT Cruiser back in ooh man we made a big mistake. I would recommend you rent a car the whole time you are there. Quirks: The maids didn't speak English. Sometimes when we came back to our room from being out and about the whole day the towels either did not smell clean or they had particles in them like they were not clean. This happened twice. When we arrived to our room. We wanted to test how they cleaned. We dropped something in the corner to see if they would pick it up or if they vacuumed over it. Nope it was never touched. When you sit on the bed you can feel the coils. However after sleeping on it. It was quite comfortable. No complaints. The TV didn't really have too many channels. We basically just watched CNN. Also ENGLISH is not the spoken language here. All throughout the trip we heard more chinese, spanish, french, italian, german and arabic then I've ever heard in my life. A couple of times we wondered where we were. Overall: I would recommend if you don't have kids don't stay here. If you do have kids still don't stay here. If your looking for something within the same price range opt to stay on or near Fremont Street. Fremont Street has the canopy of lights - awesome! It's shaded so you will not be in the hot sun. There is a Starbucks/ w outside sitting area. This area is where the Old School Vegas is. If I ever go back to visit this is where we will more then likely stay.

They definitely smelled and looked new. We were there for a family reunion. A few of the rooms were starting to look worn, mine didn't. It is indeed a shame that some folks feel as though they can treat a hotel room shabbily (I'll bet their homes reflect this too). The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were very nice and very very clean. Some of the family had showers only. Hotel Lobby - Absolutely horrendous. Carpet was so filthy, I did not want to walk on it. Needless to say I quickly passed through when I had to. I guess they could care less as rumor has it, they will be gone within the next 2 years. Taken over by MGM - imploded and something fancier to replace it. They truly need help organizing their check in process. Very long lines. There's got to be a better way. Children - Everywhere. We had no problems with this as we had children for the family reunion also. They wore themselves out in the Adventuredome with the rides and at the Midway playing games and of course, supping at the golden arches. Food - Of course McDs was the most economical and tastes great. The \"Casino Cafe\" had excellent food and outstanding customer service. The \"Buffet\" was edible; however, great customer service.

Not Bad at All!\u201d", "Author": "Sangies", "ReviewID": "UR17863648", "Content": "This was the first time my husband and I were visiting Las Vegas. We stayed at Circus Circus. Getting to and from Circus Circus from McCarron International Airport. There are a number of shuttle buses located on the Westside of baggage claim, outside exits 7 to 13. We opted to use Bell Trans which cost us $11 US each for a return ticket. We made a few stops at other hotels along the way to drop off other travelers but reached hour hotel within a half and hour. I called 5 hours before on the day of our flight back and made a reservation for pick up to return to the airport and the driver was on time. No problems and I recommend the service after talking to other hotel guests who took a taxi which cost them around $30 just to get to the hotel from the airport. And the plus side is the shuttle drops you right off at your airline check in counter. Check In @ Circus Circus There was a long line to check in, we were there at 11am which was early but we were still allowed to check in early. Originally our reservation was for the Skyrise Towers, but I asked if we could upgrade to the West Towers (recently renovated) and it only cost us an extra $10 US a night. Really worth it. The room was nice, the carpet was new, had a king size bed, TV, ironing board, iron, hairdryer, in room safe. Although there was NO refrigerator in the room, there is an ice machine, pop and vending machine right near the elevators. The washroom was nice had marble shower and countertop the only complaint I had was the water pressure was very low. Had good air conditioning in the room. Just buy looking at the hotel and talking to other guests you definitely don\u2019t want to stay in the Manor Suites. They do charge you a $1 a day phone charge for unlimited phone calls even if you don\u2019t\u2019 use the phone. Check out is at 11am and our return flight was at 930pm, so for an extra charge we took the late check out. $25 US for 1pm and $30 for 3pm. We stored our luggage right across from the check in desk at the bell hop for free, so we could spend the afternoon and evening on the strip until we need to be back for our shuttle pick up. Check out was easy and pretty painless. The Hotel The hotel itself was busy, lots of kids but we didn\u2019t mind it. There is a theme park, McDonald\u2019s several stores, Buffet restaurant, a 24 hour caf\u00e9, some free circus shows. The hotel was clean, staff were helpful, and we were pleasantly surprised at the hotel after reading some of the bad reviews. It\u2019s not really that bad. It's what you make of it, and the truth of the matter is you don't stay in your room expect to sleep. There is an information desk and the staff were Tahiti Village shirts. Stay away from them, they are trying to sell you timeshare by offering you free tickets to a show. Opening line to us was \u201c Are you Married? Our response, \u201cYes.\u201d They\u2019re retort, \u201cTo each other?\u201d We kind of got sick of hearing that and it wasn\u2019t just at Circus Circus but at almost all the hotels we walked into. If your looking for discount show tickets there is a legitimate booth on the second floor that sell half price tickets to the various shows. Also if you pick up some coupon books or look online you can find two for one tickets to some shows. Getting Around The best way to get around is using the local bus. It\u2019s called the Deuce which runs up and down the stip. One way is $2 and once you get off then you have to pay another $2 dollars. The best thing to do is to get an all day pass for $5 which is good for a 24 hour period. So we travelled up and down the strip for only $5 dollars, which was great because we could get off at a hotel we wanted to see and then get back on. During the day we did the sightseeing things and then were able to get on the bus to go back to our hotel to shower and freshen up before we headed out for a show or clubbing. It\u2019s a double Decker bus and it\u2019s great to see everything from the second floor. Plus you meet some great people on the bus and some of the bus drivers are so funny. You can even take the bus to Freemont Street were they have a laser and show from 10pm to 1am nightly. We even took the bus to the Premium outlet mall, You take the Deuce towards Freemont street, ask the bus driver which stop to get off on and take the local #108 bus to the mall all on the same bus pass. There is a shuttle that also takes you there for $15 one way but it\u2019s cheaper to use the 24 hour bus pass. Once you are at the mall got to information and get a coupon book for some of the stores, make sure you pick up a map of the mall because there are coupons in there as well. We each bought a bottle of cologne and perfume from Perfumaina and saved $35 Us. We never took a taxi once. There is also a monorail but it\u2019s $15 dollars one way and it only goes to and from certain hotels. Few Tips Buying water is expensive, unless you\u2019re in the hotel gambling then drinks are free. There is a Walgreens within walking distance from CircusCircus. It\u2019s across the street just north of the McDonalds. WATER is cheap there! Sometimes we paid almost $3 US for a small bottle on the strip or from a vending machine. There you can get 1.5 litre for a buck fifty. There is a Travelocity coupon book, I think I got if from the forum shops (http://www.vegas4locals.com/couponforumshops.html) which had a 2 for 1 coupon to the buffet at Planet Hollywood which saves you $26 US. The buffet was pretty good, also tired the MGM buffet which was also quite good. I printed a coupon online for Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. It was a 2 for 1 admission if you went after 7pm. Here\u2019s the link for the coupon. http://www.destinationcoupons.com/nevada/Las_Vegas/Activity_Madame/Coupon.htm) One admission is $25. Good idea to print it off because I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere locally. When we went there was hardly any line up and we had a great time. Make sure you look for the props you can wear next to the wax celebrities, like a robe next to Hugh Hefner, a wedding gown near George Clooney, basket ball with Shaq ect, ect. You can also find $4 dollar off coupons for the museum in the local coupon books. Casino Royal, was great margarita\u2019s for 99 cents all day! Also you can play the Zaltar machine right outside the casino for fee and you get a ticket for $50 free slots. Just north of the Venetian, right across from the Mirage. You can check out this website and print off other coupons that you might use. Nice way to save some money, so you can spend it on other things like shopping!!! (http://vegas4locals.com/coupons.html) And don\u2019t forget your sun screen, it was 45 C / 113 F on July 9th, 2008!!! Hot! Hot! Hot! The water at Walgreen\u2019s and the 99 cent margarita\u2019s at Royal Casino, come in really handy!!

We were in the Skyrise Tower, which wasnt newly renovated, but needs it. Although it was clean, roomy and not too noisy, and thats whats important. Ok, so the decor wasn't great - thats not going to affect my holiday! Although tried the buffet one morning as we were going straight to the pool - never again. Have to admit we never took the Deuce bus, though we seen them all the time. We walked alot and took the occasional taxi. Eat in the other hotels and their buffets - the Wynn for breakfast and Dinner is a must. And if you can eat in Trevi in Caesars and Canaletto in the Venetian - beautiful food and wine!!!

It was a mad house just trying to get into the lobby, where I was greeted by a long line of people waiting to get checked in. Most of the desks were open, but the process was so slow? I\u2019m sure the lines are long at other casino\u2019s so just be ready to stand in a line before you get to kick off your shoes. Our room was pretty spacious and clean, but our comforters had tears in them that were sewed up. You would think that a Vegas casino could afford to donate damaged comforters instead of just repairing them and reusing them. We looked out of our window and we were disappointed as we did not have a view of anything, we were only able to see the run down buildings and roofs that make up Circus Circus, so we kept our curtains closed most of the time. Then we also noticed that we could hear a noise in our room? It sounded like we could hear the elevators, but we were too far from the elevators? I couldn\u2019t figure out what the sound was? I thought it was just some maintenance that could be occurring at that time and didn\u2019t think much of it as we were eager to visit Adventuredome with my son! The place is great for kids as they probably would not get bored as long as they had money in their pockets. We got back into our rooms later in the evening only to find that the \u201celevator\u201d noise could still be heard?!?! We were so tired from traveling and seeing the various sights in Vegas that we just hit the beds and the noise didn\u2019t bother us as my family and myself slept so deep that a fire alarm probably wouldn\u2019t have woken us up. In the morning, I called the front desk to ask about the noise and I was rudely spoken to by a lady who was basically saying I was a liar and had no time for my complaints. I asked if some one could come up to hear the noise and she said that she would call me back. An hour later, no follow up call and no visit from maintenance or front desk? We were eager again to hit the Strip and I didn\u2019t want to deal with another unfriendly person on the phone, so we left for the day. When we got back, no messages on the phone or anything? I guess front desk just blew me off completely? By this time, we were getting used to the noise, I didn\u2019t want to deal with anyone anymore and our \u201cvacation\u201d was almost over, so we decided to just bear with the noise\u2026. We tried the Circus Circus buffet as our stay came with a coupon for a buy one, get one free deal at the buffet. WARNING! ! ! Stay away from the buffet! That buffet was a joke! It was like waiting in line for food at a school cafeteria! We waited in a 30+ minute\u2019s line, paid good money even with a coupon and the buffet could not even be described as a buffet! They had less than 10 items to select from and what entree was available was not that great. I warned you guys! Don\u2019t eat at the Circus Circus buffet! Add a few more bucks and go to a better restaurant! I will admit that Circus Circus Las Vegas is great for families taking their kids along which is the category that I fit in, but I will not stay or eat in Circus Circus Las Vegas again!", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cvery satisfied!\u201d", "Author": "jerjerDublin_Ireland", "ReviewID": "UR17547621", "Content": "We were searching for a decently priced hotel on the strip through Travelocityt and were a bit scared after reading some of the reviews, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by Circus Circus.

The main reason is that those who enjoyed it stayed at the refurbished West Tower while those who crinched and complained are those who stayed at the Main Tower. I am one of those who stayed at the Main Tower. Here are my reviews and I will NEVER go back to Circus Circus Hotel- Main Tower again as it was the WORSE hotel that I have ever stayed. Lighting of hotel- The hotel is unusually dark which creates the errie feeing. In addition, the hotel room lightings is so dark that I could not even have my usual bedtime reading. If I am not wrong, there are only 2 or 3 orange lights in the bedroom. I do not understand the concept of the dark lightings from the main hotel lobby, walkway, corridors and hotel rooms. Is Circus meant to be dark? Noise from Lift- I stayed at room 817 at the main tower which is very close to the lift lobby, On the first evening, my wife and I heard noises. My wife thought it was the roller coaster rides from the adventure dome while I thought it was people pushing heavy trolley from the upper floor. However, it happened again on the second evening stay and we were sure it was not the roller coater rides as the adventure dome closed at 6pm. After much investigations, we realised that the noises arose from the lift moving up and down. It was so noisy that it sounded like a roller coaster rides or noise created by porter pushing heavy trolley constantly. Hotel room stench- The hotel room has a stench which could have been arisen from its outdated, old and dirty looking carpet. Breakfast Buffet Opening Hour- The Cafe opens only at 7am!! Many Guests have to have their breakfast early in order to start their itinerary of the day early. For my case, I had to meet the froup at 0745 hrs and how on earth can I enjoy the most important meal of the day in less than 30 mins. I reach the cafe early at 0645 hrs as advised by the Tour Leader. By the time I reached the Cafe, there was already at least 30 guests in the queue. I started my breakfast at only 0715 hrs by the time I got into the cafe and settled down. I had to rush through the breakfast and meet the group at 0745hrs. The hotel cafe should open at 0600 hrs like what most international do. Safety of Hotel- when I took the lift up to the hotel room, I had a feeling of walking in a maze. As such, I am extrremely apprehensive if there will be a fire breakout as I do not see clear exit signs and route being guided. Worst of all, the corridors of the hotel rooms are dark. Water Taps- The water tap of the bathtub could not be closed completely. This happened to my friends who are staying at other rooms as well. In summary, avoid staying at the Main Tower. Go for the West Tower which has been refurbished.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cI can't beleive I actually stayed here.\u201d", "Author": "krystennicole", "ReviewID": "UR16575058", "Content": "My friend booked this room for our 1st night in Vegas.

When we arrived there was about a 45 minute queue to check in, a lot of the check in desks were closed even though it was the middle of the day. Room was fine (no fridge unfortunately), nice view towards the Strip. On our first morning we went to the front desk around 8am to get directions to the nearest monorail stop, one customer left the counter (of which there were 2 members of staff operating) so I went up to it and waited, waited whilst she continued typing ... for about 5 minutes without any acknowledgement of my waiting, she carried on typing for a few more minutes and then proceeded to ask the other member of staff for a phone number and then dialled it, by this time we gave up and found it ourselves (either the Hilton stop or the Sahara one are about the same distance). Bed was made daily, towels have to be left on the floor or over the bath to be changed, leaving them on the side doesn't work. We had been there a week when one night I took my pill and the next night they were simply gone, we never found them and can only assume that as medicines, hayfever/allergy/painkiller type stuff is all reasonably expensive there was a demand for them. As per our previous experience we didn't bother reporting it! The Adventuredome was good, it is well worth spending the extra on getting a wristband for just under $25 as the rides can be quite costly when paid for seperately. The water ride had been closed a lot of the time but was open on the Friday night we went. The ticket paying machines can be quite good, we won jackpot on a few and returned with quite a lot of toys from the exchange stalls. We didn't get around to eating at The Steakhouse but from what we hear it is very good. Circus Circus is a good base but if I was going back I would be enclined to stay at the other end of The Strip, mayby at Excalibur as it was not much more expensive and you are a lot closer to most things. Lots of machines in the 3 casinos although the juggling 1c slots often provided extra money for the day. If you are going as a couple or family beware of the people stopping you everywhere and I mean everywhere (in casinos, in the street, in the malls etc) offering free show tickets and gambling money etc. Obviously it's a timeshare thing and eventually we gave in a went when we had a free afternoon. It only took 2 hours and they will try to persuade you but some other people had been there for nearly 5 hours. We didn't get around to validating the show tickets and the gambling money is jackpot only promo machines so trying to lose $300 gets a bit boring! If you can find reps (which we did encounter) that will offer you any cash to do what you want with then go with that. Circus Circus was a decent hotel for the money, somewhat dated and from all acounts it will be ripped down in the next couple of years anyway so doubt they will be revamping it. Lots of shops and eateries, the Casino Cafe has very nice food and I think is open 24hrs.

After seeing the pictures of the new rooms we decided to go ahead and save the money and stay here. Check In was fast, if you have their players club you can use the north check in desks--we had no wait at 2pm where the normal lines were huge. We got a room on the 20th floor, walking off the elevators we realized this wasn't the old Circus we had stayed at before, the hallways and carpet were updated with modern colors and artwork. We got to our room and were very surprised at how nice the newly renovated rooms were. Very modern patterns and colors, flat panel TV, dark wood desk, night stands and dresser all with granite tops. There also was a chair and round ottoman. The bed was very comfortable--not too soft but not too hard. The room can be dark or light, whichever you prefer as their are 4 lamps along with the standard room lights. Great upgrade from the old West Tower rooms and a Steal for Avg of $35/night! I would compare these rooms to the rooms at MGM, Planet Hollywood and even the standard Mandalay Bay rooms. I defiantly would say these rooms were much better than the rooms at NY NY, Monte Carlo and Luxor. The bathroom was the same as the old rooms just with updated wall paper and art but still everything was clean and fresh! No problems! As for those who have made complaints on here about the walking distance from the rooms to the casino, obviously you haven't stayed at any other properties on the strip--They ALL are a long walk from the rooms to the casinos. Yes there are more children here than most other strip hotels but really it didn't bother us that much--neither of us like children especially on vacation.

This place has several good restaurants, fast food and amenities perfect for kids. Our son was in heaven with The Midway and Adventuredome, and we had fun too. Regarding our room--after reading a large number of reviews about this place, we decided to book a Tower room.

We waited in line a long time, so our expectations were confirmed.

It had a large flat screen TV, granite tabletops on the furnishings, and a good view of the strip. The beds were extra thick and very comfortable too. Several reviews told of no coffee makers in the rooms. The renovated rooms have them now. The pool was a bit awkward to get to, but the water was warm and towels were provided at no extra charge. We rented a car, which I would recommend. It's pretty cheap if you book online. We did it primarily because we wanted to drive to Valley of Fire State Park. I'm very glad we did that. Only about an hour and a half from Vegas, you can see beautiful red rock formations. Beware getting around some parts of the strip with so much construction going on. As for parking around the hotel, the parking garage is so big, we found that parking outside made it easier for us to find our car! In summary, we loved this place and would love staying here again.

The hotel is on the spare, less fabulous north end of the strip and you'll be doing a lot of walking if you want to see the rest of the glitzier hotels.

In the morning we called to find out about changing rooms. We were told to leave our bags with the bell desk (a $1.00 tip per bag each way,) and they would book our new room while we were out. When we came back later on, we did not have a new room. After waiting in line, the clerk gave us the keys to our \"upgraded\" room, (another re-decorated room right across from the original room from the night before.) No amount of explaining would convince him that we were supposed to be in that type of room to begin with. 1) We stayed one night in a room $10 less than the one we paid for. 2) It cost us $10 in tips to leave our luggage at the bell desk. 3) It was a hassle to get our new room the next day, and the promised upgrade never materialized. The way I figure it, because of the hotel's mistake, it cost me about $20 more to stay there than it should have. I considered asking them to refund me the $10 room difference and the baggage tip cost, but I was on vacation, and I just didn't feel like another hassle, so I walked away from it.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "insomniac06", "ReviewID": "UR15422238", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here as we were on a budget and it was recommended to us by the travel agent. I was panicking about the hotel due to it's reviews here on Trip Advisor. We had paid for a tower room but on checking in, because neither of us had turned 21 yet, they said we could only stay in the manor rooms. This was disappointing as it was across the street and completely separate from the main hotel area. We found the reception staff to be very rude with bad attidude-we still haven't got our money back for having to stay in the manor rooms (we paid extra for a tower room). Our initial impression of the manor room was that it smelt strongly of smoke and we got the feeling that the rooms hadn't been cleaned properly from the previous guests. It is a cheap hotel and of course weren't expecting luxury, but we atleast expected a clean room! A good thing about the room was it's size. It was large and very accomodation for two people. The tv worked well with lots of different channels and the bathroom, luckily, was spotless. Another good thing was that the air conditioning worked well. Our fridge didn't work which was a major inconvience due to the sweltering August weather! We called to address the problem but nothing was ever done about it. There appeared to be a 24 hour security guard at the entrance of the manor room site, I liked this as the area seemed 'out of the way' and not as busy as the hotel area. We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel but I got the impression that it was great for families. There were many different amusement rides, arcades etc which would certainly keep a child entertained for hours! We walked to the center of the strip which took about an hour (this would probably be far shorter if you weren't distracted by all the hotels along the way and stopping for water at every store in sight!) The location is at the north end of the strip, which makes it more seculded than other hotels such as; Mirage, Paris, Bally's etc. I returned to Vegas for my 21st birthday and decided to stay at the New York-this was a much better experience and didn't cost a whole lot extra! I wouldn't stay at the Circus Circus again, I didn't really enjoy myself at the hotel and Vegas has so much more to offer. If you are considering staying here I would recommend to avoid the manor rooms and opt for a tower room, or even better, stay at a hotel with a more central location:)", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis MN", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad, not that great, it was OK\u201d", "Author": "retrofitz", "ReviewID": "UR15368231", "Content": "We stayed at Circus Circus for 2 nights in April 2008 - Me, wife and 2 kids.

They gave us ajoining rooms which was very handy. Check in did have a line, but it went very fast and the desk clerk was very efficient and friendly. We got to the hotel at about 2:30 and expected to wait in line. There are A LOT of kids at Circus Circus, but that is what they cater too. My kids went to the adventure dome twice with all day passes and had a good time both trips. It gave my husband and I a chance to do some gambling. We ate several meals at the Casino Cafe and all of them were actually pretty good. The portions were very generous, and prices about average. The buffet on the other hand was not very good, we found enough to eat (the salads were actually quite good) so we weren't diappointed in our meal, just chose not to eat there again. We went to a show at the stratosphere that included their dinner buffet and that was awful, I mean simply not edible and most of us left there hungry, saying that even though the one at CC wasn't very good, at least we were full. I got a dozen donuts one morning from Krispy Kreme which was an affordable option, and convenient since it was right there in the hotel. The kids also ate at McD's which is also in the hotel. As for the gambling, we didn't do a lot at CC, but did got across the parking lot to Slots of Fun. I like the old type of slots where you put money in, pull the handle, and get money back rather than the kind that spits out slips of paper so slots of fun was more to my liking-and we came out ahead for the trip so who can complain about that. We did get roped into a time share thing upon arriving at CC but they gave us some very nice gifts (adventure dome passes and slot play for dh and I), and really the presentation was very entertaining and our salesman was very laid back and took no for an answer so I guess it was worth a couple hours of our time.

Not a major issue. I did not notice the swarms of kids everyone keeps talking about. Yes, there were children, but its a circus themed casino. You are obviiously going to get kids there.

We were in the hotel at night time, and morning time. All the rest of the time we were off exploring the rest of the strip. The main issue we probably had the the amount of static shocks we got of litterly everything. It got to the point that we were scared to press the button for the lift, as it gave out a proper shock where you could even see a bit of \"lightening\" coming out between the button and your finger whenever it was pressed. We ate at the steakhouse one night, and it is the best steakhouse ever. Definitly give it a try. Ate at the buffett, was a lot more plain, than the other hotels ones, but it was also a lot cheaper, but there was nothing wrong with the food at all.

It was clean and the bathroom was large. This motel is not a fancy as some of the motels on the strip, but if you want to stay in a nice cheaper place and save some money to gamble, this would be the place to stay. The atmosphere is more laid back. There were alot of children running around, but most of them where in and around the Adventuredome area, not the casino part. We ate at the Casino Cafe and had the $11.99 Prime Rib Dinner. It was Great. It was the best meal we had while in Las Vegas. We will be sure to eat there again next time. The hotel is off the strip and you will need to walk to get to the strip and the other attractions, but that wasnt a problem for us. We will plan to stay there again next time we go to Las Vegas. I think everyone complaining about this motel stayed in the Manor Rooms. We were originally booked for the Manor Rooms, but called and got an upgrade for about an extra $17.00 for all three nights. The Hotel was very good about the upgrade. We would suggest seeing the fountain show at the Bellagio, Eating at Margaritaville, the show at Treasure Island and be sure to go to Fremont Street.

My son and I were meeting my parents, and they always stay there out of habit, and it didn't make sense to search for better lodging off the Strip. There are some very good deals at Circus Circus (and it seems all of Las Vegas) on Sunday thru Thursday, but the room rates just soar on weekends. Our visit was from Wednesday thru Saturday. We had a special promotion code for Wednesday and Thursday for $40 per night including tax with some freebies and coupons thrown in. But the rate for Friday night was close to $200! I didn't book that night, and instead reserved a room at the Motel 6 about 3 miles away, but even that was $100/night. As the date of our trip got closer, the room rate for Friday at Circus Circus started to drop, and a few days before leaving, I found a room for $85 including tax on Travelocity, so I snapped it up. We checked in late Wednesday night, and got \"upgraded\" to a newly renovated room in the West Tower. The room was large and bright, with new granite surfaces on the furniture and in the bathroom, and had a big wide-screen TV. The TV remote needed new batteries, so I called housekeeping and they brought me a new remote in about 15 minutes, even though it was past midnight. Because I had two reservations, I had to check out on Friday morning and then check in again on Friday afternoon. I had been told that I could get in line and see if I could keep my room another day, but we were taking a Hoover Dam bus tour, so I didn't have time to wait in line. We left our bags in my parents room, and went off on our day trip. On Friday evening, the check in line was so long that it wound around the corner by some of the concessions. I was fortunate that my parents had a room that I could hang out in, and that my reservation was prepaid. I was able to phone in my check in, and after an hour go wait in the check OUT line (about 15 minutes instead of a couple of hours) and pick up my room key. We were put into the West Tower again, but the room was smaller and dark, and had a regular TV. Even though it was a nonsmoking room on a nonsmoking floor, there was a definite, though not overpowering, odor of cigarette smoke, and a burn hole in the bedspread. However, the bathroom was clean and bright and had a granite counter. And the beds were comfortable. My parents had a very dark room also. If you're traveling by airplane, bring a couple of 100 watt lightbulbs. If you're traveling by car, bring a small desklamp. MIght as well bring a coffee-maker too, as there is no in-room coffee and room service ends at noon. If you are traveling with kids, I definitely recommend trying to get a room in the West Tower (instead of the Main Tower or the Skyrise Tower) because you don't have to walk thru any casinos to get to the Adventuredome (indoor theme park). You just step off the elevator, go around the corner, and you're there. A possible advantage to staying in the Skyrise Tower is that you're closer to the pool, but since the pool closes at 5 PM, we were never able to check it out. I was annoyed by all the nickel&diming with room charges, especially the phone. There was a $1/day phone charge plus it cost 75 cents to dial an 800 number. But they were up front about all these additional charges, and so I had no unexpected charges on my bill. Another annoyance was all the advertising for EZ check out on your room TV, but both times that I tried to use it, the system was unavailable, even though I was trying to use it during the allegedly available hours. In spite of the drawbacks, we enjoyed our stay. My son loved the Adventuredome, 24 hour Krispy Kreme, and the selection of family-oriented pay-per-view movies. I liked being able to return to our room for bathroom breaks and to get more money.", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Havre de Grace, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cOkay for the Price- too many kids though.\u201d", "Author": "Vegasluv110202", "ReviewID": "UR13854706", "Content": "We stayed at Circus Circus Feb 17-21, 2008. Our experience wasn\u2019t a bad one, nor was it an overly great one either. We arrived in Vegas at 10:45pm, after traveling five hours from the east coast. We took the Grey Line shuttle to our hotel, and after hearing some horror stories about the shuttle, we were pleasantly surprised. The other passengers on our shuttle were all headed to hotels on the lower end of the strip as well, so the ride wasn\u2019t too long with dropping others off. I think we made it to Circus in about 25 mins or so, and that was after dropping someone off at the Riviera across the street. When we arrived at Circus, the check in line was long and there were people everywhere in the lobby. The line moved rather quickly and before we knew it, we were up. Our only request at check- in was to get an upgraded/renovated room in one of the towers. The clerk helping us was very nice and was able to accommodate our request, which was in the west tower. We hiked our bags up to the room, and once inside noticed that the temp in the room was 80+ degrees. My husband tried to turn the AC unit on, and it wouldn\u2019t work. We called down to the front desk, and they told us to come back down, and they would reassign us another room, they also apologized profusely. They offered to have a bellman come move our bags, but my husband declined and said we could take care of it on our own. Once back down to the front desk, they assigned us another room (deluxe suite) in the main casino tower on the top floor. The also gave us two comped meal vouchers for the restaurants at Circus. So\u2026.we hiked up to the room and opened the door, and to our surprise the bed wasn\u2019t made. It wasn\u2019t slept in; it was a new pillow top mattress and box spring, which must have just been delivered. So needless to say we called back down to the front desk and they apologized again and told us they would have housekeeping come up to make the bed. I wasn\u2019t angry at this point (almost 1:30am), just overly tired and wanted to get some sleep. The room itself was very nice & huge. It had a king size bed, two marble top night stands with lamps, phone, and digital clock, a 42 inch television in an entertainment armoire (the stations at Circus suck, only about ten stations and three of which are hotel advertisements), a separate area with a desk/chair, loveseat, easy chair, round coffee table, and another marble top table w/lamp. The bathroom area was just inside the door off to the left. It had a foyer area first, where there were luggage racks to place your suitcases, and a coat rack to hang clothes as well. After walking through the foyer area, there was a dressing area with a marble top vanity w/stool, a huge wall mirror, another coat rack, and a safe to put valuables. The bathroom itself came next, and had a marble top sink area, huge mirror, commode, and tub/shower. The bathroom itself was just standard. We were hoping for a Jacuzzi style tub, to no avail. All in all the room was nice and we had an awesome view of the strip, and could see all the way to Mandalay Bay, which was especially nice at night to see all the lights of Vegas. The hotel itself was okay, not the nicest I have ever stayed in, but served its purpose. One complaint would be all the kids, even during the week. This isn\u2019t the hotels fault in any way, especially given the hotel theme. My idea of Vegas is an adult get-away, and next time we will stay somewhere else where there wouldn\u2019t be so many kids for the same price. We spent some time over at the Riviera across the street, and didn\u2019t notice many kids there, if any at all. Circus casino was big, and had many slot machines, and table games, plus a poker room that my husband played in nightly. The dealers at the table games were not the friendliest we\u2019ve ever come across. They appeared tired and grouchy and constantly talked about the foreign non-tippers. We experienced the same thing over at the Riviera as well, but not at any of the other casinos we gambled in, not even in Slots of Fun, which is a small casino owned by Circus. The attitude of the dealers at Circus and Riviera, pretty much turned us off. As far as restaurants at Circus, we were comped two meals and had heard horror stories about the food at Circus with the exception of the steak house, so we decided we would use the comps for breakfast one day at the Buffet and the second day at the Casino Caf\u00e9 because we wanted steak at a restaurant downtown. The buffet was okay- definitely not like the RIO buffet, more like a Golden Corral or Cactus Willy type, but it was breakfast food, and it\u2019s kind of hard to mess that up. They had a pretty good selection of hot foods, but a huge assortment of breads/pastries and fruit. The Casino Caf\u00e9 was good. It had a quiet relaxed atmosphere and big comfy booths. We both ordered the Circus Scramble which was three scrambled eggs with cheese, onions, & peppers and came with hash browns, bacon or sausage, and Texas toast in your choice of white, wheat, or rye. The food was really good, and the presentation on the plate was nice too. The service was very fast and friendly. We would recommend this place for breakfast. I can\u2019t guarantee that it\u2019s the best value for what you get, as it was a little pricey but it was very nice at Circus. All in all, the hotel was a nice place to sleep & shower. I probably wouldn\u2019t stay there again unless for some strange reason I decided to bring my kids to Vegas- which won\u2019t happen for another 10-15 years though.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "allup01", "ReviewID": "UR13748961", "Content": "We have just come back for 13 days in Vegas, the happiest place on earth.

We had been to this hotel before about 10 years ago and I don't think it has been updated since our last stay. This time it was myself, husband and our 13 yr old daughter and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with teens. The hotel lobby and main areas were in decent shape for an older hotel and I didn't notice the smoke in those areas as much as I remembered. The check in was slow and we waited about 30 mins in line, there were 4 or 5 families in front of us when we joined in. Our room was ready early and we were happy about that as our flight got in very early - 8:30 a.m. The room itself was on the 14th floor, down the corrider and one of the last on the hallway. The room: it was a nice size, with a area closet and a decent sized bathroom. The window was large and faced the adventure dome/parking lot. The carpet was worn, the walls were dirty, something of question was splashed on the wall leading to the bathroom. The lighting was dim and two lights weren't working, there was a smell of smoke throughout the room even though we had nonsmoking, the window was dirty and I didn't want to touch the curtains. Bedspreads were old and smelled, I took them off right away, only to find the blankets threadbare and holey!! The bathroom tiles were cracked, the tub dripped and we never had more than lukewarm water, no matter when we took a shower!! The tv offered barely anything in channels. Everything about the room suggested the hotel needs a major make-over. We ended up only sleeping at the hotel as the entire time we were there it was over run with families with many small children (nothing against families) we just found it hard to even walk from the minute you left the elevator as there were children and strollers everywhere! Our hall was over run with people sitting in the hall watching their children run up and down the corridors and we could hear all conversations around from other rooms as the walls/doors seemed very thin. Our daughter found nothing in the Adventure dome or main area of interest, although we did watch a few circus acts and they were ok for free entertainment. We made a huge mistake of eating at the buffet for lunch the first day, they had just changed over to lunch food and nothing we ate was of any flavor or appealing to look at. On our last day we did find the Cafe and were sorry we hadn't found it sooner as it was a nice meal. The servings were large and the food was diner-quality, not over priced and the wait staff quite pleasant.

We did only get two bath towels, which I thought was a little odd since the room can accommodate four guests, but since there were only two of us, it wasn't an issue. We did a lot of walking everyday, and at the end of the days of walking from one end of town to the other, the extra walk to the manor seemed even more daunting, and at times made me wish we would've stayed in one of the towers, but it really wasn't that bad.

I only went because my son had a hockey tournament there, which was something I had to do. I loved the people we went with and the other hockey parents we met there. So, here are the good things about my trip. 1) The fellow parents we traveled with and the ones we met for the first time were great! I loved them. They were nice, friendly, and well organized. 2) The hotel that housed the ice arena the kids played at was great! The staff there was friendly, courteous, and very helpful. The rates there were cheaper than CircusCircus, for rooms and food. Now for the bad points of the trip, which is mostly about CircusCircus. 1) When we arrived, we followed the directions from the hotel. The directions were okay but the hard part was finding the actual hotel check-in. We saw signs for it but when we drove up, it stated that we could not stop there. Very confusing. 2) The line to check-in was horrendous! They only had two employees at registration, and the line was 30 people long. You need to be a saint for that kind of waiting period. 3) Trying to park was just as painful. We had to cross traffic, and there were no stop signs for right-of-way. Five minutes after getting there, we saw our first accident because of the lack of traffic safety. The signs into the parking were not clear nor was anyone really very interested in giving guidance. 4) Four people were staying in the room yet they only supplied us with three towels. When we asked for one more towel, we were told that they could not do that. They had already given us our limit for the day. Gee, I guess someone does not need a shower? We ended up getting one but with a little fight and hesitation. One of the towels in the room already smelled like food. It looked clean but had the smell of sitting in a kitchen for a few days. We also had to ask for toilet paper as well. We had a half a roll on the dispenser, and I guess they thought that was enough for the next three days. 5) I needed internet access, and was told that there was a $50.00 deposit plus a charge of $11.99 for only 24 hours of access. I have no complaint about the access charge but I do have to warn about the deposit fee. There is no hardware in the room, in case of theft or damage. My laptop is wi-fi capable, so there is no problem with cables. When we asked the manager about the deposit fee, she just claimed that all hotels do it but could not explain what the actual charge was for. I think the least she could do was supply a reason for bilking, I mean charging me. 6) There was no microwave in the room, the window wouldn't open, and the a/c took some work to turn on. The room was very stuffy so the a/c was on constantly. I like the cold but it would have been nice to be comfortable rather than cold all the time. We ended up using the express check-out, which wasn't that painful. I would recommend doing that or using the menu function on the tv. The less interaction with the staff the better. In truth, Las Vegas is not a family town. I would not recommend this for anyone with kids under 21. My daughter (10 years old)was reading a marquee about strippers, and what \"activities they\" can do. This was just from the freeway to the hotel. Another person in our group was handed a flier about strippers and prostitues, all with fully exposed pictures of their \"talents\" and where he could find them.

I later came to regret that decision somewhat. The check in process is terrible, with a dimly lit lobby with a unusual position for the check in desks which makes it difficult to find. The lobby looks run down with dirty carpeting and we were already feeling pretty let down. The room that was given to us was in the \"Manor Wing.\" Manor Wing is nothing but a collection of run down rooms with tiny washrooms, and believe me when I tell you they are not worth staying in unless you are really desperate. Moreover, the phone was not working and the room safe (Pay per use) was not working either. We were so tired that we decided to accept it for that night. The next morning, we found that the Manor Wing is quite a walk from the reception and the casino. We were upgraded to a Tower room after complaining about our old room at the reception. That room was quite acceptable, spacious and all things worked for a change. The Adventure Dome, or the kid's area, is quite nice, practically busting with the sheer number of kids and their parents. Our 5 year old enjoyed it a lot and there were a variety of rides to choose from. But make no mistake, the common areas, walkways and lobbies of the hotel and the Adventure Dome are really *packed* at almost all times. It was a major hassle to navigate all the crowd and to get to to my room either from the Adventure Dome or the Casino. It was only at 8 am or earlier, that I found that I could stroll through the hotels lobbies and casino without being caught in a crowd. The location of the hotel is inconvenient, at the end of the strip. It cost us about $12 to get from there to MGM grand or Bellagio by taxi. The shuttle that plies on the strip (Deuce or something like that) is OK, but its timings are unreliable at times. One evening we decided to try it, we were waiting for about an hour. We decided to take a cab, again. The casino was OK for people who do not like to bet a lot. There are even slots that have a bet of 1 cent!! Blackjack table are always packed and difficult to get a spot. The liquor service was indifferent and certainly not fast (but free, nonetheless). I took my action to MGM Grand, where the service was excellent and the dealers were a lot more helpful than that at Circus Circus. And there was space at the tables. In my opinion, Circus Circus is not worth staying in.

And for the price -- $139 -- you can even argue it's a good value, since it's technically on the Strip. I stayed in the Skyrise Tower. The room was small but clean, the decor pretty much a nightmare of pale pink, purple, green and red, with pictures of Cirque de Soleil style harlequins on the walls. The bed was nice and firm -- my back is very particular about mattresses, but I didn't have a problem at all during a four-night stay. The walls were indeed pretty thin -- one night I had a screaming infant next door, but covered it up by leaving the A/C fan on, which was about as loud as sitting in an airplane at 35,000 feet. Room service was fairly uninspired food and overpriced, which is pretty much the case at every hotel on the planet.. The public areas of the hotel are dated and a little dingy, the main casino with circus acts going on overhead simply weird. Didn't check out the pools or eat in the restaurants -- I was working 18 hour days. But this hotel is \"bad\" only in comparison to places like the Venetian or Wynn or Bellagio, which are $400 to $600 a night. Unless you're entertaining clients or honeymooning or on a special trip, why pay the big difference? The major drawback to Circus Circus is if you actually want to walk the strip, one of my favorite activities in Vegas -- the people watching is outstanding. It is WAAAY off on the far northern end of the strip -- they've torn down the Frontier and the Stardust, so all that's immediately south of Circus Circus are construction sites -- you're going to have to trudge two miles south before you see anything interesting, down by Treasure Island, then trudge two miles back when you're done.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gwynedd, North Wales", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than expected!\u201d", "Author": "cymru84", "ReviewID": "UR12654278", "Content": "My girlfriend and I spent a week in Las Vegas in November 2007 and enjoyed every minute of it.

The hotel is one of the largest in Las Vegas as we found out when checking in when we were given a map of how to get to our room which was through 2 casinos, up an escelator and up a lift! The room was comfortable and modern with the air con unit a bit noisy The hotel staff were very friendly and there are plenty of choices of food available. We had an amazing dinner at the award winning stake house and the bagel cafe was our stop for breakfast every morning. There are also plenty of activities on offer at the hotel including the indoor theme park and the circus acts that perform above the casino. We sat down and enjoyed the circus acts once and went on a couple of the rides in the theme park once, and we felt that was enough as we had much more to see in Vegas itself! Parents with children would love the activities on offer of course! It was a 20 - 30 minute walk to the centre of the Strip which we did on numerous occasions but the Deuce was very handy when it got too hot. One complaint we had was about the member of staff that sold trips to the grand canyon, hoover dam etc. We hadn't arranged any tours before arriving in Vegas but had decided that we wanted a helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon as friends had recommended it. But the member of staff was adamant that there was no availability of helicopter tours and only an 8 hour bus tour was possible!! We politely said 'Thanks, but no thanks' and found a booth selling helicopter tours in the centre of the Strip, no problem! Beware!

About a 20 minute walk to the convention center made it a good location for us. Good steakhouse within the hotel. Arcade upstairs and some cheap eats places. Cons: Like many of the Vegas hotels, the distance from the entrance from the strip to your room can be pretty far. It was about a 10 minute walk for us.

With its big top attitude and its indoor amusement park it very well may be. In addition to being the most kid friendly hotel on the Las Vegas strip Circus Circus Hotel is also the fifth largest hotel in the world. Of course this is at the moment and that is subject to change at any time. The beauty of this particular hotel doesn't lie so much in its size or even the circus like atmosphere. The charm lies in the fact that it was something new and relatively untried along the Vegas strip. Rather than build to suit the gamblers they were hoping to attract, this particular hotel was wise enough to offer something new and untried by appealing to families with children rather than solely to gamblers. The gamble seems to be paying off in a city that is known for both its hits and its misses. Other hotels and casinos are also working to cultivate the family friendly image that Circus Circus has basically proven. Not only did this hotel build The Adventuredome Theme Park they also decided to make accommodations even more family friendly by accommodating RVs at the Circusland RV Park. This offers a great place for families to stay that might not otherwise grace the theme park, hotel, or the casino. Don't forget that there is a casino involved and that is the primary purpose of this gigantic hotel, resort, and theme park. The casino makes the expense of building it all very much worthwhile and brings in big business of its own each and every day. In grand Vegas style there is also the requisite onsite shopping and of course full service of wedding options in addition to a wedding chapel and banquet facilities in which to hold the reception of your dreams. The shopping at Circus Circus offers everything from ultra exclusive boutique shops and salons to stores such as Under $10 and the trading Post, which offers fad jewelry and other kid friendly gifts. This hotel has a somewhat unique concept that sets it apart from the many others along Vegas' strip. If you are traveling to Vegas with the family I very much recommend at least checking them out and comparing prices and packages with the other hotels and resorts in the area. Keep in mind that comps are like money in the bank particularly when they involve food or activities that you were planning to do even without the comps. So you may be able to negotiate a much better deal even if you're paying a couple more dollars a night by having free parking, complimentary meals, or tickets to events, shows, or attractions. Now we're on to my favorite part of the discussion. Dining options. Circus Circus does not disappoint when it comes to offering variety to its guests. In addition to The Steakhouse, there is The Garden Grill, Mexitallia, Pink Pony, Circus Buffet, Pizzeria, Westside Deli, and Barista Caf\u00e9. The food offerings accommodate varying budgets and familial needs by offering some kid friendly dining choices to visitors and guests as well. The good news however is that if these restaurants aren't appealing to you there is another hotel, casino, or restaurant next door that has different fare to offer. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Las Vegas along with the family there are very few hotels that will offer the overall environment of fun and wonder that you will find at Circus Circus. In addition to the wonderful rooms, the great food, the casino, and The Adventuredome Theme Park you will find that the shows here are as kid friendly and entertaining for the entire family as the atmosphere in general. This is a great vacation destination anywhere. Considering the fact that it is in Las Vegas and it is very nearly the perfect vacation retreat for those with children.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cHas Moved Out Of The Hotel - WOW!

Now, the inside has changed not a little but a lot. Currently staying in room 26814 (West Tower) and the room has been completely remodeled. In fact they are remodeling one floor every week from the top floor down (West Tower) They are done modeling from the 19th floor which makes staying between the 19th and the top floor an experience similar to mine. The staff here is super friendly here... although they do try to nickel and dime you. For example, the wireless interent is $12 per 24 hour period (and longer stays are not discounted). The business center charges $10 to print out a boarding pass. There is a $1 per day charge for telephone use (and that is even if you don't use it). The gym fee is $5 per day but again is very nice. In my honest opinion this is to be expected on a budget type property. I am guessing the average stay (ADR) is about $50 per night and with a completely updated room with a 32\" plasma TV, very comfortable bed (its super soft) granite vanity in bathroom, and granite top on very piece of furniture including the desk, TV stand, night stand, and side tables... its really an excellent deal. The carpet is very expensive and has a soft but elegant and stylish circle pattern and in the bathroom there is real tile and even granite walls as the surround in the bathtub.

Since we have 2 small kids, we decided Circus Circus would be a great place to stay for 1 night. The rate was unbelieveable - $39 a night. What could go wrong, right? For starters, it is one of the farthest hotels from the airport. It took us an hour and a half to get down the strip to the hotel. Then, the wait to check in was 40 minutes. You try managing 2 kids under the age of 6 in a crowded hotel lobby for that long. I felt this was unreasonable, especially since I had made my reservations MONTHS in advance! The room was just OK - clean, but very basic. And even though it was a \"non-smoking\" room, it still smelled like smoke. The first thing the kids wanted to do was go to the pool. We went to the pool, and it was filthy. The water was discolored, trash and beer bottles littered the pool decks, and the lifeguards were not enforcing the swimsuits/swim diapers rule (you know, that basic idea that everyone has to be wearing proper swim attire - NOT JUST UNDERWEAR - and that toddlers should be in swim diapers.) We let our kids get in for a few minutes, but they weren't allowed to go under water. I tried to get a beer from the bar, and the female bartender was actually hostile. Mean, even. We finally decided that the pool was just too gross, so we left. We went to dinner at the Circus Circus buffet, assuming there would be some sort of entertainment for the kids. There wasn't. The food was mediocre at best, and it was very crowded. After dinner, we toured the grounds and found out that most of the cool stuff that Circus Circus advertises as being for the kids costs extra. And sometimes significantly extra. If we had bought the day passes to the \"indoor amusement park\", it would have cost our family more than our room! There were free circus acts every half hour, but there was very little seating and the crowds were huge. Most of the other attractions were rides and games that aslo cost extra. The next morning, we looked outside the window and saw that - surprise! - the pool area was closed and roped off with bright yellow hazard tape! UGH! Then the video check-out through the TV wasn't working, and the line to check out was huge. We ended up using the key drop box that took us 30 minutes to find. We also couldn't find a bellman or anyone to help with our bags, so we had to schlep them to the car ourselves. I was so disappointed and grossed out by Circus Circus that I wouldn't stay there again even if it were free. The rate is that low for a reason.

My only complaints were that Circus Circus is now somewhat remote with the Westward Ho, Stardust, and Frontier all dirt lots, and the days of cheap eats are definately over on the strip (the breakfast buffet is $9.99). Only the Riviera, Sahara, and Wynn's are relatively close, although you have to walk by vast construction projects to get to most of them. With all the high rise condos, the area is gettting a Honolulu feel. Something to think about is to walk toward the Hilton and using the Route 108 bus to downtown or the Sahara Road east bus to Boulder Highway, change to the 107 and hit Boulder Station, AZ Charlies, and Sams Town. Better meal deals and gambling to boot. Fare is $1.25 one way or $2.50 for an all day non-strip pass. You can use the Sams Town shuttle from the Riv for free, but then you are tied to their timetable. I stay here again, but only as a base to wander the strip, not to game.

The third night the noise got even worse, dragging noises, banging noises in the room above us and dust and ceiling particles falling in our faces and eyes as we layed in bed. So we finally complained and had to be moved to another room at 2 am in the morning. As it turns out they are renovating the entire 27th floor 24 hours a day/around the clock. The work crews were using a machine to grab on to the rug and rip it up from the halls and the rooms. Banging on the floors with hammers and scraping rug off from the floors with hand tools. I went upto the 27th floor and looked and yelled at the workers and asked them what the heck they thought they were doing making all this noise while people were trying to sleep. So after complaining we were moved down 1 floor to the 25th floor directly below our room on the 26th floor, and we could still hear them banging on pipes which travelled down though the walls. So we complained again, and were eventually moved up to the 35th floor (TOP) finally quiet. The worst of it is that travelocity is supose to warn you when there is construction at your hotel. What a joke, travelocity had no clue. What had happened is as the work crews worked from room to room they got closer and closer to our room on the 26th floor and eventually made it to the room over ours on the third night. The stupidity of the management allowing crews to work after midnight while people are trying to sleep is the worst part. And they really did not care, we had to talk to a manger to get anything done because the counter help is nothing but a bunch of polite trained monkeys. Even then we were treated like we were being a pain in the butt. We had to fight with travelocity to get them to get the hotel to Comp us for the two nights our sleep was interupted.

I received an invitation from the hotel for two free nights, so I called reservations since I was planning a trip to Las Vegas anyway. The reservations clerk was very nice and said she was booking me a tower room with a strip view and I should check in at the VIP desk. Sounded great! Particularly since I am definitely not a high roller. When I arrived for my stay, I went to the VIP desk where the clerk was typing. I stood there for three minutes before she even acknowledged my presence, even though I was the only other person in the room. She finished what she was doing, put her papers in an envelope, and then simply said, \"Yes?\" Not a good first impression to say the least. She had my reservation ready, handed me the packet and gave me instructions on getting to my room. I asked about the room key and she said it was in the packet already. It's a LONG walk to the room, but when I got up there, I opened my packet, and, of course, found no room keys. Again, I worked my way back down to the VIP desk where I was greeted with the same \"go away - you're bothering me\" display of attitude. When she finally acknowledged my presence and I told her I had no key to my room, her response was, \"are you sure?\" I didn't even respond, just gave her the packet she had given me. She then printed up two keys and said she didn't know how that could happen. No apology for my inconvenience, she just went back to her duties. When I finally got into my room, the smell was really bad. It was a stale or musty smell. When I opened the drapes, the strip view I was told would be booked was non-existant. I had not brought in my luggage at that point, but decided to take a shower and a short nap. The bed was like sleeping on straw, it was squeaky and terribly uncomfortable. I had some friends staying at another hotel and they invited me to come bunk with them for the night, which I did with great pleasure. When I came back the next afternoon, I noted a security guard and a man in the hallway near my room. I said hello and started to put my key in the door when the guard asked me if that was my room. He took my identification and verified with the front desk that it was my room. SURPRISE! I was informed that the man standing outside my room had actually spent the night in my room and that his personal belongings and luggage were still in there. I thought, \"no way - I showered in there and the bed was messed up, why would his things be in there?\" He told me that he had checked in around 9 p.m. the night before and was very tired when he got to the room. Yes, he noticed the bathroom had been used and that one of the beds had not been made, but he was tired and there were other towels and the other bed had not been slept in, so he used it. He thought housekeeping just had not gotten to the room. At some point the next day while he was out, the hotel discovered their mistake and disabled his key. He was waiting in the hallway for several hours for me to return so he could gain access to his belongings. Security would not let him in without my permission since the room was originally booked to me. My key had been disabled also, so the guard let him in with my permission and he rapidly gathered his things and left. I decided that I would do likewise. When I went to check out at the VIP desk, the young lady said there was no one there I could talk to at that time, but she would gladly give me a comment card. I was waiting for the valet to bring my car and running my experience through my mind when I noticed a car pull up a short distance from me and turned over to a man who was waiting. Bells went off in my head and I yelled to the valet as the car started to move, telling him I thought it was my vehicle (rental). He started yelling. \"Sir, sir\" as the car slowly began to pull away and the man stopped. The valet asked my name, checked his ticket, and apologized profusely as he had just given my car to someone else. Not only did Circus Circus put somebody else in my hotel room for the night, they were going to give my car away also. Too many other hotels in Vegas for me to stick around and see what else was going to happen. I did receive an apology from management at the hotel, subsequent to filing a complaint, offering me complimentary accommodations in the future, but doubt that I will take them up on it.

The smell of the room was a bit musty (smelled like old cigarettes), but not overpowering. The casino did smell heavily of cheap air freshner though, which was very unpleasant at times, so we tended to avoid walking though or going to the casino there. On the one night we did though, the drinks service by the slots was quick and efficient (obviously with tipping), so no complaints there! Check in and out was pretty fast. I paid the $1 per day phone fee in advance and didn't hand over my credit card details so didn't use the TV in room check-out service. As mentioned, we didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel or casino, just used it as a base to explore Las Vegas and the other casinos, so we didn't eat there (unless you count Krispy Kremes) or use the pool facilities. The Deuce bus stop is right outside (but is very busy) and it's a shortish walk to either the Sahara or Hilton for the Monorail. I'd recommend using the Sahara monorail stop as the walk back feels a little safer. The Sahara itself is also a pretty good value casino, with Blackjack and Poker tables with cheaper minimum bets than other more modern casinos. If you are looking for somewhere just to sleep and use as a base to explore then Circus Circus is good value.

I made our reservations before reading the comments and they really worried me. I almost called to book another more expensive hotel and I have to say, I'm so glad I didn't! I'm not sure what these other people are talking about, but we had a great time. We stayed in the Main Tower which was fine. Our room was large and had an aweful view of a wall out one window and the construction out the other but we weren't there to sit and look out the window all day. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and really low to the ground. They were spring mattresses and you felt every single one of them when you woke up the next morning in desperate need of a massage. The tv had very few channels anyone would want to watch, alot of them were circus circus channels that were stupid, but again...we weren't there to watch tv either. I do agree with the cigarette smells...they did bother me but I'm allergic to cig. smoke so I'm more sensitive than most. I noticed that other, newer (and nicer) hotels didn't have the stench that Circus Circus has. By now you're probably wondering why I said I'm glad we stayed because everything I wrote so far has been negative. The reason I'm glad we stayed can be summed up in two words...our kids. They were beside themselves with glee with all the fun stuff to do. The circus acts are really top-notch and are FREE! The only drawback is that they are so short...we wanted more! The adventure dome was where the kids had the most fun. They stayed in there for quite a while and played to their heart's content. So, if you have children, they will love this hotel. I have children ranging from 7 to 15 and they all were able to have fun. With that being said, if it were just me and my husband, I would never stay here. The drawbacks are many...it's miles away from the strip action with huge vacant lots on either side. There are children running around everywhere...duh! But, even though I'm a mom, I still hate parents who don't control their children. And Vegas seems to attract these types of parents by the droves. They bump into you without so much as an apology, they cut in front of you...it's ridiculous. Our entire stay at Circus Circus, I never met one staff person (including telephone reservationists) who was nice, helpful or basically in a good mood. They all seem to hate their job and you are their casualty should you have the misfortune of needing their assistance. We found the check-in line to be short. But, we were informed ahead of time to call the pre-register number which is supposed to make your wait much shorter. We also realized that there is a reason that your room is so cheap...if you want to do anything other than walk through their corridors, it costs you money. They even charge for drinks in the casinos. Actually, I take that back...the circus acts were free which was nice. We ate in the Casino Cafe and were pleasantly surprised that the food was actually pretty good. The prime rib was tasty and reasonably priced. The wait staff isn't all that great, especially the hostess trying to seat everyone. The Mexitalli Grill was okay...a bit overpriced for the quality but not too bad.

The room and bathroom were clean - and that's the only positive thing I can say about Circus Circus. The room smelled like extremely stale cigarrette smoke - so much, in fact, that I got a headache. The tub is so small that your shoulders are almost touching the wall and the shower curtain. The beds are hard and the WINDOWS are so dirty that you can barely see out of them at night (it's not really a problem during the day though). The TV is TINY and the channel selection is even smaller. I don't think they even had basic cable - just the network channels and 2 or 3 hotel channels.

They have express check out on your room TV which you can access by pressing menu...unfortunately, my remote control didn't work, so I wasn't able to use that option. The hallways were clean, but there was a panel missing from the ceiling in front of my room. And to top it all off...the vending machine took our $2, but didn't give us a drink. We ended up taking all of our stuff to our parents' suite in Tahiti Village the next day. We didn't go back to Circus Circus until the last day of our trip and that's ONLY because check out at the other hotel was at 10am and our flight was at midnight, so we had half a day to kill. Would I ever recommend Circus Circus? I guess it depends on what you're going to Vegas for.

We checked in on Sunday afternoon. You stand in a Disney-ride like queue, ropes and bars, to check in. We were a bit unnerved, we'd reserved adjoining rooms, and they said \"As long as the rooms are both on the same floor...\" Some checking, they found adjoining. Whew. From there, the you get the who pays for it thing kicked in. We live in Vegas, and took the kids for a birthday extravaganza at the Adventuredome, so we figured we'd spend the night. We've been (of course) to CC to see the midway and eat at the steak house (VERY expensive, but VERY VERY worth it - best in town) and what-not, but never to spend the night. As we walked through the casino to the main tower (they have a new tower, main tower, the manor, and an RV park), we found ourselves being bumped, pushed, cut off, etc, by the lowest of low class people. Wouldn't be surprised if they flew into Vegas with live, carry-on chickens. Took the creaky elevator to our upper floor, and found two standard, Motel 5 1/2 rooms. Ours was dirty, the kids' was OK. The mattresses were the second worst I've ever seen. The wire springs were covered by the decorative fabric only - no padding at all. The TV is completely locked out - it was a reasonable one, with HD inputs and component inputs on the front, but no way to access the inputs to hook up a portable DVD player. If you're watching free movies in room, you aren't buying, gambling, or visiting the midway. There are also no kid's channels. Only PBS. No Disney, no Nick, no Cartoon Network. If the kids are watching free TV, they aren't buying a movie, or visiting the midway. We headed down to the pool - down the elevator, through the casino, up the escalator, past the adventure dome, shops, restaurants, etc, to the second casino, across a walkway, up an elevator, through the manor rooms, down an elevator, to a very full, very sweaty pool. Pool towels are provided there, two lifeguards. Two pools, a big one and one about 3/4 the size, and two jacuzzis, a big one and a very small one. Snack bar, bar bar, and lockers. Can't comment on the prices, but imagine they were up there, as was everything else. After, we went back, showered, headed down to eat. 20 years ago, the buffet at CC was 2.99, and clearly overpriced. Now, it's 12.99, and would still be overpriced at 2.99. No drinks service beyond \"Go over there and get a drink\" (but a good selection of sodas, juices, coffees), lots of fried food, and shrimp that hasn't been \"de-veined\". Doesn't even have chocolate syrup to put on your ice cream for desert. Tables scattered haphazzardly, with no set real set walkways inside the perimeter. Much more bumping. The midway is OK. It is actually acceptable as a destination. Lots of rip-off carnival games for a dollar each. Softball into the milk can, basketball into a hoop 1\" bigger, those types of games. But still fun. They have cheesy circus acts 2x an hour (think every 55 minutes), but we passed two hours time with the very little ones while the bigger ones were on their own at the Adventuredome for $40. Not too bad. The Adventuredome is a \"theme park\" under a dome. The rides are tiny, and it consists of mostly arcades and midway games. The wrist bands are $24.95 per person, find a two-fer coupon if you can, or the casino gives a \"fun book\" with a $4 off coupon. The older kids had a lot of fun, played for hours on their wrist bands and $20 each. Check out is easy - the same little box that locks out the inputs is the movie/pay per view/view your account box. You can check out on on TV, which I would, because the same way check-in is set up with the ropes, so goes check out. And the line is even longer. Probably to find out why they were charged for local calls. As it turns out, there is a $1 surcharge, per day, for the honor of having a phone in your room, which isn't included, mentioned, or billed when you check in, so you have that last extra charge. So, all in all, our impression is you don't even really get what you pay for at $90/room/night and $15 for a buffet.

The nights spent at Circus Circus were free due to Tahiti Village's promotion of the mini vacation if you completed their time-share presentation. Circus Circus was extremely crowded. Lots of children, to be expected due to the theme of this hotel. Our room was located in the back tower which took us no less than 20 minutes to walk to from the lobby. The tram from the back tower is broken down (apparently for years now), so we had no choice but to walk through their entire hotel every time we wanted to go out. The water in the tub would not turn completely off, it ran constantly. The electric plug-in located in the bathroom sparked every time I plugged in my curling iron. The air conditioner was so loud that it was hard to sleep. I could go on, but i'll just sum it up saying this is one hotel we will never go back to, even on a free nights stay! We were very unhappy with our entire stay there. I will add one nice thing about the hotel, the circus act that they have is entertaining & free to watch. The buffett was average. Adding a note about the New York New York. Fabulous hotel. Great service, easy to get around, great restaurants, nice casino.

I didn't like the casino purely because it holds a lot of entertainment for children and not as much for adults. So if you're on holiday with the kids it may be an ok choice for you as Las Vegas doesn't really cater for children.

Still, I would have hated to pay more for a room, since I really did not like Las Vegas. I have nothing to complain about when it comes to Circus Circus. We did not have any problems, rooms were clean, staff nice, pools fine, etc. We did not have a car, took the bus a few times, but ended up walking back and forth more or less everyday and night. It was not very far and felt safe, even for a single mother and her son.

My husband and i booked this trip through a time share deal that he \"won\" on the radio. None the less, the accomadations were free and so off we went. We checked in late Thursday night (7/12) around 11:00PM. There were a few people in line, but there were also many people working the front desk check-in. It only took about 15 minutes or so to make it to the counter. While we were checking in, we were assigned a smoking room and i asked the gentleman at the counter just to verify that the room was non-smoking. He said it wasn't and without question, he put us in a different room. While he was booking the new room, someone else that was checking in booked the room first, so he then upgraded us to a suite on the 8th floor. I said great. Then i thought again and asked if the elevators were pretty quick-and he nodded and answered fairly quick. I was a little worried, but thought that a higher room might be more quiet. After check-in was complete, we were given directions to the correct elevator from parking garage #1 and went in search. After about 20 minutes, a couple trips up and down the elevator and once down the escalator, we finally found the elevator, not because the directions were wrong, but because it was definitely a little confusing with so many people walking around at midnight and so many different places to go. (You see, only level 3 has a walkway that takes you to the main building and then you have to take an escalator down to the casino floor.) But once we found the correct elevators, we went up to the 8th floor, all the way to the end of the hall and opened the door to a very spacious room. Very nice view of the Stratosphere at night. My true test of a hotel room is how comfy is the bed--and i must admit, we actually flipped the covers up at the end of the stay to see who made the mattress because it was more comfy than the one we sleep on at home. Since we hadn't eaten all night, we went in search of something to eat. Not being too familiar with the place and being that it was late, we didn't find much open. We saw McDonald's bads that people were carrying around, so we asked a family where they got it, and they said upstairs in the arcade but they thought that it was closed by now. So, we settled on some premade sandwiches from one of the convenience shops next to the main elevator-to our surprise, they were very good and big. Later in the stay, we did find a 24 hour cafe further down, but we never got to try it. The next morning, we woke up early for a morning tee time and joked that we should leave ourselves plenty of time just to find our way out to the parking garage to find the the car. But i must admit that after parking your car in the parking garage once, you get used to finding it and it isn't really a big deal to find it again. Plus, we found a more direct route to the 3rd floor walkway that didn't involve going through the casino. After golf, we returned to the hotel and grabbed a bit to eat at the Mexican place. Although we didn't have the Mexican food served in there, we did order the Meatball sub and Sausage and Pepper sub and found it to be a good size portion and very good. We also got the $3.00 margarita special which was very good. The food was a little pricy,b ut i guess that is what you get for convenience. After lunch, we finally started to drop a couple dollars into the casino. My game of choice is Blackjack and my husband's is Let It Ride. I plopped down at the Wheel of Madness Blackjack Table for about 2 hours and had fun with the other gamblers. We are not real high dollar gamblers, more just the type looking to put down $100 a day and try to win some back, if not, at least sit there for awhile. The table was a minimum of $5 which was just fine, I didn't really win anything, didn't really lose anything either. My husband, on the other hand, did much better than I. But, I have to admit, the cocktail service was rather slow. Think i only had 3 beers in 2 hours. The pattern for us stayed the same the next couple of days. Golf in the morning, gambling in the afternoon and eating at night. It involved us moving our car numerous times a day, and although it might have taken at times up to 20 minutes to find a parking spot, i don't think it was unreasonable. Only once did we have to park in the second parking garage and walk a longer distance. The night before we were checking out, we walked up to our room and our room key didn't work. Probably because it was demagnetised by my husband's phone...but a quick note-we were told to stand in the check out line, where there wasn't a single person and we would be next to be called and with a photo id, we could get another one. And that we did. When we got back to the room, the key worked fine and we started to pack. I then thought about checking out in the morning and trying to make our early tee time on time. I had my husband call down to the front desk and ask about check-out. They told us we could do an express check-out, which means leave a major credit card at the desk and just call down in the morning when you were leaving. Because we didn't have to pay for the room, i wasn't sure why we would have a bill, but it turns out that they charge a phone fee of $1 a day whether you use it or not. So, after our $3 was charged to the card, we called down just before lugging the last bag out the door we called down to the front desk to tell them that we were leaving and they said ok and our tv went off. They must have cut the power to the room somehow, but no worries, because we really were done and out the door. Overall, the entire stay at Circus Circus was enjoyable. Like i said, i was a little worried after reading some of the reviews online, i don't think i could really say anything bad other than i was really thirsty while gambling. The elevators all worked prompt, the room was clean and large, the casino didn't really smell like smoke (compared to others we were in), the parking situation was busy, but you have to expect that if you drive a car anywhere on the strip, the circus act was neat to watch at least once, the location is fine if you have a car (a little far away if you are walking, but not impossible) We didn't visit the pools or the adventure dome-although it looked pretty cool. The staff was very friendly, including the dealers. Of course, there were a lot of kids around the hotel-you are staying in a casino designed for family, but if you don't mind kids, you won't think twice. The kids really weren't in the casino area, and the one time we were walking throught the casino we did hear a security guard tell one family that the kids cannot be standing there-the family had a fit, but he was only doing his job. If you are staying at Circus Circus, don't expect the high end amenities you would receive at Caesars or the Wynn, but for the money (i understand it is pretty reasonable), i would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Our time in Vegas was short, but we will definitely be back again.

We e-mailed the hotel and got our rooms booked ( four in all, for various members of the clan) We had our flights via Airtours - as they are direct to Vegas - but others came a variety of routes with varying changes. We picked up a hire car at McCaran - or, rather, at their hire car facility about a mile away.

We stayed Sunday - Thursday. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I was aware that there may be some problems, but because this place seemed like it is offered the most activities for children, I thought I would take a chance. Before booking a room, I read the reviews on Trip Advisor, and decided the best place to stay was in one of the tower rooms, so when booking online, I went directly to the hotel's website and booked a room in the main tower versus the manor rooms. Before our flight took off, I called the motel and spoke with someone at guest services to tell them that we would be arriving late - 7 pm, and didn't want to lose our room in the main tower. They assured me that 7 pm was not too late and there would be no problems. When we arrived at the motel, we parked in the garage next to the main tower, unpacked our car and made our way to the check in. We were ready for the long lines that we read about. It took 20 minutes to get to the front which I didn't think was too bad. Our person was friendly and seemed very fast, but THEN, he proceeded to give us directions to the Manor rooms! which as you may or may not be aware of are outside of the hotel and more like driving distance away. He proceeded to tell me that management needed to upgrade and downgrade other people's room, and that there were no other rooms left. After showing him my confirmation of a room in the main tower, telling him about the earlier phone call guaranteeing my room, and knowing how cheap the manor rooms are compared to the tower rooms, he discounted my room $30 and threw in some extra coupon booklets. I then insisted on a room in the main tower room for the rest of my stay, and he put a room on hold for me but told me to call the next day by noon. So off to the manor room, we went. Returning to the car, repacking all the luggage, etc. and driving there. My suggestion would be not to unload your car until after you know where you will be staying. The only nice things about the manor room were that we were able to park our car next to the front door and there was a refrigerator in the room. It smelled musty and just looked uncleaned. Other people's reviews about the noise air conditioners and thin walls were right, which made it difficult for sleeping. The next day we packed up our stuff and stopped at the information desk early in the morning to check on our new room as we were going to the Grand Canyon and would be gone all day. I was told that it was too early to get keys but there was a room in the main tower on hold for us. So we headed on our trip. On the way back, I decided to call and check on our room as it was going to be at least 9 pm before we returned. We were told that we were still in the manor! I insisted on speaking to someone else, and they said we would have a room in the main tower but not the one previously assigned. When we arrived at the hotel, we left our luggage in the car and went to check on where would be staying this time. We were given a room in the main tower, but before we made our way out of the motel, we were tracked down by the hotel clerk and said that there was something wrong with the room and needed to change our room again. FINALLY, we arrived in our new room. What a difference! The room was clean, nice view of downtown and a short elevator ride to the Adventuredome, shops, midway games, etc. The room didn't have a refrigerator which wasn't a problem for us, and it was much quieter. The rest of our stay was pleasant. The kids had fun. They enjoyed the game area over the main casino more, and it is next to a McDonalds and the Circus Acts. We ate twice for dinner at the Buffet, food was OK, but don't be surprised that you have to wait to get a table when half the place is empty. They insist on seating you. We tried to use the express checkout on the TV, but it didn't work, so called and had no problems. Overall, 3 out of 4 days were good. Would we stay here again?

It was great because my daughter is vehemently opposed to smoking rooms and our whole tower was in a \"green\" or no smoking zone. You could smoke in the small casino in our tower near the elevators, but that was it. All the hallways, walkways, shops and restaurants were all non-smoking. Upon check-in, we encountered a problem, but it turned out for the better. We had originally reserved rooms in the West Tower because it was near the Midway, which we thought we would be frequenting with our children. When we were given our rooms however, they were in the Skyrise Tower. At first we were quite upset with the arrangement until we found out that the Skyrise Tower was right next to the Adventuredome, and as I said before, we were in the non-smoking section of the hotel. The rooms were very clean and very large! One party in our entourage had 6 suitcases and they were able to live comfortably in the room. There is a parking structure for this end of the hotel and if you park on the 3rd level, you walk straight into the casino area, which is right around the wall to the elevators. Very convenient for transporting luggage without having to use the valet. You still have to check-in at the main lobby near the West Tower, but check-out can be done on the TV in your room. Our rooms were also very convenient to the Adventuredome. We spent an entire day there, and it was so easy to return to the room to change after riding the Rim Runner, which gets you pretty wet. It's incredible that they have a full-on roller coaster there also! The children in our group, ages 3-11 all had things to do and rides to ride. For lunch we ate foot-long hotdogs from a place one floor down from the Adventuredome that was at a very good price. There are other pretty good places to eat near the Skyrise Towers. We ate a nice meal at the Garden Grill which was right next to the lobby of our tower, and also tried the Mexitalia restaurant located right next to that. The food at both places was decent. The Garden Grill is a sit-down, waitress served meal, while the Mexitalia is more of a fast food type where you order your meal at the counter and they call your number when it's ready. Our room had an old air conditioning unit which was quite loud and not very efficient at cooling our room. When I checked out the rooms of the other members of our party, I saw they had newer units which were a lot quieter and made the room a lot cooler. That was a minor problem though, and the room got cool enough for us. We just turned it off at night because it was noisy and we didn't need it, but I can see how that would be a big problem when the temps hit 100\u00b0+ in the summer. I'm sure the staff would have seen to it promptly had I complained because everybody was very friendly and courteous from the valet to the front desk to the waitresses to the maid.

This was our fourth visit to Las Vegas and the fourth time we have stayed at this hotel. Our check-in was a breeze as there was no queue at all so we got to our rooms in double quick time. On this occasion we were given two rooms in the Skyrise tower on the third floor which proved to be a little bit of a disappointment. Because we were on a low floor we had absolutely no view from our windows. We were looking back at the roof of the Adventuredome. On our previous trips we had rooms high up in the West tower overlooking the strip. That said, our room was as usual very spacious with kingsize bed which was very comfortable. The air conditioning unit looked fairly new and was very powerful (compared with our previous rooms). The bathroom or rather shower room as there was no bath was again spacious with a giant shower cubicle. The shower was hot and the water powerful and we were supplied with clean fresh towels plus new toiletries every day. Our room was clean and tidy and at the end of the day it's simply somewhere to get your head down after a hectic day and night on the strip. Being on the third floor had a plus point as it was the main corridor to the swimming pool. On the downside it was very noisy with everybody passing your door to get too the pool. The weekend we arrived was the memorial day holiday and the hotel was packed with families. It did become a bit of a chore trying to get from one end of the hotel to the other. By Tuesday the hotel had quietened down a bit. Yes, the Circus Circus is a family orientated hotel hence the Adventuredome at the back and the circus acts, yes there are lots of kids but if you can live with that it's ok. Again as mentioned before, the hotel is located at the North end of the strip but it's still not too far away from the main attractions. There is also a plus point to being at the North end is that the bus the \"deuce\" when it comes along is invariably empty. It soons fills up as it works it's way along the strip. The bus stop is right outside the hotel. Tip - do buy a 24 hour pass for $5, great value. We had breakfast each morning in the casino cafe which was very tasty and good value for money. The only \"duff\" place to eat in the hotel is the buffet. THE Steak house is an absolute must. The Circus Circus casino is one of the cheapest places to gamble on the strip with $3 Blackjack. Although I have gambled in other casino's along the strip, for some reason I have always found the Circus the most fun casino to play in. Here is a tip for Brit's. In England I was getting $1.93 to the pound. On the strip at an exchange bureau in the Fashion show mall they were offering $2.07 (as of 30th May). Las Vegas is a crazy town and we absolutely love it, don't expect a relaxing holiday here. People say to me that you have to be a gambler to go to sin city, You don't. There is so much to see and do without having to gamble. I have had friends who have come to L.V. and not put a single dime in a slot machine but have still enjoyed themselves with all the other attractions. And don't forget the other great attractions outside of L.V. such as the Hoover dam, Grand canyon, Primm valley and the town of Laughlin just to mention a few. On summing up, the Circus Circus is no Bellagio or Venetian but if you want to spend megabucks on these hotels than go ahead. But if you want to do Las Vegas on a budget and save your money for more fun things then you cant go far wrong with the Circus Circus hotel. We are just looking forward to our next trip. On a final footnote - I had a nice little touch on our first night winning $1,181.00 playing video poker at the sports bar in the main casino plus free beers too. Deep joy! I booked our holiday using Expedia and flying direct with Virgin Atlantic. If I can give any help to anyone just drop me a line.

We thought that given the hotels amenities (pool etc) it was excellent value for being on the strip, it's no Bellagio or Wynn but then you can still spend all your time in the other hotels and casinos and come back to your much cheaper room at Circus Circus. Our room was spacious, comfortable and the bathroom clean and modern, all in all we were very happy until later on the first evening. The room was connected to the next room by a locked interconnecting door and there was a two inch gap at the bottom of the door which meant we could hear everything from the room next door. Both nights our neighbours went out and left the TV on with the volume turned up high. This wasn't a problem until we were trying to get to sleep in the small hours of the morning and had to call security to go in and switch the TV off.

I have to say up front that I enjoyed my stay and would have no problem recommending the hotel to others who wanted a \"Circus Circus\" experience. I had no problems with check in. The desk seemed efficient enough and processed our early check in request with no problems. My room was a west tower room (16839 for those that can decipher those things.) The room itself was dated but comfortable (Still have texture coat ceilings). This particular room had two queen sized beds and overlooked the main big top which encloses the adventuredome. You also have a pool view. The bathroom was sufficient but dark. The shower had no light within it and with the curtain closed was very dark. The decor to the room was utilitarian. A bedside table, a phone and alarm clock bolted to that. A desk and chair. There is a safe in the closet. There is WiFi available through COX for a daily fee. There is no mini bar, but that is generally not critical to me. I did miss not having a phone at the desk. So all in all, the room is OK. Check out was very easy using express check out on through the TV. Here is where my problem is with Circus Circus. If you are not gambling or at adventuredome, there is nothing to do here after 2200. All I wanted to do was get a drink with my fianc\u00e9 and maybe grab some hors d\u2019\u0153uvre. There is nothing available. There are a few bars in the casino with no real seating and no food options and terrible auto mixed drinks, but there in no bar within the casino that you can sit in and simply talk. The 24 hour cafe is available, but really nothing of the quality of a decent casino bar. I walked the casino and promenade floors a few times and asked several employees about food options, receiving only shrugs or apologies. There is no room service available after 12 noon. The only option for room delivery is the pizza parlor within the casino. I am not sure why there is no food offering really in the Circus Circus save for the cafe after 2200. The pool was fun. They are on the small side and again ageing, but sufficient. There is a bar by the pool which again has seen better days and lacks the ability to make real drinks, but it is sufficient and you can get cold beer (if you order before they run out.) There was a hot dog chef outside and there is a snack bar. The pool seemed open to the public as the locking gate was unlocked and seemed to be a thoroughfare of people coming to enjoy the pool. They may have been guests as well. I would stay in Circus Circus again if I wanted to show kids a great time for a day or two. I split my trip this time between Circus Circus and the Wynn (I am not comparing the two in the least. They are different hotel categories). I was ready for a change after two days, however, I enjoyed the two I spent and do believe the hotel is hitting its target audience. On the other hand I really think it is inexcusable to not have a sit down bar which serves at least hors d\u2019\u0153uvre after 2200 or room service. I really believe that for any other audience, there are better options that are more customer oriented.", "Date": "May 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alburg, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cWas 'OK'\u201d", "Author": "vtcammie", "ReviewID": "UR7429694", "Content": "Circus Circus is an affordable stay in Vegas.

Myself and 5 friends from the uk (between the ages 22-35) stayed here. We were a little worried after reading reviews. But we had nothing to worry about everything was fine. When booking in we were given lots of room options, we all had great views from the rooms (Strip & Stratosphere Hotel) The rooms were all very clean and the maids were great (we tipped $1 a day) The lifts were quite busy at morning and evening but didnt have to wait too long for the next one. The buffet restaurant is great value $11 for breakfast (\u00a35.50 pp) Lots of choice eg. scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, corned beef hash, hash browns, french toast, pancakes, waffles, fruit, cereal, muffins, donuts, cakes etc Garden Grill for evening meal, prepare yourself they are massive meals. My partner and i would often share two starters for our meal (waffle fries and chilli & popcorn chicken) this would cost about $10 for both of us to eat and you get so much that we were full. The casinos are great in the hotel, any drink you want whilst playing eg. Corona, Bud, Vodka and mixer, water, pina colada, baileys etc from cocktail waitress just tip them a dollar note or chip and they will return with next drink within ten mins. You dont even have to be playing alot realy you could just sit at a 5c machine and they will ask you. Deuce bus stop outside hotel(slot of fun part of circus circus) this bus travells on the strip to every hotel, buy a $5 ticket and u can travel all day on any bus. Dont worry bout missing stop the bus driver has microphone and announces every stop. If possible try not to go out till later in the evening as this is when it is busy and alot more fun on table games, Often we would be going to bed at 1am and the hotel would just be getting busy. If you are goin try and go for more than a week, we went for 6 days and this was no way long enough, their is so much to see. Go and see the Bellagio Fountains (wow) Ceasers paalce, new york new york, paris etc You could spend a day in each one.

Likewise, the hotel's outdoor hot tub was only mildly warm -- very disappointing, because I wanted to soak my feet after walking up and down the strip, and I couldn't do it in the bath tub since the bath water wasn't hot... In our 18-story tower, the ice machines on only TWO floors were in working order. What a pain in the butt. The good thing about Circus Circus is that it's on the strip, though it's at the far end. It's a long walk to Treasure Island, the Luxor, etc. It's walkable if you're in good shape and have comfortable shoes. If not, there's a bus stop very close, and for $5 you can ride the bus up and down the strip for 24 hours.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville", "Title": "\u201cNo problems wit CCLV\u201d", "Author": "RN29", "ReviewID": "UR7215697", "Content": "We arrived at around 2am.

I've paid 100 dollars in total for Saturday night, and my experience had been quite pleasant! When I booked on the hotel's website, I've booked a non-smoking room with 2 queen beds in the west tower as many have had suggested, however, as I was travelling by myself, I've put in a request that I'd prefer a non-smoking King bed or if non-smoking rooms are not available, at least I want a King bed. I took a shuttle to CC after I arrived, first impression of the hotel is that it is a bit old and dark, but hey, did I mention it was only 100 bucks for Saturday?? Cynthia at check-in was quite funny, made a joke about my FCUK shirt and everybody had a good laugh, I got a room in the main tower, it was a non-smoking King, so I didn't really bother with trying to get into west tower. It only took 20minutes between queueing up and arrive into my room. When I entered my room, there weren't any horrible smell or traces of filth anywhere. It smelt like a normal non-smoking room! I was on the 9th floor, even I didn't get a room with strip view, I still can see the stratosphere tower from my window, which i was quite satisfied. The bed was reasonably clean and comfortable, shower was clean, everything was quite satisfying from my point based on the rate I've paid. However there were some rooms for improvement, as many others have mentioned, the walls were very thin and totally not sound proof, there were only a few child running, which didn't bother me at all, but the sound of showering from all rooms around me (including the floor above me) was quite annoying. The lighting for the hallway and lobby could have been brighter. Also the in-room safe costs you 50c every time you use it. The location wasn't a problem for me as I enjoy walking up and down the strip looking at the view and different hotels, it was great. Although people handing out little flyers for strippers were a bit annoying, but they are quite harmless, every now and then you'll encounter some crazy drunks that'll yell from their car etc etc, but it was all good. Overall I think CC is a good place to stay if you are travelling on a budget, otherwise, if you expect 5 star facility and service, here's a hint, stay at a 5 star hotel!!!!

It is truely a run down/in need of updating in the hotel department. First of all the check in process was long-had trouble locating our reservation(we went there on a promotional deal from a previously visited timeshare presentation-airfare not included). I had called twice the week before to confirm this reservation and to request a room in the \"tower\" which I was assured by the reservation department. When we arrived we were told there were no regular rooms available in the tower! (did not want to stay in the older part after reading bad reviews). The only other tower option was to upgrade to a mini suite for an additional $100.00 for the three nights so we reluctantly agreed to this. The reservation person did ask if we minded room #666 which we agreed to as she stated this was the only one available. This was clearly a mistake once we arrived to our room! First of all our window looked directly across at another wallon the adjacent building and on the roof between these two buildings was what appeared to be a dead/decomposed rat! The window frame on the inside of the room was full of dead flies and other bugs from the window being opened(the only relief from the musty stale smoke oder that permiated the room-and we smoke!) We bought room deodorizer to spray the room. The wallpaper was peeling in some spots,the bed mattress was absolutely terrible(sagging,could feel the springs in spots),only gave 2 almost flat pillows,carpet stained and dirty appearing,and the cushioned headboard had several burn holes in it. On our last morning after showering what appeared to be a baby cockroach crawled out from behind a picture! The vendings machines didn't work properly and kept our money to get some chips and soda. Every time you went downstairs there were timeshare people located in two different locations hounding you-even if you just walked past them 2 minutes before! Another couple told us to tell them that you were leaving that day(that way they don't continue to pester you as long as there is no time to schedule an appointment). The buffet there was okay-nothing special-we used our points we earned from their players club to eat there three times so be sure to register for the players club there. Checkout was a long process due to very long lines and what appeared to be inadequately staffed reception area-took almost 25 minutes! The better part of our trip was the one day that we went to Red Rock Canyon early in the morning-got there at 6am when they opened and saw a very picturesque sunrise as we drove through the park-stopped and took pictures at several spots.

The room was large; it was clean. The furnishings were not new. The bed was harder than I would have preferred. When we got up to the room, there were only two bath towels for the two of us (my wife and me). The room maid was in the hallway making up another room. She happily provided us with two extra towels and a shower cap, which was apparently not standard issue. The television worked fine, but there was a limited selection of channels.

On Monday a horn sounded loudly at 6:30AM, and the beeping of the excavators and trucks demolishing the Stardust started. And continued. We were in Las Vegas to meet family members. My sister was there for a convention. She and my mother were staying at Treasure Island. So we spent more of our time there, and little at Circus-Circus. We did go to the breakfast buffet at Circus-Circus and thought it was a good deal for the money. The food was OK, and there was plenty of it. We had gone to the buffet at the Mirage, which cost twice as much. The Mirage had a wide variety of foods besides breakfast, like roast meats, Mexican, Italian, Japanese etc. But it cost twice as much as Circus-Circus, and you can only eat so much. We had a drink at the bar at the Circus-Circus steakhouse. We went there to get away from the casino noise, and it was a nice respite. When originally making the reservation at Circus-Circus, I booked the room through the airline we flew to get there. The first night was about $150.00 the rest about $45.00 per night. This was in contrast with $250.00 per night every night at most of the newer Las Vegas Strip hotel/casinos and $850.00 per night available at Bellagio. My wife checked the Circus-Circus web site viewed the rooms online. She contacted them to get a better room. She was informed that, because I had booked through the airline, we could not upgrade. So she cancelled the airline booking and booked directly through the hotel. It cost a few dollars more per night ($54.00 per night for the weeknights), but felt it was worth it.

Impressions as we walked to the fitness room: To call it a maze may be an understatement. O.K., we can let that slide. We could see down to the pools. Pristine, with clear blue water? More like mucky with a milky white consistency. At one point we were greeted by a few dead 1-inch cockroaches and the pleasant aroma of freshly spayed cockroach spray. In the fitness center the machine I wanted to use had its cable completely broken. The least they could have done was put an out of order sign on it. Other impressions: A struggle to get bath towels. Frustrated employees (the maid showed me her cart with no towels). Tons of rubbish outside the doors to the manors. Grimy elevators that scarcely worked. An incredible trek from the manors to the main building. Traveller's tip on saving a few bucks If you decide to stay at this dump to save a few bucks, be prepared.

We also flew grandma in from out of state to visit the kids (and of course do some of her own gambling) and allow my husband and I a little occasional alone time in Vegas. The clerk was nice when I checked in. I mentioned to her that the rates had gone down $25 a nite. She had her supervisor approve an adjustment and I save $100 for the 4 days. Good thing, because I would have been bent out of shape paying the higher price for a run down hotel. She also asked me if I wanted a higher floor so that I could see the strip. I said \"sure\". The last time I was in Vegas, I stayed in the Paris hotel and was O.K with the higher floor. After checking in, we went across the street to the skyline tower. I was O.K. with the location of the parking garage & tower. No long walks. Then, my kids and I got in the elevator (while my husband grabbed more luggage) and couldn't get out on the 2nd floor. I hit door open. It didn't. We ended up going back up to floor 3, getting in another elevator, then back down to floor 2. I got out of the elevator, and immediately felt as if the building was unstable. I don't know if it was the carpet padding or what, but the flooring seemed unstable & uneven. I got in the room (maybe I was sensing something, because I hadn't read any of the reviews) and didn't want to reveal to the kids that I was scared to death to be up on the 23rd floor of this crappy hotel. I told my husband about my worries and he was O.K. changing to a lower floor. They (hotel staff) were nice enough to let me (us, our family) do this. Then grandma arrived, it was a horribly long walk from our room to the restaurants. It's not a good hotel for an older person. The false stone floor is very hard on the feet. We met other family members there (a couple were staying across the street @ the Riviera) and to our surprise, disgust, embarassment, and to my already newly found Circus Circus Anxieties, the fire alarms (a buzzer that sounded like a gibbons monkey and annoying flashing lights) went off for about 10 minutes. I kept expecting security to walk around and do \"checks\" and they didn't. I kept expecting for us to be evacuated and nothing happened. Everyone in the hotel, restaurant, staff and guests alike just ignored it and went about their business. It's as if they were used to false alarms. I expected to hear an announcement over the loud speaker \"no need to worry guests, it is just a false alarm\". AN APOLOGY, an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, something! And it happened again, for a short period of time. It could have happened many times for all I know (we were gone during the day doing other things). I was happy to be on the third floor. Then, another elevator problem, the first one was garage elevator, this one was one of the elevators that took us up to our room. It wouldn't open. Then, one another occasion, our elevator stopped and an announcement came on \"we are experiencing technical difficulties\", but the door opened anyway. The hotel was freezing cold. We were there during a horrendous cold snap (it even snowed in Vegas), but that's no excuse for the casino floors to be ice cold. Our lights in the bathroom went out, yes they changed them on our requests. But, the bathroom also had mold on the ceiling because there were no exhaust fans. I could go on more, but why bother?

I had read the previous reveiws on this website and was slightly worried about what i had let myself into, but upon arrival, i was very plesently surprised. We arrived at approx 2pm on the 28th, a busy period due to it being the last check in day of 2006, and we waited no longer than 10mins to check in, which went very smoothly and quick. We then ventured up to our room. Previous reviews had said that the rooms were miles from the lobby, but we got in an elevator and within 2 mins, we were opening the door to our twin double room. It was lovely, just like the photo had shown on the website we booked on (lastminute.com) It was large, clean and bright. The beds were larger than doubles, the bathroom huge and the closet space adequate enough. The only 2 things so far i can fault is that the lifts can take a while, and can break down (2 broke down while we were there but were fixed within an hour) and we needed more hangers and pillows. After freshening up, we ventured down into the hotel to find dinner, and ended up at the garden grill. It was amazing, the value for money was unreal. We had huge portions and the drinks were reasonable. Service couldnt be faulted and we were in and out within an hour. Okay, it is a family hotel, there were kids about, but if your moaning about all the kids running around, why the hell did you book the one hotel that is based on a family atmosphere? thats your own fault. If you dont like kids, simple, dont book this hotel! It wasnt that bad anyhow, if you wanted to get thru quick, head into the casino to get past all the crowds as children under 21 not allowed into them! We could not hear the people in the rooms next to us, the maid was very friendly and apart from having to ask for extra towls each day, it was great. Yes they do charge a $1 a day charge for the phone, but it states that when you book, so again, quit complaining, you agreed to do it when you paid, its not a small print item. Now, when it came to new years night itself, the place was heaving. The children were in their thousands, and for each child there was normally about 3 adults, so you can imagine how chaotic it was, but as it is the only family based hotel, i expected it and lived with it. We had to que for an hour and a half in the take out pizza place, but it was edible, the chefs were clearly rushed, and it could have been nicer, but what can you do, everywhere along the strip was the same from 5pm. Overall, this hotel is great, like i said, if you dont like lots of children, dont stay here. We walked into the centre of the strip each day and it took no more than 10mins, even with huge blisters on our feet, and getting a taxi from the hotel was easy as there are two areas to pick them up. the hotel lobby or the front of the hotel. The adventuredrome. It was ok, it was like i expected, tacky and completely based on kids! ther rides were good, even for a thrill seeker, the games were average carnival games and the stalls were cool. Little people would love it and its not expensive. The shops in the casino are great, they sell everything and again, its not expensive. Beware if you are from england and have a credit card as if you need money out, it only accepts the cards with the cirrus logo on, thankfully one of my cards did! and there is only 1 atm there, its in the lobby. Check out was quick and easy, took seconds to fill in the leaflet and pop it in the hole with the key. then we were gone. Taxi to/from hotel to airport cost approx $12 then a tip on top, so rather reasonable i thought. One thing i will not fault the hotel on is its care for the residents. One of my party get very very sick and needed a doctor, within 30mins there was one there, and he made her better and she was ok to fly and the next day was up and about again, but do make sure you have health insurance for the USA as it cost $600 for the injection and medicine. I loved it here, and would not mind staying here again, i cant understand what everyone is complaining about.

We estimated that it took between 10-15 minutes to get out of our hotel!! The restaurant level is HUGE with around about 6 eateries to chose from, not including shops and kiosks selling and advertising various things. The hotel was very busy and the casino was jammed with people, this added to the time it took to exit the hotel. One good thing about this was that I'm sure I've lost weight after walking a million miles everyday! :o) The staff weren't anything special and while they weren't rude, they certainly weren't as friendly as most hotel staff I've encountered during my many stays in the USA. That said I did call housekeeping to report a faulty tap in our bathroom and they fixed it almost right away, so that was good service. I realise that all the major hotels on Las Vegas Blvd make their money from casinos and that's why they're built BIG, but if I had to go back again (and I probably wouldn't) I'd stay just mid-way down, or off the strip in a smaller hotel.

The window overlooks the roof of the hotel where there are large generator which A, block out the light and B, sound like a bus is sitting at your window with the engine running!

Apart from these gripes the hotel was ok, we found it clean, everything did what it said on the tin, tv was rubbish but if you go LV to watch TV you need to have a word with yourself. its a good place to go for your first trip to LV. Just don't expect the whole \"miss you already\" over friendly american approach- the majority of staff in Circus Circus seemed like they had been there too long, were tired, hostile, rude and in need of a lesson in customer service.

Ended up getting there late so I got into the Vegas Strip traffic. I didn't know that the rooms were located across from the casino. I didn't know where the parking was. All I found was the valet parking in front. I didn't see any signs up close where I turn onto Circus Circus road to show me where self parking was. I took me an hour & a half just to find the parking plus I had a friend helping me & still couldn't find it. So first timers, turn onto Circus Circus and just GO STRAIGHT AHEAD, keep going straight under the monorail track & you'll see the parking area finally on your left. Follow the sign from the front that says registration. I don't want anyone to have trouble like I did. As for the check in, it was very quick but the clerk chose not to tell me that there's an automatic $1.00 charge for the convenience of having a phone to use. You get charged whether you use the phone or not. So beware of this also. Read your receipt before you sign it at check in, be sure of what they put on there because at any other hotel or motel I've stayed at previously, I ONLY was charged if I made a call, this is the first time I've ever been charged regardless. I asked the front desk about it from viewing it on the tv screen the next day & they said it was, quote, explained to me at check in, I said no it was not, that I thought it was included in the $25 deposit for incidentals, the clerk then said that is only for cash paying customers only. He got persnippety with me & sarcastic & said, quote, well it's only a dollar for one night but I'll take it off anyway. The room was less than expected, I got spoiled at Santa Clarita Motel the 2 nights before. This room was a letdown. The bathroom was VERY tiny. I had to either straddle the toilet or step to the other side wall to shut the door. The toilet faces the door & is right behind it so if someone accidentally opened it--it didn't lock--I'd get smacked in the face w/the door. The shower/tub was narrow. The curtain was typical plain & thick plastic, it kept wanting to stick to me when the shower was on--ewwww. They provided soap, shampoo, & lotion. The a/c was on a timer but it worked although it took doing to figure out how to make it work. The good thing about the room is that you can check out on the tv, just follow the menu although you hafta press menu item 4 & when I tried to do this, it wouldn't let me, that's when I found out I owed a dollar for a call I never made. Why in the world wouldn't they charge it anyway at check in rather than at check out is beyond me. You can also check out by filling out a card they give you & dropping it w/the room keys into a container at the elevator downstairs from the room but I had to borrow a pen from a security guy to fill out the card because this hotel didn't provide pens or paper either so bring those w/you if you think you may need them. Overall, this hotel is only good if you're desperate for a room at a 3 star hotel but I could've done better w/my choice. The Orleans was only $3 more & is a lot nicer & easier to get to, I should've stayed there.

We initially booked a manor room, but after reading mixed reviews about Circus Circus on this website and others, we contacted the hotel and paid the extra money for a tower room. When we got to the hotel, the check-in process took a short while, as we arrived on an airport shuttle-bus with a lot of other travellers, but I would say it was only about 25 minutes or so. The staff were efficient enough, but did not seem to have the time to spend being sociable - I put this down to the number of people they must have to process every hour. They provided us with a map, and I must admit, it took us a while to find our way to our room, but the hotel lobby, lift and landing were all immaculate. Our room was fantastic, and we had an amazing view over the adventuredome and out to the mountains on the horizon. Each room has a safe, iron and TV but you have to pay for the safe here (which is a bit cheeky in my opinion)! The restaurants were a little disappointing on-site, but that's mainly because we had really been looking forward to visiting the Blue Iguana, which has now closed and become some strange Italian/Tex Mex place with a rather obscure menu. We visited the Mexican restaurant at Sahara, which was amazing! The buffet in the mornings is fantastic value for money and much recommended, although you may want to take a lie down afterwards!! We spoke to another couple whilst we were in the restaurant - they were staying in the manor rooms and were not so happy with the accommodation - that made me even more glad that we had changed our booking! The Pink Pony cafe is also good, although there are better places if you are willing to look about. The free circus acts are on all day, and if you have children, it is well worth a look. The adventuredome is also fantastic, although a lot of the rides were out of action while we were there. Also, be careful with the lockers in here - we lost our money a couple of times on lockers that were tempramental! The location of the hotel was ok, although it was at the top end of the strip so it took a while to get down to the other hotels. Overall, we liked Circus Circus and would happily go back. Although there were a lot of families here, we were not bothered by children everywhere - maybe we just struck lucky! We also went on a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon whilst we were in Las Vegas - highly recommended (Papillon Helicopter Tours are excellent, and run a shuttle service from all of the strip/main downtown hotels to Boulder City to catch the chopper)!", "Date": "August 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "mrtravler", "ReviewID": "UR5543590", "Content": "Arrived late at 2 am, had to wait 1 hour to check in.

There's a long wait for elevators and there are extremely long check-in lines unless you arrive late night. If you are energized by noisy crowds of children, this is your place.

We also don\u2019t gamble \u2026 the point of our trip was to see Hoover Dam, architecture along the strip, and to say that we had been at Vegas.

We and our kids felt safe and comfortable there, but we also felt comfortable walking through Paris, Caesar\u2019s Palace, Bellagio, the Hilton, and the Mirage. If we could do it again, we would have stayed at the Mirage, which has a great pool, a somewhat nicer clientele, and more things to do in the neighborhood (not to mention the white tigers). The pools at Circus Circus were older, dumpy and filled with screaming, impolite kids.

The hot water also did not get hot, only warm and one night there was a note on the door saying that there would be no hot water from 10pm until 6am. I think it is a hassle to stay there. It was hard to find the circus acts and everything was very spread out. Also we would have to wait about 20 minutes to see a 5 minute circus show, it was not worth it. I also did not think the buffett was worth full price, it had limited selection and long lines to get the food. I do not find this hotel kid friendly for people that have real little kids.

I was a little worried about staying here after I read a few of the reviews but my worries were put to rest as soon as I got there. I had one of the rooms in the main building on the 2nd floor and found it more than adaqute. The room had 2 double beds, bath with shower, iron/board, hair dryer, tv with pay movies, safe, phone etc. The room was in a good condition with great maid service. Rooms cleaned everyday along with clean towels. The only downside to the room was it was a little dark due to the lighting being just lamps and it could have done wth a fridge. This wasn't too much of an issue as there was a drink/ice machine at the end of the hall plus right at the bottom of the lift was a 24 hour shop. There is a bus stop right out the front of the hotel so even though it's at the north end of the strip it's easy to get around from. Most days we ended up walking as the bus service stops at every stop so can take about 30 mins to go about 4 miles. The only other downside to the buses is the inconsitantcey of them. You could easily wait for 30 minutes then see one or 2 at the same time but due the amount of people on the buses half the time the bus will drive by without stopping. I'd definitely reccomend staying at this hotel especially if you're working to a budget. You can't go wrong.

The line at check in was long when we arrived at around 4pm on a Tuesday, but the people were friendly and someone came round to enroll us into the players club, which we wanted to do anyway. The room itself was clean and tidy, and the maid service attentive, although our room wasn't cleaned on the second day because we were in our room. The rooms are basic-ours contained 1 king bed, a TV, 2 bedside tables, 2 chairs and a table, a 'fridge, a dresser, lamps and a bathroom. I would say that for $39.95 a night this was a good deal. Security was also good-outside security doors that needed a keycard to get into, plus a security guard outside at night. There was no noise from other guests. The location is obviously a little away from the centre of the strip, however, the bus stops right outside the hotel and costs $5 for a 24hr unlimited pass that takes you to all parts of the strip and downtown. It's really not that far to walk to Treasure Island, but I wouldn't want to walk further, unless you like to do that! The pool was fine-nothing special, but nice to sit at for an hour or two...clean and plenty of room for the amount of people there. We didn't gamble in the casino much, since we preffered the Riviera opposite and Slots-a-fun right next door. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants either, but didn't see lines at them when we went past. Although we didn't take children we went upstairs to the carnival games which were easy to win at and quite fun. All the children we saw there were well behaved and seemed to be having a great family vacation. The only problem we had was upon check out when they tried to charge us for a couple of phone calls we didn't make, but when we queried them they printed out what they had on their records, then cancelled all the calls off our bill-even the ones we made-so we didn't have to pay. Overall i'd say this is a very basic hotel, but great for the price. Don't let the location put you off because the bus service is great-one every 6 mins daytime/10mins night time 24hrs a day.

BAD STUFF: neglected aging/broken furnishings - one of 3 lamps in the room did not work due to broken on/off switch; knobs missing from desk drawer; white hotel towels were worn and grey; bed cover had cigarette burn holes; lamps glued to middle of table tops - can't push aside to accommodate more things on table surface;poor maintenance planning - they shut off the hotwater one night between the hours of 10pm-6am for maintenance and notified people by slipping notes under everyone's door in the afternoon of the same day they were turning off the hot water - we just happened to come back to the hotel at 9:45pm that evening and were rushing to all take showers before the hot water was turned off - inconvenience. - would have made more sense to do maintenance during the day when most of the guests are outside enjoying the city. Unusual pricing rules: all rooms are double occupancy priced and if you should have a 3rd person in the room, all three parties pay the double occupancy rate plus a premium to enable the 3rd person to stay in the room without the 3rd person getting a separate bed - in effect, you pay a premium for less service and amenities per person, eg. instead of 2 people each paying $25 for the room, 3 people had to pay $30 each for the room with the same stuff in the room as if only 2 people paid to stay in it - the hotel collects $90 instead of $50 for the same room without accompanying increase in service - a reverse of how many other hotels do things where charge is done by basic room rate divided by number of occupants + low premium for extra bed. We were there for 5 nights and had to call for an extra set of towels and soap for 3 of the 5 days there.

It is only $3, but they charge each room that, and many people may not dispute it because of the time involved.

We called the hotel to find their parking area and were told to come in back to the Valet parking area. When we got there it said \"Valet parking full\". So, we found a space ourselves and parked. We then got our kids and our suitcases and proceeded to walk quite a distance to the doors. At which point we were greeted with a line for check in that was about 50 people deep (no kidding!). After 1 hour, we finally made it up to check in and the lady behind the counter gives us a hard time (okay, I would be grouchy too if I had that many people waiting in line). We were given room 29749 out of 29750 rooms. It was way out of the way! (you have to go up to level 2 and walk quite a distance, go through the skyrise casino and then catch another elevator to the 29th floor, Very inconvenient). I wouldn't have minded so much, if the room was at least facing the best part of the strip, but we got one with a view facing the other direction. Then we wanted to take our kids to the adventure dome. It closes at 6pm on the weekdays! I thought this was Las Vegas, a city that never sleeps! A lot of the shops were closed too. Lady luck was not on our side!! On the up side.. The elevators were fast and my kids won a couple of stuffed animals in the midway. The free circus acts were good, they need to vary the types of performances though. We saw three acts and each one had two performers doing different hand stands on each other. Oh yeah, and what's up with being asked every 5 seconds if we were going to be in Vegas for a couple of days? There is someone around every corner ready to pounce on you.

It was my mistake so I just told the reception girl there I would pay for another night. The hotel was fully booked which was fair enough, so she advised me to look for another hotel for that night. What annoyed me being my first trip to the US was there was no offer of ringing another Hotel to check availability or a recomendation of where to go for me it was just, bad luck, next customer. Which I would think be the courteous thing to do. I ended up getting a room at the Riviera for the night. The food is the worst there I tried the Buffet, and tried the blue pony I think it was called yuck,yuck,yuck, then gave up go to the Bellagio or one of the better hotels for food. Loved that Krispy Kreme though! The room was well appointed and clean. Very busy place with lots of kids, which I like actually, having two myself and doing this trip alone. They have a carnival there which my kids would have loved. Some of the staff where good, most absolutely atrocious. For a circus type theme hotel its not very jolly. Its a tired looking place and when I go back this year I will stay somewhere else, they do a very good job at making you feel like you are cattle.

Circus Circus is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip so you cannot really expect it to be a four star property. Stayed in room 1235 in the main tower from Jan 31 until Feb 7 and it was ok, the room was clean, and very spacious with it being one of the large king tower rooms. We had a King bed and a separate seating area including a sofa, chair and a coffee table. The bed was comfy and clean, no sign of any strange marks or stains. The furniture was very tired and this is the main complaint, they really do need some new furnishings including sofas chairs and carpets, it is starting to show its age! The bathroom was clean but on the small side, but as you don't spend a lot of time in there it really wasn't a problem, the shower was instantly hot every time we used it including peak time in the morning 7am until 9am. Plenty of clean towels. We waited 20 minutes to check in but the queue was small by comparison to hotels such as MGM and Bellagio where we saw hundreds of people queuing! I really would have been annoyed if the queue had been as big as those hotels! There were children in the hotel but at no time did I see them in the casino! and the only place they were a problem was on the midway but that is where they are meant to be so I couldn't complain. Staff were friendly and helpful, we requested a room change due to being given a non smoking room and within 5 minutes we had a new room with a security guard waiting for us with new keys, impressive. Cocktail waitresses were plentiful in the evening, and the bar staff were on the ball. Overall I would say this hotel is exactly what I expected for the price, I would recommend it for people on a budget.

We got inside to ferals everywhere, people just sitting on the floor with beers and plastic plates of food and the lighting was very dim, my husband and i looked at each other with disbelief! Now we understood that Vegas was going to be busy as we were checking in on the 30/12/05 and out on the 2/1/06- New Years Eve, a very busy time but still.... we thought that there would be some standards. We lined up in a line which seemed to take forever and that was cool we expected that- what we didnt expect was the rudeness and attitude we copped from the check in staff. I asked a guy behind the bellhop desk if we had left the car in the correct spot- i was met with a very rude response and must have looked so shocked that another older staff member called me over and asked if i was ok- he was the only person the whole time we were at the hotel that gave us the time of day. So we are given te instructions to our room, we had were in a Tower room. We drove out to another carpark accross the street then went up the lift which took us into the casino, we then had to find how to get up any further to our room on hte 11th floor.... we had to ask as the sign was so small we missed. So we wait for another lift, go up to the 11th floor and get out to a hallway covered in wet towels under the ice machine (the same towels were there the entire trip, the towles were swimming in water eventually.... very disgusting!) The room was fine, the bed was lovely and the maid service was ok, we had left a do not disturb sign on our door and when we returned from the outlets for the day we discovered our sign was on the inside of our door and our room had been made up- we specifically did NOT want anyone in our room as we had bought a new suitcase while we were out and had things spread in piles over the room. Room service only exists from 6am-11am so forget dinner! The Casino was an absolute disaster, i had heard that there would be kids around- thats cool-im a teacher that wasnt too much of a worry. BUT what disgusted me the most was the ammount of children and babies and toddlers who were sleeping on the floors or on the chairs which line the walls. not only were there children sleeping there bu teenagers and adults at times. It was incredibly difficult to move through the lobby, as the ammount of people that were in the casino was a joke. Children of all ages were sitting on the floor next to the slot machines watching their parents play. Security guards were walking around and didnt seem to care that this was happening when we had explictly read that this was not to occur. The child neglect and abuse which was occuring in the lobby and casino of Circus Circus was horriffic! They have a sky rail thing which takes you from the tower casino and rooms to the main casino which is a great idea- however this chose to stop running at any time with no explanation and the staff were rude when you asked them why this may be. so it was back to battling through the crowds of teenagers who walked around as if they ruled the place and stepping over sleeping children whos parents were to lazy to take them back to get a good sleep. On new years day the lifts didnt work at all and we had to walk down 14 flights of stairs in the fire escape to get out of the hotel, thankfully we didnt have to drag our bags with us but many other people who got sick of waiting for the lifts did have to! Oh and make sure you dead bolt your door as you will get plenty of advertising material stuffed under your door thoughout your stay for companies other than Circus Circus. Circus Circus was an utter let down and the staff responses when concerns were raised was truely unsatisfactory. We loved our trip in the USA and everywhere else we went we were treated with such respect and felt welcome into a land so far away from our own, sadly though Circus Circus was an utter waste of time and we felt that New Years was a shamble. we also dont believe that the excuse of 'because its news years weekend' is an adequate excuse for the extreme breaking of laws and lack of concern which we encountered at this hotel. Oh and by the way try to avoid having showers in the morning, as the hot water didnt come through and the shower was cold, if you can hear anyone around you in the shower.... avoid it. Go for a time in the middle of the day or very late at night if you want a hot shower!!!!

It is an ok hotel. We went with an open mind having read other reviews, and therefore we were not \"shcoked\" by anything. The hotel is a liitle far up the strip, but as long as you are reasonably fit you can walk to the Bellagio in 20 mins, if your not so fit, then the 302 or 301 bus stops right outside the hotel, and you can get an all day pass for $5, or you can walk to the Sahara and get the monorail which will take you to MGM in about 10 mins, $3 for one way. Circus Circus is one of the oldest hotels on the strip, and I think you must remember this when you see the newer hotels such as Wynn, Venetian or Aladdin, how clean and bright they are. We liked the character of the hotel, yes in some places it could do with being re-painted and re-carpeted but for the price you pay you can'treally moan. I would suggest you try to stay in the main tower rooms, they cost about an extra $20 a night, but they are much nicer and bigger than the Manor rooms, and you don't have a 10-15 minute walk to get to them! We had no complaints about the room, it was big, clean, air conditioned and everything worked. Well actually amybe there was one tiny complaint, they could do with putting more lighting in the room, you only got 2 bedside lamps and one big lamp. We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful. The checkin/out area is quite small, but we only had to wait 10 mins to check in (at 3pm) and you can self serve check out if you haven't run up a bill. I would not recommed eating at the Buffet, it is rubbish and the food looks like it's been there all day, but having said that what do you expect for like $5-7. We ate at the Blue Iguanna (Mexican place) a couple of times and it was really nice and quite cheap. We never ate at the steakhouse, but heard from other guests that it is very nice. I thought the swimming pool was a bit out of the way and small for the size of the hotel, but that said, we never really got a chance to sit and sunbathe, in Vegas there is just too much to see and do! I wouldn't recommend staying at the hotel over Labour weekend, we expected kids (it is a kid friendly hotel) but the hotel was swamped with them running around everywhere. We took refuge in the casino (where they are not allowed). The casino is big, and the tables seemed to be kind, and the dealers were nice, We never had an empty bottle, as the cocktail waitresses were rounf quite often. We mainly played the slot machines and were lucky enough to win $1000 on a 25c machine! All in all we would go back to the Circus Circus and have recommeded it to friends & family for a lovely holiday in a budget hotel. If you are thinking of going to the Grand Canyon, I would really recommend you go by helicopter, it's more expensive than going by coach or car, but the views are spectacular, and it only take 40mins as opposed to 5 hours by land.

When we went in to the lobby, we were overwhelmed by cigarette smoke and the dark interior. I have a strong suspicion that the dimmed lights hid dirt, grime and other filth. The staff were certainly very friendly (I got a $12 a day refrigerator for free) but the building seemed to be crumbling. Our hotel room was not too great. The linen did not look that clean and the bathroom had calking problems and did not look properly cleaned. At dinner time we waited in line for Pink Pony. The food and service were less than ideal. The waiters forgot what we wanted and after too long, we were served cold food and the glasses were dirty. With the overwhelming stench of cigarettes even though we were in the non smoking section, we didn't stay long in the restuarant or downstairs for that matter. My husband and son did enjoy the Adventure Dome and all of the kids attractions. Before we went to bed that night, we canceled the rest of our reservations at Circus Circus and reserved another room at another hotel on the strip for the rest of our stay. We paid substantially more for cleanliness and less second hand smoke, but it was well worth it.", "Date": "December 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taylor Mill, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "wckdtrix", "ReviewID": "UR4251118", "Content": "We stayed at the Circus Circus from Dec. 10-18...in the Skyrise Tower (floor 22).

We arrived at 3pm and we decided to check in along with about another 75 people. Although there were so many check in only took 20 minutes and the desk clerk was very nice and cheerful. We had originally decided to stay two days and paid $49.95 a night (e-trill deal from e-mail). When we asked the price for a third she gave us the same deal no problem right away. She then gave us our coupon book and directions to our room. We found it no problem but it is at the back of the casino. I've stayed in the South Tower at the Golden Nugget and that was a further walk than the Skyrise at the Circus Circus. The room was very clean and each day the housekeeping was an excellent standard and no one bothered us and only cleaned after we were gone for the day. We found that since it was the middle of the week there were very few kids and they were well behaved. My friend and I used the 2 for 1 buffet coupon (which made the cost of the buffet $6 each) and the buffet was another surprise. I've heard reviews of the fod not being good but I liked it. It was hot , fresh and clean. The selection isn't a good as the other strip hotels but what do you expect for $10 for dinner. Everyone else on the strip charges over $18. We went on the rides at the Adventuredome and used the $4 off coupon given to us at check in. Same rides as at the PNE. All day pass regular price $24.95. Save your money and go a couple of times on the Manhattan Express. Gambling was okay lots of selection didn't eat my money as fast as Paris but I found my money lasted longer Downtown. Every worker we encountered was friendly and helpful. The first night we stayed there the people in the next room were getting a little out of hand so I called the front desk and security was there in less than 4 minutes and handled the situation very professionally and we didn't hear them again for the rest of the night.

Some of the slot and tables areas are a bit shabby/tired. This is an older establishment and it is beginning to show its' age, but it still is good value for money (we booked thru Expedia). We just used it as a sleeping place - never saw a circus show and never had a meal (except the pizza). And only gambled a few tens of $$$. Check-out is amazingly easy - follow the instructions on the TV using the remote control and navigate thru the pages. There are unmarked boxes strategically placed near the elevators to deposit your room key when checking out. We would stay there again without hesitation. It is fine for the price and with so much to do along the Strip and elsewhere (please don't miss visiting Fremont Street in Downtown LV - stunning!!), all you will really need is Circus Circus' bed for the night. uncletony and family", "Date": "October 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Breda, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGood for budget travellers\u201d", "Author": "Muk_muk", "ReviewID": "UR4016906", "Content": "The casino is small compared to the other hotels on the Strip, but of course Circus Circus is a place for budget-minded people so I guess that's normal.

Travelling with our friends, we went by Virgin Atlantic. I have to say that i really was expecting something better than the average airline but was sorely disappointed on both the outbound and inbound flights. lets just say i wont book with them again ! On to the holiday itself. We booked with expedia, which was simple and straight forward. We booked 7 nights at the 'Circus Circus' hotel and casino, and also had a hire car. The hotel was, at first, very disappointing. We were booked into the manor rooms which were located across the road from the main hotel building. The rooms were awful.... smelly, dark, and very sparse.... the stained carpets eventually sent us back to the main lobby to complain. Our complaint was dealt with immediately, and pleasantly, which was a godsend at the end of a very long and tireful day. We were relocated to two lovely rooms close to one another in the main building, and settled in quick. large clean rooms, with huge bathrooms, huge beds, great views of the vegas strip, and maid service everyday. (but no mini fridge or tea/coffee making facilities). The weather in Vegas was in the 80's everyday, a dry heat which was great... but i have to say that the air conditioning everywhere was so cold. We all suffered with nasal problems including a few nose bleeds here and there... and we weren't the only ones ! Our skin went really dry due to the amount of chlorine in the water (shower)... (not pool). so we all felt a bit yuck all week. Now for the good bits ! The strip was filled with great hotels... all themed, and well worth visiting. We celebrated our first wedding anniversary with a lovely gondola ride inside the 'Venetian'... a really stunning hotel not to be missed. 'New York New York' ... the rollercoaster is a must ! (but i lost my earings !!). Harrahs has a very lively casino... great atmoshere. The 'Bellagio' is quality... the food is fabulous. 'Treasure Island' has a live outdoor show 4 times a night with two pirate ships having a battle... worth seeing ! The Stratosphere.... WOW ! You just have to go to the top ! The rides are totally crazy... but we stayed with our feet firmly on the ground ! Every hotel has something worth seeing.... and last of all, i have to mention 'Caesars Palace'.... not only is this hotel huge.. it has shops, restaurants, huge casino.... but best of all, it has the Colloseum Auditorium. This is where Celine Dione appears on a regular basis..(she even has her own shop in the hotel ! ). BUT.... my friend had her birthday on Wednesday and we were fortunate enough to aquire tickets to see Elton John, as he is there for 3 weeks while Celine has a break ! We even flew over Celine Diones vegas house in a helicopter.... we pre-booked a trip on the internet to the Grand Canyon, and then on to a cowboy ranch for lunch... well worth doing.... but a bit over-priced we thought. $279 each.... but hey, no point in not seeing it... the views were spectacular. Vegas on the whole was good, clean, friendly, warm, and fun...lots of shows to see,,also the old casinos and fremont street with its light show...lots of designer shops and malls... but overall, the sound of slot machines, arcade games, roulette wheels, and casino noise in general can get on your nerves in the end.

I will say that overall we enjoyed Circus Circus. My wife and I went with two other couples. It was a great deal and we couldn\u2019t pass it up. Let\u2019s start with the check-in. I read all the horror reviews about the long lines and slow service. We had no problems when we checked in. Having said that, I must also add that we got to the hotel about 10:30am, so that may have made a difference. Our room wasn\u2019t ready, but they do say that check-in is 2:00pm. We went back at 1:40pm, and the room still wasn\u2019t available, and they said they cannot even give you a key until 2:00pm, even if just wanted to drop off your stuff in your room. At 2:00pm, we got our key and our room was ready. We requested adjacent rooms with couple 1, which they obliged (actually, we got rooms directly across the hall, which was just as good). Couple 2 was put in a room on a different floor in a different building. They requested a room on the same floor as us, which they changed with no problems. There was nothing available on our floor, but there was one on the floor below. Now on to the room. The room was nice, and had a purple color scheme, which we liked since purple is our favorite color. It was nothing fancy, but overall very clean and spacious. We were missing the top part of the lever behind the faucet that lowers the stopper for the sink. Also the alarm clock on the nightstand didn\u2019t work, but they had already put another one on the desk (I still don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t remove the broken one). We didn\u2019t ask maintenance to fix these problems, since they weren\u2019t really a big deal. Both of the couples we were with had a light burned out (one had a burned bulb in the bathroom and one had a burned bulb in the entryway). They called maintenance and someone was up to replace the bulbs immediately, so that was good. As for food, we only ate in two of the restaurants. We tried the Buffet, which had a nice selection and was very reasonably priced, plus the food was good. We mostly ate at the Pink Pony, which was a very basic restaurant. The food, however, was awesome! They give you a nice selection, and the portions were more than you\u2019d ever expect, for not a lot of money. We highly recommend this place to eat. At least give it a shot. The hotel in general was nice. Yes, there are a lot of kids around, but they aren\u2019t in the casinos, nor are they running around the hallways. So don\u2019t let that concern you. The place is huge, so be prepared to walk a bit. It took us a day to get used to where everything was. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. I honestly don\u2019t know what people expect. Is this the Ritz? No. Is this the Hotel at Mandalay Bay? No. But this is a very nice place, and a great value for the money. Don\u2019t let the negative reviews scare you off. If you\u2019re looking for an upscale hotel, go to the 5-star hotels. But if you\u2019re looking for a nice place to stay for a low price, then I would definitely recommend checking out Circus Circus.", "Date": "September 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paphos, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cA well priced hotel on the strip\u201d", "Author": "serap", "ReviewID": "UR3976207", "Content": "This was our first visit to Las Vegas, and we were staying for 3 nights but hadn't pre-booked a hotel.

To be fair, the hotel seemed quite full, and the front desk staff were very nice. 2) The food was \"ok\". We ate at the buffet twice (mostly because we didn't have time to look around for other restaurants). Anyway, there are plenty of dining options in LV. 3) Getting in and out is a hassle. This, however, is par for the course in LV hotels - you have to navigate the casino to get out! Beyond that, ask yourself what you are looking for. There were alot of families (read: kids) - we are you and don't have kids, so we're not crazy about spending out vacation surrounded by them (no offence)! If you want a cheap, clean hotel, then this is the one for you. It's towards the end of the strip, however (a cab ride to Excalibur was like $11), and if you are young and single, and want to \"club it up\" - then go somewhere else like the bellagio, Luxor or the Palms. Circus Circus was perfect for us because we planned day trips out of LV 2 out of 3 days we were there. For gambling, CC has some $5, single deck blackjack, and the dealers are patient in teaching you the ropes. This is far less intimidating than some of the other casino's. We took day trips to the Grand Canyon and Death Valley. With the canyon, it's a long day - I would advise you do a flyover, and leave it at that. The bus tour doesn't do any justice to it. For a better look, hike it. Death Valley is a great trip, about 2 hours away, and I think there may be tour buses that go there.

The room was very clean and the maid service was excellent. I've never seen such a huge hotel room. Sometimes, all you have to do is be nice and ask if you'd like to make changes to your reservation. Circus Circus is not a four star hotel, but it is a great value hotel that is right on the strip. If you want glammer, stay at the Wynn. If you want a nice hotel at a cheap price, stay at Circus Circus. The hotel is not located in the heart of the strip, but there are buses that run every 5 minutes that will take you anywhere on the strip you'd like to go for cheap. ($5 for a 24 hour unlimited pass.) The only thing you need to be aware of is that Circus Circus is a huge hotel--one of the largest in the world--so it takes a long time to get anywhere. There are a lot of children, but thats what this hotel is known for. Overall, we were very pleased with Circus Circus.

They have about 30+ windows for customer service, but only had about 2 clerks working. So it was slow. It didn't help that I wasn't 100% sold on staying here at that time.

The carpeting in the hall and in our room appeared to be very new and recently replaced. Our room was on the end - but we found it very pleasant. The room was clean, the bed sheets were crisp and clean and the bathroom was very clean. There was some crud on the carpet in the corner hidden under the curtain, but we called housekeeping and when we returned later in the day it was gone. It was a basic room.

Circus Circus is an affordably priced hotel, on the strip. If you don't like kids, stay away. I have two, so it was an obvious choice. I think of all the hotels we explored, this was by far the most crowded. We had 6 in our party, 4 adults, 2 children. Requested non-smoking, connecting, strip view rooms. First set of rooms we went to had the Adventure Dome theme park wall right in front of our windows, with a tiny peek of the strip up by the Stratosphere (this was the West Tower)...this was overshadowed by the fact that my father-in-law and his wife swiped the key to enter their room, only to find another guests luggage and clothes strewn about and literally someone was in the bathroom !!!! Flew back down to the desk...was not waiting another 45 min. in line to check in, so I barged my way to an available person. Gave us two new rooms (upgraded us to the Main Tower) with everything we wanted except strip view (however did get to get an upfront look at the bungy jumping place and watched some brave souls take a plunge). We checked back in the morning and again in the evening for any openings of other rooms, like they told us to do. Nothing. Stayed in those rooms another night. The next day, they said they had two new rooms, connecting and strip view right across hall and down a few. Great...except when we got our keys to get us into these...again my father-in-law walked into a room occupied by other guests. Couldn't believe it. This time I was fit to be tied and got right on the phone and called the front desk. Explained the situation and was told to come and see the supervisor. She was very polite, and had two other rooms for us, on the 15th floor of the Main Tower as well. After all this, wouldn't give me two new keys without ID, which I left with my husband in our temp room. We were told to move all our stuff into our new room, and they put a rush on getting the connecting room cleaned for my father-in-law. They sent a bell hop up and gave me the keys to our room, but the supervisor would not give keys to my father-in-laws room until it showed up as cleaned in the computer. It was cleaned right away but because of a discrepancy between housekeeping and the front desk with the computer system, the room couldn't be released to us until it showed as cleaned. That took almost an hour to get the housekeeping inspector to look and call down and say it was cleaned. Then it took another hour for us to get our keys to that room. Once in the room, we had a view of the front of the property looking right at the Riviera...which wasn't bad except these top floor rooms have this permanent scrolled cement design that covers the entire window, so you don't have a plain window to look out, but this weird stuff to look through. But at this point we just wanted to get our stuff out of our suitcases finally and get settled. After having done this moving around, I would stay NO WHERE BUT the Main Tower. Everywhere else is a quite a hike to get to the main part of the hotel where the casino, restaurants, midway, etc. is. I was very disappointed in the pools there. They have two pools serving the towers to the hotel and I think one across the street for the Manor and campground. These pools aren't much bigger than a large inground pool someone would put in their backyard and for a hotel having almost 3,800 rooms, I think this is terrible. Getting to the pools is like a mouse in a maze and the pools being the piece of cheese at the end. Having explored around Las Vegas (this was my 2nd trip in 10 years), if you have an attitude that \"you get what you pay for\" The Venetian is absolutely the nicest hotel on the strip. Gorgeous architecture, no expense was spared. Other nice ones were The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Aladdin. Circus Circus is not centrally located. If I were to go back, I'd definitely stay somewhere around Venetian, Mirage, Treasure Island. Side trips we did were Death Valley, CA (awesome), Grand Canyon, Red Rock Canyon, Hoover Dam. If you have kids and plan to take them to the midway, expect to drop a small fortune on these games and pack an extra bag to get all the stuffed animals home in that you can check or carry on if you have to. I had to stop our kids because we had so many animals...they do give nice prizes to the kids. Adventure Dome was neat. No where near worth the $25 or whatever they charge, but you can't really get away from doing it when you have kids old enough to know it's there and what it is. Oh, one last thing...several times, around the weekend days the valet parking would be full and they wouldn't accept any more cars. I think being a guest there, you should be able to no matter what. It was so full because of the circus acts and midway. And a last suggestion...valet park !!! Don't waste time trying to park yourself. Drive up, get your ticket and walk right in the front door of the hotel. When you are done, show them your ticket, get your car, tip a dollar or two and be on your way. This was sooooo worth it.

Two hotel managers were doing whatever behind the desk. Our first room was in the non-smoking section in the Circus Circus Manor. After finding out it wasn\u2019t part of the main hotel and we had to walk about 1 full (normal) block to the buildings. No shuttles or golf carts for guests. After entering the building it smelled of cleaning supplies. We got into the room and it smelled of vomit so we call the front desk to get a room in the main hotel. The second room was much better in the West Tower. The next morning we went down to the breakfast at the Circus Buffet; cash is king in Las Vegas and no different here while I waited 5 minutes for them do a \u201cRoom Charge\u201d, guess they don\u2019t deal with \u201cRoom Charges\u201d often.

Circus Circus is especially bad where most of the day Mom\u2019s or Dad\u2019s are sitting on the side benches with 2-4 kids in tow trying to make time. Older kids tend to be at the AdventureDome mini amusement park. One afternoon we hung out at their pool of which there are three. Two are a short walk from the hotel but not as far their Manor buildings. The third pool is over closer to the RV Park and the Manor buildings. Having a slight breeze is a nice thing in Vegas but not this afternoon by the pool where we got these occasional smells of the garbage crusher. Our last morning I wanted to do a late checkout after calling the front desk I was told that a checkout between 11AM and Noon would cost $10 and between Noon and 2 PM would be $20 \u2013 what a joke, their casino must not be making money or something.

No smoke smell, no mold, and no evidence of previous occupants. The bed was fairly comfortable and the water pressure was good.

The complimentary circus acts were entertaining and the Adventure Dome, filled with amusement park-type rides and activities, was a pleasant diversion. There are several eateries in the hotel, including McDonalds. The Buffet was reasonably priced and the food was acceptable. The hotel is located near the end of the strip, so pack comfy shoes. Public transportation in Vegas runs 24 hours so we did not bother renting a car. The lobby is clean and not overwhelmingly smoke-filled. We stayed for five days and neither my husband and I were accosted by crazed, parentless children. I cannot comment on the Manor because we stayed in the main hotel.

I would say if you simply want a place to lay your head at night, then Circus Circus is as good a place as any. They offer great deals.

We were placed in the West Tower, the elevators for which are convenient to the back door of the hotel, but a bit of a hike from the front door on the strip. Our room was large and clean, with a few of the mountains (and the enormous tacky pink glass \"Adventuredome\"). The bed wasn't particularly comfortable, but not awful. We've definitely experienced worse at various hotel chains throughout the US. Our only complaints were that: (1) for some reason the housekeeping staff loved to start vacuuming the hallway at about 7am, and (2) if anyone on the floor ran their shower or flushed their toilet, it sounded like Niagara Falls was rushing through our bathroom. Also, (3) the location of Circus Circus basically sucks unless you happen to like the seedy end of the Strip. We spent a fortune in cabs to get us to the places we really wanted to go. Also, we had a tendency to stay out very late and then sleep until late morning or noon. As a result, we missed out on the housekeeping experience and never had our bed made or our towels replaced for the duration of our stay. We never had that problem at Luxor or the Tropicana.

The only fault with the room is that the drain in the bathroom sink didn't drain fast enough, otherwise, everything was just fine. I was on the seventh floor of the Skyrise Tower. The room was clean, the bed was comfy, there was a wing-back chair, plus two other regular chairs, a desk and small table. A word of advice, try to get in the Casino (west) Tower if possible because you will walk a lot less. When you stay in the Skyrise Tower, you have to take a 10 minute walk through the casino every time you want to go out to The Strip. Did you forget to put your Chapstick on? Sorry... it's a ten minute walk back to the Skyrise Tower, and ten minutes back. When I first arrived in the room, they had sprayed some fragrance that I didn't like at all. Fortunately, you can open the window a few inches, and then twist open the round suction vent in the bathroom to clear the air. When I came back later, the smell was gone. Blackout curtains let me sleep late. They charge a dollar a day extra for unlimited phone calls from your room, but calls to 800 numbers incur a 75 cent charge. Checkin line took about 20 minutes to get through. Desk staff was nice. Video checkout from your room means you don't have to wait in line again when you leave. A word to the wise: do NOT stay in the Manor rooms. They are usually five dollars less per night than tower rooms, but you will regret not spending that five dollars. I think many of the negative reviews about the Circus Circus were from people who stayed there.

Of course you have the exceptional few (they tend to look under 4 years old) who may have a stubborn attitude and a temper for who knows what. I'm sure that we all had one when we were little. The only minors that were unattended by their parents were the ones in the Adventure Dome. They were kids ranging from 8 years old to the mid-teens. You would EXPECT that for a place that caters to families with children. Besides, all of the children were focused on staying IN the Dome. They had no interest outside of that.

Kids, kids, kids. It's two-thirty in the morning (or any other time, really) and there are little islands of them, in groups of three to ten, scattered all over the casino, the hallways, the shops. They're dirty, crying, some of them are eating or drinking and many look like zombies. You're literally tripping over them anywhere you want to go. Who knows where their parents are - probably at the slot machines. I have occasionally seen Gaming Board folks telling people to get their kids off the floor and so forth, but it's been very few and far between - and then the parents just dump them right at the edge of the floor - hence these islands of kids. I don't see how this is a \"fun family vacation\" for anyone.

The Pink Pony is a mess - again, no fault of the establishment, really, but all those kids and they're throwing and spilling food and running around... and the wait staff kept having to dodge them and sometimes lost food on trays because of them... then you get your food an hour late.

We knew because of spring break it would be overloaded with kids, but we had 2 teenagers so it was not a problem. Picked the location as we were attending an event at the Speedway in North Las Vegas. Had problems at check-in. First they had us reserved for 6 nights and we only reserved 5 nights. They had us as a no-show the first night and charged us and said they did not have rooms available in the tower at this time. We had reserved a room in the west tower in October 2003. They offered us a waiver of the one night no show charge and would lower our rate by $20.00 if we took a room in the manor. We knew someone who previously stayed there and did not have good things to say about the manor rooms, so opt to decline this offer. The check-in person then checked with their supervisor and said they could put us in the tower, but would have to charge the no show fee. We went ahead and took the tower room just to get a room and not deal with anymore hassle. They put us on the top floor (35th) and had a nice view. The only problem with that, is that you end up stopping on just about every floor on the way down. All the elevators to the upper floors were not always working. In fact only 2 of the 4 worked on a continuous basis. We also had a rollaway too. $12.00. The rollaway was worst than a cot. Actually a cot would have been better.

However, the CC room itself was much bigger and nicer than the Excalibur which we stayed at earlier in the week.

MOST dealers were nice to talk to and even the pit bosses but there was one stuck up dealer who i think was trying to wind all the customers up, he was evenshocked when i tipped him after the games. The location isnt too good, and if you turn left out of the main doors to the store or the Arbies (excellent) then it gets a little scarey, lots of hoods in cars i found, got followed back to the hotel once by a guy who jumped out of the back seat of a parked car and started trying to talk to us even though we only said hi and walked away, he followed us right into the casino. The only other prob we had was with a taxi driver taking us from Freemont to CC, he took us all round the world and wouldnt check his cab when i said he had my wifes bag. i tried to get the valet to help but he wouldnt listen to us at 1st and dismissed us with a wave of the hand whilst he put his head and body through the cabs passenger window to check what happened with the cabbie 1st. it turned out the cabbie did have our bag and the valet himself even said at 1st 'he has checked the cab' but how would he know? Anyway rant over, we did report the cabbie and he got 2 ticket things worth $75 each or something but that was only for taking us the long way. The adventure dome is nice for the kids and i liked the arcade part, the little shop is ok but go to the massive shop opposite, next to riviera, also the food court in riviera is good, the chinese for 2 or 3 courses and noodles is excellent.Also go downtown to freemont street experience if u do nothing else, i didnt go there 1st year and when i went 2nd year we went nearly every night, $1 drinks in most casinos and u can drink em on the street.", "Date": "April 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tasmania, Australia", "Title": "\u201cloved it all\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1767067", "Content": "Have stayed there twice before, great service, wonderful for the kids- will be there again next February.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCircus Circus\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1748236", "Content": "Circus circus, was a pretty nice place to stay, the rooms were very nice, and clean, the only complaint was the buffett was pretty high priced, and there was NO break on the price for the kids, 9.99 per plate", "Date": "March 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPleasenltly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1748053", "Content": "After booking our trip, I started to read reviews on Circus Circus and became quite distraught.

She did not know how to use her emergency cell phone. 3. Was charged for $12 per night for a crib (usually a courtesy) and received queen size bedding and some towels to prep it myself. Hardly adequate - in fact, dangerous for a baby. 4. Waited more than 1 hour for a drink at the slots (pumped in $150 and no drink?). Finally had to get a supervisor. 5. Phone in room did not ring, towels were not replaced fully, no ironing board, no coffee maker in room and you had to walk half a mile from our room to the Krispy Kreme that sold coffee at 6am. 6. Staff was not helpful getting us around. Positives 1. Hotel is smelly but rooms were clean. 2. For children, the adventuredrome theme park, the circus acts, and the carnival games were great along with an indoor Mickey D's and Krispy Kreme for little ones who couldn't sit through a restaurant meal. 3. I hear they have the best steak house in all of Las Vegas. Top rated by NY times. 4. Slots weren't too stingy, dealers were nice. My recommendation: stay if you have kids that need to be occupied with games and rides and you don't care too much about quality. If your kids like animals/zoos more, then I'd recommend the Mirage. The Mirage has the beautiful Sigfried & Roy animal garden with dolphin pool. The reception desks have huge fish tanks.

Next, the hotel is huge, it takes forever to get to your room - but then again there are lots of other huge hotels in Vegas. As for previous reviewers saying that the hotel was full of kids running wild, I think that's exaggerating things a bit! The hotel was extremely busy, but most Vegas ones are, and yes there were children there, but none of them were causing a problem! The final minus point is that the hotel caters to a more down market client - but maybe that's me being a snob though!

The elevators to our floor were very fast and readily available, the vending and ice machine were close by and worked fine.

Not because we had a bad holiday, I just think there are better places to stay for not much more money. The hotel was clean as was the rooms and bathrooms but on the second visit I realised that the hotel seemed to be looking very tired and could do with some modernisation. The rooms are a decent size with either two queen size beds or a super king size bed make sure you stay in the towers as the other part of the hotel looks even older and to an extent run down. The down side to the rooms are that most of the views are of either waste land or the top of the adventure dome (but who goes to Vegas to look out of the window) secondly the rooms are quite a distance from the front of the hotel. The gambling in the circus circus is cheap and cheerful so if you don t want to loose a fortune this is the place, tables start from $1 for blackjack but depending on how busy the hotel is these tables fill up quickly. If the hotel is quieter you may find that the minimum bet is $5. The other down side to the hotel is the location on the strip you soon get fed up of walking the long distance to get to the next decent hotel (Treasure Island). I would also take into consideration that the hotel is probably the only one which caters largely for children and at the weekends it seems to be over run by them. On the positive side if you are looking for somewhere which is cheap and you don t mind walking this will probably be sufficient.

Loads of on site shopping and entertainment with circus acts every half hour and most lasting for 20 mins. Housekeeping is fast , smiling and courteous. No drunken stag nights , no nude parties , and family orientation throughout , just make a point of talking to people and finding out what is where. Remember its a busy , popular hotel for people with kids and as with all of las vegas it gets busier on a weekend.", "Date": "November 15, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Circus Circus Hotel & Casino Las Vegas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d91770-Reviews-Circus_Circus_Hotel_Casino_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$30 - $97*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2880 Las Vegas Blvd S</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91770", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3c/88/3c88849a20e872eca9ab2866ddd8cc6f4large.jpg"}}

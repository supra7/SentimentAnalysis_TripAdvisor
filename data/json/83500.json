Came back at 1:30 to change for the beach and a room was ready. Great 2nd floor room with partial view of ocean. Listened to the ocean in the night while a sleep was peaceful.

The room was a great deal and according to google maps about a block away from the beach. I wasnt really expecting alot from this hotel but i was amazed at everything That they had. First, it was about a 2 min. walk from my hotel room the the beach, not a block. We arrived at around 2:30pm on the 4th and check-in wasnt until 4pm but we decided to see if we could do an early check in and sure enough the nice young ladies at the front let us do early check in at no extra charge. They ask for all guests names and license plates who are staying when you check in, we had a frined stay 1 night with us and they added her to the room (no charge). The room was 35 on the 2nd floor, it was very big and very clean (i walked around barefoot and my feet did not get dirty in the room) the bathroom was a good size and looked fairly newly remolded. The closet had a small fridge and microwave. Tons of space for clothing in the closet and drawers. We a a 2 queen room with a table and 2 chairs plus a table and 2 chair outside on the balconly. The sheet were so clean and nice, i pulled them off to check for dirt and bed bugs but everything was beyond perfect. The beds and pillows were comphy and cozy and we loved the flatscreen so we could catch up on news at night.They had coffe and pastries for breakfast, i got coffee every morning before heading to the beach. They also had wash machines that you could use. The staff was so pleasent and friendly. I loved the location, you could walk all over PB and not have to drive. We will be staying here (or at the new property) next time we come back. We visit SD a few times a year and we found a wonderful place to stay. I Can not wait to come back. Thank you for doing such a wonderful job. *Alisha*", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitehorse, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest value on the beach!\u201d", "Author": "Marianne250", "ReviewID": "UR125479953", "Content": "I have stayed at Pacific Shores Inn 4 times in the last year and would not hesitate to recommend it to everyone.

Hotel was actually nicer than I expected inside and out. Everything looked really clean and well kept and the pool looked nice too. We arrived early Saturday about 10am and our room was not ready, but they gave us a parking pass. So we parked our truck and off we went. We spent the day walking and bar hopping along the board walk and did not make it back to the hotel till about 5pm. I had asked for an upstairs room and they gave me a large room upstairs, close to the office, the stairs and the street...Our room was updated and I thought quite nice. The bed was comfy and we had a fridge, microwave and a coffee maker. Location of the hotel was excellent. Once we parked our truck (in a covered parking spot) we walked everywhere and did not use the truck once. Lots of places close by to eat or stop in and have a drink. Lots more places closer to Belmont park (the roller coaster) if you enjoy walking-which we do. Tips-Bring your own coffee, filters and coffee cups. You have a coffee maker in the room, but you need to bring everything else. If you go to the office to get coffee and sweet rolls in the morning. Bring the tray from your room. They don't have plates or trays in the office if you are trying to carry more than one thing. Dont stay in a room close to the road--even a Saturday night, off season was loud, loud, loud. Some of the cars sounded like they were driving through the room and the kids coming back from the bars sounded like they were also in the room at times. I went down Sunday to see about changing rooms and the girl at the front desk was great and said they could change me to the other end, but that Sunday night would be much quieter. She also offered to help us move our stuff which i thought was cool. We decided to just stay put and she was right Sunday was much quieter. This was not a deal breaker for us, but something you should be prepared for.

If you pay more than $100, you'll probably be a little upset. Also, if you book your hotel via a booking service (e.g. Orbitz), make sure you print your reservation out, along with the rate, as the clerk was unable to find our reservation. We had to show him the email confirmation. The Great: -AMAZING location is a beautiful area (Mission Beach). If you have never been to Mission Beach, add it to your to-go list. The motel is right on the beach. -Value - I am pretty sure I got a steal due to it being off-season (got the place for around $90) and if the rates stay that way, I'd consider this a great value. -Big rooms, very spacious, comfortable and clean. The ceilings are SKY HIGH on the second floor above the parking spaces. I loved how high the ceilings were. Very comfy beds. The Bad: -Incredibly thin walls and windows. I was on the second floor and I could literally hear people on the street coughing. It's unfortunate how thin the windows/walls are. However, at night, I did find peace and quiet and didn't hear any activity or loud noises. I did turn on the heater unit just for the \"white noise.\" -No free WiFi! Terrible. They charge $8 a day for WiFi and the signal is bad. -Poor cell phone reception in the motel area. No one in our party had good reception and we were all on different networks (this is obviously NOT the motel's fault but it's worth noting). The motel is in a great location, central to several wonderful bars and restaurants. We recommend Fat Fish, as it served great food and margaritas, and Taco Surf Shop. You'll find plentiful bars/restaurants to check out, along with chain restaurants, Ralph's, CVS and shopping stores all within walking distance from the motel. Parking is free. We stayed in rooms above the parking on the second floor and those are the rooms that had sky high ceilings. Highly recommend those.

The rooms inside the hotel are sparkling clean and everything quite inviting and relaxing. Our standard room had huge flat screen TV, walk-in closet with small refrigerator and a microwave. Bathroom was modern with good quality shampoos, soaps and even toothpaste. My only complain is the water pressure in the shower. Trying to wash out sand and sea-salt from long hair proved to be a very long and very frustrating process because water pressure was pretty weak. But, even this minor disappointed did not spoil our stay and I didn't feel like taking off stars from excellent rating for this hotel. Front desk staff was always friendly, courteous and super helpful. Always smiling and enjoying helping customers. Breakfast was basic with just pastries, however includes huge selection of delicious tea, coffee, and papaya juice - yummy!

I asked about a roll away and she said she would have to check and call me back but after about 2 more minutes of blaming me for the room I was in she said she did not have any roll aways.

The rest of the time you're going to hear slamming car and hotel room doors, couples arguing with each other, drunken partiers, barking dogs, mischievous children screaming and running all over the place, harleys and hopped-up cars doing jackrabbit starts on Mission Blvd., garbage trucks, Federal Express trucks on delivery, car alarm systems going off, landscapers with leaf-blowers, lawnmowers and weed-eaters beginning at 6:00 am., honking car horns and stereo systems, helicopters, airplanes, skateboarders pounding the sidewalks, and other assorted noises.

The cost was great, it was $87 a night then but i see the price has gone up quite a bit and im not sure i would pay any more than i payed. When we got there no one was at the front desk and we found a maid outside who went in and got a key for us which we were a little concerned about (isnt the manager supposed to do this?) the room was really humid and had very bad air conditioning but it did come with a box fan, and the floor was really sandy but i understand this because you walk outside and the whole parking lot is covered in it. When we first got in the room we were a little confused as to where the promised microwave and fridge was and we found them hiding in the closet, which im not sure i liked because it was a cramped space and only 1 person could fit in at a time. Also we knew they didnt have a coffee maker in the room so we brought our own but there were no availabe plugs left in the closet and most of the ones in the room itself did not work so we had to unplug our microwave. and the bathroom is tiny i mean REALLY tiny! just a shower sink and travel trailor sized toilet and the window next to the toilet had no shade and opened up to a back ally where many kids would walk through and peek through them so we had to put a towel over it. The maids made sure the rooms got cleaned at least twice a day which was nice to be able to leave for the beach (which is right next to the hotel) and come back to a clean room. The pool was very green and smelled of pee in the area but it did have a shower to use after the beach so you wouldnt have to use the public one on the beach. One day we did have a 20 dollar bill go missing but we didnt complain because we were not sure if it was the maid or one of our family members who had taken it. Anyways the bed was comfy the coffee in the lobby was great and there was plenty of resteraunts and shopping right outside the hotel, if i go back to san diego and can get the same price i will stay here again.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Goodyear, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat Budget Hotel by the Beach\u201d", "Author": "whitethrone1", "ReviewID": "UR65848272", "Content": "The Pacific Shores Inn is a great budget hotel by the beach. Check-In: We booked through Expedia and got a rate with a coupon of $87 per night. When I arrived at the hotel check-in took no more than 5 minutes and our rooms was ready to go in the location we requested through Expedia. We requested a room on the end of the hotel closest to the beach. It also ended up right across from the pool. The Room: It was recently remodeled so everything looked new. The bed was amazingly comfortable and made for a great night's sleep! The room itself could have been a little larger as the door to the room hit the bed when you opened it. There was ample room at the ends of the beds though (we had 2 queens). The room had a separate room that was a closet/microwave/fridge room. This was nice as we stored our luggage and food in there which got it out of the way. The bathroom was very clean and updated. However, it was a bit small though. It also only had a shower (no tub). Very small counter space for the sink. We also had a flat panel TV with cable, a large dresser, and a small breakfast table with 2 chairs. Overall, the room suited us pretty well as we stayed there 4 nights with a 1 year old and a 4 year old. The room could have used a bit more lighting, but it wasn't really a problem. The main thing is that the beds were pillow-top and super comfortable. Other Amenities: The pool area was very nice and had a gas grill for use. The pool was \"heated\" but barely. So swimming in May was not a super easy task. The breakfast was probably the only major disappointment. Even to call it continental is a bit of a stretch. It basically consisted of a small selection of pastries, watered down coffee, and pulpy orange juice. Nothing more. Also note that the rooms have coffeemakers but if you want to make coffee you have to go to the front desk and get coffee, creamer, and cups. However, they give you as much as you ask for. Location: Incredible location for the price! There is only one small condo building between the hotel and the beach. It takes about 3 minutes to be on the beach after a walk down the ramp/steps at the end of the street. And there are many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

We found the drive to Sea World to be easy with routes to Mission Bay right down Mission Boulvard or over Grand Street to Ingrahm Ave. We tried the beach both off of the motel at pacific beach and down near Belmont Park on Mission beach. The Mission beach area is a little better for kids. Both are well patroled by lifeguards and the ocean surf is warm and fun to play in. We spent three nights at Pacific Shores. The motel is going through some \"growing\" pains with upgrading going on. One afternoon after returnign from the beach we were kept oput of returnign to our room while maintenance was replacing a light switch with sensor switch.

This is not a romantic place, it's a very functional place at a great price in a great location. I booked it solely based on reviews read here. We paid AAA rate of around $90. for week-end and $85. for week days. We had a top floor room (it's a 2 floor motel) with 2 queen beds and a partial view of the ocean (room 35). I booked with the hotel directly and was told that a partial ocean view was their maximum view. This was the case. We stayed 6 nights. Our bathroom was completely renovated with a window that opened. Beds were comfortable, Towels & toiletries better than you'd think at this price. A/C noisy but we ran it during the day when we weren't there and turned it off at night. The room had a ceiling fan, which was sufficient. FYI - outiside temperature was around 80 - 90 degrees F. during our stay. We had an outside table with seating. The balcony is like this: a long open area that fronts your room and all the adjoining rooms. If you have one of the first rooms in the row, you will have people walking right past your outside area. If you have the last room in the row, you have total privacy. Each room door is slightly angled so that you don't see your neighbour when sitting outside. No problem with maid service, parking or noise. Our room was probably 3/4 of the way down through the property (in the direction of the beach) so we were probably a bit further from the main road than many rooms. We could hear the ocean though! I didn't see any other rooms however, I think it's fair to say that some might not be in an ideal spot on the property, i.e. with the front of my car parked up against their front door. I found the front desk staff very good on the phone and in person, my travelling companion found some of the evening staff less than helpful. They weren't surly; they just didn't know anything!

No kitchette but what ever at this point. First irritation was Could not get the air conditioner to work properly. Once we did the thing rattled like it was going to fall out of the ceiling. Next there was a coffee maker in the room but they did not provide any complementary coffee or supplies, not even cups even if I wanted to purchase my own coffee and brew it. I just thought it was tacky. There was no rack or hooks to hang wet bath towels on so they would not dry. I thought this odd, especially with the issue of water conservation if you wanted to do your part to conserve water and reuse the towels. Then the room key stopped working. My huband and I were at the pool with just our towels and swim suits when he tried to go back to the room for an item when this was discovered. So he went to the office and asked if they would rectify the situation. They would not do it because he was not the one who checked us in! He had to go back to the pool and get me. They claim it was a security issue and had me sign my name on a piece of paper to match signatures against the check in signature. While I do understand security for the guest, it was irritating to say the least. ESPECIALLY when you see housekeeping with your room door wide open while they are cleaning! Who is to say that people walking by don't just pop in and help them selves! Overall the best part was the location.

We're both in our 60's, so by experience I mean, watch. We stayed for three nights Saturday-Monday after previously staying in Point Loma for three nights. We choose Pacific Shores Inn based on Travel Advisor reviews and the Inn's website. I was somewhat concerned when there was no way to verify my reservation via email (which I made directly by phoning the Inn, since their website did not offer me all the room choices I knew were available.) I wound up calling the Inn prior to leaving on vacation to verify the reservation. Once we arrived everything was exactly as requested. We asked for an upper level 2Q N/S room with kitchen, and a view of the ocean, if possible. The room was huge, with a separate kitchen area and table, a large main room with another table, and a very large walk in closet. The bathroom was above average, but the door was right next to one of the beds. About four rooms shared an outside balcony and each room had its own plastic table and chairs set outside into a little alcove by each room's door. There was a view of the ocean from the balcony, but since the boardwalk and beach was less than a half-block away we simply walked through the parking lot and there it was (except for one other property in front of the Inn). A pleasant surprise was the coin laundry. The Continenal breakfast was the standard rolls, coffee,fruit and juice, but the coffee was very good. One wing of the Inn was being extensively remodeled, the rooms were essentially being gutted and rebuilt. I would strongly suggest that you request an upper level room, and the one's with kitchens don't cost a lot more and appear to be a lot larger. Housekeeping was good, the staff was pleasant (I learned that the motel did not have an internet connection in the office except for the reservation system, which explains the lack of email confirmation.) The Inn is located near the northern end of the beach/boardwalk, which was great because it was less crowded and noisy, yet in a block or two you were right in the middle of the beach scene. We were fortunate to be there when the surf was unusually high and saw high waves, and dozens of surfers up and down the coast. Some of the surfers had come from long distances to take advantage of the waves and a few were staying at the Inn. The weather was perfect, sunny and in the 70's which was what we were seeking after a tough Wisconsin winter. The mid-January price was great , the room was perfect ...... but, I wouldn't want to stay there from Spring Break until the end of the year unless I was much younger, because Pacific Beach is striclty a youth-oriented destination most of the year. We had a few times where the outside noise in the parking lot was excessive, I imagine most of the time the area has a college-town atmosphere. I didn't see any children at the Inn, and almost none in the entire area. Along the boardwalk on the beach bluff there were numerous restaurants and bars, and the shopping area was eclectic. It is a great place to soak up the sun and people-watch, plus you can walk the beach for hours.

It was basically either freezing cold, really loud or both and I couldn't turn on the TV to drown out the noise b/c nothing was on. I generally found that room to be just disgusting. When I checked another avail. room (also non-renovated), it actually smelled worse. I got comped for my first night's stay - Partially and not fully which I regret not demanding and which I also resent the manager or people who work there for not offering. The manager was elusive with me which I didn't appreciate, but he did talk to someone who worked there and said he would give me a discounted rate at the other property he managed - The Holiday Inn in La Jolla, which turned out to be worlds better. However, if someone had offered this the first night I arrived there, I would've been spared the grossness of staying there at all. I was too tired and busy to switch at the time. I had a great time in SD anyway, but I just hope this may be helpful to someone somehow. I had was extremely uncomfortable and just gross.

Being so close to Central Park the neighborhood also feels more European and less frenetic. Some wonderful museums and restaurants are a short walk from the hotel. The doorman was friendly and helpful. Evening check-in was efficient but NOT welcoming or friendly. It seemed as if my associate and I had interrupted a conversation between the two receptionists. Neither the man nor woman welcomed us. There was no other guest at reception. I greeted them both and asked with a smile, \"Where does the line start?\" Now admittedly, my humor is not appreciated by everyone, but they both just stared at me... they said nothing. No smile. No greeting. Finally just \"What is your name Sir?\" The friendly doorman delivered my bag quickly and offered to place it (it's heavy and large) wherever I wanted it. The room was surprisingly spacious for NYC. Some of the furniture (not all) was beginning to look a little tired but all in all it was an inviting decor. The room and bathroom were spotless... except there were candy bar wrappers and other unidentifiable things on the floor between the nightstand and wall (I was looking for an outlet to charge my phone). I just wrote spotless... and 99% of it was... but there was a piece of onion (yes, onion) and some crumbs on the nightstand table top itself. The very cool and sophisticated radio/iPod-dock/nature-sound/clock had the correct time but was not illuminated and could not be seen during the day without staring into the front of the display and reading the black-on-black digital display. It could not be seen at night at all. Neither the radio nor nature-sounds worked. The bathroom was small but fine and the tiles, tub and sink were gleaming. Everything worked in that department. Two double beds, each with mattresses far too soft for my taste, led to a sore back each morning (my associate had the same comment). I would have liked a couple feather pillows from the many pillows provided, but alas, all foam. I didn't sleep well either night... (ditto my associate in his room). There was an empty cigarette pack and some scraps of paper on the floor outside my associate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room for the entire first day of our two-night stay. He picked it up and moved it to a telephone table outside the elevator. It stayed there, uncollected for the remainder of our visit. We had drinks at the attached restaurant. Excellent. Warm and friendly service. We didn't eat there but it was very inviting. Super decor and very alive. Not noisy. Looked great... as was the menu which we peeked at. The two elevators are slow.

All I can say is that for the price, it is well worth it. The room we had was small, but we were upgraded to a south facing room which provided for some awesome photos. I would like to answer some questions that others might have. For starters, there is a reserved drop-off/pick-up parking area in front of the hotel. You will likely have no problem when you arrive as to where to park while checking in. Now for parking, parking for me was around $70 and I parked Sunday night and left Wed. morning. The museum lot is only open from 8AM till 10 or 11PM. They shut the gate over-night, so if you are leaving in the middle of the night, don't park here!! There is also some parking on the street, but for about three or four hours on Monday and Thursdays, there is no parking...I think this is when streets are cleaned, but I don't know. I was able to save a day of parking charges thanks to the bellhop pointing out someone leaving..he saved me around $30, so I gave him $10 extra. Make sure you take your ticket to the front desk as they have the validation stickers there. Some may have questions about the subway system. There is a train stop right on the block, and despite the \"train sometimes skips this station\" notation in the NYC transit info, the C train never skipped this station from I would say 8AM to 8PM. So at a minimum, you can catch the C train during the morning and afternoon hours. In addition, there a station where you can catch the 1 train at 79th street just two blocks or so SW. You can take the 1 train one stop south (downtown) to the 71st street station and catch a #2 express if you wish. There is what I believe a 3rd party tourist info desk in the front lobby. During day hours, a person is there and they can sell you show tickets and such (from what I read). What is really great is the small display. They have a great map of Manhattan and the subway system. Overall, I was pleased with our stay. A/C worked great, instant hot water for showers. The staff were all friendly. A huge plus was that I decided to leave a day early. There was no charge for an early exit and I waited for them to bill my CC before posting to make sure they didn't charge me for that day.

My wife made a four night reservation at this \"luxury\" hotel, a stay that would keep her close to business meetings uptown. We reserved a particular room category but called later to upgrade. Mistake. When we arrived at the hotel, the receptionist, who, to us, could have been nominated for most surly hotel employee in NYC, told us that the room we had reserved was not upgradable - but we could re-book for an additional $100/night. She seemed to refuse to think we were truthful, noting that a hotel representative would never have told us what we were reporting. Figuring that we were misunderstood (rather than mendacious, a possibility she apparently could not conceive), we ignored the left handed way she appeared to tell us we were lying. A luxury hotel? Things seemed to be on the mend when she offered us a park view. As we were near the magnificence of Central Park, we immediately latched on to that four-day pleasantry. When we got to the room, many of the windows overlooked an airshaft, but some did face the Museum of Natural History. Nice enough, but not the Central Park view we had anticipated - and were seemingly promised for our not insignificant increase in rate. I called Ms. Guest-Friendly and noted the difference. She advised me to look out the window at the grass in front of the museum. \"We call that a park.\" Well, we don't, but oh, well. We had written to the hotel in advance requesting down pillows. (It's a luxury place, right?) Mistake. At bedtime, we called to note that our request had not been fulfilled. You guessed it. \"We don't have those.\" At one point, we asked for a turndown. Mistake. \"We don't offer that.\" Not at this luxury hotel. The bell staff was a comparative pleasure to work with, but the other professionals with whom we had contact seemed to have been cast by Alfred Hitchcock's Academy of Guest Relations. Note the reviews below that report similarly. We must congratulate the hotel manager who did decide to refund one night of surcharges because of our consistent unhappiness. Having prepaid the reservation, we couldn't leave and go elsewhere, but you can bet that the additional night we required in NYC was spent at one of our favorite hotels - a new 11th Avenue bastion of total elegance and four star service, a description that this hotel will not likely achieve, at least not from us.

The rooms are nice and meet our needs. They have made special considerations for me when I needed to keep a bicycle for a 4:00am bike ride. The location is fantastic if you like the Upper West Side (and we do). We will probably continue to stay at the Excelsior. I just wish that the staff was a little more sensitive to a traveler's needs. I've read a few other Tripadvisor reviews that mention a certain amount of ambivalence to the customers. I've always chalked that up to a culture clash between hardened New Yorkers and the throngs of tourists excited for their New York adventures. This last week I came to a realization that the staff just really doesn't see the need to go above and beyond. The specific example I have (and it seems a little petty when I think about it) deals with not having a printer available with their \"business center\". One of the last activities most travelers do today is print out a boarding pass so they can get make air travel a bit easier. And in every other hotel I've stayed in, and I've stayed in many, that service is now a given. It's one of those things that, if done well, will delight the hotel customer. Excelsior's policy seems to be built around protecting themselves against printer abuse. And to that end they've contracted the functionality out to a third party, and the customer has to pay the hotel $0.25 for every page the need to print. But more than that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Because the functionality is coming through a third party, the boarding passes you can see and print out from a web page have to be saved as a printable document. Now, there may be some more web savvy users out there that now how to do that instinctively, but I had to have the staff at the front desk talk me through it on the phone (I was trying to do it from my personal computer - did I mention that the Excelsior is charging you to access the Hotel's wifi so you can get to your boarding pass?). But because I had to print out not only 2 boarding passes, and 2 receipts for baggage charges, I also had to pay $0.25 for cover sheets for each of these documents. Why? Each of the documents already had my name on them. It was the same name that was going to be on the hotel room invoice. So after sending the documents to the printer, I had to ride the elevator down to the front desk (where I started in the first place because I assumed I could do all of this at their \"business center\") to see if they printed. The man at the desk (who I'd been on the phone with) wouldn't look me in the eye as he handed the print-outs to me. I said (calmly, because I'm not aggressive) \"This is the sort of thing that is going to lose this hotel business\". He replied, \"All the other hotels will also charge you for print outs\". (Again, he still wouldn't look me in the eye.) I answered, \"That's NOT true.\" And I went back to the elevator. The next day I looked at my hotel invoice and saw a charge for $12.50 for \"miscellaneous\". I called the front desk and asked what it was for, and person actually said \"let's see, you printed out 8 pieces of paper...how many pieces of paper did you print out?\" I answered, \"8 pieces - like you said\", and she said \"oh, we charged you $10 too much - I'll just refund you.\" I am left to wonder if the guy the night before didn't like being confronted about their ridiculous printing policy and decided to add an extra digit to my bill. So there it is, a bad taste left in my mouth at the end of an otherwise fine experience. A half an hour wasted - for both me and the staff - because the hotel wanted to get another $2.50 out of me. If the Excelsior Management is reading this, I hope they take a closer look at the policies that travelers have come to expect, and think of ways to surprise and delight us - not frustrate and waste our time.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lillehammer, Norway", "Title": "\u201cNice location, small rooms and poor staff.\u201d", "Author": "FN_Madball", "ReviewID": "UR115255375", "Content": "Hotel is located less than a block from the Metro and Central Park.

The hotel itself was beautifully presented, with a warm and inviting lobby with lots of comfortable furniture to sit and chat if you were waiting for someone etc. and the hotel looks like it's had a major makeover fairly recently. (I love that they've kept the original elevator doors, they're beautiful!) The staff were efficient and helpful, with someone on duty at all hours and the rooms were excellent with a comfortable bed and a great shower. We had a bit of a problem with our first room, due to noise and were given an upgrade to a fantastic room as soon as we mentioned it. But the best part was the locality. It is situated in a predominately residential area, with nice apartment blocks, as well as local restaurants, a couple of laundries (very handy) corner store, small shops etc. We walked to most of the places in downtown NY, or caught cabs that were really cheap, but also used the subway, (if we wanted to travel further out,) which was easy to use and close to the hotel. We went on one of the cruises out of Pier 81 on our first morning, which took us around the whole of Manhattan Island and gave us a fantastic perspective of New York as well as the history. It also provides the best opportunity for taking a photo of the Statue of Liberty and saves the cost of doing the tour there later. We then used the double decker tour buses to check out the sights and they were worth every cent. You can get a ticket for two days and hop on and off as you wish, stopping at any place that takes your fancy, all over NYC. The Greline coaches were the best. Buying your Broadway show tickets at Time Square is the only way to go - tickets half price, just make sure you get there to line up around 2:30 ready for the 3:00pm opening of the ticket office. If you want to avoid the queues at the Empire State, be there by around 9:30am. We got up to the top within fiftteen minutes - it can be 1 to 2 hours wait later in the day. The Ground Zero tour is highly reccommended, and left a deep impression of both of us. There's so much to see and do in NYC and we packed in quite a lot of it in seven days.

My room had the view only of the ventilation shaft in the middle of the building, but that was made up for by the room itself. Being Manhattan, I expected a closet-sized room. Au contrare. First there was a sitting room, with a spacious closet, desk, chair, couch, coffee table, and large flat-screen TV. Then, separated by French doors, was the bedroom. Not with the king bed that I'd reserved, but instead a pair of twins. (Disheartening, since I'm 6'4\".) There was also a dresser, two chairs, and a small table between them. Finally, the bathroom, of a perfectly normal size, with a full bathtub, toilet, and a somewhat oversized sink, somewhat larger than the bathroom than the one in my own ranch-style house at home.

In all, I was surprised and pleased with the decor, size, and comfort of my room. The bad news was the discovery of a bedbug nymph in the bathroom shortly after my arrival. I once had bedbugs at home, some years ago, so the little guy immediately looked familiar. Trapping it under a glass, I compared it to photos from entomology websites, and the reddish-brown insect was a dead match for an immature bedbug. I saw no adults, never woke to find myself being bitten, and several hours far checking out, I have none of the telltale welts. I was going to quietly inform the hotel staff of this discovery upon my checkout, but the desk was staffed by a lone man who was barely awake, and I could not manage to deliver this news to him.

Overall the Excelsior is OK but the rooms we stayed in (902 and 906) were very dated. We had two single beds in each room and they were probably the smallest beds that we had slept in in New York and the bedspreads were like something your granny would have on her bed! On each bed there was just a sheet and the granny's bedspread with just one blanket in the cupboard. I guess if we had needed another blanket then we could have got one, but for New York in December a sheet and thin bedspread is really not adequate. The heating in the rooms was a frankly nightmare; either far too hot, too cold or too noisy. it was really impossible to get the temperature right. The windows were very drafty. The bathrooms however were spotlessly clean, but the bath tub did look quite small - not really big enough to lie down in although none of us tried. The point is that any hotel you stay in in NYC is just to sleep in and for the price we paid for this hotel was a good base, but we have stayed in much better 4 star hotels in NYC - The Waldorf, Sheraton Towers, Barclay Intercontinental - which were much plusher with much better public areas, better bedrooms, much better beds and closer to the action. The location is fine being just a block from Central Park and the nearest subway station (81st Street) was on the corner, so if you have bought an unlimited 7 day Metrocard for $27 you will get your money's worth. There were lots of good eateries in Amsterdam Avenue and good places for early morning coffee and muffins a short walking distance from the hotel, and also breakfast diners.

The hotel is an older hotel and the decore in the reception area is in keeping with this, everything is very clean and nice. The elevators were very quick and a good size. The corridors and the room itself are clean but in needs of a refurbishment. Our room had single beds, haven't experienced that in a while and everything, whilst clean, is old and dated. The safe didn't work in our room and I had to dry my hair in 3 stages as the hairdryer in the bathroom overheats and shuts off. The shower head, which doesn't move, points sideways at a wall so you have to get between it and the wall to have a shower. There were also no Tea or Coffee making facilities in the room and the rooms do not have air con. The area around the hotel is very nice and there are quite a few restaurants in the area to choose from as well as deli and supermarkets to pick stuff up from. There is a subway station at the end of the block. I was glad I got a good price for the hotel and it was probably about worth what I paid for it. I would not have been pleased if I had paid full price for this as even for New York I would have been over charged. That being said, I would stay at this hotel again if I got a good deal on the price as it is perfectly acceptable.

There is a no slip mat for kids located in the bathtub hanging on a metal fixture which we thought was odd. Our room had an older small colour TV and I would have preferred a larger flat sceeen TV.

The hotel is conveniently located one block from Central Park and across from the Museum of Natural History. There is a playground for kids just inside the park on the left hand side that my children really liked. If you walked north from that location there are 2 more playgrounds for children. They are both quite sandy and have water elements. Pack aqua socks/crocs and a swimsuit if you are using these playgrounds in the summer. We took the kids down south through the park to the Boathouse for lunch. There is a great takeout area beside the indoor restaurant with a family friendly eating area with shade and sun. The hotel is a block from Columbus Avenue where there is a Starbucks (N/W corner) that opens at 6AM and many family friendly restaurants.

The metro is right on the street corner so very handy to get further down the island if you dont want to walk. The excelsior is 'quaint' and traditional but clean and very comfortable. nice rooms with plenty of space and nice traditional bathrooms. tip: ask for a room not next to the lifts as they can be a little noisy if you want a lie in! The service is very good and all staff very pleasant. We didnt eat in the hotel (it was a little too upmarket for us) but found lots of lovely places to eat. try the cupcakes at magnolias bakery on 71st street or brooklyn diner on 56th. Wholefoods at columbus circle is great for picnic food to eat in the park but also has a eat in area as well if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat from the massive deli. other tips we recommend is the helicopter ride over manhattan - worth every penny, if that is a little out of budget try theboat trip round the bottom of the island - excellent value for money and a great way to see and find out more about NYC. Go to WTC site - a very moving experience, the wtc tribute centre is definately worth a look when your there too. we 'did' the tv and movie theatre trip, again great value and very entertaining! lots to see in the 3 hours and they show you clips of the films on the tour so you can compare fact from fiction!

The location of the hotel was perfect, close to bus stops, the subway and cabs go past the hotel all the time. Lots of great areas just walking distance though, including Central Park, Broadway etc. Lots of great places to eat close by too.

The Excelsior has a certain traditional old world atmosphere that we found quite cosy. The rooms are perhaps a little worn but very clean. The front desk staff were ok and professional, no complaints about that. Don't use the $10 breakfast buffet, it's not worth it. The avenues nearby - Columbus, Amsterdam and Broadway - all offer plenty of breakfast choices, for example Manhattan Diner is excellent. Visit Zabar's at Broadway for delicacy souvenirs.

The group consisted of my husband and me and our friend and her boyfriend. (All in our 20s.) We got a great deal through Travelocity -- two nights plus airfare from Pittsburgh for $519/couple. My husband and I stayed at the Excelsior several years ago and enjoyed our stay. So, I booked without consulting tripadvisor first. But I got worried when I read some of the reviews -- had the place gone to pot in those years? NO! The hotel is a solid 3* joint. It has a lovely lobby and the front desk people were very pleasant, despite the fact that the hotel was full. (The poor bellman seemed a bit overwhelmed, but was very professional nonetheless.) The hotel also has a restaurant which is very well reviewed, but we never got the chance to step in as we were too busy running around the city. I was quite pleased with our room, which I conclude was an upgrade from what we booked. (Our room the first trip, though large for NYC, was not nearly as big.) We had a two-room, I guess it must be called, suite. The bedroom had a queen size bed and the adjoining room had its own television (which I couldn't get to show cable, but I didn't call to see what the deal was either since I didn't care) and a pull-out couch. The linens were of nice quality, as were the toiletries left for us. Though I didn't check, our friends apparently had the same type of room on the other side of our floor. The desk and a few cracked tiles in the bathroom did show some limited signs of wear -- but certainly not unattractive. I think the only reason I even noticed was because of some of the reviews I'd read on this website. Oh, and for the reviewer complaining about the street noise -- are you kidding me?! It's New York! While I didn't notice ANY street noise at the Excelsior, I certainly expect some when I have a street-facing room in NYC! The hotel is in a great location. (I personally prefer to stay out of midtown b/c it's just not my scene.) There is a subway station at the end of the block, as is Central Park. The natural history museum is right across the street. We found things we want to do well within walking distance. (For example, we walked from Rockefeller Center through the Park to the hotel, which a stop at the Shake Shack to be a fun afternoon activity. If you stay at this hotel, you must stop at the Shake Shack!) All in all, the four of us were perfectly pleased by our stay. (It would have been a good deal even at much higher price!) As it turned out, I stayed an extra night in the City for business, transferring to the Benjamin (Lex at 50th) to be closer to my firm's NYC office since it was St. Pat's and I knew the City would be a mess. While the Benjamin was a bit nicer, I wouldn't pick it over the Excelsior except for the reason that brought me there in the first place. Also -- for your reference (since I find these things to be important in evaluating a review) -- I travel reasonably frequently for business (staying in Hyatts and Omnis generally) and have stayed in NYC many times (for pleasure) at hotels such as the Hyatt at Grand Central, the Millennium Hilton, Le Parker Meridien, and the Sheraton.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colombia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel, but beware of the rude and menacing maintenance guy\u201d", "Author": "cristynewyork", "ReviewID": "UR26877189", "Content": "We we very well impressed by the location and good quality of the hotel, good and confortable room, good toilette and good service upon arrival, all went well until we had to call maintenance in order to take our things out of the safe becoiuse it run out of batteries.

As others have mentioned, the heating unit can be very noisey , and our's prevented us from getting a decent night's sleep during our two night stay. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful , which wasn't the case on my previous visits.( looked like some new faces). Our room with twin beds was small and one of the beds was in front of the closet , which made it difficult to get to.

We stayed on a room only basis preferring to sample local diners for breakfast. I can recommend Barney Greengrass - a jewish diner/deli on Amerstam which offered interesting concoctions and unlimited coffee plus a diner called 'Good Enough to Eat' which does excellent pancakes with different toppings and unlimited coffee refills. This wasn't so good for evening meals we found.

The lobby was gorgeous. We were able to have our bags held by the bellman for an extended amount of time both before and after our check-in and out, with ease and professionalism. We were incorrectly booked by Travelocity for two twin beds, which could have been a hassle, but instead the front desk gentleman switched us to a large junior suite with a queen bed without us even asking. The suite was very clean, notably the bathroom, which sometimes seems to suffer in city hotels. When we needed extra towels, they were up within 5 minutes. The AC worked great, not loud at all. The mini-bar is pricey, but hello....it is NYC, and the prices are listed on a menu next to the minibar, so you know what to expect. The location was great, well-lit and safe, within 5 minutes walking distance from the subway, central park, museum of natural history, and several restaurants. The only negative thing I could say was the view of our room was towards a brick wall. However, we did not specify what view we would have liked, so I would suggest asking for a \"park\" view when either booking or checking in. This did not bother us, as we only were in our room when sleeping, changing or showering.

The sofa bed that our sons slept on had a surprisingly comfortable mattress. We were a little disappointed that our suite wasn't higher--it was on the fourth floor. The street noise was considerable, although by the second night our sons were immune to it. In the bedroom, with the French doors closed, we couldn't hear it. We had a park view, but perhaps the cheaper courtyard view would minimize the street noise. The only thing missing about our visit was room service. The Excelsior Hotel doesn't have it, and with two kids, the idea of heading out for dinner or waiting for breakfast can be too much.

Not only did no-one seem to vacuum during our four night stay, but also apparently not between guests. Gross! Also our trash was never emptied - despite our ordering in food usually once a day, and our bathroom was left untouched. However, someone was coming into the room everyday as they kept closing the net curtains that we were leaving open. Too bad they didn't think to clean while they were there! However, none of this was a surprise after the 'welcome' we received. Even though we were carrying a one year old, 3 big bags, a diaper bag, two back packs and a stroller, none of the three doormen who were standing around chatting thought to help us out at all. The only time help was 'offered' was when the concierge jumped up to tell us we couldn't go to our room with all that and had to have a bellman help...oh well. We were already loaded into the elevator at that point...hmmmm But paled in comparison to our treatment by the guy at the front desk who was EXTREMELY rude to us and all the other guests I saw him speak to.

When we left the hotel, we turned right and walked up to Broadway (2 blocks). Turn left on Broadway and pass Filenes at 79th. The diner is on the same side of the street as Filenes just past it on Broadway and 78th. The breakfast includes freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee. There are about 8 full selections, as well as ala carte choices. I had the full breakfast and chose the challah french toast with a generous serving of bacon. The entire bill was 6.50 with tax! For lunch try Artie's Deli. Wonderful! Just turn right when leaving the hotel,and walk to Broadway. This time, go right on Broadway and walk to 83rd. Huge sandwiches, great matzo ball soup and very fair prices. Had dinner at Freds one night and Pergola des Artistes the other. The later offers wonderful fixed price French dinners. We took a taxi there and I believe it is at 46th Street on the west side near Times Square. Worth the trip! The hotel stored our luggage on our 3rd day there as we had an evening flight home.

I do suggest you let them call a car for you when you need to check out so you don't have to wait for a taxi. Not a whole lot more and it was reassuring to know it would be there on time. The subway is very close so getting into Times Square was never a problem. Beware though, we tried to take the subway back late one evening and the line we needed was already closed. Some taxis do not want to take you from Times Square back to Central Park West. It took us over an hour to get a taxi. Overall, it was a nice place to stay.

If you're not a fan of walking the subway is right on the corner of 8th. I really liked the area as it was not as touristy as mid town near Times Square, but still pretty central.

I chose the hotel primarily due to cost and the fact that I booked late. All hotels near the conference were booking in at over $500 for a Wednesday through Friday stay in early November, which was not in my department budget, even for NYC. I found the Excelsior on Travelocity for a reasonable price (package deal with airfare for $681), researched it on TripAdvisor.com and booked it with a bit of trepidation due to the negative comments on the staff. My experience was mostly positive with a few exceptions. Positives: * GREAT location! Very safe, residential neighborhood, but close to food, bookstores and shops on Columbus and Broadway. Not to mention proximity to museums and Central Park. * Nice rooms. Not the biggest in the world, but not the smallest I've seen in NYC either. The room I had overlooked the park across the street and had ample room for two adults (although I was traveling alone) and luggage without an issue. * Accessible to transportation. With subway stops within a block of the hotel that will whisk you away to anywhere in Manhattan for $2.00, even those of us with an expense account to pay for taxi transportation would rather take the subway (see negatives regarding more on the taxi service at the location). * Quiet. This hotel is out of the bustle of midtown or some of the lower manhattan hotels. It is, for all intents and purposes, a residential neighborhood. I had quite a good time on my one day off (Wednesday) hanging at Starbucks watching dogwalkers, moms and nannys walk by with their charges and then heading off to the Barnes & Noble and doing the same thing. * Doorman and bellmen are amazingly service oriented! These guys did everything right and made sure I was well taken care of at all turns. Negatives: * Some of the other reviewers are right, SOME of the staff has issues. Desk agents are less than helpful, whether it be checking in, checking out or any other problem you bring to their attention. They seem frazzled and uncaring. Whether it's an understaffing situation or just that they'd rather be lottery winners, I'm not sure, but this should be addressed by management. * The one problem that was irritating was that the remote control in my room for my television did not work. Right, just get off your lazy butt and change the channel, you're saying. he problem being is they use a LodgeNET system, which works on channel 3 of the television and relies on the remote to actually surf away from the menu channel. Despite several calls and stops at the desk, when I left on Friday morning, I still had no access to television. I didn't mind, I read a book and worked a bit on my laptop, but the point is, this level of service (or lackthereof) on the part of the desk staff is unacceptable at any level. * Taxis. This is not the fault of the hotel, but during peak rush times and bad weather, getting a taxi in front of the hotel is near impossible (see subway alternative perk though). Getting to the airport on Friday in the rain, thank GOD the bellman knew this and had cost-effective alternatives to offer me. All in all, I'd stay here again and, as a matter of fact, I am planning a mini-vacation trip here next year and will more than likely stay at the Excelsior again. Bottom line, yes there are some minor service issues, but going in with your eyes open and realizing that you, as an individual can also be responsible for your own wake-up calls (there are alarm clocks in the room and my cell phone alarm woke me just fine) and other things you don't think twice about doing for yourself at home, I think you'll be pleasantly suprised with the Excelsior.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201cI Love New York\u201d", "Author": "sez-jay", "ReviewID": "UR11123606", "Content": "having read previous review we were quite concerned as some were negative, however we are delighted to report the hotel was excellent!

The air conditioner couldn't muster the oomph to actually cool the entire room. Someone vacuuming over our heads woke us up before 8 a.m. on Sunday morning. And as others have reported here, the front desk staff were dreadful. We were in town for the weekend to attend a baseball game, and having noticed that the subway train we intended to take didn't seem to run on weekends, we asked at the front desk if it was possible to take the subway from the corner station to Yankee Stadium on a Saturday. They said no. When we asked the best way to get there on a weekend, the desk clerk said he was sure one of the many brochures on their concierge desk could tell us. He'd have lost points with me for rudeness and general uselessness even if his answers hadn't ultimately proved wrong. (Yes, you can take the subway from that station to the stadium, even on weekends. And the game was great, by the way, except perhaps for people from Tampa.) But the front desk has to get that question from guests over and over again, which makes his answer seem as much malicious as stupid. And as for writing that off as \"just a New Yorker,\" I'd have to say we've found New Yorkers to be the some of the most outgoing and helpful people in the world. My children joke that every time you stop to read a subway map in the city, some passer-by will ask what you're looking for and offer to help.

We were given a free upgrade to a Suite ( even though the Hotel was very full ) Just by asking for a nice room & the price of a smile... All through our stay, the desk staff went out of their way to be helpful, answering any questions we had quickly & politely.. the other members of staff ( in the Breakfast room & Lobby ) remembered us quickly & made a fuss of our son each time they saw us, adding to the freindly atmosphere we experienced all over New York...Our suite was comfortable with big fluffy robes to wear & was cleaned & restocked with fresh towels each day.. The housekeeping staff even tidyed Travis's cot & regrouped all his Soft toys! Just a couple of minor gripes... 1. not having a Coffee/Tea maker in the room, but Starbucks is only two minutes walk from the hotel, so my husband went & got a take out for us each day while I got Travis ready to go... 2. No Bar or restaurant for the evening... But there are LOADS within a block or two so it was not too much of a problem... We did have breakfast in the hotel twice ( $19 for a full American breakfast, fresh cooked for you ) which was nice, but there are plenty of places just outside if you want something different or want to spend a little less.. The location was great, just half a block from Central Park & right by the Natural History museum.. The Subway is just two minutes from the hotel, but the walk through the park is so nice we prefered to do that, as we needed to carry Travis's wheelchair down into the 81st street subway due to no lifts. Also we were pleased that some New York taxis cabs are able to take a wheel chair, so we had a ride or two when we were too tired to walk..! The very best thing about the Hotel is how peaceful it is after a day of sightseeing or shopping..

Initially couldnt find the booking but found it under another name (my partners). I suspect we had a single room originally as he looked shocked when i told him there was 2 of us. However he checked the booking and immediately sorted the problem without bothering me with it! We were then shown to room 906, clean, fresh, light and airy with 2 large picture windows that opened onto a lovely view of the natural history museum gardens, the museum itself and some of the city skyline and if you craned your neck to the left a little you could see central Park! It was also great to have a bathroom window that opened, again clean, fresh and plenty of fluffy white towels available. Great water pressure too. The bed was a queen, comfy and well stocked with big pillows and a fleecy blanket as well as a quilt and top sheet. We faced onto the street which admittedly was noisy with the windows open but no more noisy than the main street we stayed on in Paris, Havana, Toronto, London and all other major cities we have visited and i wouldnt have sacrificed the view. We didnt use hotel catering at all during our stay so cannot comment on it, however we did have a problem with the safe and had to call maintenance in to sort it. He was a miserable bloke really, so much so he was actually laughable so we didnt allow his rude attitude to reflect upon other staff who were helpful and courteous.

I would recommend any of the dry cleaners in the area (and there are at least 2 that are seconds away from the hotel). We saw lots of locals using them as were a lot cheaper than the hotel service. The general area and location of this hotel was faultless, the subway is one block away and there are literally hundreds of local places to eat that serve everything from mexican to chinese to steaks to tofu! We found Columbus to be the best street. I agree with the person that mentioned the dog walkers, literally hundreds of locals out walking their dogs of all shapes and sizes. After a few days you start to see the same faces (both canine and human) and it was great to be in a nice residential area. We also asked for directions occasionally and people were really friendly and glad to help, we even shared a taxi ride on a Friday evening as it was raining!

Although, I had not stayed here in a while because I have found On The Avenue to be fantastic and cheaper. Nevertheless, I found On the Ave sold out for this weekend and decided to book a room at the Excelsior. I was already aware that the rooms at this hotel are reminiscent of staying with your Grandmother, but I was okay with that, plus it was the only room I could find up here.

I can tell this bothers him, and I say, \"I do think it is a bit rude that you are chatting on the phone while I am trying to check in to the room I am paying for. He says he is making flight arrangements that must be done at this very moment.....not sure where jesus fits into flight arrangements these days. I mention that I heard him discussing Jesus and the bathing of feet, not flight arrangements....he says this is his religion and it is very important to him. At this point I must add, this is not some sweet distracted man talking about the Lord. He sounds like his is gossiping about celebs while on the phone and his manner of speaking is so quick, sharp and filled with such bitterness and anger it is totally shocking. He is completing my room confirmation (still on the phone 'gabbing'.....I am not deaf, he was not making 'flight arrangements' ) I say,\" Really, this is very rude\".....he then, in last ditch attempt to make his story real says to the person on the phone,\"I will have to call you back....will you hold those seats\"....c'mon, give me a break. He begins to lambaste my sister and I for throwing my credit card at him.....this did not happen AT ALL...my sister looks at me like is this guy for real? I told him why I thought it was rude, but he was so worked up I don't think he was listening or he even heard my sister say...maybe you are having a bad day...he was just railing on about how he hadn't done anything wrong.....obviously to be that worked up there must have been something going on. I proceeded to explain how I would have appreciated...\"Welcome, sorry I need to be on the phone can i get your information\"....or any variation on that theme.*(p.s. I paying a chunk of change for a 1 bedroom suite) I tell you, this was the most shocking service I have ever had...after I got his name, Joseph, if that is his name.

We have very mixed feelings about this hotel which pretty much concur with the last reviewer. Good points: The hotel is comfy and our room was clean although rather dated decor wise. The location is safe - it's more of a residential district so people out and about tend to be locals walking dogs (spotted more breeds than at crufts!) and hustling to and fro from work. As has been stated many times before, the location is great for central park, the Museum of Natural History (just across the street and a full day trip if you have children with you. Excellent IMAX presentation about the latest Rover moon landings, and an impressive planetarium) and the Metropolitan Museum which is a 10 min stroll accross the park to 5th Avenue. The housekeeping staff were great - our 9 yr old daughter vomited quite spectacularly in the lift one evening which we were mortified about but they couldn't have been nicer about it. To be honest we didn't find the desk staff rude or unhelpful - just perfunctory. Now the bad: We were on the 10th floor and found the noise level from the street quite intrusive, especially early in the morning. The lack of facilities is frustrating - no tea or coffee making facilities, no bar (can't really take the kids out bar hopping of an evening!) and no food except breakfast which we risked on our first morning - weird, stuffy dining room like a Victorian front parlour with no windows, and the cost was ridiculous $20 for a cooked breakfast and $16 for continental! $75 (inc. tax) for breakfast every day not really feasible for a family of four. There are lots of places along Columbus just a few minutes walk away were 2 teas, 2 juices, 4 pastries and a few pieces of fruit averaged around $24 the lot. The door man and concierge are quite amusing - tripping over each other to help with cases even when you don't want help. Had the opportunity to watch them in action for about half an hour whilst waiting for our airport shuttle - how moving a case 20 foot from the street to the desk and visa versa warrants the kind of tips they get is beyond me. We asked the concierge about theatre tickets for Mary Poppins, which provoked a sharp intake of breath and much talk about how difficult they were to get hold of. Eventually said he could get them for $118 each, so we phoned the theatre direct and got 4 good seats for the following night for $50 each!

(Every other hotel reservation I've ever made has never had such a silly policy.) The reservations agent refused to cancel my reservation. I told her that I couldn't cancel my reservation online because didn't have a password for the website, never had a password for the website, and none of the emails from the hotel would go through my spamblocker, so it was impossible for me to obtain a password in order to retrieve the reservation. The reservations agent argued and argued with me, asking how did I make the reservation in the first place. Finally, I asked her \"are you refusing to cancel my reservation?\" After all that arguing and grief, she finally grudgingly said she would. If you ever deal with this agent, beware. She said her name is \"Daisy.\" Now, I'll just have to double check my credit card statement to make sure the hotel doesn't charge me.

He said to me, \"what's she talking about? we have six carts!\" After finally locating the World Smallest Closet - actually a tiny broom closet with a single one-foot bar that faces forward so you could only see the last item of clothing on the rack, and that only after removing the ironing board from it so it was possible to put anything at all on the rack - I called and asked for another room. The same desk person said \"they're all like that\" and if we wanted a better room we would have to get a suite for an additional $120 or so per night over the $239 we were already paying. We asked if they had a rack or wardrobe or anything at all that my wife and I could use to hang clothes; she said she'd check with housekeeping and get back to us. She never did.

We were hard pressed to find something in New York under $300 a night because many colleges had their graduations the same weekend we were staying. We got our room for $239 a night (queen bed) and were very happy to get that rate. [As a comparison, the less than stellar Hotel Penn was going for $199.] The room was very clean and nicely furnished. It was small by national standards, but average sized for New York. The equipment in the gym was kept up and the continental breakfast was nice, if a little pricey ($14.50 per person). It's the other end of the block from a subway stop and Central Park. Good eating (and shopping) are to be found on Columbus Avenue (a 30 second walk from the hotel) and Amsterdam Avenue (the next block over) and Broadway (the next block after Amsterdam). The natural history museum is across the street, which our room overlooked. Drawbacks? If you need two beds, this is not the hotel for you. If you are in town for business and need to be at Wall Street or Midtown, this is not a good location for you. And the air conditioning seems to be all or nothing. There is no room service, but all the area restaurants deliver. (This is New York--even McDonald's delivers.)

Having stayed mid-town a quite a few times I much prefer the Upper West Side for relaxing in after a long days sightseeing and museum visiting. The restaurants, bakeries and delis are more \"local\" than mid town and the pace alittle more relaxing and less pressured than the key tourist areas. I can see that the reception staff could be described as abrupt but other than checking in and out I've been fortunate not to have reason to have further contact. Housekeeping was efficient and polite. Rooms are spacious compared with my experience midtown and pleasant enough to relax in at the end of a long day. Starbucks across the way good for coffee/breakfast. Subway very close as is Central Park- for that stroll across to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

However, although I found it pleasantly warm to begin with, we almost cooked overnight, and we were unable to turn the heating off. We had all windows and even the door open just to enable us to breathe. This of course let all the noise from the street in. Needless to say, we had little sleep which was a shame as it totally wrecked one of our two days in New York. I think I had a better sleep in the plane on the 20 hour flight back to Australia. I found the night staff unfriendly and not at all apologetic. Some kind of compensation would have been appreciated. The day staff were much more pleasant. On the second night we were given another room on the 15th floor. It was nowhere near as nice as the first room but at least we slept and it was noticeably quieter than the 7th floor. I think the hotel could be great with a better heating/cooling system (I see others have suffered the same fate) and some improvement in customer relations from the night staff. The position is good.

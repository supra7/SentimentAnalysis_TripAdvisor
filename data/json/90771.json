We were in town for an athletic event and had 10 rooms reserved for 2 nights each. The hotel itself is quite large. There were several buildings, most of which seemed empty while we were there (red flag!). Assuming my room was typical, it wasn't much to speak of. It was fairly small and the decor was outdated. As mentioned in previous reviews, the choice of tv stations is pitiful. Maybe 15 stations total, and a poor choice of stations at that. The room appeared fairly clean, and it was adequate for a budget stay. However, in one of our other rooms we had a player who had a series of what appeared to be spider bites going up her side when she woke up in the morning. I asked the front desk if it could have been bedbugs and they said they were sure it was spiders. Either way, obviously unacceptable. They put the players in a different room and they did comp us for the original room. Another room had key cards that continually malfunctioned and would work once or twice and then were useless. On several different occasions we had to go get new keys. Finally, they put the players in that room into 2 separate new rooms and only charged for one. So the staff did try to accommodate us and address the issues, but these were things that never should have been issues in the first place. If I were to visit Branson on my own as part of a vacation or some other outing, I would not consider staying at this hotel again, unless I was on an extremely tight budget.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cKeep Looking\u201d", "Author": "Paul M", "ReviewID": "UR134577677", "Content": "Service : Front desk and any other employee I ran into were all quite friendly and helpful but in no hurry to accomplish any task.

The decor for our room was typical, two beds and a television. It wasn't fancy but had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The room was clean and the cleaning staff did an excellent job each day in making sure the room was always clean when we returned. Each morning we went down to the breakfast area to eat. The complimentary breakfast provided a large selection to choose from. We especially enjoyed making our waffles each morning. There was also ample tables and chairs so that we never felt overcrowded as we ate our meal. It was a great way to start the day. We will definitely stay at the Days Inn Branson the next time we visit Branson. What we liked best was the price and the location. It was affordable which allowed us to have more of our money for having fun while we were there. The only thing that we did not like was being on the second floor and having to walk up the stairs. Next time I will ask for a ground floor room.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sand Springs, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok - pool was nice!!\u201d", "Author": "spinegirly", "ReviewID": "UR113862227", "Content": "Upon arrival they gave us a smoking room and it stunk so bad.

Once I gave her my name, I heard him say \"hold on just a minute\" He turned to me and said \"Are you Randy?\" To which I responded yes. he said \"You have a phone call\". When I took the phone, there is nothing but silence on the other end. Thats when he started laughing and said ah I am just playing with you. The girl waiting on me said the room assigned to me would not be ready until 3:00. I was understanding, because housekeeping was not finished for the day. I had reserved a queen room and had asked if the room was somewhat close to the pool, because I knew my oldest son would want to swim. I was told that it was not, but that there was a room very close to the pool, but it was only a full size room. We opted to stay with the Queen room. Our plans were to go to Silver Dollar City, but we did not want to leave our items in the car until 7:00 when we finished our day. So we did some shopping while we waited. We returned at 3:00 and got our room on the second floor in Building #4. We grabbed all of our stuff, made it upstairs with the boys and opened our door to find the room not cleaned. I called the front desk and they told me housekeeping had finished for the day. They told me that I could come back to the front desk and they would get me a different room. I once again asked if they could get me closer to the pool, they offered the same rooms as before. I told them that was alright. So, we grabbed all of our suitcases loaded them and the kids back up in the van, drove back to the office to get our new room. When I arrived, The guy who pulled the phone prank on me informed me I was now in building 6 on the fourth floor. The building farthest away as possible. I said \"You have to be kidding\" I was told that was all they had available. I was not happy at all. I expressed my dissatisfaction and was told that was all they could do. I took the key and started to walk out. I decided to ask if I was required to stay there, since my room was not ready and I was pushed so far down. When I turned around both clerks (the guy who waited on me and an older lady) were snickering and shaking their heads at each other. This further infuriated me, but I kept my cool. I asked if I was required to stay and was told I was not. We went to our room, (seeing maids still cleaning other buildings along the way), drug the kids and our luggage to the fourth floor and unpacked in a room with beds that had as much spring as antique beds and a toilet that kept running. We discussed leaving and going to another hotel. But it was already 3:30 and Silver Dollar City was closing at 7, so we decided to stick it out. We went to SDC and returned later that night, to find only 4 cars (including our own) at building 6. Building 4 where we were originally had 4 cars as well. The buildings closer to the lobby were more full, but it was obvious there were PLENTY of empty rooms throughout the complex. The next night there were 6 cars at our building and a few more throughout the complex, but once again, plenty of empty rooms. I complained to Days Inn Customer Service 3 times before this motel responded. Once they did, they argued with me &informed me that it was their decision, nothing had happened innappropriate, but they talked to their staff. I finally did get a $20 refund from Days Inn Corporate... Oh boy, I can take the family out for burgers now!", "Date": "July 20, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cNever again.....\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR979288", "Content": "This was the first hotel that we ever stayed in in Branson, but never again. The first room that they put us in was totally out of date, smelled old and musty. Nasty carpet. When turning back the bed, we noticed the linens had not been changed from the previous nights guest. They did give us another room that seemed to be a little newer, but still not what I considered to be a nice room. They really need to refurbish parts of thier hotel.", "Date": "April 23, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Days Inn Branson", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d90771-Reviews-Days_Inn_Branson-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$56 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3524 Keeter Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65616</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "90771", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/40/69/406917cdc7e773300d78111bcf7deec51large.jpg"}}

If you are on a tight budget in Chicago, the Tremont may be a good option for you. The location, just off Magnificent Mile, is excellent. We stayed here in August, at a time when other rooms in the area were at least 3 x's the price per night. It was awesome getting up in the morning, walking one way to Michigan Ave, walking the other way to the Red Line. As far as the hotel itself, well.... It was very dark, and had a stale feeling to it. I didn't care for our room: it was outdated and the carpet always felt slightly semi-damp to me, although my husband said it didn't really feel that way to him. I did not feel comfortable walking around the room in my bare feet. Although the room seemed kind of musty to me, it was quiet (except for an occasional vent/AC sound?), and the bed and bathroom were clean. I think if the hotel were to update the rooms, even with just new paint and carpet, it would make a world of difference.

It was a last minute business trip and the price was actually considerably lower than the other premium hotels in the area, so I booked it. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it was a Starwood property when I checked in. I guess that was a plus too if you're a Starwood person. Check-in was fine, polite and helpful desk attendant. To go up to the room, I had to get into the hotel's LONE elevator. It's a 16-story hotel and they have one elevator. Waiting on the elevator never took less than a couple of minutes, which was highly annoying. Also - no gym. My option was to walk down the street to the Westin to work out which I did. But there is no locker room facilities there, so you have to think through that process - Chicago in November/December is cold. I wore regular clothes over to the hotel with my overcoat and changed in a bathroom. I did the same after the workout. Not exactly convenient.

The Tremont Hotel is a few blocks from the lakefront, right next to Mike Ditka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, and literally a few steps from the Miracle Mile. Just around the corner, is the old water tower. You could not ask for a better location in Downtown Chicago, especially if you are planning to buy a Rolls Royce\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I think the dealership is right around the corner from them. Good things: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel is reasonably priced for Downtown Chicago. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The reservation system was quite efficient, and unlike many other Downtown Chicago hotels, we got what we asked for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nonsmoking, clean, that faced away from the street. The room itself was of average size for a Downtown Chicago hotel, reasonably clean, and had a bathroom with hot water than came on immediately and stayed through a nice long soaking shower. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The best thing about the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bed. An excellent, firm mattress, lots of extra pillows, and extra blankets. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A very friendly place! We did really did get to know the folks in the room next door to us quite well. They had read a half of what Ben Franklin had to say. You know, that line about early to bed and early to rise. They read the early to rise part, but not the early to bed. We know they were early to rise, because at 7:30 in the morning, Chicago time (remember, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5:30 in the morning California time on Sunday), we could hear the television from their room better than we could hear the television when we turned it on in our room. We also know that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t early to bed. In fact, beddy-bye time for them was about 0300, but they got back from whatever bar they were visiting at about 0200. At least they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn on the TV; they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it, because the three or four of them were having such a good time with their drunken rambling and high-pitched cackling laugh, that they might not have noticed the television anyway. We enjoyed their company almost as much as we enjoyed breakfast the next morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Negatives: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The staff (!). Ask them whether there is a health club in the hotel, and they do not think so, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure. Ask them whether the hotel provides vouchers for a nearby health club, and they do not think so, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure. Ask them whether there is a health club nearby the hotel, and they do not think so, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure. At least they were not negative about anything, but we ultimately concluded that they do not think too much. And I do not think much of them. And I am sure. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Climate control in the room did not work at all. We visited this hotel during October. The temperature outside was in the low 60s during the day and down into the 50s at night. The temperature in the room was very little different. We asked the staff if they could get it to work, and we got the reply that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d gotten used to: they do not think so, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Breakfast. They called it a continental breakfast for $5. Tepid coffee, orange juice from concentrate, rolls that I think came out of a Sara Lee package, one over-ripe banana as the fruit choice, and no yogurt, milk, or even the hotel-grade scramble egg that you expect at Holiday Inn Express. I do not mind paying $10 or $15 for continental breakfast in a downtown hotel. For this breakfast, $5 was absurd. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The elevators. Actually, scratch that. Not plural. The elevator. There is only one elevator to serve the hotel, and it seems to have a drinking problem. That is, the elevator works only when it wants to, and then only quite slowly. Come to think of it, it reminds me of a lot of state employees. Maybe it is a state employee. So I used the stairs instead. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Most memorable part of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it stinks! No, not figuratively. Literally. It stinks. After waiting almost ten minutes for the elevator, I decided to take the stairs (our room was only five floors up). Go up one flight, and you will notice a bit of an odor. As you go up the second flight, the odor becomes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6distinctive. I am not certain of exactly what the smell was, and I really do not want to know. I would just advise that you do what I did\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6wait for the elevator next time, even if it takes 15 minutes (which it did).", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galveston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA shopper's dream location!\u201d", "Author": "ironista", "ReviewID": "UR120594313", "Content": "The best thing about the Tremont is its location just around the corner from Water Tower Place, H & M, American Girl and all that the Magnificent Mile has to offer.

The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. My son and I stayed eight days, and had a wonderful time. Would definitely stay again. For $5.00 extra a filling continental breakfast is provided at Ditkas restaurant , which also provides lunch and dinner for the public and guests. It was lovely to sit out front, people watch and have a martini at the end of the day. Also, I am a smoker, and this is a non-smoking hotel. Was able to have my nicotine fix with other smokers in an area in front of the hotel-where I met some lovely people from other states and countries. Also, some outdoor tables at Ditkas provided a smoking area when I indulged in my martini. A side note, though I didn't see him, some other guests informed me one morning that Mike Ditka was actually in the restaurant when they were there. Too many \"finds\" to name them all... But, one of my sons and my favorite was Cafe Tempo two blocks West on Chestnut. Open twenty four hours a day; they serve breakfast at all hours, to full dinners, sandwiches, homemade pies and cakes and a variety of smoothies- I think in the eight days we were in Chicago, my son tried a new one each day.

Upon arriving, we were very pleased with the location. You can't get any better as far as that goes. The Tremont is located right at the start of the Magnificent Mile and was very central to everything we wanted to do. Attractions, restaurants, and shopping are all within walking distance or a short cab ride away. We enjoyed this aspect of our stay very much. We parked our car valet and were very pleased with John, the concierge. He was very friendly and attentive to his duties. The rest of the staff was very accommodating and friendly throughout our stay as well. Some of the other reviewers seemed to have had less luck in this aspect stating rude staff...however this was not our experience at all. When entering the hotel, it seems nice enough...lots of historical character and charm; but I didn't feel that way so much about the room itself. Our room was a standard king size room and left a lot to be desired. It felt dark, dirty, and very outdated and while I am not a prude in this area, I did find it interesting that several of the more standard amenities were left out (i.e. alarm clock and hair dryer). The light in the bathroom was attached to the fan and was extremely noisy and the shower had a slow drain so you were standing in a couple inches of water while showering. The king size bed was very uncomfortable. A thin mattress you could feel the springs through and the sheets just had a scratchy feel and were yellowed. I am truly not a complainer and hate writing up a negative review, as the staff were so nice. I just feel if they took the time to update and repair some areas of the hotel it would be absolutely perfect as the location is to die for. My husband and I stayed only the one night, getting in late (after dinner, a Broadway show, and drinks out) and left early the following morning; therefore we strictly used the hotel for sleeping only...while sleep was an elusive term that evening, I would recommend this hotel if you're not planning to stay in it much as the location makes up for some of the other areas it fails in.

Hotel has a nice quiet attractive lobby - a pleasant lounge to the left hand side has a nice smart period look to it and is a great place for people to wait for you. Front desk staff were very pleasant - what is great about this hotel is it's not huge so it means things like the front desk are not overrun with 50 people all trying to get service. every time I needed to go the front desk there were no other guests around so you got great informative service from the staff. Staff also were locally knowledgeable on places to eat and different places for drinks. Hotel is in a perfectly nice set of streets - cannot understand what the reference in a review here to begging. Never saw any. It is also a matter of 100 yards or so to the magnificent mile - at the Hancock building and very close to all the malls. Room itself was perfectly fine and moderately spacious - with easy chairs to sit on and a writing desk as well as good storage. Was surprised how smart the decor was - never switched on the TV but then I rarely do - you're in a great city so why would you. Bathroom was serviceable - perhaps slightly dated in look but I wasn't complaining at the price - shower was great - a veritable gushing shower. everything clean and tidy. Also the free wireless everywhere in the hotel including the rooms was a boon. There is use of a not great gym in a much bigger hotel nearby - if you really need the gym I'd suggest finding somewhere better but then you're paying very little for the hotel so could stretch to a day pass to a bigger gym. Breakfast was reasonable - not posh or much of a spread but coffee bagels and cereals - enough to set you up to get out the door but not something to savour and spend time over.

As for the hotel per se, when you arrive someone opens you the door (so you get surprised because you have read all these reviews) but that's all that is. Check in lady makes you feel you are not welcomed. She tries hard to let you know she does not want to be there. Then, there is the elevator... ha ha... exactly like the Tower of Terror in DisneyWorld. In fact, it is a wooden cart, with crancky noises and the wire hitting the walls of the elevator, what makes you think: Who (or what) is out there? Anyway... The room was in urgent need of a remodelation.... in 1970. Nowadays, everything is outdated. The AC control was so scarry we did not even try it. It had push buttons.. had never seen this. The shower had a temperature display, which looked like the oddometer of a 1940's Mercedes Benz. The door let in so much light through the borders, it looked like an allien was on the other side (if this were a movie). In fact... it all looked just as if you where taken to the Island in the series LOST, and this hotel were part of the Dharma Initiative. The hotel had complementary internet on the lobby, but as we were staying on the 7th floor, we did not get any signal. While in Chicago, you CANNOT miss the Bobby Bike Hike. It's worth every penny. The best thing we did in Chicago. We also went to Wrigley Field (was too cold and boring to enjoy), and the Hancock Center, which is also worth enjoying while having a drink (it's also pretty cheap) if you cannot afford to have dinner there.

Especially considering that every other travel site I checked was charging a minimum of $220 for the Tremont on the same night -- and every other hotel in a two mile radius was averaging nearly $250 to $300. But I digress. I have to say I'm a little baffled by some of the other reviews, as we had a really nice stay at the Tremont. The location was PERFECTION less than a block from Michigan Ave, and we actually had a really neat view of the Hancock Building from our window. Additionally, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was plenty big enough for our needs, and the staff acceptably accomodating. And while the room was a bit on the small side, it's pretty much exactly what I was expecting based on everything I'd read about the Tremont. It's kind of irritating reading reviews complaining about the room size when the hotel is hardly trying to hide the fact that the rooms are not large. It IS an old, boutique hotel - if you're looking for a larger room, and willing to spend more money, then by all means go stay at the Marriott down the road. We did not spend a whole lot of time in our room, so I can't comment on things like whether or not there was cable TV (we did watch some TV, though not much -- but I could have sworn there WAS cable, but maybe we were just watching network TV before bed) or internet access, but what time we did spend was very nice, and it was a great central \"home base\" for coming back to between activities.

A Hampton Inn located by an Interstate exit is far superior to the Tremont. Prior to our stay, I thought that \"boutique hotel\" meant fewer rooms, cute and quaint.

After reading so many complaints on Tripadvisor, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. My room was perfectly comfortable, not at all decrepit or crumbling as some other travelers have complained. I did ask for a \"newer room, if possible\" when I checked in, and that might have gotten me a nicer room. Fabulous location just off Michigan Ave. Room was reasonable in size and quiet. Bathroom was unexpectedly spacious, with ample counter space (marble). Not spanking new but cerrtainly nice enough. Everything was clean. The A/C worked fine. I found the staff to be courteous and helpful. No complaints there at all. Yes, the elevator is slow, but not a big deal. Two inconveniences of note: 1) No high-speed Internet offered in the rooms (though I was able to access it one way - read on). This is the main reason I can't give the Tremont a higher rating. Because of this, the hotel may be unacceptable to many business travelers. There IS wifi in the lobby, as well as at the Starbucks across the street. Numerous business travelers (including myself) did set themselves up in the cozy lobby to use the wifi. Oddly, after I had accessed the hotel's wireless network in the lobby and then returned to my room, I was able to connect to the network from my room -- continuously, with a strong signal -- for the rest of my stay (~36 hours), whereas I couldn't before. 2) In my room, there were no accessible electric outlets next to the bed, so the phone and clock radio had to be placed on the desk (out of reach) rather than on either nightstand.

She said, \"You will be VERY pleased with this room.\" The desk clerk was rather curt, and when we got up to the room, we couldn't believe it. For close to $300 it was a small, dark space. The thin white METAL blinds on the smallish windows were all broken and crooked. The door paint was all chipped. The bathroom was a joke. We'd been told it was an \"all-marble\" bath. The tile was all chipped, and the tiny vanity cabinet which looked like something from the 60's had no knobs (missing) and looked like it had been painted over a dozen times. There was hardly any room to walk around the king bed. The fabrics on the bedding and drapes and the carpeting were tired and looked faded. The room had an oddly-angled wall and on it was stuck a battered TV cabinet that didn't fit. It was pathetic. We decided not to stay, and it took about 20 minutes for the doorman to locate our car.

My main gripe is that while there are no minibars in the rooms there is also no room service.

I do believe that a city hotel should offer small snacks or at least provide a refigerator to purchase one's own. To make matters worse my shower/bath control froze on high heat and I was forced to wrap my hand in a towel and plunge my hand into the bath to release the plug in order to prevent flooding.

However, since Priceline had the Tremont listed as a 3-star, we were \"stuck\" with it. At $130 a night for two nights, I was a little peeved, but I told my husband to go into this with an open mind, to expect the worst and hope for the best. We were prepared for a miserable experience, but we were so pleasantly surprised! We arrived over 5 hours before check-in time expecting to ask them if they could hold our luggage until later but our room was already available. We took the elevator up to the 7th floor and entered our beautifully decorated but smallish room. We like a cooler room so immediately turned the thermostat to cool and went to check out the view. We had two windows. The first one we looked out had a rooftop/alley view, so imagine our surprise when we looked out the other window directly at the Hancock Building less than a block away!! There was also a view of a beautiful Catholic church, a corner of Michigan Ave. and even the lake off in the distance. Our cable worked fine including HBO, despite the reviews. The bathroom was also very nice. We set out to see the sights and when we returned the room was even hotter than before. Apparently they completely shut off the air to the hotel during winter months. So we opened the window and took a little catnap. I should mention that the room is VERY quiet with the window closed and not too bad with it open if you don't mind a little city noise. HOWEVER, at 6:00 Friday night we were promptly awakened by that beautiful church's 15-minute long bell chimes! It wasn't terribly loud, but it was enough to get us up from a nap! The hotel does not have room service which they made plain upon our arrival but there are so many restaurants within walking distance, including Ditka's which is attached to the Tremont (try the pot roast nachos). There is no continental breakfast (Starbucks is across the street) or pool and fitness center, which we knew before we arrived. So the wallpaper was peeling in just a few places - the place was very clean. We greeted the housekeeper both mornings as we left. So the elevator was slow - we weren't in a hurry anyway. We loved it! It was charming and comfortable and the location is amazing! We walked two blocks to Michigan Ave. & Water Tower or took the CTA train (the \"L\") everywhere. The red line station is .2 miles away (about 5 blocks?). We were blessed with fantastic March weather and the fact that the St. Patrick's Day celebrations were that weekend, but all in all we truly enjoyed our stay. If you're looking for a sterile, cookie-cutter environment with lots of amenities this is not your place. It's not terribly family-friendly but we were on vacation FROM our kids anyway. A gentleman in the lobby remarked to me that the hotel reminded him of his grandmother's house, and I would completely agree with that assessment.

The front desk attendants were all very friendly and helpful. Check-in is at 3pm and we arrived at noon and were given our room with no problems. The room: A little dated, but clean and comfortable. I did see some of the things others complained about, such as peeling wall paper and chipped paint; but, neither were were that bad or noticeable. I am a clean freak and brought my own blanket and sheets but found the one's provided to be clean and fresh.

I can see they are really trying to fix up what you can, but it is apparent that their parent company is not willing to pay to renovate. Nor have they in the many years I have been going. WHy do I go? Well, I must say, they have some staff that have been there as long as I have been going (Housekeeping and the doorman). They have a very dedicated management team who have always responded to my needs (Front Desk and Accounting even the GM). The prices are generally good too, you just need to understand that when everyone else in Chi is charging a lot, so are they.

Threadbare polyester bedspread which appeared to a be from a Motel 6 auction. Spiders (three) visible (luckily, I'm an afraid-of-bees person, so they didn't scare/bother me), poly/cotton threadbare sheets, hard-as-a-rock mattress, pillows w/funky smells and no support, a headboard that whacked against the wall when you got within 2 feet of the bed, broken furniture, fluorescent bulbs in the lamps (to add the the ambiance, I suppose...), paint peeling off of the walls and trim, stains on the walls and ceiling, and the piece-de-resistance: one tacky, gold-lame-trimmed K-Mart (yes, I shop there, but, wow...) floral picture visibly bolted (ie: someone took a drill, and just drilled right through the front of it with 2 big screws) to the wall - PERFECT! I decided since the carpet appeared to be new, I would take my chances there with the placement of my luggage. The bed, of course, was a full or queen size (hard to say - so microscopic), so I picked up the phone to ask (nicely - it's not the front desk person's fault that a hotel sucks) the front desk if I should come downstairs to get a new room with the king bed that I reserved. I was told that \"when you reserve online, there's no guarantee that you'll get a king bed.\" It's not like I went to one of those websites where it's a crapshoot or like I didn't reconfirm my stay and room-type.

I will go through the positives: LOCATION, LOCATION LOCATION- you are literally less than 1 block from the John Hancock Center off the shopping on Michigan Avenue. You also have great access to public transit as you are a 3 minute walk to the Red Line L station and various buses off Michigan Avenue (I didn't rent a car for the week I stayed there and was able to get just about everywhere I wanted to.

The room had a desk which helped me get some work done and studying. Cable TV was available however the stations were somewhat limited. The bed was comfortable and closet was functional. Room View: I had a great view of the Hancock Center out of my room's window. Ask for one of the rooms that end with a 4. My room was 1104 and it was pretty nice as I could see the sun rising and reflecting on all the buildings to the east.

They do however have internet access in the hotel's lobby. The elevator creeks and is very slow. There is wear in the hotel's rooms due to the hotel's age. In my room is was mainly cosmetic, ie. wallpaper peeling.

Once we walked in, the smell overpowered us and we could only conclude that it was an old lady rotting on the sofa, waiting for her room. The slow elevator screeched and rocked us up to our room, where we fell to our knees and thanked the lord that we made it to our floor. But once we opened the door to our room, we were not so thankful anymore. The pungent smell of mold mixed with throw-up and rotting beer was so overwhelming that we had to immediately leave the room until a later time of a more incoherance. Like the other reviewer, we found out about the spattering waterhead and the flood of water well above our ankles. We felt as if we were cleaner before we attempted to shower in this place. I was looking for the hair dryer, when i tired to open the cabinet of the vanity and it fell off in my hands to reveal TWO empty old beer cans and other garbage amongst inches of dust and filth. After awakening the next morning, and even though it was only 7:00 am and -19 degrees outside, we could not stand this place any longer and immediately got dressed and left. well... i should say 'tried\" to leave, the valet took 20 minutes to get our car when we were told no more than 10 minutes and obviously the only customers waiting.

It is true the the hotel is old and would need an makeover (actually there are some construction works going on, but during the weekend we were not disturbed by any noise), but the room, bath and bed was clean and the staff was very helpful and friendly. So if you are looking for a clean place to sleep, at a reasonalbe rate in a very good location (next block to Hanckock tower), we think the tremont is definetely the right place to look for. For the same purposed we'd go there again!

I will not rush back to The Tremont, but I would stay there again if options were otherwise limited. The staff is reasonably friendly, and it is well-located for shopping/dining.

Thought I was getting a deal close to Michigan avenue, and getting ready to move to the windy city, it was close to my interview. However, the problems just kept on coming. When I checked in (through hotels which locks you in by the way), not only did I reserve a king \"deluxe\" room which I guess I had assumed would include decent furniture and a clean carpet. It was not available and had been given to someone else since I had reserved \"online\". Which I didn't, I reserved by telephone with the hotels, who are now refunding part of my fees. Making me feel much better. After complaining about this they moved me into yet another dingy room with a larger bed. The next day, I was ironing my white shirt for my interview that had a nice covering of rust that came off onto my shirt that I was supposed to be wearing within an hour. I called and asked for a replacement iron, and complained. The replacement took longer than 20 minutes to get and then did not even work! And the ironing board was quite soiled. . .at that rate it just didn't seem to matter. I called hotels and they told me that I could move into another hotel by talking with the Tremont. I requested this, and of course the Tremont refused. The next day, I asked if there was internet, and there wasn't. Good thing I didn't bring the laptop, since I found out later that they charge you per minute. I asked to borrow a telephone book, and they didn't have one available. I called the front desk, and asked how much their long distance rates are, and they told me at&t rates. I said, oh, like 5-10 cents a minute? And front desk clerk said probably. The day I was leaving, after 4 nights, I awoke to find a $200 phone bill where I was getting billed at $1-$2 per minute! Where I could have just used my pre paid cell phone. I called the front desk, they put me on hold and never picked up again. So, I went downstairs. I told them that there was not any signage in the room about these fees and that the person I spoke to did not tell me it was this expensive. I told them I would not pay that bill, and finally expressed that I really try to maintain my anger as a trying Buddhist practicioner and this was really getting on my nerves. I was finally given some room to negotiate and ended up paying still a rip off sum of $50. I was also nicely informed that I should know that hotel telephone fees are expensive. And, by the way, the doorman does not always open the door for you. Not the most friendly atmosphere. All in all, it was absolutely horrible. I will never stay there again.

What a pleasant surprise to find out that nearly all of the claims were gross exagerations. I've found this with a few other hotels that got less-than-stellar reviews on Trip Advisor--some people just love to whine and expect perfection and they seem to enjoy dramatizing things here. Sure, it's an older hotel, but it is absolutely charming and very romantic. The lobby has a quaint elegance, including comfortable leather couches and chairs and a piano. There was excellent free coffee served there each morning. The entrance to Ditka's restaurant is right off to the side of the entrance--I had the best burger of my life there. Our only check-in issue (if you can call it that) was that they seemed to have us booked for two hotel rooms instead of one--no problem! The pleasant and professional woman at check in just cancelled one room, checked us in for the other, and that was that. We stayed on the 12th floor, and despite there being only 1 elevator for the 16 floor hotel, we never had to wait long. The room was just fine and had a wonderful old world charm, complete with hanging prints and what looked like a fairly fresh coat of paint. There was NO peeling wallpaper in the room nor mold in the bathroom. The bedsheets were clean. I saw one tiny cigarette burn in the blanket on ONE day only, but big deal--you find that at many hotels. The A/C worked fantastically, the beds were extremely comfortable (I have a bad back and am picky about this) and the pillows were nice and fluffy. We had a gorgeous view of the city. The room did not smell at all--no mildew, nada. Maid service kept the room clean and neat. They were very prompt about cleaning the room as soon as we left for breakfast (and we got up later than most other guests every day.) Checkout was smooth and uneventful. The doorman was always ready and willing to call us a cab at a moment's notice. As for the lack of ice machine, all one had to do was go down to Ditka's restaurant (within the hotel) and ask for ice. They gave people paper buckets or cups of ice, depending on how much they needed--even after the restaurant was closed. Our only minor complaint was that we wished there had been more TV channels to choose from--not a big deal. The location is PRIME! You are right there in the middle of everything--across from Water Tower Place and walking distance to everything. Other than going to and from the airport, we only took a cab once the whole time. Walking and convenient subways took us everywhere.

Following reassignment to a \"smoking room\" (without a hint of smoke), I learned of various other problems at this hotel. The room had a broken mirror door on the closet. Rather than repair the large break or replace the door, the hotel had placed scotch tape over the jagged glass edge. The scotch tape clearly had been there for a while. The furniture pulls in the room had broken off (drawers and doors). Rather than repairing them, the pulls were simply placed inside the furniture, screws and all. Why someone didn't take the 5 minutes required to repair such a minor problem is a mystery to me.

We were able to get our room right away. The room was small with a major crack in the ceiling with a piece of the ceiling hanging down over the doorway to the bathroom. The controls for the air were behind the cabinet with TV, if my husband and not been their I could not have moved the TV my self. The bathroom had wallpaper coming off and cracks and holes in the window in the shower area. The hotel is located in a perfect spot and with a little care it could be one of the best hotels. When we returned Friday afternoon to the hotel they had luggage lined up down the entry way to the elevator and into the lobby. (I hope this is not what they were charging the $3.00 per bag for because anybody could have taken any bag there. NO one was watching the bags or seeing who was coming and going.) Elevator did not work on Saturday morning and we were on the 9th floor. Another hotel guest told us the elevator was not working there was a sign down in the lobby after we waited about 10 minutes. We then took the Service elevator down.", "Date": "August 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Forks, ND", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "NDHawkFan", "ReviewID": "UR2355402", "Content": "Just came back from a fine stay at the Tremont for two nights. I was a little nervous as others have been after reading the reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. We parked in a parking garage on Delaware one block away to avoid the $40 valet charge. Still $25/day, but not bad. Check in was very pleasant. Had two rooms booked on hotwire. Be advised that the hotel pretty much has only single bed rooms only. We were given two rooms, one with a large king bed and one with a queen, both on the third floor so we could be on the same floor. There is only one elevator and it can be slow, but being on the third floor made for an easy trip on the stairs behind the lobby, if you don't mind seeing the kitchen on your way up. The rooms were well decorated I thought, and both had CD players as advertised. Views can vary, one room had a great view of Chestnut St and another the back of the place. Both rooms were very clean. Be advised, they are small though, but that's to be expected. There were some minor spots of peeling paint, but nothing major and nothing that looked unusual for an older hotel. The location can not be beat, we had a close walk to the El, Rush/Division restaurants nightlife. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, especially at hotwire prices.", "Date": "August 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cThe Tremont Hotel is quaint and cozy.

It was built in 1929 and reflects that period, as one should expect, but that does not mean it is a dump. The staff was polite and helpful. We shared a comfortable queen size bed and had a view of the John Hancock Center from our window. The water in the shower was hot and plentiful. The television screen was large and offered cable and pay-for-view. The room was clean and cozy. We were half a block away from Water Tower Place on Michigan Avenue. Our room was on the fourth floor and it was so quiet, I often wondered if the other rooms had occupants. In regards to the changing of linen so many have mentioned in their reviews, the rooms on our floor were cleaned daily and the bedding was changed. I do not change my bedding on a nightly basis at home. Therefore, I do not expect the hotel staff to do so. I requested housekeeping refrain from changing our bedding daily, or they would have. This practice wastes water and is unnecessary, unless one has had an accident in the bed. There are no accessible ice machines, but one may ask Room Service to bring some, or make a quick trip to the front desk and ask for it. In conclusion, I found a great price on the internet and considering the inflated prices of the neighboring hotels, it was a bargain. I received a good value for my money. I would definitely stay there again and will always remember our stay with fondness.", "Date": "July 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muncie, IN", "Title": "\u201cWannabe Rock Stars\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2230535", "Content": "The Tremont is in a great location - our room had a fabulous view of the Hancock Building, and I know that as with all real estate, desireability is based upon Location, location, location.

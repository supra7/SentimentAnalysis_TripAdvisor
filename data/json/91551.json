We loved the first one we stayed at in Lexington, KY; it was newly built, and we fell in love with the modern decor and big lounge area in the room. The last 2 in Louisville and this one in Indy were former Amerisuites, according to the front desk, and were rehabbed to fit the Hyatt Place decor. The one in Louisville was at least clean; this one was really bad. The ceiling looked like it had leaked several times in long seams and seemed like it might fall in places at any minute. The smell of the room was horrible, like an old moldy hotel room, and it was humid the whole night despite the A/C constantly running. The bathroom tiles were cracked in half and the caulk against the tub had pulled away and was filthy. The tub itself had non-skid stickers on it and were dirty gray. The doors looked like they had been patched with a bad coat of paint over and over, poorly. Dirty bedside tables with sticky goo on them. The whole place screamed \"re-purposed Amerisuites\", as if they simply threw on a coat of paint and added some new furniture. The breakfast, which I've enjoyed in the other Hyatt Places, was atrocious. I don't know if they just couldn't handle the Sunday crowd, but I had to go through 5 plates before I found a clean one and the glasses were all dirty as well. They didn't have any silverware except spoons and kept running out of food. The decaf was weakly brewed to the color of light tea. I sat down to eat and it seemed that the chair arms had never been washed; I stuck to them. It was just completely disappointing.

While they have a unique and inviting theme with these hotels, we were disappointed with this property. The hotel is literally 10 feet from I-465, be sure to request a room on the south side to avoid all the traffic noise. It is also very difficult to find. Being so close to I-465, you would think it very easy, but you have to exit off I-465, then take another exit off Keystone avenue, and then turn into a business park. The hotel sits at the very back of the park behind an office building and is not visible from the intersection nor are there any signs to point the way. The hotel also has horrible front desk service. The guests in front of us at check in requested to pay one night in cash, another on a credit card. This took the attention of both front desk employees and a couple of phone calls before they could figure it out. c Check in time -10 minutes. There was absolutely nobody around the next morning during checkout and it wasn't like it was an unpopular time to check out, it was 7:45am. After waiting forever and multiple unsuccessful attempts at using the express check out kiosks, I finally grabbed some poor guy pushing a mop and asked that he go find someone that could check us out. Asking for a copy of my receipt caused more problems, the clerk had to run to some back office to print a copy. Check out time - 20 minutes. The \"High Energy\" breakfast was also pretty disappointing. It consisted of toast or bagels, yogurt, and a fruit salad. The room itself was very nice, minus a few issues with the shower. As I mentioned above, this is a unique concept. They have moved the bathroom from the traditional front corner of the room over to the back wall, creating a large living space with a sectional couch, ottoman, sink, mini fridge, and work desk. This area is separated from the sleeping area by a short partition, giving the appearance of a two room suite. The 42 inch flat screen TV is mounted on the wall in the center of the room, allowing you to watch from either side.

We looked and looked for a great place to stay that was affordable. We decided Hyatt Keystone looked beautiful and had nice amenities. Unfortunately the hotel did not deliver in such nice accommodations. I'll admit, the staff was wonderful but our room (both of them) were less then wonderful. When we checked in we asked to be on the 6th floor, we thought the higher the better. We went to the room and it was just ok. Nothing special really except for the TV. We didnt really have set plans aside from a dinner reservation so we intended to plan our honeymoon as we went, with our laptop. The wi-fi signal was horrible. We asked for an Ethernet cable but were given a cable to plug into the wi-fi, which didnt work. My husband took the laptop down a few floors and discovered we needed to move rooms. As i said the staff was great and had no issues giving us a different room on a lower level. When we got to the second room the smell was horrible. There is a lot of mold somewhere in that room. I started getting itchy almost immediately. Its probably our fault for not asking for yet another room, but we decided to stay in that one. We actually went out and bought a bottle of Febreeze which only helped momentarily. There were also spider webs in just about every corner. I'm positive the air conditioning unit had black mold growing in it. The room obviously wasnt cleaned thoroughly, in quite a while. I also discovered the shower curtain had probably never been changed. It was slimy and you could see the yellowish color of tons of built up soap scum. I requested a new one, which we were given. The glasses given with our ice bucket were dirty, both times we were given a set. Our room was never serviced one of the days there. They dont even offer room service nor do they have vending machines. If you want a drink or a snack you have to go to the front desk and pay $9 for a deli sandwich, chips (only 2 flavors to choose from) and drink. There were salads and candy bars, and thats it. You're better off going to Wal-Mart and getting your own snacks. Which is what we did. Dont be fooled by the beautiful pictures shown.

When we got to the hotel the receptionist was very friendly and gave us a tour of all the hotel amenities. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable and biggest I have ever slept in. The location was good, it wasn't too far to drive to the Speedway and it was right beside a decent mall.

They have refurbished it with a stylish, sort of 70's feel that was very \"cool\". There is a 24-hour snack bar at the front desk that featured pre-made deli-type sandwiches, fruit, salads, baked goods, coffees and drinks. The staff was very welcoming. Our room was on the fifth floor. The elevator and room hallways seemed tired and a little musty (compared to the trendy lobby) and we were worried about our room. But there was no need to fret. The 70's style was continued in the room with relaxing gold/tan/brown decor. There was a huge sectional couch, frig and desk in the first room. Smallish double beds, dresser, large mirrors, well-lighted sink were in the second room. Between the two was an enormous 42\" plasma TV that had my husband giddy with pleasure. I was thrilled to have FREE wireless in the room! You don't get that very often! The bathroom is very small and looks pretty old (the old-fashion ceiling heat lamps had been replaced with swirled, fluorescent bulbs). But *shrug* we didn't care. The shower and toilet were fine. One complaint was the air conditioning. The unit was incredibly loud. When it kicked in, we could barely hear the TV and it woke us up several times during the night. No idea if it was just our unit or if other rooms have a similar problem. The only other complaint was the double beds. They were HARD. Lots of nice fluffy pillows, but our beds were like boards. My husband likes a form mattress, but I had a backache in the morning. The location is in the same parking area as the very upscale Keystone at the Crossing Fashion Mall *Saks Fifth Ave., Nordstrums, Crate & Barrel). There are plenty of restaurants nearby. We got a good deal of $107.00 online at their website. Once Indianapolis added on their tourism tax, it was $124.00. Other than the bed and noisy air conditioning, we enjoyed the stay.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "MeganFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR17183965", "Content": "We liked this hotel.

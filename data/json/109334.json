This was an excellent location, easy to find and to use as a home base. We had young grandchildren with us who love hotel breakfasts. The breakfasts did not disappoint. Jimmy Dean microwavable egg, bacon and sausage sandwiches were good as were the Texas shaped waffles, lots of fruit, yogurt, cereals, hot oatmeal, and pastries. We used the very clean pool and hot tub--we are very picky about hotel pools and this was one of the best. The beds were the most comfortable we had had in awhile! Plenty of room in rooms for the 2 queens, desk, two chairs, and dresser. The hotel is not brand new and you see that in the bathroom tiles which were a little loose. But, the carpets seemed new and the air conditioner worked great. Only reason I didn't give this an excellent rating is that I reserve that for more spacious rooms and totally updated floors, etc. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conway, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SWIBC", "ReviewID": "UR119525352", "Content": "Nice hotel for a family, area could be considered sketchy, but no issues even with the Gas Station right beside it. Hotel was nice inside and the staff was super. Stayed 4 nights and even though room was cramped with 4 people in the room it was tolerable. The breakfast was adequate but not up to par for the price paid. Pool was nice for the kids to run off energy, but can be very loud in the pool area due to acoustics. Room was good size with king bed and a sofa bed, but day 2 had a strong mildew smell that popped up and remained the rest of the stay. Overall B+ a good hotel although could be considered a little pricey for what you get.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springdale, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cVery happy with this hotel. Will stay there again.\u201d", "Author": "Charlotte V", "ReviewID": "UR116814698", "Content": "Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating, though most of the housekeeping staff does not speak English. Room was clean except for one spot on the bedspread but I never use hotel bedspreads anyway, so it wasn't a big deal for me. Everything else was fresh and clean. Entire hotel is non-smoking which is a major plus for me. Pets are allowed with a deposit but if people actually take their pets there, you'd never know it. There was no smell at all nor did I have any issues with allergies from pet dander. Beds and pillows were VERY comfortable. Rooms and hallways were very quiet. We never heard our neighbors or any outside noise at all. Windows do open but it was too warm for us to take advantage of that. When we checked in the AC had already been turned on for us so the room was nice and cool - perfect after such a long drive. Hot tub and pool area were very clean and no too many people used them. However, the chlorine smell was VERY strong and caused some eye and allergy irritation for some of us - even those who didn't get into the water. We were able to prop open the emergency exit door to the outside and it got a little better. Room has a fairly low ceiling so if they used better ventilation or had a higher glass ceiling, it might not be so bad. Also, there is a lot of echo in that room - more than you'd think - and it's hard to carry on a conversation, even in the hot tub. Continenal breakfast included make-your-own-waffles and the waffle iron was shaped like Texas, which everyone thought was cool. Also had a limited selection of bagels, english muffins, bread for toast. Bananas and apples were the fruit choices. Small boxes of Kelloggs cereals available. Also had sausage biscuits, breakfast burritos and sausage/pancake corndogs that could be microwaved. No microwave in the rooms but the breakfast room was open 24 hours so you could use that if needed. Several restaurants and fast food places close by. Also not far from both Kroger and Walmart Supercenter. Overall, not a place I'd go if I was looking for a vacation where you relax at the hotel- rooms are fairly small but adequate for sleeping. Double queen room does not have enough room for an added rollaway, for example. But for an on-the-go vacation where all you need is a clean comfy place to sleep, a decent breakfast and that's convenient to everything, this is a great choice.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corpus Christi, TX", "Title": "\u201cJust what we were looking for\u201d", "Author": "mamiya22", "ReviewID": "UR115739059", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights with kids.

Know where you are coming before trying to find this place. Hotel staff not very good at explaining it is called Park Central but a few miles from there. However, service at check in, breakfast are, swimming pool (indoor) and fitness center appear clean and neat. Rooms are typical, a bit small for a large chair and ottoman. We were in a double with adjoining rooms. Don't lock yourself out like we did, the adjoining door will close on you and if the safety latch is closed on your door it is very challenging to get in, although it was done courteously by late night staff. Breakfast consists of boiled eggs, waffles, breads and muffins with toaster and microwave supplied. Apples for fresh fruit, small containers of dannon yogurt, fruit cups and fresh boxed milks from a fridge. A large pot of oatmeal with raisins coconut and peanut butter for toppings. Fresh hot coffee supplied in a nice large room with a flat screen tv on the wall. Indoor pool was like a sauna, not so bad if you are swimming off your breakfast.

She welcomes you when you come in and offers to assist you, she brings extra napkins to the tables, offers to refill drinks and wishing you a good day when you leave. She does all of this while keeping the breakfast items stocked and the counters clean. She was a very pleasant surprise!

In my opinion, the price we paid ($110 total for two nights) was too cheap. You gotta see it for yourself. The rooms were a good size. We had a nice view; we stayed on the 3rd floor. I tell you, I was shocked to learn that this hidden treasure turned out to be so great. The only minor problem, which I didn't report, was the odor in the room--it was sort of a musty, old smell. But heck, for the price we paid, it wasn't too much trouble for me to spray Febreeze and Lysol to freshen the room up. The beds were SUPER comfortable. I felt like I was sleeping in my own bed at home. My husband and I used the workout room which only had three machines, but it got the job done. Oh my God, the front desk staff on Saturday morning was SO friendly. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. You gotta see it for yourself. So, if ever looking for a bargain in this part of Dallas, please stay here. You might get the same value at the Homewood Suites next door or at the Holiday Inn across the street, but I guarantee you'll pay a whole lot more for the same exact service you could recieve at the Fairfield Inn Dallas Park Central.

We asked to change rooms. The staff was very pleasant and gave us a room in a quieter part of the hotel. We noticed some maintenance problems in our room. The smoke detector was missing. Only the base plate for the detector was present on the ceiling and there were electrical wires dangling down. Also, we noticed that the lock on the window was broken. A large piece of the latch was missing and the window could not be locked. I took photos of these items for documentation purposes. The room was clean but furnishings seemed rather spartan. There were no pictures on the wall. Also no small refrigerator. In our opinion, just sort of a bare bones room. We stayed the first night and checked out the next morning. We just didn't feel safe in this hotel with a missing smoke detector in our room and a broken window latch. We wondered: How many other rooms in the hotel are in this condition?

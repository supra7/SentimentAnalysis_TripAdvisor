Everything from beginning to end was a perfect touch to our vacation! The room was exactly as described online and very clean. We had #804, direct oceanfront room. The pool was not as descibed in other reviews, it was crystal clear, clean, and exactly like the photos for Acapulco on South Atlantic Shores. The restaurant in the hotel had excellent food and great prices, expecially the grilled chicken sandwich and fries! The bathrooms were clean & balcony was nice and relaxing. We did not have any interactions with staff other than check in/out which in both cases they greeted us with smiles and thank you's. The maids were very friendly and left plenty of coffee and towels whenever we needed. Everything that the hotel site said would be in our room was in our room, including everything needed in the kitchen. The internet worked great once I used the passcode supplied from the front desk for signing on. I would 100% stay here again and send friends/family here. I cannot imagine some of the other reviews on here being the same place I stayed at...I wonder if there's another Acapulco located somewhere else at Daytona?

What a nightmare! I consider myself a reasonable guy, not overly critical, but Daytona Beach was not a great place to go (nothing to do) and the hotel made it worse! I travelled from the UK to see the final shuttle launch with my daughter, a friend and his son. I've been to the states (NY and Florida) before and expected the usual US high standards. However, we would have settled for nothing more than hospitality and cleanliness, as it was really only a place to stay. On arrival at the Hotel, the receptionist was rude, which set the tone. It's true first impressions count. Our room was tacky with a dirty bathroom and cheap accessories. For example, the soap block all 5 mm x 5mm of it was stubbornly stuck to the plastic sink. The bed had a slightly damp squishy feel. I've stayed in better hotels at half the cost. My friend tried to play it all down as he didnt want to complain, but after I called the receptionist to inform her our room was not interconnecting as we'd asked, she was again rude. It wasn't what she said but it was the way she suggested she was speaking to an idiot that annoyed me. I tried to reason with her and finally she promised to check and call back if she could find another room but didn't. 30 minutes later I called her back to be curtly lectured she'd been busy dealing with the huge volume of other unlucky saps staying there. I have to say I didnt see more than 10 people. We (and this includes my friend who is very reasonable) decided we weren't spending 5k on hols to a place like that and the lack of atmosphere in Daytona Beach meant we left the hotel after 1 day and spent out on what was meant to be a cheaper place in International Drive.

At times there were very few people using the beach...say 2 people per every 100 yards. The beach is hard pack so vehicles drive on it, there is soft sand near the hotel pool entrance. The pool is nice and during the week very quiet. The continental breakfast is rather sad, bagels, bread ,juice, muffins mixed fruit and coffee. Good news here-just across the street is Mike's Galley and they serve a good breakfast and lunch. About 3/4 mile north is an Ihop and a few yards further is a Winn Dixie where you can buy Fixin's for anything you want. About 2 blocks south is a New York bagel place with very good pastries.The problem is dinner ... the closest restaurant is Ihop again and right across the street is a Best Western which looked pricey. The top of Daytona is a restaurant with 4-6 early bird specials (starting at $14) and a phenomenal 29th floor view of the beach and the city. There are also buses and trolleys right outside the door to take you in any direction....Bus schedules available in the lobby. The front desk clerks are exceptional and helpful. Now about the rooms I was first in room 218 which overlooked the fire pump room and an open (lid was never closed) garbage cart. Birds were plentiful and the view was somewhat obstructed by a white fence, the parking lot, and the property next door. The room was very quiet, I even felt I might be the only one on the floor. A plus also was the flight of stairs that took you to the lobby which allowed you to avoid the slow old elevators. I give this room a 3 star rating. Room 802...I asked to be switched to an OCEANFRONT room because the hotel was so empty. They readily agreed. The view is why the room gets a 1 star rating. The view is all it had going for it. What was wrong:There was ahorrible sound which was akin to a dinosaur with indigestion. It was not continuous, but it went off and on . I later found this to be \"the pipes\"./ The patio/porch had cigarette butts on it/ the closet had trash in it from a previous guest/ the floors had food stuffs on them most notably in the corners/ I saw a cockroach in the bathroom...8th floor Really?/ the silverware was sticky and dirty in the drawers/the beds were saggy/and very scary it looked like the wiring was overloaded and not fully plugged in. I never heard a vacuum being used on this floor. Strangely enough the room had upgraded soaps in it. This room had a mini fridge instead of a full size as in room 218. I know I could have all of these things addressed, but I wanted to see what was done on their own. I usually have the do not disturb sign up as I am a writer and do not want to be disturbed, but I did have service in 802 and it was make beds/empty waste baskets and add new towels only... would I stay here again ?

The pictures on the website are very deceiving. I started to worry a few days before our trip when I checked the hotel website and saw the recent negative reviews, but was still optimistic, until we actually arrived. I wanted to cry when I saw the rooms. We had booked 2 rooms because we have a family of 6. I assumed we would have adjoining rooms for the kids, nope. When I asked about this I was told I could check back the next day after 11:00. I said that would not be an option as we had plans in the Orlando area for the day and would be gone well before that time. Asked if she would let me know if something came available and she never did so I assumed nothing opened up. When we checked out 5 days later the gentleman that checked us out asked why our rooms were so far apart and why they didn't get us closer? I said I asked the same thing and he just said that it was \"strange\". So for 5 nights we had 2 rooms on different floors and could not be together as a family. That was just the start. Like I said as soon as I saw the condition of the room I wanted to leave, but being Priceline we were stuck unless we wanted to shell out even more money. We went to the nearest strore and purchased Lysol to spray all over carpet and bedspreads. Shower curtains had mold, used lysol on that too. All in all hotel is VERY dated with only lobby area remodeled and outside of hotel. Rooms and hallways need new carpet BAD. I cannot stress that enough. Stairwells need paint and elevators need total overhaul. You can hardly get the luggage carriers in them without getting stuck. I will be notifying Priceline of this hotel. The maintenance and housekeeping staff were very friendly. There is no way this hotel should be recognized as 3 stars however. The beach was nice. Pool O.K. Hot Tub not working correctlly and looked dirty. Beds comfortable but bedspreads had stains. You just did not dare leave anything on the floor or even want to walk on it, it was that dirty.

As we checked back it became clear that 4:00 was a firm check in time. So, we waited and enjoyed the beach. At 4:00 we returned and found a line almost reaching out of the front door. We waited in line for apporximately 20 mins and were then told that our room was not ready. The staff blamed it on all the bike week check outs. They offered no more accomodation to me and my family than to sit and wait in the lobby. By 5:00 my 4 year old had just about had enough of the waiting and needed place to clean up. We asked for the staffer to check our room status and we were told to get back in line. Once we reached the counter and gave her our name again, she responded with,\"Oh yes, your room has been ready for quite some time\". It would have been nice for her to have let us know. Just as we stepped onto our floor the house keeping attendant stops us and says, \"Don't freak out there aren't any towels in your room. I'll bring them up a little later.\" Really??? don't freak out!! All I want at this point is a shower for me and my little one. So, again we wait. At 6:45 I call to get the update on towels and they assure me they will be right up. 7:15 no towels. 7:30 we go downstairs to have a chat. They find some pool towels to hold us over, which would have been fine in the first place. We didn't get new bath towels until the next day at 3:20. The room was fine. Decently clean and had a farily well equipped ktichenette. The free breakfast offered is toast, bagels, and cereal. Nothing really to speak of. The pool was nice, very large and heated. The jacuzzi's were a joke. The one opperating jacuzi barely had any water in it at all and that water was murky and gross. The walls of the jacuzzi were also terribly dirty. Online it stated there was a bar on the pool deck, again that was nonexistant. At our checkout the staffer stated she would need to collect a PARKING FEE of $5 a day. This is what I find completely obscene. You have charged me a room fee already, now my car has to pay for it's space outside.

We suspect them of \"Priceline Punishment\" meaning that if you booked through Priceline, you were automatically charged for things that other guests were not charged for and given the room closest to the elevator. Their \"incidentals\" charge was $50.00 a night and they charged $5.00 parking per night even though the parking lot was nearly deserted as was the entire town. Such parking expense could be justified during busy periods but it seemed ridiculous under the circumstances. The final straw was when they charged TAX on the parking! These arbitrary incidental charges seem immoral if not illegal and it is my feeling that hotel goers should stand up against them. What stops the hotels from charging $200.00 a night incidentals? Whatever they charge is money that vacationers can't use while on vacation. These charges are imposed arbitrarily without any opportunity to negotiate or agree to the charge beforehand. The hotels should be required to find some other way to protect their investment - that is there responsibility, not mine. Besides these primary concerns were other reasons that I would not consider this a 3-star \"resort\". There was mold on the shower curtain and shower walls and the shower rod was rusty.

I asked to speak to the manager and the girl behind the counter was very rude and said that she was not in and did not know when she would be in.

He was out there everyday cleaning the pool and pool deck. This was the first time I really saw someone there working very hard. He kept the pool area very clean.

We called Acapulco's parent company to book reservations at a sister hotel, there was a radio gig going on there so they were nice enough to tell us that if we wanted peace and quite that was not the place to be and reccomended Acapulco, touting it as being newly refurbished. The agent went ahead and book the ocean view kings suite for us, it had a kitchen and everything. She also booked us for late check out when we were to leave. The hotel did look like it was newly refurbished on the outside, but when we got to out room, it was not. The smell in the room was of wet dog, the carpet was wet from where it was cleaned (not just damp, but wet), it didn't have a view of the ocean, and to top it all off we were supplied with coffee fixings, all except a coffee maker. Being pregnant at the time, I had a difficult time getting comfortable and there was only one pillow supplied to the room, so my husband called down to see if we could get an extra pillow ot two, the desk's response was that they were not sure if they had any extras, but they were going to check and call us back. We never recieved a call back. We had requested late checkout, because we didn't want to be rushed. Our last day came and at 8 in the morning, there is a knock at the door, it was house keeping wanting to get in there. Our check out time was for 1. We told the house keeper this and she said \"ok\". About an hour later, there is another knock at the door from another house keeper, we did the same thing. By about 11, there was a third knock at the door from a third house keeper, wanting us to get out, when we sent her away, our phone rings and it is the desk asking us why we weren't out. We told her that we have late check out. She said she saw that on our reservations, but that they needed the room. Needless to say, our final vacation before our daughter was born was anything but relaxing.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cWay better than we expected!

I was scared by some of the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. First thing I got to say about the Acapulco is this : the location is simply incredible\u2026 We had an oceanfront efficiency room with a kitchenette. The view was splendid and the room was\u2026 well\u2026 efficient! The cook top and the fridge allow you to cut back on restaurant spending and invest your money on theme parks and other stuff kids like! We made dinner in our room mostly of the time. The balcony was also useful for me and my wife during the childrens napping time! A bottle of wine, some crakers and cheese, all of that ocenfront... That's was cool! The room was ok. Like I said in the title, it depends on how much you paid. I paid 77$ per night so, it was a good deal. But I would never, ever pay the 150$ per night they were charging at the front desk for a night\u2026 And if I did so, I would\u2019ve feel like I\u2019ve been robbed! The room was ok. Not too big but ok. The W/C was a little bit small but we didn\u2019t care much. The carpet looks old but it looks clean. The beds were fine and the A/C was a bit noisy but it makes me fall asleep so\u2026 Housekeeping was made daily, the maids were very cool and they did a good job. Not a great one but a good one. To there discharges, on several days, I saw only 1 maid on my floor. So, how can she do a spotless job in 21 rooms in 7 hours? That\u2019s impossible! Maybe the hotels should consider hiring more maids!!! That being said, the room was clean every day and that\u2019s what matter! The hotel staff at the front desk was polite and efficient. I got a 1 or 2 little problems in my room and each time the problem was solved in a matter of minutes. The continental breakfast was good! The man who was taking care of it was cool and very nice! Always asking if we needed something. The breakfast includes bagel, English muffins, Danishes of all kinds, oatmeal\u2026 The pool was nice! Very useful after a day at the beach! The pool and the chairs were cleaned every morning. The bar at the pool was opened on mostly days and it was selling drinks and beer. The whirlpool was not working (either one of them) but honestly, at 110F, who cares!!! The hotel itself, except for the main hall, could use a refresh. The carpet in the hallways looks old and the wall could use a painting jobs. But, like my wife said to me: It\u2019s a beach hotel so! The Wi-Fi is simply not working. I\u2019m not a geek but I know how to setup up a computer and I\u2019ve tried several options but it was not working. That pissed us off because we had to go to the library or at McDonald to get a WIFI and get an Internet access. I asked but nothing changed. The elevator a very slow and you\u2019ve got to be a very patient person. To the people who said there was no parking\u2026 I don\u2019t know when you got there but the hotel was full and there were plenty of parking spaces left! Speaking of parking, there are a 5$ per day fees\u2026 Which is not that high considering that the parking at the Hilton will cost you 20$ and park your car in one of the lot beachfront will cost you at least 8$. There are severals Ice machine but, we were on 5th floor and our didn\u2019t work so I had to go on the 6th to get my ice. The washing and drying machine are fine. 2.25$ is not the cheapest I've seen but they did what they were supposed to do! For the city, I felt in love with Daytona Beach\u2026 It\u2019s a great city, everything is near or about (1h to Seaworld and Disney) and, you have to take a walk to the Beach Center area. It\u2019s crowded, there are good restaurants, everybody looks happy and the beaches, from Daytona Beach to Daytona Beach Shores, they are just incredible! It's a clean white sanded beach. You got to see it! To resume my self: at 77$ per night, just for the location, it was a deal. With a kitchenette, it was better. With the city, it was great! The hotel in itself is good and I think we would go back to the Acapulco in vacations. We recommend it but at a fair price\u2026 Not at 150$ per night\u2026 Last thing. If you want to eat pizza, try the cheese pizza from King Louis. It is the BEST pizza I\u2019ve tasted in my life!!!", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "orange park, fl", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the price.\u201d", "Author": "cardinal50", "ReviewID": "UR73818485", "Content": "My family styed here for 5 days and had a great time .

Got a great deal on this hotel booking online before we left as a \"mystery hotel\" through Bookit. Stayed 5 nights. Our room is very nice. Has 2 double beds, a small round table with 2 chairs, a kitchenette which includes fridge, microwave, 2 burner stove, coffe make, small sink. Made dinner 1 night in room with no problem. Kitchen is stocked with the basics, 3 or 4 pots/pans, some dishes/plates, cups, silverware, utensils, cutting boards, can opener, collander, mixing bowls & mixing spoons, toaster, etc. Our room is clean, nicely decorated and updated. I do not think that it looks old or dirty at all. We have an in-room safe that we have not needed. The cost for it is $1.50 per day. The parking is $5 per night. I feel that is not at all a bad price (have you ever paid for parking in a large city such as NYC, Cleveland, Toronto, etc?! -YIKES!!!). The parking lots are rather small though (1 on either side of the hotel) so that when you back out your car you have to be careful not to hit the car parked opposite of you. Our room is a side oceanview room. We have a small balcony with a small round table and 2 chairs. Too hot to actually sit out there but I do put the towels and swimsuits out there to dry. The A/C in our room works very well and in fact cools down the room very well to the point that sometimes I get too cold at night. The pillows are big and fluffy and there are about 4 per bed. Soft warm extra blankets are provided as well. There is a guest laundry room on the 3rd floor which has 2 washers and 2 dryers. I used it at 6am on a weekday morning and it was empty, didn't get busy until around 8am. The cost is $2.25 per machine which I thought was high (paid only $1.25 at our hotel on the Gulf side last wk). But there is a machine in the laundry room which sells soap and fabric softener for only $1 each. Also a large counter on which to sort or fold clothes. The front desk staff (only have seen 1 working at a time) are always very friendly and helpful and had no problem when I repeatedly kept asking them for more change (quarters for the washers). There is free WiFi in the rooms which I have been using all week with no problems. Takes a few tries to get connected but after connection, no problems. There is also a computer with printer in the lobby but it costs at least $3 to use it. I would bring your own laptop if possible. The continental breakfast is \"ok\". The man who primarily works it is SUPER nice. He made my kids hot chocolate with whipped cream a few mornings and is very helpful to clear your place, get you more drinks, etc. The breakfast is free and includes canned tropical fruit, oatmeal, cottage cheese, english muffins, mini muffins, bread/toast, bagels, cream cheese, butter, jelly, apple juice, OJ, cofree, tea, dry cereal. I have to say that the coffee is quite good as is the OJ. You serve yourself and toast your bagels etc in 2 toasters. There are 2 (maybe 3?) seating areas which are clean and comfortable. There is a sign that says you may not take any of the food beyond those seating areas but in talking to the nice man who works it, he said that is just the management's \"insurance policy\" in case they need to enforce it. He let me take food to the laundry room (I don't like to leave my laundry alone LOL) as well as up to the room. Other than the free breakfast, the hotel does NOT have a restaurant which I found disappointing. The front desk said they used to have one but it closed a few yrs ago. There is an ATM in the hotel lobby which charges $2.75 when you take money out. The lobby is actually quite nice. Large, clean, well furnished, lots of places to sit. There are 2 elevators to take you upstairs (8 floors). Our room is on the 7th floor. The elevators are VERY slow and it is quicker (but hotter) to take 1 of the 2 stairways instead. Also of note, there is NOT an ice machine on each floor. We had to go down 1 or 2 floors to find an ice machine. The housekeeping staff are VERY nice and do a good job cleaning the room each day. Also anytime I have needed anything (extra towels, forks, dish soap) and have called the front desk for it, someone has brought it up to me right away. The location is good because it is right on the beach although you really have to drive to any of the restaurants, attractions, etc because it is too hot to walk that far. There is a mini golf place directly across the street though we read poor reviews about it and decided to try the one a bit further down the street. The beach is very nice and clean and is accessed from steps down off the pool deck. We have had no problems with the pool area. The pool is very large and I believe goes in depth from 3 ft to about 8 or 9 ft. The pool water is much too hot but I don't think that is the hotel's fault, I think the water is just hot due to the hot sun. There are lots of beach chairs available. There is also a small kiddie pool that my kids have been in a few times but it is full of sand and I wish they would clean it out. There are 2 hot tubs which are empty of water and are not in use- they look old and dirty, however I do not miss those though as honestly it is too hot to be sitting in a hot tub, even at night! The pool is open til about 10 or 11pm which is nice. There is a tiny \"tiki\" bar on the pool deck which has only been opened a few times during our stay. It is more like a tiki cart though and kind of cheesy looking. I wanted to charge a drink to my room but the bartender told me it was \"cash only\" and I don't take cash down to the pool. There are a few areas of tables and chairs out the back door of the hotel on the way to the pool. One night we had pizza delivered and sat out there for dinner with our 3 kids. It was nice and a cheap easy dinner. Overall I would recommend this hotel. It is not the Hilton but it is not a roach motel either! It looks very nice both outside and inside and honestly looks better than many of the hotels I have seen on this street.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macon, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cRUN, RUN, RUN as fast as you can!\u201d", "Author": "47BaseballMom", "ReviewID": "UR70770887", "Content": "My husband and I decided to take a quick trip to Daytona for the weekend. When I got the rate on Priceline I thought I had gotten a GREAT deal based on other reviews and that it was rated as a 3 star hotel. Had I paid full price for this hotel I would have been at the office of the BBB prior to leaving Daytona. Obviously as one other reviewer noted management DOES NOT CARE! When I checked in there was a maintenance guy at the front desk who said \"she'll be back\". Ten minutes later he tried to radio the check in clerk to find that her radio was sitting next to him. Approximately 5 minutes after that she gets off the elevator, sees me at the desk and takes her time to come and check me. Did not welcome me, tell me where to park or ANYTHING! Did not tell me ANYTHING about a deposit either! I asked her what type of room I had she said \"you have 2 beds\". I said may I change to \"1 King\". She says \"NOPE\". Needless to say I left alone as I was looking forward to a GREAT weekend away not a weekend of being in a HELL WHOLE. My husband and I proceeded to our room to find a stained floor as soon as opening the door to our room. Proceeded to look at the beds which appeared clean but made up very messy. I then proceeded to the bathroom where sand was all over the floor. Tried to go to sleep to hear the ice machine outside our door constantly going off, kids with their parents running the halls and yelling well past midnight. The next morning got a shower to see that the shower fixtures were old and rusted. Went into the kitchen area, just to check it out, to find rust all over the side of the refrigerator and something all over the 2 burner stove. Stopped to eat the advertised \"free breakfast\" to find it looked horrible. Saw that the \"restaurant\" is the extent of the free continental breakfast. The bar was never open. Proceeded down to the pool to find it dirty and uninviting so we went straight to the beach where it was WONDERFUL! That night was the same routine with people beating on doors, hollering down the halls, etc. Called the front desk and was told we can't do anything about that. Checked out the next morning to find that the Acapulco Inn had charged my card for Pricelines fee that I HAD ALREADY PAID as well as their deposit. The same person who checked me in checked me out and told me that I would have to call the manager back the next day that there was nothing she could do. She proceeded to tell me that I better call at 8am as he is on a conference call at 10am and leaves immediately after the conference call. Hello, this is the manager's schedule!!!!

Pool deck is not taken care of and not cleaned (in years most likely). Pool chairs are dirty. A pool light fixture was hanging out of the pool with a wire.

We reserved an oceanfront room because they do not adjoin and thus preventing the noise from neighbors. The next morning at 8 am Valerie did change our room that afternoon. She still never explained why the management took it upon themselves to do this. Others behind us at the desk received the same treatment. So, double check and confirm your room before you go! The beach is nice, the pool is crowded and completely unsupervised. There was some behavior that would not be considered appropriate for children. The one hot tub is empty and broken and the other was dirty and basically unusable. The oceanfront room was small but very nice. The small kitchenette was a blessing. Bathroom fan and room air conditioner are both quite noisy but ear plugs help. Housekeeping was friendly and came to clean our room between 1 and 2 every day. The continental breakfast featured fresh fruit, fruit cocktail, muffins, pastry, toast, English muffins, and plain bagels. There are also orange juice, coffee, and tea available. The area was kept clean and the tables were comfortable. Overall, this is a comfortable beach hotel at a wonderfully affordable price. If they can work out the small glitches I would return in a heartbeat! If you go to Daytona Beach you MUST visit Via Genovese on Dunlawton Ave just off South Atlantic Avenue.

That's the only thing I would describe great with this hotel. You can tell it's an older hotel...the decor is nice but used looking. The lobby is nice and the grounds are nice but the pool area was dirty, the tiki bar was a cart basically with old, dirty chairs and the hot tubs didn't work. Note to manager...for an upcoming holiday weekend, get the hot tubs fixed. One had water in it but the jets didn't work and the other was empty...both looked old. They do charge for parking and you better not go out at night because you won't have a space when you get back...it was probably like this because it was full for the holiday. Our rooms were okay...we had an oceanfront efficiency. The beds are only doubles and quite small so if your large and sleep with another, you'll be up most of the night...no room. Our view was very nice but the beach was blocked by palm trees, no big deal...good view of the pool area though with beach in background. The free high speed internet was unreliable but when it did work, it was good speed wise. Try to get a lower floor, thank God we did...because in this hotel the staff has the right of way. They do not have service elevators so the wait for the elevators was frustrating...mainly due to staff and housekeepers going up and down. We were on the 2nd floor and only used them when we had the cooler for the beach so we didn't suffer too much. The breakfast is decent...nothing special, a quick bite. Little muffins, bagels, english muffins, cereal, fruit cocktail, juice, coffee, etc. - nothing hot, except oatmeal in packets you have to make with hot water. Would we return? No...only because Florida has so many other places to offer...especially Daytona.

I\u2019m not sure if parking is free when visiting the fitness center at the sister facility. In hindsight, I should have just stayed at the sister facility. East elevator was a bit shaky and bouncy.

The only friendly staff I encountered was the young lady attending the breakfast bar area. Attitude is everything and their attitude toward friendly service was poor. With businesses pleading for customers just to survive in this very poor economy, that's a pretty sad statement!

The rooms were clean, and the name brand toiletries provided were appreciated. However, I really didn't like the shower, and finding a temperature that wasn't scalding hot or ice cold was tricky.

Actually, I must mention that the staff knew about the mischief these children were getting into, and sent security to check on it. I don't know how it all got resolved, but I was happy to see that they were on it. The beds were WONDERFULLY comfortable! I was pleasantly surprised. We booked a standard room, but were pleasantly surprised to see that we were still able to sit out on our balcony and enjoy the oceanview.

However, the family reunion people checked out that morning, so the next day and a half were completely crowd-free.

We were there five days and they kept putting out of order signs on one several different times. They bounce when it stops at your floor! -The stairwell stinks! I could barely stand it. -The bar & grill was NEVER OPEN while we were there. Total waste. -The tiki bar, while nice, was only open weather-permitting and the bartender would take off pretty regularly and just pop up at some point. -The room was very small. -The really do nickel-and-dime charge you for the in-room safe & parking. It's a 100% profit for them, and it really shows they are not dedicated toward serving the customer. -The hot tubs were scary. The other reviews tell the truth-the paint is chipped and floating around, the jets don't work, and they don't get cleaned. Only one was actually semi-warm and lit up at night while we were there. -The parking lights are non-existent. There is some glow from the hotel, if you're lucky enough to get a spot that close. -The internet didn't work at all during our visit. So there you go. I wouldn't ever stay here again or recommend it to a friend, because there are better hotels in the area for the price tag. And beware!!

However, they were very clean and the hotel service was very good. They always had fresh towels and soaps, shampoos, etc. for us. Everyone was very friendly. Our room had a view of the ocean. It also had a microwave and fridge. It was everything that we needed. We cooked most of our meals in the room in the microwave. The maids even left us some dish towels...so nice of them! There was a room safe in the closet...which was nice. There were also pool towels in the room! I was very impressed with that! The pool was amazing...so big and very clean. The water was amazing. The best part is that there is a beach access right by the pool. The beach is wonderful and there is a place to rent beach chairs and golf carts and ATVs right there! We rented a golf cart ..... if you go before 11 AM then you get 1/2 hour free! It was only $40 an hour for the golf cart...very good deal! We got the 1/2 hour free also....even better! We had a wonderful vacation. The only negative things I can say about the hotel is that it is sometimes hard to find a parking spot. But that is everywhere! Also, the elevator is very slow! And the air conditioner is set on a motion sensor. If you are sitting still in your room for a long period of time, the air conditioner will shut off...you have to wave your arm to get it to come back on.

They even provided Bath and Body Works soaps, lotions, shower gel and shampoos! Our balcony had a view of the city, inlet waterway and the ocean...traffic could be heard at times, but that's what happens when you are near a busy road! Air conditioner was a little noisy...constantly turning off and on...heard the front desk supervisor explain to a lady ahead of me as I was checking out that they can be adjusted if you ask the front desk...do wish I had known that before my check-out, but mentioned that to her and she took off my parking fee and safe fee and I didn't even know it until I looked at my bill walking out the door! Speaking of the parking fees and safe fee, it is clearly stated on your form at check-in that you are resposible for those charges. It also states it on the website! I do think that these are unnecessary charges, but for the cost of the hotel, even adding those on, it is still very affordable! I do agree that the pool side chairs need some attention...I wouldn't say there was mold on them, though. They were just worn. Only one hot tub was working (and the paint was peeling from the bottom) when we were there, but when it's 95 degrees, you don't want to spend much time in them, anyway! The continental breakfast was very nice...the man who takes care of things every morning does a great job...I would consider him efficient, not the bother that the other reviewer said! As far as taking things to your room from the breakfast, I'm sure they had people abuse it and take some food for their lunch, too, so you know how it is...there is always someone out there who ruins it for everybody! I just can't say enough about the front desk staff...Jennifer was there every day we were there and couldn't have been nicer.

We highly recommend spending just a bit more for the view! With the door propped open the beautiful ocean breezes freshen the room, and with the door closed you can't hear the roar of the ocean. Breakfast was included for us, and as others have commented on, has something for everyone...and plenty of it. Our breakfast attendant was great. Our daughter wasn't feeling well Christmas morning. We went down to get a tray to bring back to her, and mentioned this to him,. He disappeared and returned with a plate of Christmas goodies for her that weren't available in the breakfast area! Very thoughtful! YES the elevators are slow and quite small. It wasn't bad when we first arrived, but the hotel started to fill up after Christmas, and then we did wait. TIP: the elevator at the road side of the hotel is faster! Most people wait for the one near the ocean side because it's closest to the breakfast area and the pool/ocean...making it even slower!! The pool area is only in the sun for the morning hours and is quite chilly! The condo that was built next door blocks the sun for the afternoon ( see photo ), so that's a good time to sit on the beach. There are two hot tubs, only one of which was out of order, the other WAS working which the other reviewer neglected to mention. They also drained and cleaned the hot tub and scrubbed the area around it at night. There is a kiddie pool as well, but both pools get quite sandy because people clean their feet in them. There is a foot wash at ground level at the gate to the beach, and also a shower on the other side! Would be good if they had a sign for the foot wash, cause obviously most people don't know it's there! YES the parking charge is annoying ($5.33 inc tax per day), but the safe charge can be reversed if you don't use it. The only other thing that bothered us was our room had a connecting door to a room with a King size bed. The couple that stayed there reqested a playpen for their baby and it was set up directly in front of the connecting door!! So we heard them, and the baby crying for most of the nights that they were there...but other than that the rooms were pretty soundproof.

I was meeting some business friends in Daytona Beach and i chose to stay at this hotel. I received a rate of $89 + parking fees on Priceline so i thought it was a good deal. As you read in previous reviews the staff really is the lifeline of this hotel. The staff at the Acapulco are very kind and accomodating. ROOM The rooms at the Acapulco are quite large for the price. I was lucky to get a room upgrade to a top floor ocean front. The view was wonderful and the room was good all around. Ask for room 801. You can't go wrong. ;<) My room had a stove, eating utensiles, microwave, mini fridge with freezer and a sink to clean dishes. Amenity wise the rooms are good. No complaints really. STAFF As mentioned i did get a room upgrade to ocean front for only a few dollars more. The staff was quite accomodating about having me stay an extra day even though they were fully booked. They did their best and succeeded in making room for the extra night. HOTEL You may hear of parking issues on previous reviews. I was at the Acapulco during the Turkey Run at Daytona. The hotel was at capacity and there was room for all cars no problem. I was returning between 1 and 2 in the morning and there was room for me to park no problem. The lobby is good and up to date. They offer a free morning breakfast which i don't know if i can really recommend. I prefer not to go in to cardiac arrest. The breakfast consisted of a fruit salad which was mediocre. The rest was items like mini donuts of various types and greasy muffins. I would certainly go out of the hotel if you are looking for a healthier breakfast alternative. The pool area is okay. It consists of two hot tubs and a pool. There is also 2 shuffle board courts for kids. LOCATION Acapulco is right on the beach. If you like to go for a walk on the beach in the morning it is perfect. IT IS FAR TRENDY RESTAURANTS AND THE ACTION IN DAYTONA BEACH. You will have to drive about 6 miles which takes about 15-20 minutes to get to the trendy area with all the good restaurants. DISLIKES The elevators at the Acapulco are the slowest in the nation. The night i go there i was quite patient and understanding. After a couple of days, however, you get tired of waiting 10 minutes for the elevators. No word of a lie... you will have to wait 10 minutes for the elevator.. no exaggeration here. There are 2 elevators and i was told by some guests that they actually got stuck in one of the elevators AND one guest even claimed he had to pry the door open to get out. My other dislike about the hotel is that it can get loud. I was getting back as mentioned earlier at 1-2 in the morning and there were people drinkng and partying in the hallways. MY OVERALL IMPRESSION The price was okay but really there's nothing incredible about the hotel that would make me go back. The good staff just isn't enough to make this hotel a winner or a memorable experience when in Daytona Beach. My friends stayed at Daytona Beach Resort and Conference Center. I would highly recommend this hotel because of the great location and the fact that it is much nicer.

The only complaint was that the dbl beds are really small so my husband slept in one bed and I in the other because it was too close (requested a king but none available). The rooms were kept clean and fresh towels everyday Free continental bkfst was nice. As far as the $5.00 a day additonal parking fee - I was told it was included in the total I had charged to my card but when we arrived they tried to charge again and since we trailered our bike down we had to park this offsite with an additional $15.00 a day fee (of which we were never informed of in advance - especially since I asked upfront) I don't understand the parking fee - I am paying to park in the hotel lot - why not include this in the rate of the room.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, Great staff...\u201d", "Author": "Patrick G", "ReviewID": "UR20115000", "Content": "Stayed with my family and had a second room for some friends. I knew the hotel was one of the better hotels in daytona beach so i kinda knew what to expect for a room and amenities but was really pleasantly surprised by how welcoming and accommodating all of the staff were that i came in contact with. The guy that checked me in smiled and was accommodating. A few hours into our stay, the AC in our room started to make a knocking sound, i called it in and within a few minutes, one of the staff was up and fixed it, again, with a really nice personality and open to conversation. When he left, he said if you need anything else i'll be here until midnight. The next morning we went down to get some breakfast as the hotel was offering a free continental breakfast and the guy that was attending to it was working really hard at everyone's requests. he went so far to warm up my son's milk in the microwave and get a few other specialty items that we requested. We had an oceanfront efficiency room and a connecting oceanview room with 2 beds. Both were very nice with private balconies. There was a full moon when we stayed and it was beautiful overlooking the pool area and ocean from our balcony.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LANCASHIRE", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "MOLLYLancashire", "ReviewID": "UR19608648", "Content": "we stayed here 4 nights had a great time excellent staff especially barbara at the tiki bar and indoor bar also will the manager very friendly to .rooms very clean with nice added touch of lovely soaps we had a room on side of hotel but still had great view of beach and ocean could also see halifax river from balcony .pool was lovely clean and right by the beach we had food by pool one day was lovely and very resonable priced .main hotel areas very presentable.would deffinatly stay here again good value for money.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dudley West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cCracking Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lucygoosy77", "ReviewID": "UR19074894", "Content": "What a little gem if your on a budget.

Pros - The reception area, lifts, hall ways were very clean. All staff were extremely helpfull and friendly. Room cleaning was very good - daily cleaning and daily supply of clean towels for both the room and beach / pool area. View from all rooms is excellant as all rooms can view the beach The hotel is on the beach and has easy access to the beach Hotel was nice and quiet with no excess noise or trouble There were ice and vending machines on alternate floors Cons - Pool area was clean but could be cleaner - e.g. pool deck was not washed down daily, rubbish not picked up daily The restaurant opened and closed at various hours depending on how many people were aroun. Therefore it was easy to get caught out without food as it could close at 4 in the afternoon ! The hotel automatically charges all rooms a daily fee of $5 + taxes for parking and $1.50 plus taxes for the safety depsoit box. On check out then you have to explain how many actual days you used it for Both hot tubs were not working Summary - we would recommend the hotel and stay there again. But Hire a car as the Daytona areais so big it is hard to get around and the buses only run 2 per hour !", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bethied74", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Daytona Stay I've Experienced\u201d", "Author": "bethied74", "ReviewID": "UR18247254", "Content": "This was our fifth trip to Daytona Beach and this is, by far, the best hotel I've experienced.

If we would happen to come back to the room while they were working, they would just fuss over my two year old twins and try to make them laugh. The pool area was nice and the access to the beach was perfect. It's on the south end of Daytona Beach and away from all the Boardwalk hubbub.

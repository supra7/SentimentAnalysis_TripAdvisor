Big tv,clean carpets and very comfortable beds(although they were high our toddler struggled to get off /on bed)Paid for roll away bed didn't use as beds were big enough. Rooms cleaned daily. Didn't try pool, tried cafe 101 very tasty food shame they dont do kids portions, (not part of hotel). Location was a 10 min walk to walk of fame, and felt quite safe walking there in evening. A garage nearby we got snacks/drinks from and a fabulous bakery next door we got our breakfasts from. We had to pay for valet of car even though we didn't use car at all because the public transport is very good and very cheap and the traffic is manic so was easier to walk/ public transport everywhere.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boone, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean, good value\u201d", "Author": "tqmbill", "ReviewID": "UR127327317", "Content": "Stayed here 3/21-28/2012 because it is near my daughter's apartment, so we didn't have to have a rental car.

We are from San Diego so we know Hollywood is a little rough but we wanted to walk to the Kodak Theatres and see the sites on the way. So we read TA reviews and booked this hotel. I don't think the parking is free anymore but we found a parking spot right next to the hotel. We were planning to pay for parking but this spot was literally next door. So I think we saved 12.00. The lobby has many pictures hanging of famous actors and was going for the old Hollywood Vibe. The hotel is in rectangle shape with the pool in the middle. Our room was on the bottom floor and when we entered the room we were surprised with all of the art they had up. It was similiar to the lobby but they had even cooler pictures, some were even new like Harry Potter and old like the Beatles. We were able to walk all the way to the Kodak Theatres from our hotel and see everything on the way and get some good food. Maybe a mile or two. It was a little seedy until we actually got to Hollywood Boulevard, which is funny to say because the Boulevard is a litte seedy. What I really mean is unlike the Boulevard where there is traffic and stores, where we walked, it did not have alot of pedestrians walking around. If my husband was not there, I probably wouldn't have walked by myself (even though I know I would have because I would convince myself not be a wimp). I didn't get to eat at the restaurant because we were going to try out this awesome breakfast place down the road. If you want to cheap hotel close to Hollywood Boulevard this is it. I am more of a people watcher person so I would probably stay more on the boulevard if I had too this again but that would also cost about about $100 more.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rubear", "ReviewID": "UR125901879", "Content": "Travelled to Los Angeles for work and had a couple of nights as free time so checked into this hotel.

It was my first time staying here so I did not know what to expect. The hotel does a wonderful job keeping everything clean, from the lobby to the bedrooms. I stayed in room 124, which is on the first floor across from the pool. The room was spacious, clean, and very modern looking. The bathroom was big too. The room had a coffee maker, refrigerator and microwave. I was able to get the room for $108 a night. I believe if you have AAA it may be cheaper. The air conditioner worked well. The only problem I had, was that you could hear everything. My sleep was interrupted many times because I could hear the people who were hanging out by the pool area. I could also hear the TV in the room next to me. Room 124 is right by the ice machine. A plus and negative at the same time. Unfortunately, I could hear when people were getting ice. Which kind of stinks when it is 3AM and your trying to sleep. I believe it took us about 15-20min to walk to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Do yourself a favor, and walk over to the W hotel which is about four blocks away from the Best Western Hollywood Hills, and go to the Metro station and buy a $5.00 subway pass. You can use this all day. Take the subway to Hollywood and Wine where all the action is, and it will drop you off right by the Kodak theatre within a matter of minutes. There is also a outdoor mall. This was very handy when I did not want to deal with the many people laying on the street asking for money. Attached to this hotel is a GREAT place to eat. I highly recommend ordering the chocolate brownie waffle, which comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup drizzled on top. A wonderful dessert, enough for two people to share.

There's certain aspects of it that may scream \"WHOA, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!\", but as long as you know what to expect (reading these reviews is a good start ;)), I think most people can have a really good stay here. For starters, the hotel exterior looks really dumpy. Like a rundown apartment or low-income residence....I almost thought they were closed for renos the way it looked from the outside. The hipster-wannabes standing around the hotel sidewalk don't really help much (they're perfectly harmless though....lol). In addition, it also took me a little while to find the entrance to the hotel (it's a bit past where the valet is sitting). Secondly, the location. Ohhhhh the location. On the one hand, it's only about a 5-7 minute walk to Hollywood & Vine, so it's pretty close to the \"action\" on Hollywood Blvd. On the other hand, you have to walk up a very dumpy and sorry-looking Argyle Avenue (the closest street to the hotel). From Hollywood & Argyle (where the \"W\" is located) to Franklin & Argyle, you'll pass - in no particular order: 1) The most run-down, ugliest, beat up pay phone I've ever seen in my life (wish I took a picture of it!) 2) 2-3 busy parking lots with a lot of cars going in and out (seems like I allllllmost got run over everyday while walking to/from the hotel) 3) Under a highway bridge, where homeless people tend to sleep at night (again, harmless, but you may have to encounter them while you're walking back to your hotel at night) 4) A boring looking plaza (right beside the hotel) where I saw a few \"transactions\" going on at 2 in the morning At this point, either you're going to close this hotel page because you're already scared off....or you'll keep reading, looking for the reasons this was voted 5/5 (if you're sticking around...good!) Because apart from those 2 \"issues\" noted above (which in the grand scheme of things, really weren't a big deal for me), this hotel is pretty darn awesome. Ok, ok...the lobby is a little dumpy (it's going under renovations though), but everything is made up by the awesome, comfy, quiet and SPOTLESS hotel rooms! I came in around 12:30pm, and was able to check into my room early without any problems; the front-desk staff are also quite nice as well. As for the hotel rooms themselves, they are HUGE - a lot bigger than many \"budget\"/mid-class hotels I've stayed in. Secondly, as mentioned, the rooms are VERY well kept and seem to have been renovated recently, with new beds, a microwave and fridge (extremely useful!), new washroom, carpeting/tiles etc. Really clean, trust me! (I didn't notice any odd scents as some others did) The one odd thing about these rooms (or at least my room) is that the CLOSET was located in the BATHROOM (yeah, seriously!). No idea if that was just my room because it was located at the end of the hall, but it was a little odd to see that (no biggie I guess). But speaking of the bathroom (which is also quite spacious), the 2 sinks are a pretty nice touch if you're staying with someone else. In addition, there's no bathTUB in your room, just a shower (again, no big deal...but that means no bubble baths either ;)) Other than that, you had the very big-screen TV (with a surprising amount of channels), a great A/C unit and solid Wi-Fi service (you have to get the password from the front desk). I ate at the (kinda-sorta popular) \"101 Cafe\" in the hotel; nothing special to be honest. Meh. The hotel itself, while pretty \"no-frills\" (no gym, room service etc.), does its job as a good place to rest (besides, when you're in LA you won't be spending much time in your room!). I would suggest looking for deals online (Expedia and the like), because booking through Best Western is pretty expensive (I got the room at a great price of $70/night on Expedia). When you sign in, they also mention a $5 energy fee per night you have to pay - but I wasn't charged that. Not sure what the deal with that is, but just keep it in mind so you aren't surprised. I guess that's about it for this hotel. To be truthful, I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to families with young kids - it really doesn't have a \"family\" atmosphere to it (although I'm hard pressed to think of any hotel in Hollywood that does). But for solo/couples/families with older kids, I think this is a pretty good hotel to consider. P.S. - The Hollywood memorabilia/pics hanging all over the hotel are a really nice touch (check out my pics for some examples)", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Deigo, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat but got some attitude from valet\u201d", "Author": "kpim", "ReviewID": "UR96368751", "Content": "Don't judge the hotel by the outside.

It's walking distance to hollywood blvd and about a mile to the Chinese Theatre. Then we left to have dinner and came back around 1130. Based on our previous experience with Valet, we tried to park our own car. The new valet person pretty much yelled at us, asked if we were staying at the hotel, then demanded proof that we were staying at the hotel. After showing him our hotel key, he condescendingly asked us if we were staying here or if our friends are staying here and we're just using their key, he asked 20 questions about when we checked in, what room number we were in, and if the hotel knows we're parking a vehicle. I guess because we're in our mid 20s we don't look like we can afford the best western?? He was such a jerk and ruined our stay. Luckily the staff in the hotel was very nice and kinda made up for it.

When arriving at the hotel It was clear to myself and my friend that we certainly weren't staying in six star luxury, the outside of the building looked a tad weathered to say the least. However once inside the Hotel we were very impressed. The Hotel staff were welcoming and were very helpful with excellent knowledge of LA and its attractions. Our twin double bedded room was clean, comfortable and very roomy, we were particularly impressed with the large television and the spacious en-suite bathroom. Initially we were concerned with the road which our room overlooked but found that the little noise pollution wasn't a issue at all especially during the night. Quite possibly the best thing about the hotel was the amazing '101 cafe'. The cafe was reasonably priced- especially for the enormous portions of food and is open pretty much 24-7, it always had a relaxed atmosphere and a cool retro interior. The hotel is situated about a ten minute walk from Sunset Blvd and a twenty minute walk up the hill to the Hollywood sign, we both found the hotel excellent value for money and would certainly stay there again in the future.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "nocturnalgirl72", "ReviewID": "UR64333512", "Content": "Lobby was very small and non exciting but check in was fast.

However upon arrival this Hollywood charm was what I found. The reception staff were very helpful upon check-in, they upgraded me and my friend to a Double Queen and it was absouletly huge. The room had a seating area, 2 queen beds, a kitchen, a desk with wireless internet access and the biggest hotel bathroom I have ever seen. We even had his & her sinks with a huge shower. It really did impress me and I think the majority of the reviews on this website are just from people expecting a five star hotel at low prices. If you want 5 star pay for it! The location of the hotel was fabulous right on the doorstep was Hollywood Blvd, the home of The Walk of Fame, Manns Chinese Theater, Kodak Theater and close to transportation networks. However if you are planning your L.A. trip and you are over 25 I highly recommend hiring a car, the roads are easy but public transport is awful! Everyone drives in L.A. so there transport system doesnt have to be great. However if you are not keen on driving out there the bus is cheap however ask reception for the right route you need and they will direct you to the bus stop. Or use the Metro subway system compared to London's Tube and New York's subway it is a small system with only 4 networks within the system. But again is extremely cheap! Also my top tip:- book a tour to see the Movie Star homes, many visit the homes of Hollywoods biggest celebritys on Mulholland Drive and also the sights of Bel Air and Beverly Hills including the oh so glamourous Rodeo Drive (take your credit cards if you plan to shop there just to warn you prices normally start from $500 for a small garmet and can go over $50,000 for evening dresses and shoes!). Tours are around $35 roughly 3 hours long. Also another tip: - DO NOT TAKE A CAB FROM THE AIRPORT in high traffic it can cost you up to $70 from LAX, so try and arrange a private car from the hotel or a respected company which will cost you around $55 excluding tip. This will save you money. I think L.A. would appeal to adults however young children Hollywood may not be suitable. If you are planning a holiday to California with the kids, try Anahiem or San Diego were it is more family friendly. Overall the hotel was fabulous, the location extremely convient and L.A. is just incredible!! P.S. eat at the popular celebrity hangout Coffee 101 one lunchtime.

There was a small refrigerator, along with a microwave and coffee pot, behind a sliding door. The large bathroom was really nice: beautiful tile all around, with a walk-in, 2-person shower. The staff seemed professional and responsive. I usually avoid hotels with exterior corridors, but the doors and key system seemed secure. I'm very picky about hotels, and I think this was a good value for the Hollywood area. I should mention that another guest's car was broken into one night while I was there, but that comes with the territory. I also spent 2 nights in the nearby Rennaissance on this trip, and I'm not sure the $200 per night difference in cost was worth it, unless you include the celebrity sightings at the Rennaissance.

I agree with another reviewer, the lobby had a funky smell. After 1 night ( I was supposed to be there for 3) I checked out. I stayed at the holiday inn at hollywood and highland.

Our room was large with two double beds, a microwave, fridge and television and both the room and bathroom were cleaned daily. We didnt have a car and as such we were a bit worried about how we would get around before we arrived, but found that the hotel was in a perfect location to visit all the main attractions. You can walk to Grauman's Chinese theatre, the hollywood museum, the Kodak Theatre etc... in about 20 minutes and easily catch buses and the metro to the studios from Hollywood Boulevard which is just a short walk away. We also walked to Paramount which only took about 40 mins. The only difficulty is getting to Beverley Hills, but it isnt impossible - you can catch a bus nearby or join a tour. The only negative thing we did find about the hotel is that the staff at reception are not very helpful at all! They were vague on attractions and would not book a shuttle for us to get to the airport! They will only book a taxi for you with the firm they use. We didnt use the pool while we were there but it looked okay and we would definately recommend the cafe next to it as the food is really good and reasonably priced. You can eat in or take away. If we were to go back we would stay here again.", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN PLUS Hollywood Hills Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77243-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_PLUS_Hollywood_Hills_Hotel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$118 - $225*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6141 Franklin Avenue</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Hollywood</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90028</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "77243", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/f2/d9/cd/best-western-hollywood.jpg"}}

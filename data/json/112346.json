All the other reviews were right on! This hotel is a great find - very comfortable accommodations, unbeatable location, reasonable price. I stayed for 3 nights at the end of June and I was extremely satisfied.The Bush/Stockton St. location is prime - 1 block from Powell-Hyde or Powell-Mason and 2 blocks from Calif. cable lines. 2 blocks up from Union Sq. and 1 street over from Chinatown gates. Stockton St. is on the route of several major MUNI bus lines - 30, 45. Compared to other trendy hotels, Juliana is in a much safer area than those on Geary St. (Savoy, Monaco, Diva et al).Loved all the complimentary services, incl. the Aveda toiletries, cont'l breakfast (not fancy, not quality, but it nicely compensated for a lack of a hotel restaurant), the bowl of apples, the wine reception, the towncar service to fin'l district.For better breakfast fare, walk 1 block to Grant St. to get something at Second Cup or Cafe de la Presse. Or as another reviewer mentioned, the Roxanne rest. on Powell St. is 1 block in the other direction.My room on the 4th flr was well-decorated and spacious. Lots of walking space even though it included a double bed, 2 night tables, a desk/chair, sofa, armchair, round corner table, TV cabinet. Bathroom was large, clean and bright. Great water pressure, too. Bed was plump with a mattress pad and I had more down pillows than I needed.A small quibble was that even though my room was at the back of Bush St., I was awoken by noisy garbage trucks early every morning. Even on the weekends.If you require parking, use the Sutter/Stockton multi-level garage across the street. There are entrances on Bush and on Sutter St. $6 for 24 hours.The front desk staff were a bit clued out when it came to tourist info, such as locations of places (a convalescent home), bus lines and their frequency or even the cost of stamps. However, they were well-trained for their courtesy.Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay and have no hesitation recommending it or staying there again.", "Date": "Jul 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR375429211", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "IntrepidfromMontreal"}, {"Content": "GREAT LOCATION, GREAT PRICE I stayed at the Juliana at the end of May to attend a conference, and to my delight, the hotel was only steps away from Union Square and about a 10min walk from the convention center.

We stayed at the Juliana Hotel from February 26-29, 2004. We arrived very late on the 26th and had no problem with check-in although the evening clerk was not nearly as friendly as the daytime staffers. We requested a quiet room, away from the streets, on a higher-up floor. We were on the sixth floor and our room was extremely quiet. The hotel matched the Expedia price of $87.55 per night. The room is small but comfortable it is an older building and not like a large-scale chain hotel. The bed, linens, and pillows were all extremely comfortable important after a long day of walking around the city. The bathroom is spotless with soft, absorbent towels monogrammed with the hotel's initials (nice touch). Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo and conditioner, along with Aveda soaps are left in the bathrooms for your use. A limited continental breakfast is served until 9 am. It consists of orange juice, ice water, coffee, tea, muffins, and Danishes. There is also a bowl of apples in the lobby. There is a computer in the lobby from which you can purchase internet time ($4 for 20 minutes, $10 for an hour). There is also wireless internet available for your laptops in the lobby (you need a wireless card). The hotel is in a great location a very short block from the cable cars and you can see Macy's and the major shops in Union Square from the front door. The front desk staff members were not bursting with tourist-y knowledge but they were helpful enough to get you to where you were going. We had a very full schedule and never attended the wine reception but overheard other guests saying what a nice touch it was. Overall great hotel, great value, great location.

The hotel is centrally located about 2 blocks away from the Chinatown gates, but is in a fairly safe neighborhood, about 3 blocks from Union Square, close to major bus lines, restaurants, etc.Very clean rooms, fairly spacious for a 3 star hotel. Nice modern European inspired color scheme and decor. Rooms were pleasant with A/C  heating unit. Pretty quiet considering it is so close to busy areas. Loved the Aveda products, good water pressure, clean and modern bathrooms. The service was great, nice staff with a helpful attitude. Fair continental breakfast, small store bought pastries, decent coffee and OJ. Did not partake in the wine reception, noticed the wine quality isn't excellent (but did not expect it to be) - mostly Charles Shaw wines from Trader Joe's.Discovered a cool little bar called Tunnel Top cross corner from the hotel. Late 20's early 30's crowd, cool loft, DJ, cheap beer, relaxed atmosphere.I later found out that this hotel also offers a 15% discount to dine at Roxanne's nearby (which once was my favorite SF breakfast place, but has become less reliable in terms of service and food).All in all, the Juliana is better than one might expect, very comfortable, great bargain overall.

My girlfriend and I (both in our late 20's) just got back from a 4 day vacation in San Francisco. We are budget conscious travellers. This would be our first time to SF and knew that we wanted to do all the typical touristy things near/in downtown SF. We decided to stay in this hotel based upon the reviews on this website and the price (I got a standard room with a queen-sized bed for $130 CDN per night); I got this deal on expedia. This hotel seemed to offer the best location, ammenity, and price combination that I could find. I'm sure that there are better hotel deals out there, but location was a key for us. Also, we were warned by our friends that some areas of SF are quite questionable (there are some areas you definitely want to stay away from, especially if you are a single female traveller). As far as I am concerned, all the reviews about this hotel on this website up to this date are accurate.PROS:-great central location to see many tourist attractions in a pretty clean area of downtown. We ended up walking to most attractions. When something was too far, or we got tired of walking, we would just hop onto public transportation. The bus system is SF is excellent (cheap, clean, convenient, and I found the bus drivers to be very helpful and friendly). Most bus stops have maps so that you can decide what bus you need to take. The attractions we went to were: Fisherman's Wharf, Embarcadero, Alcatraz, Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, Pier 39, Lombard Street, Union Square, Financial district, SF Museum of Modern Art, SF Center and Metreon shopping centers, Fillmore and Unions street shops, Japantown, Fort Mason, Marina District, Ghiradelli Square, Exploratorium, Palace of the Legion of Honor, and the Palace of Fine Arts.-felt safe at this hotel location. The Ritz-Carlton is one block away, so you know it couldn't be that bad. I did see one or two panhandlers near our hotel, but they didn't bother us. They were not aggressive or abusive. Try not to book a hotel in the TENDERLOIN district because there are lots of panhandlers and homeless people around. This hotel is sufficiently removed from the TENDERLOIN district (the area bordered by Van Ness, Ellis, Mason, and Market Street).-friendly and helpful staff.-an appreciative cleaning staff. I left a $5 tip on the pillow every morning, and always came back to a thank-you note (let's just say I've never had cleaning staff leave me a thank-you note before). And they did a good job of cleaning too.-every morning, there was juice, coffee, muffins, and danishes available in the lobby. And every early evening, there is a complimentary wine tasting. We didn't take advantage of either because our agenda didn't allow for it. However, lots of other guests did.-The rooms look just like on the website. It was clean. More than adequate for travellers that just want a place to rest their heads at night.CONS:-room size was definitely adequate for the two of us. But for larger parties, the room would be too small (I'm sure that there must be larger rooms).-the hotel is a small boutique hotel, which means that it is a nicely decorated and quaint, but it is an older hotel. The problem with this is that the windows were old and did not do much to keep out the noise from outside. We had a room on the 2nd floor facing Stockton Street (side of the hotel). Let's just say that SF has a very active downtown core and in the early morning, the street sweepers and garbage trucks are out in full force. You can either try asking for a room higher up in the hotel and facing the alley (there isn't a view from the front or sides of the hotel anyways, so you won't be missing anything), or bring a pair of ear plugs (once you have ear plugs on, you won't notice a thing).-air conditioning unit is loud, but we didn't need to use it.-I can't explain it, but there were a couple of mosquitos in our room for a couple of the nights that we stayed. I ended up with 5 bites even though I thought I killed them all (but my girlfirend got away untouched). They must have gotten in when we opened the window in the bathroom to let the steam out.-no concierge service, but we didn't need it anyways. They were some helpful pamphlets and a very helpful map at the unattended concierge desk.-the carpet on the stairs was worn, but it's not like it affected our enjoyment.SF TIPS:-If you are doing things in downtown SF, then this is a good hotel to be staying at. However, if you are doing things outside of downtown SF (i.e. NAPA Valley, Sausalito, Monterey), then you mind as well stay at a cheaper hotel outside of town and rent a car (parking is expensive in downtown SF; around $20 US a day).-We saved a bundle on transportation by walking or taking the bus when we needed to. The bus only costs $1.25 US and is good for 1.5hrs unlimited travel in one direction. The BART subway takes you between the airport and downtown SF for only $4.70 US/per person, one way. The ride in from/out to the airport is convenient, safe, and is 15 minutes faster than a cab, and $40 cheaper. The BART is only 5 blocks away from the hotel (Powell Street station).", "Date": "Oct 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR875566618", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great Deal Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Juliana hotel.

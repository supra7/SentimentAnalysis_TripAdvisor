I said I based my coming down to breakfast according to their information and booked the Inn because they served breakfast. While bickering with him, the woman cleaning up the breakfast area let someone else in to grab a few pre-packaged pastries. They did let us eat a few of the breakfast items.

But when it comes to finding an affordable hotel in a good location for under $100, that's a different story. There are a lot of scary places and hotels way off the beaten path. And what may only look like a 15 or 20 minute car trip on the map can often turn into a 2-hour nightmare on LA's infamous roads. That's why I have chosen to stay at the Comfort Inn whenever I want to take a few days in Los Angeles beyond what work will pay for. (I actually get to stay in many of the city's finest hotels for work but I'm not about to spend $300-$400 on my own nickel!) The Comfort Inn is literally right next door to the city's Metro station that's just a few quick stops from Hollywood and the Kodak Theater. IF you don't mind a long trip, you can also take the train(s) to LAX, but it's at least a 1.5-2 hour journey. It's also on several major buslines, including the Beverly bus that goes all the way through Beverly Hills and connects to busses that'll easily take you to Santa Monica and the ocean. But what really keeps me coming back is the service and staff. Peter the manager is a great guy and his team are all efficient and courteous. They also offer FREE internet and a breakfast that includes eggs, sausage, waffles, toast, fruit, cereal and yogurt. The great irony is that the breakfast and internet would cost you an additional $30 or $40 bucks at least at the hotels that charge $300 and up a night! Finally, the rooms are very clean with a flat screen tv, and a really nice shower with a massaging feature, a refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave right in the room. Don't be concerned when you arrive - the street and outside could concern some people who haven't stayed in Urban hotels. But once you get in the lobby and are greeted by the staff, the experience will be a very good one.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cReasonable hotel with good metro red line connection\u201d", "Author": "Si_uk_says", "ReviewID": "UR117582221", "Content": "Stayed here for the first part of out trip for 5 nights. We took the LAX Flyaway to Union Station $7 and then the Metro Line red ($5 day pass, $20 for 7 days) to Vermont/Beverly Station. The Hotel is one building away to the left from the Metro station. We were greeted but a pleasant guy on reception and quickly checked in. The reception area looked clean and modern, we then took the lift (elevator) to the 2nd floor, the lift did not look as modern and looked like it could do with some TLC. The hallways in the hotel looked in a good state if a little dated, the doors to the rooms could do with a fresh paint job though. The room was large with two double comfy beds with a bedside table and alarm clock between the beds, Two sitting chairs and table, A large unit containing drawers and cupboard below the TV, A large flat screen TV, Fridge, Coffee maker, Microwave, large walk in wardrobe (Closet), Ironing board, Iron and a safe. The room also had it's own air conditioning unit and free wireless internet access. The bathroom was a good size with a large mirror and sink area, toilet and a low level bath and shower The shower did have a strange attachment that produced a rain effect as one of the settings. The breakfast was reasonable including three cereals, a selection of cakes and pastries, bagels and bread that could be toasted and a waffle maker. There was also fresh fruit and plenty of juices and plenty of tea and coffee. A member of staff was regularly clearing up and keeping the cakes and pastries topped up. The area surrounding the hotel felt reasonably safe, we walked along Vermont Ave (Left from the Hotel) in the afternoon and found a selection of shops, including a small supermarket and plenty of placed to eat including McDonalds about half a mile up the road. There are also plenty of petrol (gas) stations along the road. The area after dark felt reasonably safe, we felt safe enough to walk from the metro station to the hotel after midnight. In summary - The hotel is a good location for travellers not using a car as it is in a great location on the Metro Red line that can take you to the Hollywood/Highland station where the Walk of Fame and Chinese Theatres can be found, Universal Studios (Universal City Station) and Union Street Station for Trains and LAX Flyway. The Hotel also has a car park and only a few blocks away from a free way. The not so good stuff - The d\u00c3\u00a9cor might not be to everyone's taste yellow and green in the room. Some of the paint was peeling around the edges such as at the bottom of the doors, the outlook from a lot of the rooms is onto other buildings, the breakfast selection is limited compared to other hotels and the breakfast room is small.

I stayed 2 nights at this hotel in February during the course of a school trip. We were a group of 3 teachers and 23 grade 9 students from Montreal that were on a school trip to California and the Grand Canyon. We had stayed in a Hampton inn in South San Francisco and then took a bus to get to LA. I had called the hotel a week before to ask them to put us on the second floor since we were with minors and we did not want them going out the window in the middle of the night. The guy on the phone assured me that everything would be in order when we would get there.....are you guessing the end of the story? Almost all the rooms were with a window facing a large balcony that other rooms could access. I immediately went downstairs to have the issue resolved, even if it was past 10 o'clock at night, and I have to give thanks to the night manager that changed every room to other rooms that did not have balconies. He was not too happy but I did not give him a choice. I told him that they were minors and that it was his responsability to do so. The kids were very disappointed because we had been in a nice and clean hotel room in San Francisco and ended up in dirty hotel rooms that were scary. I did not sleep a wink all night because people were going up and down the corridor. I looked through the peephole and noticed that it was gentlemen with women. It is probably a hotel where prostitutes take clients. Let's just say that it is not a hotel where you want to take 15 year olds!!!! The rooms were disgusting....the curtains were dirty....the sheets were dirty....the bedspread was dirty....I was thoroughly disgusted with the place. It was also scary as hell. The only redeeming aspects are the fact that they switched my students to rooms that did not have balconies and the fact that they allowed us to have a pizza party in their breakfast room. We came in late from our day of sightseeing and did not feel like going out to dinner to a restaurant in the area...did I mention scary area also? The night manager, Peter I think is his name, helped us find specials on pizza and the kids were so happy to come down in their pyjamas to eat pizza and talk until curfew time. Since we did not allow them to have parties in their rooms, the setting was perfect for them. I would discourage anyone to stay there.

It has a small fridge and microwave. The beds were comfortable and linens were clean (no bed bugs!) The room has a 32\" flat screen panel HDTV which I though was funny since it's a budget hotel. Cannot comment on the free breakfast because we wanted to venture and check out the local eateries (recommend going to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle -- YUM!) Overall, the hotel was okay and would recommend it. The BIG plus side is that it is right next to the Metro Red Line which will take you anywhere in Los Angeles. We just parked our car in the hotel and took the Metro (parking is below the hotel and is safe.) I highly recommend taking the Metro. It is not only clean and safe but also cheap! If you are staying in this hotel, then most likely you are on a budget, so the Metro is a great tip for you budget travelers. With the Metro we were able to go to Union Station, Oliveras Street, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Universal Studios, Hollywood & Vine, and other tourist areas. One way ticket is $1.25, but for a whole day it is only $5 (unlimited rides.) There are not a lot of restaurants near the hotel and I would not recommend walking at night looking for places to eat.

My conference was in the Hollywood Blvd area, so I quickly booked a hotel in the same area, but a month later found trip advisor and learned that my hotel was subpar and other accommodations in the area were either to much money for not a lot of features or to much money for seriously subpar accommodations (e.g.- bedbugs, renovation incomplete, horrible customer service, etc). I also learned through the LAPD website that the crime rate in Hollywood area was concerning, as I would be heading back to my hotel between 8pm and 11pm a night after finding a place to eat dinner, safety was optimal for me as I was alone. So after reviewing over 12 hotels in the LA area I booked this Comfort Inn hotel, as most reviews were good and the bad ones were from people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do their research first and had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Diva\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like high expectations for a low budget hotel in L.A. I would recommend before booking any hotel go on \"Google Map Quest\" and take a street view tour of the address to see what the area looks like. Why I picked this hotel and what I liked about it was as follows: 1. I picked this location because I was using public transit for my entire trip including going to Santa Monica, Long Beach, The Grove, North Hollywood (Universal Studio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s & Jay Leno Show) and to and from the airport which is easy and cheap. Comfort Inn is literally 20 to 30 steps from the top of the stairs of the Vermont Subway Station. 2. It is located on a very busy street even at 11pm at night (cars and people are there) so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel isolated. 3. For the price point of a low budget hotel in a large city like LA, I found the front desk clerks to be very friendly, receptive and made me feel welcomed and that they valued my business. I was able to ask them any question no matter how ridiculous and they answered it with a smile. 4. I had very low expectations for my room so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door. There was a nice flat screen TV, large dresser with marble top, small clean fridge, microwave and coffee maker. My only advise is make sure the fridge is plugged in before putting any food inside and make sure the temperature gauge is set to #6 or more as your food won't stay. 5. The bathroom was clean, had a nice marble counter over sink and housekeeping always changed my towels and I liked the presentation of making it look like a fan. It's those little details that are nice. As an eco-friendly conscious person I liked the little sign on my night side table that gave me the option to not have my bed sheets changed by placing it on the pillow each morning, which I used frequently. 6. There were no bedbugs or insects period which was nice. The room did have a mild odour but it was because the room was very warm with the sun shinning in, so any odor in the carpet rose but nothing offensive. 7. I liked the queen bed I had which was firm the way I like it and huge. The pillows were big and soft. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a light sleeper ask for a room on the side or back of the hotel. 8. I liked the complimentary breakfast which is included in the cost of your room. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to find eggs and so I was pleasantly surprised to have boiled eggs at breakfast. I hope they someday offer scrambled eggs as an option here and there. There is also a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literally half a block up the street you can see it at the street lights from the hotel door and as a person who doesn't really eat in Denny's I had my best dinner meal of my whole stay in there for a cheap price on my last night in town. My only complaint is that the ice machine is very loud as it make ice and louder when someone goes to take ice. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Canadian from a large city so I have been exposed to many cultures and have seen and worked with the homeless, so I personally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a fear of other cultures or homeless people. This hotel is probably not for people who come from small towns or cities where they have never been exposed to or fear other cultures (especially Hispanic and African Americans- *please note I am of Carribean decent so that statement isn't ment to be racist ) or of the homeless, as there are a very few homeless people in the area, but they never ever bother or talk to me. I personally felt safe around them and they knew I was a tourist because they saw me come out of the subway with my suitcase. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a tight budget and contemplating renting a car; don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I took the transit everywhere it only cost $1.25 to $1.50 per bus or train or you can pay $5.00 for a day pass and ride all day anywhere. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy a week pass if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive on a Saturday as their week passes are preset to Saturday to Saturday for $17 I got ripped off by the check cashing place I bought my from on a Thursday for $17 and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell me it expire on Saturday.

I've traveled a lot for both business and pleasure, and never have I encountered as extreme a circumstance in a hotel as we did yesterday. Very, very long story short: My wife and I arrived at our hotel last night about 10:00 after a day of sightseeing. Our room was full of smoke and smelled like something was burning. The front desk guy, who was ESL and very difficult to understand, said that the property manager \"liked to cook\" in the room next to ours, and had apparently left something in the microwave. All afternoon and evening. That is irresponsible enough, but more disturbing was the fact that NO SMOKE OR FIRE ALARMS WERE GOING OFF, AFTER HOURS OF SMOKE IN THE ADJACENT ROOM. The hotel was acting as if this were business-as-usual, trying to pooh-pooh our concerns. Front desk guy offered us another room, but wifey and I decided we were not willing to risk our lives (and the smell of our belongings) by subjecting ourselves to two further nights at this place -- so we checked out and rebooked at another local Comfort Inn. I'd also like to interject here that this travel was booked on rewards points. We shopped for this hotel based on its relatively low per-night points cost. When this all went down at 11:00 last night, we didn't have time or resources to patiently comparison-shop our replacement lodging. I called Choice Hotels reservations, who booked me to the new hotel, told me they did not have the authority to refund points and resolve other billing issues, but that I should call customer service in the morning, with whom my issue would almost certainly be completely taken care of. This morning, I found myself on the phone with two very rude people in customer service at Choice Hotels. They offered to refund the points for my two unused nights (big whoop), plus a 10,000 point bonus for the inconvenience. This did not come close to covering the cost of the nights at the hotel we had to switch to under duress -- again, forced out by smoke in the middle of the night. At the time of writing this review, this issue remains unresolved, and I shall be speaking with a supervisor's supervisor on Monday morning. Anything less than making us whole on this without any further cost to us (money or points) is unacceptable to me, bad business as it relates to frequent customers, and will eliminate Choice Hotels as a competitor for any of my future hotel business. Bottom line: DO NOT stay at this Comfort Inn location. It is unsafe. Don't know what the fire marshall is doing in this precinct, but he should check this place out for sure. Personally, I would never recommend that anyone I care about stay at any Choice Hotels location after this incident and the subsequent dealings with their \"customer no-service\"... but that is up to your discretion. (Unrelated to the above incident: Before this incident even happened, we had stayed in the hotel one night. We'd already decided it was rather run-down and not totally clean, as well as being located in \"the hood.\" If you're in L.A. as a tourist, you won't want to walk around this hotel's neighborhood.

We went down to get the rooms switched and it was a HUGE DEAL! They said that what we book online isnt guaranteed, and we get whats available when we check in. Our paperwork clearly said king, not \"standard room\" or anything that might be misconstrued. 3) The furniture was nice at one point, but it is all dinged up, dented, and the paint is missing. The bed spread is nice, but the curtains are covered in crap. There are stains everywhere on them. It really makes me wonder how clean everything else is. 4) The free continental breakfast looked nice from the outside, but there were a number of things wrong with it. The waffle maker excited me, but the batter was all wrong, no matter how long you cooked them the middle was eggy and wet. The orange juice was fake tasting and overly sweet. No peanut butter for the toast. Cereal was stale tasting. Front desk did not care. 5) It is not in the best area.

The buses (2 connections) took almost 2 hours whereas you can get to the hotel in about 40-50mins by metro. I had a Vermont Ave facing room on the 3rd floor. Road noise was apparent (but not deafening) and the aircon - same as for the San Diego Comfort Inn - is too noisy to leave on while you sleep; a consideration to bear in mind in staying in the heat of summer. The room and hotel in general is really quite old/dated but reasonably clean though more fussy people would be a bit disappointed.

The coffee can be variable from watery to normal. In the room there is an issue whenever someone next door or above you flushes the toilet or has a shower/hot-tub... you can basically hear the pipes/water... and loud!

I couldnt find one fault with the rooms which were a good size and had plenty of space for our 4 pieces of lugguage and my hoard of cosmetics. Theres ample parking, and the location is great! We were able to access all the hotspots of LA using this as a base with ease (disneyland, hollywood etc) we even managed an impromtu visit to Las Vegas and to San Diego. Also as we are both muslims we found local mosques and halal meat not a problem. Breakfast was great with cereal, juices, fruit, fresh dougnuts and pastries (which were replenished when empty and delicious) and we were able to come down at half nine and still get breakfast.

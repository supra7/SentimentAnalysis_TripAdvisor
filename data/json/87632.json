This provided much more value than I expected it to do (and I didn't have low expectations).

Situated just opposite Ralph Lauren and the RL Grill (which was great as well). Hotel itself : good mix between modern and classic. Standards and cleanliness was very good. Good roomy lounge area downstairs. Conference facilities : very good and the catering was excellent as well. Rooms : much larger than expected. Huge bathroom with window across the bedroom for a lakeview (room 803) which was very impressive and nice. The room itself was also very large, great bed, excellent work desk and had all the facilities you might need (excl coffee maker). Very nicely decorated, high standards and very clean. Fitness room : pretty big, well equipped and connected with the SPA (incl changing rooms). All in all it felt modern and a good place for a nice workout. Bar / Restaurant : NoMi lounge, bar and restaurant on the 7th floor. Interesting menu with good tasting food. Pretty well stocked wine list and good selection of international and local beers. Service was great and always with a smile (not the least from Stefan). Service : Excellent, not one bad experience. Everyone very curteous, friendly and professional. A well run team I think.

By doing this and observing the photos that other people took of the stay, by the 10th picture of this property, I was sold. You can tell by the sleek, chic room d\u00c3\u00a9cor how awesome these rooms are. I was inspired and booked my stay here, coupled by the fact that this hotel had dropped significantly in price at the time of my booking, making it the overall winner. When we pulled up in our cab, even the outside of this hotel is amazing, stunning, and impressive. It is ideally located and truly in the middle of everything. We noticed right away that NoMI is the affiliated restaurant there, which was a good sign for us. Once out of the cab, the doorman is microphoned and asks for your name. He \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd your name to the front desk so that they can pull up your reservation and that they are all ready for you. It is pretty awesome. The sweetest, most professional reception girl greeted us and processed our check in seamlessly. At our former hotel (the Conrad) we were stuck looking into another office building from our hotel room. Here, we were smart, and requested a view. She stated that it would be $30 more for a view, and we politely declined. This hotel is definitely a splurge purchase, and you really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay much more than what you already have paid. Interestingly enough, when we checked into our room, we had a stunning, gorgeous view of Chicago. (Thanks, check in girl!) In a previous review, I complained that the Conrad had no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WOW\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd factor, but was simple and suitable. THIS hotel is one big wow factor after another. The lobby is gorgeous, dark, stately, and sexy. It is just a place where you want to stay at as long as possible. When you go into your room, you are just struck by the trendy, cool, vibe that rises up and greets you. The rooms are immaculate and pristinely designed to satisfy even the most highbrow consumer. The blinds are all electronically controlled by the wall, along with your lights and just about everything else in your room. The office desk is this really modern, cool design and swings on over across into the room. I was immediately in love. The main stunner? The bathroom wall opens, so you can take a big, bubble bath, while sitting in your tub, enjoying the view of your room, or outside your window. It is a REALLY well designed room, and smartly aware of what a traveler wants for a comfortable stay. HUGE bonus points awarded for the bedding. This is why you pay more for a hotel room. Probably one of the best nights sleep I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. In fact, we loved the bedding so much, contacting the hotel about their complete list of bedding / mattress / mattress pad is still on my list of things to do. It is something that I would be interested in replicating for my own home. (Yep. It is THAT outstanding!!) Here is what makes this a 5 star property: Extras and details. I got to enjoy the most luxurious bath with complimentary bath salts, stocked in the rooms. It was truly a special experience and trust me, we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave. Additionally, the mini bar is well stocked with all sorts of treats, plus complimentary apples in your room for you to enjoy. We loved everything about the room. The one downside came into play when I ordered breakfast the next morning. I ordered a basic breakfast ($16 and not a bad price for this nice of a property) plus a side of fruit, a juice, and coffee. When I went to go pick it up, I had to wait about 15 minutes for the girl to get back with my change. I just was left there, standing, with no explanation. I paid in cash, instead of charging it to my room. Normally, this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t annoy me, but it is early, I am tired, no makeup on as people are trickling in to enjoy their $60 brunch, and I just wanted to pay and get out of there. Instead, I had to loiter around this fancy hallway endlessly for her to get back with my change. Apparently, she explained that they only rely on the bartender for change and since the bartender wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there on Sundays, she had to go downstairs to the reception area to hunt down change. Fine. I would have appreciated being told that, and I would have just charged it to my room to save both of us the trouble. Now 20 minutes later, I high tailed it back to my room, with the breakfast in hand. I open it only to find BLACK toast, totally burned. Really? Who would be so careless to package up burned toast at this nice of a hotel at these prices. My bill was $34 for 1 meal, 2 drinks, and my toast was burned? Fine. I then realized that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t process the order right. It was supposed to include a meat (not included in my takeout) and the toast was supposed to be included (which I was charged for.) SUPER annoying. My coffee had no cream or sugar, which we had to go back downstairs to get. In an ultra-classy, uber trendy hotel, I just would have expected things like this to go much more smoothly. I will say, the staff is super nice, accommodating and polite. It is just the breakfast on Sundays that can use some work. Reluctant to leave, our checkout was smooth and uneventful. The bellmen are all very prompt and professional; they have been well trained and work very hard for the hotel. We were really impressed. With the exception to the breakfast blunder, this has become my favorite place to stay in Chicago. I would describe this hotel as dark, modern, sleek, sophisticated, sexy, trendy, professional, upscale, desirable, and luxurious. If you can afford the splurge of spending to stay here, do it. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and will look forward to a return here sometime.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cOne of my favorite hotels in the world...PERIOD!\u201d", "Author": "JamesE339", "ReviewID": "UR123544388", "Content": "I speak often of customer service.

I have lived in Chicago my whole life, and you can guarantee I'll never step foot into this lazy excuse for a high-end lounge, in the heart of Chicago's Mag Mile, again.

Our American Express card had a special for this property so we decided to try it out. We have stayed at many hotels across the country and all types. This was the best by far than many others. They put us on the 17th floor with a gorgeous view of Michigan Avenue and the Lake. The room was a nice size with a window seat, Large desk/table, a Herman miller recliner chair with ottoman , a 42\" flat screen television and king size bed. The bed had a feather mattress on top of the mattress and the most soft pillows. I have never had a bed that felt like sleeping on clouds (and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels). I had the best sleep and woke without headaches. The cable/satellite tv service was a little weird at times, but not too bad. I can't forget the electric curtains and all the light and curtain switches by the bed. My husband couldn't get over that. Very nice. It was like they thought of everything The bathroom had a jacuzzi tub plus a separate shower and a separate makeup counter with stool. We had plenty of room when we both were getting ready to go out. The small tv in the bathroom was also a thrill for my husband. He could watch the game wherever he was in the room. My husband was offered free shoe shining which he was thrilled to take advantage of . We enjoyed breakfast daily (in NoMi) that came with our special and they were very accommodating. The pastries and breads were made in house so were very fresh, the eggs are organic and they offered fresh fruit every day. The coffee wasn't my favorite, a little bitter, but everybody likes different coffee. The prices for breakfast and drinks were all on the menu they gave us, so there was no surprises with the bill.Room Service brought our breakfast one morning and the gentleman who delivered it was very friendly and did NOT push a bill at us waiting for an extra tip as we have had at many hotels. We ate at NoMi one evening. It is in the higher price range of meals but is worth it once in awhile. They must have fixed the door situation listed on another review as we did not see anyone from the fitness center or able to view it from the restaurant. Most all the staff were wonderful ( you always get one pea in the pod that is not as good, which we had as our server at breakfast on the second morning, but that happens). They called us by name from the very beginning and were always willing to please. They would open doors, greet us when we left and welcomed us back when we returned. They accommodated us with an umbrella on a rainy day and held our bags while we waited for our ride and we sat in the library with fresh tea & lemonade (or coffee if in the morning). The hotel is in a great location. Perfect for shopping and was easy for our family to pick us up there. There has been so many businesses anymore that have forgotten what service to the customer is. This hotel has brought it back to the forefront. We will definitely returned to this hotel again.

If you approach her with a task, she will follow through. Room: Clean, well appointed and small. The room is tastefully furnished but a little tired. Still look a little fussy and busy with older pieces of furniture and finishings. The one bonus is the Eames chair in each room. This is a good thing - if only there was more space to enjoy it. Standard room is ideal for one, but tight for two. Bathroom is nice and large. Tub is enough for two large people to sit comfortably. The handheld shower is better than the wall mounted one. Housekeeping: inconsistent and challenging. It felt like the hotel was under-staffed with services slow and requiring reminding. Called for room to be made up and turned down each day and 3 out of 4 days and to call twice. As there is no housekeeping button on the phone, had to call the operator where some seem to know you while others don't and unsure if messages are relayed. However, one the rooms are cleaned or turned down, it is done very thoroughly. In short, good housekeeping, when they come. Nomi and bar: Bad service. For a five star hotel, it is always unfortunately to see a group of staff standing behind the counter and gabbing away. What's even more annoying is when the service is inattentive. Guess the staff discussions were more important! The deco of the restaurant and bar are good and luxe. Won't the money and time, if only the service could be improved upon.

After wanting to try this property for a long while, i took my family over new years. It advertises as a 5 star property, but it is not up to the level of the Four Seasons, Ritz or Peninsula Chicago. It is essentially a 4 star Hyatt with a very nice location at the Chicago Water Tower and Michigan Ave, and an art-museum, fancy lobby. The pool area is probably one of the best in the Chicago loop area, and the food is very food in both the restaurant and room service. Outside of the these two, very expensive options for eating, you need to leave the property for family style dining. The reason i cant give this property 5 stars is because of staff service. Outside of the bellhops and valet, who were excellent, this is essentially the hotel of \"no\". I found that most times i asked a question or made a reasonable, simple request, the staff responded \"no.\". Or \"no, the hotel doesn't allow that.\". My wife and I sadly coined this property the \"hotel of no\" during our stay. For example, the hotel brags about its Butler service for every room. Well, when you ask the butler for a toothbrush or extra soap or towels, the butler says \"no sir, you must call housekeeping for that.\". The hotel brags about it's available car service. But when you ask to use it, the driver works less hours than an out of work school teacher. It was really quite absurd. Even try asking for a second wake up call or, better, for room service to deliver food to the pool area. Every time, consistently, we were met with \"no\" and then an explanation why they couldn't do it. Try bringing a glass of wine from the bar to the pool.... When my wife did, a very stern manager promptly entered the pool area and, basically, said, \"no.\". The rooms, while modern at some point in time, need a major rehab. We had a large suite, and the L shaped couch was torn and worn. The hyatt bed needed replacement as it was almost worn out. The bathroom and the locker rooms for the spa and pool were very nice and well stocked. Towel quality was reasonably good and soft. Overall, this is a solid 4 star business traveler hotel, less the staffing issues who probably could use some retraining. But not for a family vacation. Too bad because the pool and exercise room os very nice.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cnot satisfied\u201d", "Author": "Minhtrung1811", "ReviewID": "UR105745829", "Content": "First of all, I am a Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond member and PHC offered no recognition or amenities or breakfast and certainly no upgrades.

If this had been the Sheraton Chicago Towers, the service would have been on point. But, Chicago has numerous 5 star options. The Peninsula, Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons, Trump, and even Omni are all comparable properties and consistently show strong customer service skills. I recommend this hotel for those that fit into their target demographic.

Very spacious at over 800 square feet. 2 bath rooms, 1 of which has separate bath/shower (shower is big enough for 3 and bath is big enough for 2). The master bath also has 2 sinks and is very spacious. There is a second restroom off the dining area. There is a huge TV (over 40+ inches), sound system w/ ipod input and DVD player. Everything is smart, clean, tasteful and comfortable. I took advantage of the free bikes. I enjoyed the bath (they have bath crystals to use as well). The soaps and amenities were fragrant and refreshing. The staff all provide the best service, with friendly faces and attitudes and very attentive. The breakfast is good but very overpriced if you actually have to pay for it. The portions are a bit small as well. The gym is nice and open 24/hrs. WiFI is free for all. The pool and jacuzzi are refreshing even after a hot humid day. The property is within walking distance of the metro (2 blocks), great shopping (around the corner), probably over 100 great places to eat from casual to fine dining.

The rooms were very large, and quite nice. We had room 1205, the view was so great! Pay for the view! We had one king bed, and a rollaway. Both of which were VERY comfortable. The room had a window seat, a comfortable Eames Mies Van Der Rohe reproduction chair, a glass desk with chair, a HUGE TV (with HD!!!) a dresser and the closet. The mini-bar was fairly well priced, and there's free water and apples. The closet was cool, also opened to the bathroom and had a safe and a robe (wish it was two) and two pairs of slippers. It also had a variety of hangers and a shoe buffer. The bathroom was amazing! Great toiletries, two sinks, a HUGE soaking tub (candles and bath salts included) separate shower, TV, and little room with the toilet. This was definitely the best room I have every stayed in. Service - 4.5 - The only reason I gave a 4.5 was because unfortunately, the turndown service was inconsistent. At check-in we were upgraded, because of Hyatt Diamond Status. We also got choice of amenity, which was almost anything. They even gave my teenage son milk and cookies, which he liked, because he can't exactly have wine. The doormen and bellmen were nice. Our bags were held there and it was very prompt. Also, something cool, when you walk in, they hit the elevator button from the desk so you don't have to wait.

We were able to confirm only a two twin bed room, but were advised to request two doubles at check-in. We arrived early around 9am, expecting to check our luggage. Despite being sold out on doubles, they checked for two rooms, both with doubles, and said we could check in soon. After about 15 minutes wait we decided to get breakfast nearby; when we returned we were told that we had an upgraded room ready. We went to the room, which overlooked the water tower on the 14th floor and had a great view of Lake Michigan down the street. Two double beds, a huge bathroom with two sinks, a separate toilet room, an oversized bathtub with a hand-held shower head, and a separate shower room with a rain-type wall mounted shower about 8' up and a separate hand-held. The door to the connecting corner room was open and it had a king bed. I couldn't believe that we had been given a two-room suite, so I called the front desk to check. I was put on hold but got no response so I called back after a few minutes. They first misinterpreted my question as a request for a second room, but when I explained that I was just checking to see if the doors had been left open by mistake they confirmed that I had reserved only one room. I locked the connecting doors myself. The room had bedside controls for the sheer and the blackout shades on the window and also for the lighting. Flat screen TV, i-pod dock, one robe (but two pairs of slippers) in the closet, two toothbrushes and toothpaste, iron, ironing board, shoeshine machine, hairdryer, safe, etc. Minibar, jars of nuts (3 kinds), bottles of imported sparking water, basket of apples. I assume that only the apples were complimentary though. (the sparking water bottles were moved to our nightstands with the turn-down service -- I guess they really wanted us to buy them.) Extremely comfortable beds with four pillows each, a modern leather lounge chair with ottoman, glass desk with chair, and a cushioned window seat were more than adequate. Complimentary internet access -- wired and wireless, although the latter worked for my son, it didn't for me, There was an ethernet cable in a fabric pouch marked \"internet cable\" in one of the drawers. We checked out around 7am and left our luggage in the hotel. I asked if we could use the pool and locker room in the afternoon and they said sure, no problem. We didn't need to keep our keys because there was open access. We returned around 4:30 pm and went to the pool. Locker room had full-sized lockers stocked with robes and slippers; towels were piles on a rack. Keys were in the unused lockers. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, shaving cream, razors, etc. all available. Two shower rooms, one equipped for handicapped. Large steam room. Three or four lane lap pool, with a small outside deck shared with the bar but separated by shrubbery in planters. Small 4 person hot tub was relaxing end to a long day. We went to the airport and arrived home late, tired and relaxed. Our one night stay felt like a full two or three day trip. I didn't rate value because our room was complimentary. We really appreciated not being treated like second class citizens in any way -- the service was first rate from everyone we encountered. My only two admittedly minor suggestions would be to replace the towels with more fluffy ones -- the ones we had were somewhat thin -- and to add a mirror in the bedroom -- the only mirrors were in the bathroom.

Room~ our room offers a marvellous view of the Landmark - The Water Tower stands right in front of our room window on the 17th floor. The room is spacious, with a daybed across the large window. The desk/table is kind of small for a business hotel. The management should replace the old TV with a flatscreen LCD one. The lighting is not under one central panel, we ahve to walk around to turn them off. Some of the features in the room is not very functional. All the towels sit on a dressing table style table with a stool, but one would expect a mirror there for make-up, but it is a picture. In the room we always hear series of siren through the evening and nite. For we were out during day time. It's loud and clear siren, we later suspect there is a firehouse or ambulance depot down the block. That's pretty annoying to those who demand complete quietness. We lived with that. The room is clean. The shoes placed out for shine were untouched. We had to call housekeeping, surprisingly, we were asked to check on it 30 mins later if they are still there, we have call to remind housekeeping. How can a ParkHyatt staff ask the assistance of houseguests to help with their job. If it is in Peninsula, the shoes would be taken away within minutes. The doormen and bell service are friendly and helpful despite of the chilly cold winter weather they have to face during such a long shift. The concierge and front desk staff did not made me feel welcomed. However, I appreciate the friendly and expeditious follow-up on the bill after we checkout.

I've stayed in them all many times. I can't say a negative thing about any one of them. They all are 5 star and it's a matter on personal taste. I first stayed at the Park Hyatt over 10 years ago when it first open in its new incarnation. We stayed in the Pritzker Suite (since renamed) and were overwhelmed. We're appreciate art and organic objects. We tend to like mid-century modern decor. The Pritzker Suite was jaw dropping. For us it was the best Presidential type suite we had stayed in or even seen a picture of. I knew I had been spoilt and resisted booking the Park Hyatt because I would be disappointed knowing the heavenly suite was perched on the 17th floor. The 4 Seasons & Ritz (by 4 Seasons) are great properties but after the Peninsula opened it become my home once a month for several years. After the economic downturn I became more sensitive to room rates and went back to Park Hyatt. Well I can report that it's a 5 star product, the equal of it's next door neighbor and at a much sweeter value. The lack none of the high end amenities of a great hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Cristophe alway greets me warmly by name and when I tell the bell men I don't need a car, that I'm taking the train a half block away to the airport I get a big thumbs up for being so smart. I've stayed in all the smaller suites and the standard rooms. All are great for a one or two day business trip. I think the 02, 03, 04 rooms all offer a great view of the Water Tower and on the higher floors an unobstructed view of Lake Michigan.

So I called my travel agent during the drive to the city and we had a room booked in no time. About 20 minutes after I got off the phone with my travel agent (yes, I had a handsfree unit on) I pulled up to the hotel. The chic and contemporary interior isn't really my style but it's exactly what I expected. What wasn't expected was the high level of customer service. As I walked up to the front desk, I mentioned to the lady checking me in that I had just made the reservation. She responded by saying, \"Mr. X, we've been expecting you\" (real names have been replaced to protect the innocent). The staff member was very courteous and quite helpful. The room was nice and very comfortable however not in the style of my preference (too contemporary for me). The soaking tub is GREAT. Other than the choice of decor, I really enjoyed the room. I just wish it were brighter and had more natural light. The best part of my stay were my encounters with security and the door men. They are so nice! I was only there for 2 nights and yet they knew my name! I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for a week and no one there bothered to remember my name! And it wasn't just that they remembered my name... while staying in the hotel, I would wake up early and head back to my folks' house in the suburbs. Now remember, I only stayed at the Park Hyatt for 2 nights. The first morning I left for my parents I had brought the complimentary newspaper left on my door and a cup of coffee down with me for the drive. The next morning i was a bit disappointed that there was no paper on my door but I chalked it up to me being up so early. So I went down to grab the car and head out to my parents. While I was waiting for my car to be pulled around, one of the doormen offered me a cup of coffee and to my surprise, the aforementioned missing paper was on the passenger seat of my car.

I booked a Park View room with the AAA discount which includes breakfast. There are plenty of workers to help you as you pull up and get your luggage. They ask your name and escort you to the front desk where they tell that worker who you are. I was thinking that we might want to upgrade to a suite since I wasn't too happy about sleeping in double beds so I inquired at the front desk if one was available. I would have booked this earlier but how many people could occupy each suite was very unclear on the website and I even called to ask but that person was not any more helpful about whether we could all fit (or if rollaways are allowed). I was told that no suites were available at the front desk but was given a complimentary second room that connected to the other room! The only little problem with this arrangement was that we had no view. But having two king size beds and two bathrooms was great! As mentioned by other reviewers, the rooms are very nice. My husband LOVED the chair in the room it was so comfortable! The baths were big enough for two so my crazy two daughters put on their swim suits and had fun with the bubble bath that was kindly given to us along with an American Girl doll bed when a worker saw my younger daughter carrying an AG doll in the lobby! Other perks were complimentary movies (although they are quite old) and free apples and water. However, there were a bunch of other munchies near the water with no note to suggest whether these were also complimentary or not. I think anything that has a cost should be listed on a sheet. Anyway, I found out that all those snacks are not free. The housekeeper ended up putting the waters next to the bed during turndown but I would have preferred some chocolates. Oh well! Another problem is the firehouse station being so close. Yes, I don't enjoy hearing loud sirens at all hours of the night, and I am a sound sleeper. However, the hotel is located near all the best shopping so can't complain about that at all. The AG place is right across the street. The other perks of the hotel such as the butler service and use of a car are mentioned in their website but not freely offered once you arrive at the hotel. Maybe the info is burried away in some book in a desk but I think the front desk should inform guests directly of these perks. Another slight annoyance is that it is unclear how breakfast is included in your rate. What I mean is that we were supposed to have breakfast as part of our package but we didnt receive any vouchers or info on how to make sure you aren't charged for the food. In such a nice place, it feels awkward to have to ask when you receive your bill for the full amount. However I did ask and was told it would be deducted later. It hasn't shown up on our bill yet but I would think at least our tip would...I would prefer that the front desk would explain when you check in how the package works so you don't have to feel foolish asking. And I did call down to the front desk right before going to eat and was told I would just have to give them my room number. That wasn't quite how it worked. Lastly, the pool bottom looks very dirty. My two daughters decided they would rather not swim in it. They provide free water in your car as we discovered after leaving in our cup holders with a note to drive safely. That was nice!

I had a room with a huge bathroom that was separated by a partition from the bedroom. If you saw my review of the W Lakeshore, you'll know how a design like this can go terribly wrong, but at the Park Hyatt, everything is perfectly and tastefully executed. I loved soaking in that huge tub (loved the touch of the bath salts and the candles) and almost wept at the thought that I had to leave to go back to my bathroom at home (which, while nice, doesn't have the view or the huge tub). The food at the hotel's restaurant, NoMI is not out of this world spectacular but the breakfasts are wonderful (especially if they are included in your room package). The view through the restaurant's huge windows are enough to make you glad to have woken up at 7a.m. and the house-made granola made me come back for more. I also loved the touch of the sea salt and pepper varieties (3 each) provided on the table -- my companions, spice lovers all, could not get enough of the lava salt. I must also say that the pool area is lovely (as an early morning swimmer, I appreciated the large workout area and the three lap lanes, complete with flippers and kick boards). The hotel is certainly on the pricey side but compared to other hotels and what they are charging the price is at least understandable (you feel that you are getting quite a bang for your buck).

The room features a pillow top mattress, (pretty standard at most of the nicer establishments) flat screen TV with DVD player (DVD movies are complimentary and available at front desk) and the most comfortable leather lounge chair I've used in a hotel. The lighting is mostly recessed, good for creating a relaxed or romantic atmosphere.

I'd been planning this special get-away for nearly a year to coincide with the Taste of Chicago and the Pre-Independence Day fireworks display sponsored by Macy's on July 3rd. When I requested a room (months earlier) that would overlook the lake -- maybe to see the fireworks -- I was very courteously and promptly told that we wouldn't be able to see the show from the hotel, but given an alternate location that would offer a great view (which it did). We were still given a great room on a high floor with an incredible view of the water tower and lake.

When we needed assistance, all we had to do was ask, whether it was for extra blankets, a phonebook or directions to Lou Malnati's. When I was checking our folio on the evening before we were to leave, I noticed that we'd been charged for raiding the mini-bar; all it took was a call to the front desk and telling the staff person it wasn't us -- parking at $44/day taxed us, the mini-bar would have just been over-the-top for my middle-class family.

There may have been more square feet than the actual room/bathroom...which was 550 sq ft. AND THE VIEW! You looked out right onto the historic water tower and Michigan Avenue. Since you are on the 3rd floor, you don't get much of a lake view, but with everything else there is to look at, it is not missed. Now, back to the room.....actually, the bathroom. in the hallway leading to the bathroom, there is a small bar and the closet. The closet isn't large, but has an ironing board, iron, hair dryer, safe, various hangars, and shoe polisher. Then the bathroom! When you walk in, you see a glass shower door...through that door is the shower and bathtub....all in one room, with a window looking out onto the terrace and the Water Tower. The tub is huge, probably big enough for 2, and the shower has 2 heads....one stationary, and one hand held. They don't work at the same time, but the water pressure is great. Then back into the bathroom there is a large vanity with double sinks...and a small wall mounted TV with a remote control. Next to that, there is a small vanity with a bench for putting on make up and such. And the toilet is in a seprarate water closet. There is also a closet door that opens into the other side of the closet in the hallway, which is very convenient. The room decor is simple. Black and white photos, and taupe carpet. The bedding is all white, and the furniture is contemporary medium stained wood. Besides lamps, there is recessed lighting over the bed, in the hallways, and in the bathroom. Service for the room was provided twice a day. Our cost for the room with the AAA discount was $400 a night, which included breakfast for 2 both mornings at NoMI, the hotel restaurant....more about that in the restaurant section. As many have noted before, the location couldn't be better. Since we are familiar with Chicago, we use public transportation, but cabs are readily available all around. We can't stay here everytime we stay in Chicago due to the cost, but we'd sure like to. We're definitely planning on staying here again for a special occasion.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel, in a great location, in a great city\u201d", "Author": "LyleK", "ReviewID": "UR6510961", "Content": "The Park Hyatt should be at the top of everyone's list.

The desk clerk escorted us to the elevators when we checked in. The doorman and concierge had plenty of suggestions for dining. When we stopped by the restaurant (NoMI) in the morning to get some coffee to go, we were told they didn't have disposible cups, but the greeter called down to the desk to make sure they were still serving complementary coffee, even though it was later in the day. On the way to the pool (located in the spa) we were welcomed numerous times and my teenage son even commented on the hospitality. And the spa locker facilities are very nice. And no extra charge for pool and gym. The rooms were very great and the view spectacular. See my photo showing the Water Tower, Michigan Ave, Contemporary Art Museum, and Lake Michigan.

Here is my impression: Check in: Fairly quick and friendly. The agent walked us to the elevator and explained the amenties of the hotel. Room: Great. Very upscale: wonderful bed, down duvet and featherbed. The bathrooms were excellent with separate tub shower and water closet. Also, a small television was positioned above the vanity - a very nice touch. Staff: As was previously mentioned, the front desk staff were good, the doormen helpful. The housekeeping staff assigned to our room were unpolished. A housekeeper actually opened our door to ask us how much longer we would be and if we would be checking out that day. I had checked with the front desk and verified that we at least 45 minutes prior to the check out time. I would have put the do not disturb on the door, except after we slept in the first day, the sign miraculously dissapeared! Also, the concierge was impossible to reach via telephone. My husband and I tried phoning on several occasions and received voicemail! I'd expect that at a Hilton, but not Park Hyatt. Food: With so many great locations near the hotel, we only had to have breakfast in the hotel. The food was your typical hotel breakfast - nothing more, but certainly not worth the $22 I paid for my bacon and egg entree. I realize that city prices are expensive, but having stayed at numerous Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons properties, I have come to expect more for the money. Do yourself a favor, skip breakfast and go to the Hershey store located just outside the front door and get a great hot chocolate and wait until lunch! Location: The hotel is in a great location and shares the same streets as the Penisula and Ritz Carlton. Several reviewers wrote about the sirens around the hotel. Certainly, it is noisy, but the people paying $700 a night at the Penisula hear it too. The hotel is near the Water Tower Shopping Center and Neiman Marcus. After your hot chocolate, grab a cab and head to the Chicago Chop House for a great steak lunch.

My daughter made the reservation, obtaining a very attractive rate available to her employer, a big-4 accounting firm. My travel budget wouldn't have afforded my staying here, otherwise. The young lady at reception, noting that it was my first stay there and after determining that I didn't need assistance with my small overnight bag, personally walked me to the elevator lobby -- a nice expression of hospitality. The room was impressively large and very well appointed, even having an Eames lounge chair and ottoman for relaxation in front of the expansive windows (which included small windows on either side of a large picture window that were openable, allowing fresh air if desired). There was also a long window seat with a comfortable cushion and ample throw pillows for relaxing and enjoying the view from my location on the 17th floor, looking west. The bed was very comfortable, with a duvet, using high quality linens. The bathroom was particularly impressive with a large soaking tub that was easily big enough for two. They even provided large candles for a romantic bathing experience and have large, sliding wooden doors adjacent to the tub that open the view to the bedroom area and the city lights view out the windows. The separate shower are, enclosed in floor-to-ceiling thick glass panels, had both a tall shower head and a separate, adjustable head that could be removed from its holder for hand operation. Much marble, attractive wood, mirrors, glass and excellent lighting. In fact, lighting throughout the room and bathroom was remarkable for the variety of options available for creating different kinds of lighting combinations. The TV/entertainment area included a DVD player. A nice touch was, in addition to the high-end glossy magazines typically found in hotels at this quality level, there were several books including one that had fascinating information and photographs on Chicago architecture. Another interesting detail was a large bowl of potpourrie on the chest of drawers. I found the fragrance pleasant but a bit strong. Of course, you can hide that in a drawer if it offends. A few details were missed, though. Some of the chrome fixtures in the bathroom could stand polishing more frequently to avoid dust or corrosion. Also, the sliding doors between the bathroom and bed area were apparently somewhat off track, not allowing them to come together properly to completely close off view between the two areas. All-in-all, I thought the Chicago Park Hyatt was a top-end hotel with its guests receiving a very good experience. At their regular rates, you get good value for the money.

I must admit that when I booked this hotel, my expectations were high- at the price, I was expecting the works- and we got it! Our arrival was seamless- got early check-in and an instant upgrade with no effort. The room was absolutely a dream. We are extremely observant travelers (only stay at the top rated hotels, after checking and double checking ratings on multiple sites, including this trip advisor site, and of course, only 4-5 star). In our room, was fresh fruit and soft music playing. The room was absolutely beautiful, the bed was a soft, and sweet sleep (white down comforter with duvett- I stopped staying at hotels with \"bedspreads\" years ago- they are so gross). The marble bathroom, tv at the vanity/sink, double head shower and walk in shower/bath were absoultely beautiful. There is a flat screen tv, dvd with complimentary movies, vcr, stereo, 2 cordless phones, and free wireless internet- do I need to go on? The location is ideal- the Watertower is across the street, as well as the Ralph Lauren store, the American Girl Store, and all of the shops and food of Michigan Ave. This is not even the half of what this great hotel has- we went down for a drink at the NoMi lounge- the service/drinks/food were outstanding. As we wandered back to the room, we came across the spa/gym- unbelievable (I'm getting a massage in the am after my run). There was a tv on every treadmill and step machine, there was complimentary bottled water and glass pitchers of raspberry (fresh) ice water (at 10;30 at night), cold towels, steam room, lap pool. Hands down the best hotel in Chicago (we've stayed in nearly all of them- family nearby and usually come here at least once every 2 months). We will never stay at another hotel. I am sad that we have to check out tomorrow. Splurge and try it- I promise, you'll agree....

Oh, pardon my oversight, the hotel entrance had a sparse attempt at conveying some semblance of Christmas/Holiday spirit. The Pritzkers should be ashamed. The property located in the block immediately to the south was resplendent in good cheer and glad tidings. Next visit! The P.H. room was certainly adequate albeit nothing extraordinary. The carpets will need to be replaced soon as there was a tear in our room. The furnitue had the look of nicks and dents that happens with age. And, don't believe everything seen on the hotel's web site. What doors from the tub/bathroom to the bedroom area?

I had to call housekeeping up to clean the door to the toilet closet, and I don't like toilet closets. They are okay when I go to Europe, I expect that, but don't like them personally.

Our room had a nice view b/c they gave us an upgraded room on accident but it was a connecting room which we specifically asked on check-in to not have. Once they realized, they called up and asked if we wanted to move but we were settled at that point. The shelf in our room was falling off the wall but otherwise the room was in good condition. My biggest complaint is that I (who have blond hair) found a few long black hairs in my brush after housekeeping had been in our room-GROSS! We've stayed at the Four Seasons up the street and would recommend them over the Hyatt. We have also stayed at the regular Hyatt across the river after getting a room through a bid site and that was worth the $39/night but not their standard rates. The place was a zoo but the staff was great. They ended up putting us in a Club level room b/c there were no other rooms when we checked in and while the room was nice, I shudder to think of the cost vs benefit of that room.

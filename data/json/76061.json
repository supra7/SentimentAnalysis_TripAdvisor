The value for money at this hotel is excellent, it is basically only 2 kms or so from where you need to go shopping and restaurant wise. It has cabs out front and its own limo service. Its located quite close to santa monica which is worth a Days look, great place. Davanie womack the concierge is excellent, she organised numerous limo rides, made calls and booked me lakers tickets. The hotel itself has all the basics and comfy king size beds. Dont expect amazing quality finishes in the rooms but if youre like me you wont care as the bed and other facilites are all there.

We made the decision to wait as weren't in too much hurry, so went to the local Beverly Hills Plaza shopping centre, when we returned after 1.5hrs the room was ready and we were also upgraded to the top floor and given complimentary breakfast every morning, we didn't expect that but were thoroughly delighted. Room was reasonably quiet, no noise from street as we were facing back of hotel, some noise from guests as we were in an adjoining room but person next door was very considerate so hardly heard him, occasional noise from hallway at night with slamming doors and people not realising they were being a bit loud. Overall a really good stay. I can't say enough about the staff, the lady who checked us in, Chanelle (I think was her name) was gorgeous and so cheerful, the doormen were chirpy with a lovely sense of humour and you really felt recognised and welcomed as part of the family each time you returned from another adventure, the conceirge Daryl was thoroughly excellent and couldn't do enough for us, what an asset to the hotel, we gave him a bottle of wine upon our departure to say thanks as he was such a nice person to deal with. We were there for 4 nights and given the chance again we will definitely be back, although the rooms were nice it's the staff that made this place and they are exceptional. Location was okay, area very safe to walk around, approx 10-20min walk up South Beverly drive to get to local restaurants, we frequented the Cheesecake Factory several times throughout our stay for dinner, they were exceptional and only 15-20mins walk straight up road on same side. As LA is very spread out we had to take cabs or buses to the likes of Century city, Santa Monica Blvd and Hollywood but bus stop right outside hotel and cabs rank also right outside hotel and weren't expensive, Rodeo Drive approx 25mins walk from hotel or 7mins in cab. Staff at hotel very knowledgeable on how to get to places the right way without spending a fortune.

Location wasn't too bad, about a 15 min walk to rodeo drive, reception gave me a very basic map (only just had major roads) of how to get there, very easy, and there was a bus stop right out the front of the hotel. my last day there i ended up going on a horseback ride up towards to hollywood sign, which took much longer then i'd planned, so i called the hotel to tell them i would be late back to check out and was expecting to be charged extra because of this, but was told not to rush, and that they would see me when i got back, which definately took the stress off. bed was very comfy, and room quite spacious compared to other hotels i stayed at for the rest of my 6 week holiday, would definately stay there again.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAverage on all levels.\u201d", "Author": "PandSMadison", "ReviewID": "UR123474898", "Content": "Really not a great location ... you could do much better.

The first problem we encountered was the concierge. We waited for approx 30 minutes to speak to her and then we were told 10 minutes into the conversation that she would need to speak to the next person and we could come back later (at this time it was 7pm) or come the next day. We ended up booking our own activities over the internet because every time we went down to speak to her there was a line up to speak to the concierge. The next problem we encountered was the unhelpful office staff. One of the members of the group asked if they could post a postcard back to Australia. They responded, quiet rudely, that no they couldn't. Only after she asked were she could find a stamp and a post office did they give a response. They told her to go to the office depot around the corner to get a stamp. We went there and they only sold stamps in packs of 100. We ended up asking the helpful bellboys and they pointed us in the direction of the service station, who were extremely helpful and gave us directions to the post office. We also wanted to go out for dinner to the cheesecake factory. The male concierge booked us into the restaurant which was good and then offered us a limo for $50. Lucky we decided to catch 2 taxis which came to a total of $6.00 per taxi each way. The other major problem we had was there was no safe in the room. The hotel offered safe deposit boxes to use and be stored in the front office. The deposit boxes were only big enough of items the size of passports. In this day and age majority of people would travel with items like laptops, ipads, ipod, etc - like we did. The office staff offered to store these items in the back office - but as the hotel states 'they take no responsibility for lost or stolen items so why would I leave it in an office.' This was the only hotel out of the 5 we stayed in in the US that didn't have inroom safes. This is something that should be fixed. On a good note the bell boys were extremely helpful - when our van didn't turn up they organised another mode of transport for us.

The aircon is not a split system and hence every 30mins your sleep is interrupted by the 'cummins deisel' compressor as it kicks in to cool the room. I know for a fact that there were 68 people staying along with us as I heard everyone of them flush the toilet and have showers from 3am onwards. The plumbing is not a high point. No microwave and a 'kettle' that only does one cup at a time makes picking up some light meals (to keep meal costs down) at the local 7/11, impossible.

They sent someone to clean up the mess with a towel, and we had argue that they disinfect the floor. I found the staff to be quite rude in general.

To top it all off, on the last night there was an extremely loud Jewish band playing somewhere in the hotel. I'm not one to complain about a bit of noise, but this was beyond ridiculous. When we complained to the front desk they didn't really seem to care at all and did nothing about the noise. For some reason this hotel was full of Aussies like us.

Needed to find a store who stocked my item. This was not easy. Davanie went out of her way by assisting me with not only finding names of stores, but calling the stores to see if they had what I wanted. Not a service you would expect from a hotel. She was fantastic. After going to these stores, I could not purchase the item as they were made out of wood and I could not take wood products back into Australia. Went to one of the stores at a shopping centre she had sent us to who could help me with my product, but it would have to be mailed to the hotel as they never had them in their stores. Only by internet. They said they would have it there before we left in 5 days. Well, it did not appear in the five days and when calling the company concerned, they advised me it was with their courier company and would be delivered the following day. Too late. Approached Davanie to thank her for all her troubles and asked her if she would like the product as it was not arriving until we had left the country. She then said that she understood how much this product meant to me and that when it arrived she would post it to me. I said it was not a small parcel and she said I will post it to you via sea mail. I then gave her my contact details. This was another service received by the Crowne Plaza hotel in Beverly Hills that is way beyond what one expects.

After arriving in the evening off a long journey from Edinburgh we found ourselves on the top floor (12th) and could not have been happier. The room and bed were large aswell as the huge tv! we noticed our toilet did not flush properly but after calling reception an engineer was sent up straight away (even at around 11pm) and this was fixed so we could relax knowing we didn't need to change rooms. We decided to use the bus instead of hiring a car, this was so easy as the number rapid 7 stops just round from the hotel and is $1 to get to Santa Monica beach where you can see all the sights and walk along to Venice.Also stopping right at the front of the hotel is the number 14 bus and for $1.50 we went got off at Beverly/Vermont,as it is right at the subway entrance. This is the best way to get up to Hollywood and also Universal Studios and for $6 you can get a metro underground day pass that also can be used on all the metro buses for that entire day. all of the buses and undergrounds stops are clearly visible and announced each time. We also found the bus drivers extremely helpful.The undergrounds have armed security that get on/off so be aware to keep your ticket handy as they check but its nice to make you feel safe.Hollywood was great for sight seeing and things to do,my advice is when you are approached about tours to see sights walk along the blvd waiting until you get the best deal as we ended up on a great tour for more than half the price of the rest just because we bargained a bit with ticket seller.The hotel was about 10 mins walk from rodeo drive where you could spend a fortune in 1 shop if you are that way inclined however the 14 bus stops at the Beverly center and the 7 stops at the Westside Pavillion both were great and much more our price range. The staff in the hotel were all friendly, however Dennis at reception was just brilliant, always happy to help and great at telling me how good universal studios was going to be. They have good hand drawn maps of the area and also keep your valuables in a safety deposit box which you have access to 24 hours.The concierge was always busy so we mainly had our own ideas about where to go. Housekeeping did a great job everyday and always had fresh towels in our room. The best place we ate was Saddle Ranch steak house on the sunset strip, great fun with a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant and huge candy floss desserts(given to us for free as it was my birthday). Nearer to the hotel I highly recommend Factors. Just round the corner and across the road it was our favorite place for breakfast, very clean and very homely. The hotel breakfast was also nice and for $16 you can have all you can eat.There is free wifi in the hotel which came in handy when we were planning our days or checking places to eat etc. We drank in the hotel bar a few times but it is very expensive so a better idea is to go to Ralphs supermarket just up from Factors and use the fridge in the room.The only disappointment we had was when we left. A shuttle bus had been booked for us by one of the bellman and ended up being late to collect us. When we finally got to LAX we had 20mins left to check in for our flight to London. This meant we were separated on the 10 hour trip back,luckily the stewardess resolved this on the plane but was an issue that should not have happened as we normally give ourselves plenty of time before flights. I would recommend anyone to stay at the Crowne Plaza and not to be put of by people saying you cant get around or the location is poor.

We have a pleasant stay. Please do not compare this hotel with other 4/5 stars hotel. This is a 3.5 stars hotel. We received very friendly check in services (Thanks Dennis !!) and we were put on the Club floor (top floor) and have breakfast included. Our plane arrived at LAX at 7am and we requested early check in beforehand (subject to availability) and we got the room early which was great as the last thing we want to do is to wait for 3pm check in after a 14 hours plane trip. The bedroom is reasonable size and our king bed was comfortable. We requested a rollaway bed for our child which is not as comfortable but it does its job. The hotel and hotel room has old decor and probably need some updates. The bathroom is quite small and require some renovations. The room comes with free Wi Fi access and a nice LCD TV. Breakfast was nice and Lucy from the breakfast room was very friendly and welcoming. We did not attempt to talk to the concierge which everyone rave about coz her desk is always occupied with guests and she talks so loudly that we can hear all the conversations. On the last day, our flight does not depart until 10pm, so we requested late check out and we pay $50 to stay till 6pm which was very reasonable. The hotel also have a small business room with 2 computers. There is also a printer so we used it to purchase theme park tickets on line which is very handy. The hotel is right opposite the Residence Inn and that's where Hertz car rental is. If you plan to pick up a car from Hertz , this is probably a good hotel to stay at so you can just walk across the road to pick up and drop off your car. The location of the hotel is ok although you will need a car if you plan to travel around LA. There is a bus near the hotel that takes you to Santa Monica though. We parked at the carpark and it cost us $15 per day (as we are priority club member) and we think that's reasonable. There is a Ralph supermarket within walking distance (5 mins) and it has everything you need. Above Ralph, there is the CVS pharamacy. If you walk down to West Pico Blvd from the hotel, there are quite a few restaurants to choose from (pizza, Chinese, Mexican etc). I believe the hotel is in a good central location. It takes approximately 10 mins to drive to Westfield Century plaza, 25-40mins to Hollywood (depending on the traffic), 20 mins to Beverly hills shopping centre, 45mins to an hour to the Citadel outlet mall.

In the exactly how far is Rodeo Drive debate, I made it a good 15 to 20 minutes to Rodeo Drive Proper , although it is a very pleasant walk it can get a bit hot. The bus service to Santa Monica works very well only $1 per person on the Big Blue bus and about a half an hour ride. There are also good bus connections to the Grove and Farmers Market with the 14 bus and the 217 to Hollywood. Be warned the service interval on the 14 occassionally gets a bit long. We arranged a private car transfer to Universal Studios through Tatiana on the concierge desk, which worked out very well. I agree that eating in the immediate vicinity of the hotel is a bit limited and you have to walk up towards Beverly, which with tired children in the evening does get a bit far.

The location at the south end of Beverly Drive, just before Pico Blvd., may be out of walking distance to the main shopping and dining for some, but everything is just up the street. If you're driving into Los Angeles, ingore the conventional directions, and take the I-10 (Santa Monica Freeway) and exit at Overland, then east on Pico to the Hotel. From the I-5 (San Diego Freeway) exit at Santa Monica Blvd, then south to reach Pico. (I was born and raised in West LA) This is not the hotel for those who are looking for the luxury of a Ritz Carlton or similar. Having said this, If you spend any time in your room when traveling, you won't go wrong with a suite here, for the price of a single room elsewhere. The dining room is adequate, as is the bar and lobby. For seeing celebrities hang out at the bar of the Four Seasons. The staff is fantastic, from those who take your car, to the front desk staff and housekeeping. Two years ago Easter Sunday, my father and my father-in-law died within 2 hours of each other, mine in LA the other in Las Vegas. The hotel went out of there way to accomodate all our needs as we traveled back and forth between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for a month. TIP get a Priority Club membership. Even if you are not staying on the club floor, you'll be given a key to access the Club room and great free breakfast and free computer / internet access.

The room was furnished with a king bed, two night tables, a clock radio, large LG brand flat screen, desk, chair, lounge chair, microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. The bathroom was small but sufficient with a blow dryer and some common toiletries and plenty of towels. The room was very clean as was the bathroom.

Hotel is in dire need of a make-over and the price is way too high for what you get. Staff put on a good smile, but then just avoid your issues. Such as my sunglasses... I was told they were \"attempting\" to contact housekeeping but no one was answering. What elegant hotel doesn't have constant contact with their staff??? Free internet did not work most of the time. We gave up and used our air-card. Parking was $22 per day and there is no indoor entry from the garage to the hotel. And, of course, it was raining most of the days of our stay...

Not a perfect stay, but far from horrible. I traveled here for a conference at UCLA and the value was good for a 3-star or better property (one of the cheapest rack rates in the area - plus I got an even better deal via Priceline). The property is in the southern end of Beverly Hills, but I still like the location. As a 30-something, I don't mind having to walk 15-20 minutes to visit Rodeo Drive (which is one mile north) or 5 minutes to some shopping and restaurants. There are plenty of eating options around the property, including the hotel restaurant which is pretty good (a little pricey, sure, but aren't all hotels?). You can walk one block south to Pico Blvd to find eating options or head north on Beverly Drive (about a 1/2 mile) and find even more of a selection. I recommend the 200 block of South Beverly Drive (Urth Cafe and Frida Mexican Restaurant in particular). Lots of other options, especially on Beverly that I wanted to try. As for the property itself, some parts of the hotel are a bit run down (the walls and bathtubs for instance) but much of the rooms are updated and the lobby and bar area are nice. Room on 7th floor has new carpet, new beds, new chairs, and a 42 inch HDTV. The towels are low quality and a few things required a call down to guest services (the hairdryer was missing the on/off button, one key card did not work, and a light bulb was burned out) but someone was sent up within 10-15 minutes each time to remedy the problem. As many have stated, internet access is free but the wireless signal in the room is very weak (I tried to connect once and it was too slow to work) but the wired ethernet connection (cable provided) is very fast. Given that the cord can be extended to the bed, I simply used the free wired connection in the room and it worked great. DId not try to use wireless in the lobby area, but since it is likely closer to the hub there, it may work well as others have suggested. The biggest disappointment was probably the television. You have this 42 inch LG HDTV with a satellite dish but most channels either do not work or are fuzzy. You are supposed to get 30-40 channels but in my room only about a half dozen are perfectly clear (some local HD channels, a few ESPN channels, and TNT). The rest either get no signal at all (CBS, HGTV, Discovery) or a fuzzy picture (most of them). Seems like this could be an easy fix, but I don't know. All in all, this property is far from perfect but our stay has not been overly painful by any means. A few adjustments (stronger wireless signals, better TV pictures, and better quality towels) could make a huge difference and would bump my rating from 3/5 to 4/5 easily.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "tookjohk", "ReviewID": "UR53588415", "Content": "Just before our family of 6 (4 Adults, 2 Children) departed for US I read reviews on trip advisor regarding the Crown Plaza B/Hills, I was disappointed and very worried about our choice of hotel.

However, the room did seem quite small and cramped for two people. The pool area was quite nice with chaise lounges and patio tables. We had planned to spend 6 nights at the hotel. However, on the 2nd night the room next to ours was occupied. We were awakend by our neighbor who arrived at his room at approximately 1:30 AM. He was not particulary noisy. however, we could heard everything through the walls. He made a telephone call which lasted for about an hour and we could hear nearly every word that he said. The next morning the front desk clerk, Tina, was extremely helpful and offered to move us to a different room on a \"quiet\" floor. I asked if the sound proofing on that floor was any better but I did not get any assurance that it would be. We made the decision to check out on the 3rd day and move to another hotel.

The beds are pillow top and come with two different types of pillows (foam and down) so you can pick your comfort. One upside is that WiFi is free, but it's a bit on the wonky side. It constantly cycles as you use it, so uploading is problematic (we were trying to upload travel vlogs - couldn't do it). The location is good, easy to get anywhere and with a Coffee Bean around the corner. The valet was quick and friendly. The big problem with the room is that the temperature sensor is right near the register, so it kicks off not long after the a/c turns on.

I was shown their car list for overnight parked cars and guess what, my car was indeed on the list. How can that happen? Well, it doesn't matter because neither the reception manager nor the parking manager believed my statement. The parking manager even went to the Hertz rental across the street to inquire when I had given back my car. He came back saying that I had given it back just the night before. WHAT?? I was furious. So I went to Hertz myself, got the express return slip stating the return date and return time and showed it to the reception and parking manager as proof of my words. Embarrassed silence. Unfortunately their apologies were rather meager. The receptionist still wanted to bill me with 2 nights of parking. I had to remind her that it was only 1 night.

While doing some work, I noticed a random, previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall. It was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall, after crushing it...good times. The room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet, with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought...a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway, without turning sideways - not an issue for me, but keep it in mind if it applies to you.

Due to some accommodation problems in New York I had to leave a few days earlier than I anticipated. I contacted the Crown Plaza Hotel and arranged two nights accommodation for the 16th & 17th September so that I had somewhere to stay once I arrived in Los Angeles. It also gave me time to try and organize for the five nights that I booked to be moved forward, subject to availability. From the moment I arrived at the hotel I was impressed with the level of service. I arrived at approximately 11pm on the 16th September, 2007 after flying from New York to Los Angeles. I had not been able to access the internet at all while I was in New York (as I use broadband not wireless internet services) and realized when I got to my room that it looked as though only wireless internet was offered. I made a general enquiry with one of the staff, who organized to send someone up to my room within 5 minutes. I was advised that the hotel could still accommodate broadband Internet access and would just need to hook up a cable. Given how late it was I advised the gentleman that I was happy enough to wait until the next morning to get things sorted out. To my surprise he offered again to connect up the cabling, which only took another few minutes, stating that after arriving late that I might like to sleep in the next morning and the internet would be ready to access whenever I needed it the next day. I was so grateful for this level of service, particularly late at night.

I quite honestly thought I was in heaven. What a fantastic idea, especially for people either arriving at the hotel late and/or after a long flight. Despite a lot of problems being caused through the company that I originally booked my accomodation through, I did manage to stay the 5 additonal nights, mostly due to efforts of two of the Managers at the Hotel, Mr Cruz and Mr Page. I cannot express my gratitude enough to them for their professionalism and genuine desire to ensure that I was able to stay the five nights that I had paid for and be able to continue my stay at the hotel. The level of service offered by the staff at the Crown Plaza Hotel continued to impress me the entire seven nights of my stay.

We arrived, a little after 3:00 pm and were told that our room was not ready. This is, of course, a little unnerving after travelling for about 7 hours, but understandable if the problem is taken care of quickly. We waited for over an hour before being let into our room, which was not even made up, to drop off our luggage. We decided, rather than sit in the hotel and wait for our room to be cleaned, we would go exploring. We came back to the hotel, several hours later and our rooms were finally cleaned. This was the only real complaint I had during our stay, but as I said it is a really big complaint. The best thing about this hotel are the beds. I have stayed in many Intercontinental hotels, most recently in Atlanta, and I must say they have the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. It is good to see that Intercontinental has made the commitment to upgrade the Crowne Plaza hotel range bedding as well, even if there was no feather-bed. The hotel decor is very much like a Holiday Inn, but this is considered a value hotel and no one should expect the Ritz when staying here. The continental breakfast, served in the mornings for Priority Club members, is a wonderful value and just the thing to start a busy day of exploring and shopping. Another hotel perk, so to speak, was the use of the 24 hour fitness gym about a 1/4 of a mile down the road from the hotel. The facility has workout machines, free weights, cardio machines as well as organized classes, which can all be accessed by Crowne Plaza guests for free. Now, as for the hotel's location, anyone coming to Los Angeles should understand, that no location in Los Angeles is ever entirely convenient. If you do not have a car it is very hard to move around the city. The Crowne Plaza is only a 15 minute walk to Rodeo Dr. and is right on Beverly, which has a number of restaurants and shops, all within walking distance of the hotel. If you can handle a tedious check-in, as we did, The Crowne Plaza is a reliable value-hotel option in Los Angeles, within reasonable driving distance to many attractions, and offers guests comfortable beds, complimentary fitness center privileges and a good continental breakfast.

Crowne Plaza also have recently introduced a Sleep programe - so on the bed was a CD for helping you to drift off into a deep sleep, some lavender pillow mist, ear plugs and an eye mask all very nice little touches. Used the hotels Valet parking at $18.50 per night - to be honest it is more cost efficeint to use the hotels self parking at only $14.00 per night - as it is under the hotel and you dont have to keep tipping the concierge everytime you need your car keys.

For out of town visitors wondering just how close this hotel is to Beverly Hills, you will not be dissappointed. Beverly Drive runs parallel to Rodeo drive and if you walk about a half mile, you will be in the main shopping and restaurant area of Beverly Hills. The parking is plentiful (although the headroom is a little low for extra large SUVS with roof racks). The club floor breakfasts are great if you can get an upgrade and the staff are discrete and the free WIFI is handy. Some of the rooms have a not too exciting view but if you ask, the front desk will likely give you a high floor facing in the right direction if they can. The hotel is on the 'crew hotels' list for a bunch of major airlines so there are often flight crew wandering around in the lobby. The pool is fine but is in the front of the hotel adjacent to the registration parking area.

For the location we felt we found a great value. The price was advertised on a travelzoo newsletter, which was what directed us to investigate. The \"deal\" was only for the weekend. We called the hotel directly to see what they would charge for the next night, a Monday. They matched the weekend price so we booked directly with the hotel. We would stay there again and are considering their Tournament of Roses package for next New Year's.", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and a great holiday experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2974409", "Content": "We stayed 3 night in September 2004 and had a great time. We were more than pleasantly surprised when we arrived - the lobby was lovely, the staff delightful and very welcoming, and our room (a double double) was surprisingly spacious, comfortable and very clean. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and the service was pretty good most of the time. We had dinner there once and enjoyed a very lovely meal and found the service great. Overall a terrific hotel, great value for money, and we would stay again and highly recommend it to others!", "Date": "January 4, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Crowne Plaza Beverly Hills", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d76061-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Beverly_Hills-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$210 - $277*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1150 S Beverly Dr</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90035</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "76061", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/12/c0/12c066aa4ed492c6dc4c2cada81ee4638large.jpg"}}

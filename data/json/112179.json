The hotel is very nice, but the service is what shines here. Everyone from the valet attendants to the front desk clerks were so friendly and accomodating. We had Easter Brunch in the ballroom, and the staff was nearly falling over each other making sure we were well taken care of. The only negative I have to say about this property (and the reason I marked it down one rank) was that the bathroom in the room was pretty small. Nice, but very small. I stayed in a Courtyard last week that had a larger bathroom! The rest of the room was great, with a wonderful bed and lots of pillows. The pool area is nice, although this is not a resort. Even though the bathroom is small, I would stay here again! The price we paid was $199 per night, including valet.

We chose the Ritz Carlton because we wanted something a little swanky for our vacation and because we wanted the club lounge access that came with our room. For those with access to the club lounge, it provides all the food you need for breakfast, a light dinner, and dessert. There is also lunch but we were never around for that. The dinner and dessert include wine, cocktails, and beer. The concierge in the lounge was very helpful with restaurant and activity recommendations. The two negatives about this hotel are the location and the parking. Although it's accross from a nice shopping area, it's not near any attractions so we had to drive everywhere. Parking is valet only, which adds an expense to the trip.

However, I suspect the reason people choose to stay at Ritz-Carltons (including us) is for the service and amenities. This is where this hotel and most importantly, the staff, does not disappoint. Despite the age, the hotel is well-maintained and clean. It is very much a business hotel, but we were there on vacation and felt very comfortable. The location is central and across the street from Biltmore Mall and a movie theatre. When we stay at Ritz-Carltons, we choose to stay on the Club Level, as the continuous food presentations and beverage options throughout the day certainly complete the whole experience and add to the value. Here, it is on the 11th floor and the design of it is a bit different in that when you exit off the elevator, you walk straight into the Club Lounge. Typically from staying at other Ritz properties, the Club Lounge is in a separate room. Jean, the concierge on staff at the Club Lounge is excellent. She certainly embodies the level of service that you would expect of the Ritz-Carlton. She is kind and inquisitive, without ever being intrusive. What you later realize, she knows just the questions to ask just so she can then ask how can she help. After mentioning one morning that the A/C unit wasn't cooling in our room, she almost seemed perplexed that we hadn't mentioned it during the night; reminding us that they have engineers on staff 24/7. An engineer had the issue resolved within 30 minutes of mentioning it to her. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the pool is rather small, so certainly not the size you would see at their resort properties. There are only a few lounge chairs, although they have a larger cabana area that would be perfect to add some more chaises, but while we were there, they chose to keep it empty. On a Friday afternoon with the pool area so full that we ended up sitting in two chairs from the dining area, there was only one pool attendant on duty. Not the typical level of service you normally see at a Ritz, but this was the only noticeable delinquency I observed during our stay.

Stay at this Ritz!\u201d", "Author": "MMBINNJ", "ReviewID": "UR126068990", "Content": "So I read the reviews- and then booked a stay anyway- even though a few obscure comments had been posted. My best friend and I had a terrific 3 night stay. Here are the high and very slight low lights. I will start with the few lowlights. Is this a business hotel- yes? What does it matter? Well- only if you wanted a hot tub (no) and wanted a big pool with a pool side bar (no). Yes- you can get a drink- but it was off the room service menu with a phone (ouch). Also- yes, they do set up in our case the hybrid seed consortium of some sort eating lunch in cowboy hats (who cares). I had read the hallway is noisy- and yes that was a bit true. End of any shortcomings... My friend's daughter had to make a last minute appearance- and they promptly set up a complimentary super comfortable cot- all gratis. And arranged to get her back to the airport- wow. The best kept secret is this amazing Friday night buffet- for $42, the most amazing spread. Well well worth it. Another secret was happy hour. On Thursday and Friday- (I think) 5-7pm they had $5 cocktails that are normally $13- wow. And appetizers- also $5 each. I wonder why they did not tell us at check-in? But alas we figured it out. The location is terrific- we walked across the street and had access to more restaurants than you could eat at for a week- and top shelf shopping (some too top shelf for me). And a Macy's- ho hum. But fun Lulu Lemon new store. Also there was free yoga on the Sunday morning we were there- but we did not figure that out until we showed up in regular clothes. One last tip- there is a Dine In AMC movie theatre steps away. If you haven't been- check it out. Very very cool- cocktails, easy chairs, a waiter. Who knew this existed? Get buy 1 get 1 coupon off web. The Ritz has a great complimentary computer room- wow (print your movie coupon)! Many machines, many printers (AND they had also offered to print out our boarding passes for us.) Does it get any better than that service? I forgot one last thing- they have this ExecuCar service. For the same price as a cab- they sent a nice towncar to pick us up and drop us off at the airport. We felt like celebrities... A note- we took a nice walk to The Biltmore Hotel Spa to catch some treatments and use their facilities (grabbed the before mentioned ExecuCar back for $10). Used their beautiful pools, hot tubs, restaurant. But their spa was run down in our opinion- old magazines, typical expensive services. Not a bad idea though for great pool action... Next time- I would try the Red Door across the street. Restaurant tip- we ate at Tarbells (again walked but called for car coming back). Awesome restaurant- iron chef, make a reservation- well worth it. I hope this helps- and thanks for everyone's past input on hotels!

I was pleased with things in the end. The hotel has its own set of high-end taxi cabs in the form of a semi-limo type vehicle. As do other good hotels in the area. The prices are calculated by the driver in some random way that even the drivers are sometimes confused about. The service is quite professional. The outside of the building is very modern and clean. The hotel is located across the street from a medium to high end mall. In the background there are mountains. You want to stay on the 11th (top) floor if possible, and that is considered Club Level. I suspect that rooms not on the 11th floor may not be as nice, but I only saw the inside of my room on the 11th floor. When making reservations, it was cheaper to book two separate reservations rather than one long stay reservation. Otherwise you pay the highest price for each night. This hotel caters primarily to the business traveler including small conferences. The rooms are smaller than expected, the safe is very small and still uses a KEY to access it (one key only, and not enough room for a laptop!), there is a mini bar, fridge by request, small closet, small bathroom, bathrobes, iron/board, etc. The room is in good shape, but with an old style decor and nothing is modern in it. Even the scale is not digital! However, things are very clean. The bed does not have a fitted sheet, so sometimes the mattress gets exposed. There is not much room to give too many towels, and they all seem to have a thread or two on them... but they are medium thickness and they absorb very well (comfortable), and they are clean. Club access is a nice benefit... allows 5 different servings of food through the day. For some people, this is more than enough to eat for the whole day. It always includes vegi choices, etc. Each time you take one or two little items, someone rushes out and adds more to the buffet type tables. There is always wine or champagne available without additional fee. There are also various cookies that are available 24 hours a day, plus water/soda and various candy. There is also free use of their computer/internet/printer. The club is sometimes a bit uncomfortable to deal with. There is always a person stationed as soon as you get off the elevator on the 11th floor. They don't mean to be nosy, but you cannot avoid talking to them and their questions about how you are, where you been, where you are going the next day, etc. Sometimes I just want to be left alone and not be bothered. They also need to make your specialized coffee drinks because the sound of the machine is too loud (other guests have complained) so they keep it in the back room for only the staff to use. i would have drunk about 3 more cups per day if the machine was accessible to me and I didn't have to bother the staff. Don't get me wrong, each person was extremely nice, well, maybe one was a bit off, but find a better place to sit so you are not in my face all the time when I get off the elevator. Anyways, it is well worth the upgrade fee to access the Club floor and food. The gym is small and they have about half the things you would expect. There is NO SPA in the hotel, but massages are available. There is a small pool, and it is often in the shade. The hotel has no shame when setting up a conference lunch poolside and allowing its other hotel guests site on lounge chairs right next to conference people that are wearing suit and ties. There are always a group of valets at the front door, waiting to hold the door open, get you a cab, or help you in some way. The main lobby is extremely nice, very clean, and comfortable to sit out for a while. There are always well dressed people walking by and it is fun to hang out for a while. The front desk staff are very pretty, professional, helpful, and genuine. The Bistro 24 staff was great. I asked my waiter if he could mix and match some of the food items and he replied something like 'the menu is more like a list of ingredients than anything else\" and accommodated my every request. He got a 25% tip. There was one semi-stained chair directly across from the elevator on the main flood. I am sure someone noticed it by now. Otherwise, completely spotless everywhere else.

We also had club privlages, even though we were not on the club floor. The service was excellent during our stay. Everybody was friendly and professional. The hotel is in a central Phoenix location and access to main roads is a breeze. The hotel was clean, except for the pool area which had cigarette butts all around it (hard to criticize the hotel and not the disgusting, thoughtless cigarette smokers). The pool was odd in that it was so small. You would think they would expand it ? The misters were nice, when they were on.

The bathroom was a white marble dream and the Bulgari toiletries were delightful. And those Frette sheets and down pillows were just delicious! The hotel is clearly intended for business travelers. The pool is a quick-dip affair, not a resort-style place to spend the day. There is a large but fairly ordinary mall across the street (Macy's, Chico's, etc.) with several restaurants, of which I tried only one--Sam's, which was mediocre. The location is pretty boring.

We upgraded to the Club Lounge for the last 4 nights. Whilst we had a wonderful holiday and whilst Ritz Carlton still remains our all time favourite hotel group, Phoenix lacked the sparkle and devotion to customer service that is normally associated with this seriously upscale hotel group. Expedia thought it merited 4 and 1/2 stars, which initially greatly surprised us. However, on reflection Expedia's assessment was about right. Basically, the hotel had staffing problems and were twice unable to offer breakfast at the stated times or have the lounge vacuumed in time. The breakfast downstairs at Bistro 24 was little better. The menu was heavily itemised and not particularly good. You could easily spend $35 per person for a very average breakfast and not even be offered a second glass of orange juice. The Club Lounge staff operated a type of 'siege mentality' against its guests, locking doors and preventing access points at many times during the day. Many of us felt the service was hostile where guests were not encouraged to ask for service (indeed, 'tutted' at in one instance) or make requests for a glass of wine. Basic concierge services such as the posting of mail were met with replies like 'You need to walk down to 20th Street.' Most disappointing of all was the failure to book our New Year's Eve dinner tickets despite the concierge emailing confirmation of this event several weeks beforehand. I know people lose patience with reviews where the comments are little more than a long series of whinging. So to be fair, after making these observations to the Duty Manager, we were offered the most generous farewell lunch with wines of our choice at Bistro 24 that more than made up for our 'gripes.' Additionally, our Club Lounge upgrade rate was completely removed from the final bill. So we left feeling warm and still in love with Ritz Carlton despite the drawbacks. A new General Manager, Christoph Roshardt has just been appointed, so the hotel is absolutely ripe for management led initiatives. So what of Phoenix itself? Hotel Location: Excellent. Opposite Biltmore Mall and a whole host of upscale restaurants. Weather: We were cold and went to Macy's sale to stock up on padded shirts, hats and jackets (also necessary to wrap up for Grand Canyon) Best Restaurants: Ruth's Chris Steak House. Just around the corner from the hotel. Best Fillet Mignon in the world. Ritz Carlton could not hold a candle up to the steaks here and we issued Ritz Carlton that challenge too! The mashed potato and creamed spinach are similarly awesome. T Cooks: Excellent ambience and superb food. Very popular. Book early. We spent Christmas night here and loved the roaring fires and Mediterranean ambience. Best Gallery: Phoenix Art Museum: Some fabulous exhibits but star of the show was Yayoi Kusama's installation 'Fireflies.' Get lost and feel your way into this sensory experience of light, darkness and colour. Check out local artist George Thiewe's abstractions too. Taxis: Unbelievably expensive. $28 for single trip downtown $20 with Discount Cabs [--]Ask for Steve, ex stand up comedian! Downtown: There isn't one. Phoenix is dead. Dead as a hole in a Seguano cactus. Hyatt have a top storey spy hole to drink cocktails from but it's not open until 5.30pm. There are some vibrant statues by the theatre and there's a Hooters (See below) with cold beer and sexy waitresses. Best Lowlife: Hooters. What an outrageous bar. Sexy service of what must be the coldest beer in Arizona. Check out the annual calendar, possibly the most unhelpful organisational tool in the history of the personal planner. Reality Check: The Buses: The buses are $1.25 per trip (exact change needed) and very regular. However they are also serve as an excellent Ritz Carlton reality check. The bus drivers were the best. They were all immensely friendly and helpful. Huge respect is given to disabled people where the driver moves seats back and makes special provision for wheelchair bound passengers. Buses: Turn left out of hotel and sit in shelter opposite Starbucks. Take the Blue Line for the Heard Museum and Phoenix Art Museum. Best Tour Operator: Detours Jeff Haflett, the CEO of Detours braved the snows of Sedona and talked us through the Grand Canyon with immense knowledge and good humour, not to mention the best turkey sandwiches on the planet. Jeff was a real local expert, deeply passionate about his environment. See Photo 6. Best Jaw Drop: The Grand Canyon. We took our first helicopter ride with Maverick Tours for an awesome close up of this World Wonder. See Photo 5 Best Museum: Heard: Improve your knowledge of Native Americans. This museum is accommodated within a beautifully designed piece of architecture. The Heard Museum has many exquisite staues throughout the entire area. The guided tours are excellent.The main restaurant is popular and serves tasty food. Desert Botanical Gardens: We loved the Seguano cactus,the all round Arizona icon. There are many outstanding giant Seguanos here living and breathing in real life and not just in some Western movie. Fabulous celebration of the spikey 'teddy bears' too. Cholla, cholla, cholla: Do they jump, don't they? Highly imaginative variety of Desert trails highlighting the many varied properties of the cactus.

However, the furniture in the rooms looked old and worn out. Also the A/C and heater unit kept malfunctioning. The heater would come on at the wrong time and the room became all toasty. We called the front desk who sent a repair man to fix it. They stated that the fuse needed to be changed. Amenity: The workout room was very small.

Marriott right at the airport and just a quick 3 minute drive from the terminal. First glance at the property and you wonder if the property has been updated as the building is older. The lobby is updated nicely, but the rooms need some updating. Was surprised to find the old-styled tube TVs in the rooms, rather than the newer flat screens, and while not every hotel has updated their electronics, this was after all a full-service Marriott. We stay at Marriott properties a lot, and found this one to be lacking and in need of updating. There is really no food within walking distance, so be prepared with a rental car or to eat in the hotel restaurant. If in Baltimore, I may stay here again, but I'm not entirely certain. Marriott - this is another hotel that needs an update!

The areas that need updating is sound insulation, bathroom and standard room maintenance. The shower faucet handle seemed to be set in sand since it did not move smoothly and the shower drain had seen better days. The track to the closet door was loose causing the door to jam when opening or closing. Most hotels offer free internet access, but for some reason this hotel still charges $12.95 a day.

The hotel is located in an area where all BWI airport hotels are situation - along one road. So many other choces - this old awful Marriott will be a Days Inn one day most likely. You walk into a new lobby environment - obvious attempt by the hotel to refurbish the image, but its like walking into styrofoam - that bland. The you hit the rooms and its like walking back in time. Old 1980's style decor with hideous attempts to renovate (Marriott is famous now for throwing on their new worldwide bedding with the nasty gold throw on the end of the bed). Drilled hole in the TV cabinet to make room for the new useless AV module. Same old tub with paint peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom and the walls are so thin I could hear the person in the room next door coughing, talking, and snoring at night! Doors are old metal doors that remind me of stepping back in a time when Marriotts used to cater to upscale business travelors. The food in the restuarant that is supposed to be Maryland style cooking (crab cakes, Maryland friend chicken, etc.) was prepared Asian style - tempura type batter on the Maryland Chicken with greasy Asian style vegtables. Just horrible. The huge restuarant only had 3 people eating there at 7:00 PM on a weeknight - this should have been a sign. I've spent over 450 nights in Marriotts during my career and lately they are just going downhill and missing the mark for 2011 properties in a major way. Something is wrong with this chain. It's a shame - corporate needs to learn that the standard Marriott burger that used to be a consistent request among guests just no longer applies - their attempt to remodel in a half-way manner but putting the same tacky red lamps in every room worldwide is also missing the mark. Oh, and forget about the price I paid of $269 per night for this property - almost embarrassed to admit I paid that. Anyway, bottom line - don't stay here. Finally, the \"Stayonline\" internet is practically dial-up speed. Kept knocking me off and after work when people returned to the hotel the internet speed was terrible - impossible just to check email at times. Again, a sign of the times when you have to register with some 3rd party lowcost ISP - so frustrating. Oh - I keep thinking of other nuisances - while the promote the Executive Lounge, it is locked most of the time.

The only down side was the shuttle from the airport. We landed around 9:40PM, had only carry on luggage, walked to the courtesy phone and called. They told us to stand at the second curb and wave down the bus. What a nightmare! There are cars, rental car busses, park and fly busses and hotel busses, all trying for the same \"curb\" Admittedly, there did seem to be an awful lot of traffic! The bus finally came by and we were able to flag it down. After picking us up it stopped a little further down and ended up picking up the flight crew that was on our plane. Then it headed to the hotel, but stopped at the Fairfield first, (where the flight crew got off) then drove to the MArriot. All in all, we left the gate at 9:40 and it was 10:30 before we were at the desk checking in. I might have been willing to pay $5 for a cab had I known how long it was going to take. (and the cab's you could catch at the \"first\" curb, much less crowded) A big plus was that there's a Champions Restaurant there which was open serving food and drink until 12:30.

At checkin I showed my Marriott Rewards card and asked for an upper floor room with king bed. I was given room 815. Though it didn't have much of a view, the room was nicely decorated and super clean. Sound proofing was amazing even with little children in nearby rooms. The fitness center and pool are great and the lobby is an eye catcher. Shuttle service to BWI is efficent and on time. The only glitch was on my final night guests received notice that all water would be turned off from midnight until 5 am for emergency repairs. Since I needed to catch a 5 am shuttle to the airport, I called guest services and asked what I should do about showering, shaving, brushing teeth and using the toilet between 4 am and 5am.

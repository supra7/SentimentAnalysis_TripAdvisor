My room was totally cute and it has the following benefits: 1) Um..free parking. Where else can you get that in the Beverly Hills area? 2) Close location to major hotels/attractions 3) Friendly front desk staff (usually people that work at motels are super-rude. The guy that checked us in couldn't have been nicer) 4) Free breakfast (it's not the Ritz, but they had a nice selection of danish, juice and coffee. And it's free...so stop complaining people, geez!) The rooms are all decorated in a mid-century modern-esque theme, which I loved. The beds were comfy and the room was huge (for a motel). The area is a bit sketchy if you head toward the freeway, but, again, unless you're planning to wander the streets around the motel at night, you'll be fine.

I certainly did not look forward to living in a motel for 2 weeks. This is a GREAT locale because it is a quiet, safe, upper middle class neighborhood near UCLA and Santa Monica.

Century City is up the road. If you are coming from out of town and are on a budget, you might want to consider this motel. It's central location will allow you easy access to wherever you want to go, although it is NOT near the metro. There are buses running up and down Santa Monica Boulevard, however. I had zero problems with the parking, which is free. The room I stayed in, #241, was a non smoking, queen bedded room. It was completely new. In fact, it had that new carpet smell. Everything, including the wallpaper and all the furnishings were in perfect condition. It also has a small refrigerator with freezer tray and Free HBO and basic cable. I did spot one roach, but that is to be expected in a motel. It didn't \"freak\" me out as I normally would be, primarily because the room could not have been any cleaner. The overall condition of the building was very good. Not the Paris Ritz by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are new to the city and don't want to be looking over your shoulder every time you walk out the door, I recommend staying here.

I chose it because it's not the LAX Motel 6, it's near bus lines on Westwood and Santa Monica Blvds, and it's pretty much the cheapest rate you can find in LA. The downsides: The property is badly in need of refurbishing, and nearby Santa Monica Blvd is basically a raceway. My advice: ask for a second-floor room when you arrive. The rooms get very warm and usually don't have enough windows, so you'll be running the air conditioner most days out of the year. You can generally leave the AC on during the day while you're out, without the maid turning it off, if you leave the temperature set to \"normal.\" That helps keep it cooler. Depending on how loud the AC turns on and off, which varies depending on the room, I've generally found I get a restful night's sleep only when wearing earplugs, but I'm a fairly light sleeper. The shower heads are pretty searing and positioned too low. They do indeed have a pool, but it's never available when I'm there, before or after business hours. They lock it up, for obvious reasons. The upsides: Although it won't look it when you arrive, the surrounding neighborhood, near the Mormon Temple, is actually pretty decent. I jog during the mornings southward down Overland Ave, past an elementary school. There's a Seven Eleven right across the street. Each room I've stayed in also has a mini refrigerator. Santa Monica Big Blue Buses troll along Westwood and Santa Monica up to Westwood, but that's about a 4 block hike. It's incredibly cheap for LA, which is no doubt why the place is in disrepair. You get free bagels/danishes/coffee in the mornings until 10am. The service tends to be pretty good, although the morning guy is a little odd. And best of all, they frequently have rooms available, and you can cancel up until 4pm day-of. They claim not to guarantee parking, but I've never had a problem with it. You probably will want a rental car in this location, since it's far from anything including Westwood, unless you enjoy waiting for buses. (I kind of do!) Bottom Line: Cheap!

Second, breakfast is not included... Weird because it's sister hotel is literally right next door and it was less money, same size rooms and did include breakfast. Would we return?

We made a minor change to the reservation on the phone two nights before we came, and were sent a confirmation of our reservation, noting the changes. Imagine our unpleasant surprise when we got to the hotel at 8 pm, with our 1 year old, 3 year old and 5 year old in tow, only to be told we didn't have a room. When we showed them the confirmation email from Marriott they said our reservation had been altered at Central Booking and in spite of the fact we had a confirmation email in hand they didn't have any rooms for us and were sold out. That was all. The front desk told us we could call the 800 number but there was nothing else they could do. After an hour talking to various people at Marriott we were told that though they were very sorry this this mistake had been made. They said if another Marriott in the area had any rooms free they would have sent us there, but everything was booked. They did not in any way help us try to find an alternate room for the night at a different hotel. Fortunately I had my computer and was able to find a nearby hotel (the LaQuinta, which was totally fine) on Orbitz. I can't believe they didn't help us find a room. The customer service was terrible from the front desk though the person on the 800 line. On the way to the new hotel I called back to complain about how this was not right, and that person was pretty decent and explained to me how the reservation had been messed up but instead of fixing it or letting me know they just did nothing and left it to me to find out I didn't have a room when I got there. I can understand one mistake being made, but come on. How could it have occurred to no one to find us a room at another hotel? At the end of that call they said they would give us some bonus points (because we are elite rewards members) but that was no help to me when what I needed was a place to stay. I will definitely not stay there again. Total incompetence. The hotel is fine but the I've been staying there since 2007 and after they redesigned it to look like all the other Courtyards all the good staff people there are gone and the old perks like free coffee and cookies in the lobby have been replaced with mostly unfriendly staff and an overpriced snack bar.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eastern MA", "Title": "\u201cClean rooms in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Soonipi", "ReviewID": "UR118969719", "Content": "The hotel location is convenient to the highway and only minutes from U of I campus.

We are considering relocating to the Champaign area for my husband's job, so we were also there for business (house hunting, etc.). We were very impressed with our large, 2 room suite. The hotel was very clean and the room was pleasant. However, the front desk employees were very rude and it was obvious they did not care about \"customer service.\" One of the big decision points for us when deciding on a hotel was to get one with an indoor pool so that we can play with our daughter. The water was FREEZING - even I as a grown woman would not get in the pool, let alone to put my daughter in it. Just dipping her feet in the pool made her body shake. We complained about this for the first 3 days of our trip, and on day 4, our last day there, the water was still the same temperature. Therefore, we were not able to enjoy the indoor swimming pool with our family, which was the main reason for picking this hotel, and it was a major disappointment after staying that long and never having our complaint addressed. We also asked when booking our hotel if they had complimentary breakfast (simple, but free). The front desk said yes. The first morning of our stay we headed to the \"breakfast\" area, and there was only one chef standing out there that could not speak English when we asked him a question. We sat down nad started to get our food, then an employee from the front desk came up to give us menus and get us drinks, and only after asking her directly did she inform us it was not free as expected. We were not looking for a fancy breakfast, but the basic cereal, fruit, etc. breakfast that 99% of hotels offer for free just for staying. Another BIG disappointment. Lastly, our room was on the end of the hall, so it made sense to enter through the side door vs. the main lobby. The card swiper did not work on the side door, so we were forced to walk through the main lobby everytime. We informed the front desk of this ongoing issue, and they simply replied \"yes, we've had problems with that door for some time now, we recommend using the main door\" instead of \"absolutely, we will have someone come look at it right away and hopefully get it fixed.\" Again, the customer service was terrible. I was truly disappointed with my stay in Champaign, and would not recommend this place as a hotel for a long stay.

I've been in a number of hotels over the years, but what surprised me about this hotel was just how flawless the experience was. The room was scrupulously clean. Water pressure in the shower was great (usually a weak flow is the norm these days, IMO). Room curtains effectively kept the light out if we wanted it. The mattresses and pillows seemed just right. Although the restaurant was closed by the time we got there, the front desk clerk was exceedingly helpful in finding some an excellent Italian restaurant that delivered. Drinks from the lounge (staffed by that same front desk clerk) were exceedingly generous. We slept well that night. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant (included in the room rate plan we had been given) was indeed a sizable spread. It had corned beef hash -- which usually isn't on the menu at places like this -- as well as made-to-order omelettes, which I've seen elsewhere. Excellent service and quality food for breakfast made the best out of the bad situation we were in. After breakfast, we went to the dealer to find out the repair news. The dealer indicated to us our truck could be fixed, but they would have to travel 30 miles to pick up a part. The front desk clerk on shift gave us zero hassles with a late check-out, given our circumstances.

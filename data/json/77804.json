The staff were great--from doorman to reception to room service to housekeeping (I managed to break a glass, and they came right away and vacuumed and replaced the glass). Our room was on the 6th floor with a bit of a view (two high-rise condo buildings across the street blocked most of the view). The room was large, with two double beds, a comfortable wing chair, a desk with desk chair and a bureau containing mini-bar, drawers, coffee service, ice bucket and glassware. Atop the bureau was a 48\" (?) Panasonic TV. The furniture was walnut. The beds were fitted with thick mattresses with pill-top and wonderfully soft linens and duvet. Very comfy. The decor was pleasing--muted tans and off-whites. Nice art work on the walls. Temperature could be controlled by thermostat. The bath was spacious; it had a glass-enclosed, nicely tiled shower as well as a separate bath tub. The vanity was contemporary in style with marble top, etc. The bath amenities were high quality. Plenty of plush towels too. We dined at Kendall's in front of the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion and therefore did not sample the cuisine at Noe's in the hotel. We did pass by it, and it looked very inviting. However, our room service lunch (a curried chicken salad and a soup du jour) was tasty, generously sized, and at the right temperature (hot soup, cold salad.) It was a bit pricey, but what isn't these days? It was important to use to be close to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. We needed only to exit the hotel on the third floor onto Grand, walk a block and change, and voila! We were there! However, a big plus it that the hotel offers a town car for shuttling to nearby venues. (When we left the next morning for Union Station, we were offered a shuttle, but there would have been a 10 minute delay, and we were running late, so we took a cab.)

The hotel is right on top of MOCA and the Disney Concert Hall, which can have its drawbacks especially if a special event is booked (as it was when we were there, and the noise was deafening).

As Marriott Platinum Rewards members, we always try to stay at a Marriott, but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a room anywhere downtown, and grudgingly stayed at the Omni instead. Wow! What a pleasant surprise this was. Although we are not members and haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stayed at an Omni in over 20 years, all of the staff, from the front door all the way up to the Concierge Lounge, treated us as old friends. The service at this hotel is absolutely top-flight. The Concierge Lounge at this Omni is truly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concierge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd style. Unlike at the Marriott, alcoholic drinks are complimentary, mixed for you, and served to you at your table. In the evening, the Concierge Lounge staff always offers to make dinner reservations for you and to help in any way they can. The hotel had a very nice bar area on the 3rd floor. We found the restaurant No\u00c3\u00a9 to be highly overrated, but it was slightly better than most hotel restaurants. Our room (1724 Club Room) was tastefully decorated in warm shades of beige, taupe, gray, & charcoal. Although the bed was very comfortable, it was too high for me (5\u00e2\u20ac\u21222\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) to easily get in & out of. We appreciated the extremely light duvet, which enabled us to sleep comfortably. There is a thicker duvet draped across the bottom of the bed if you need it. Lighting was excellent & bright. There was a large desk with comfortable leather chair, and an armchair with ottoman. The view was over Olive Street at the front entrance of the hotel. The bathroom was large enough in which to comfortably move around and had separate shower stall & bathtub. In addition to the usual shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, lotion and soap, there were also Q-tips, cotton balls, sewing kit, toothpaste, mouthwash, razor, shaving cream, shoe mitt & shower cap. The bar of soap was much larger than normally found in a hotel, which we very much appreciated. I have only a few minor complaints. (1) We originally booked (in October) 5 nights at $284 on the hotel website, but due to changes in our business appointment schedule & flight changes, we had to reduce our stay to 3 nights. (These changes were made a week in advance). The hotel did change the reservation, but bumped our nightly room rate to $379. (They told me the price had gone up because the hotel was fully booked)! However, at the same time, I also reduced the stay to 2 nights for a colleague traveling with us, and his price stayed the same. Go figure! (2) We arrived in the room to find a used towel on the floor of the shower, so we were not convinced that the shower had been cleaned after the previous guest. We called this to the attention of the front desk, and housekeeping did come to take care of it. Still, it was a rather yucky thing to see upon arrival. Otherwise, housekeeping was generally good & pleasant. (3) The location was a bit far from the Convention Center. We had to take a taxi to & from everyday, costing us $9 plus tip each way. Also, it was quite a climb up a steep hill to get back to the hotel on evenings when we went out to eat. The escalators between 5th & Hope Streets do make the climb back to the hotel a bit easier, but we were told they stop running at 9 or 10 pm. These minor complaints account for my lower rating in Value, Location and Cleanliness. The lower rating for Sleep Quality is due to to extreme height of the bed. Nevertheless, it is a 5-star hotel.

If you desire to be in downtown LA, this hotel will afford you the modern, highly functional hotel you are looking for, without having to pay super-steep prices for a room. The Omni chain will frequently offer discounts for AAA, AARP, gov't rates, etc., so take advantage of those if you can when reserving online. Moreover, just joining the Omni Select Guest program, which is free, provides you with complimentary internet in your room. There is no reason not to do this. I found the wi-fi to be a dependable service here, just as I had when I stayed at the Omni in Cancun a few months earlier. By checking in online before your arrival here in downtown LA, you will completely bypass the registration desk. My valet/bellman handed me my room keys as I first entered the lobby and promptly ushered me upstairs; my luggage followed me up the elevator. I was very pleased with my comfortable, clean, modern, attractive guest room. My requests for a high floor with a view overlooking California Plaza were honored, and I found the king bed to be quite comfortable, with several extra pillows. The \"Classic Deluxe\" guest room and the bathroom were both sufficiently spacious (384+ sq. ft.) and well-appointed. The bathroom had both a small tub and a shower stall. Both were sparkling clean. There was plenty of hot water and water pressure each morning. The usual assortment of lotions / shampoos / conditioners were there for my use. The in-room safe with programmable lock combination worked perfectly, and it was large enough for my laptop and accessories. Bathrobes, clothing iron and refrigerator were well placed and worked great. The housekeeping service was excellent and also consisted of one or two polite visits to my room each evening to see if I needed anything, such as more ice, etc. The flat-screen TV worked well. The TV did not have a plethora of stations, but it did have most of the local and national stations/networks. The pay-per-view movie service had some but a limited number of choices. The newspapers I requested for morning delivery when I made the reservation were both placed in the hallway right at my door each morning. Express check-out is conveniently and efficiently handled. I found the bell staff and the valet staff to be very professional and capable. I had driven my own car to LA and had no qualms at all leaving it with this valet staff. I did feel that the price of $40 per day to park was a tad high, even though I realize this is downtown LA. $20-$30 I wouldn't have even blinked at. I just thought $40 was a little high. But I have zero complaints about the quality of service I received. These guys are good, and they are knowledgeable for providing you with local driving directions, if you ask them. Getting here and getting back onto the LA freeway system are relatively simple if you stay at this hotel. LA's downtown is actually pretty easy to navigate, and it served my business purposes to be here. The hotel's concierge desk is usually staffed. There were a couple of things I inquired about with which they were not able to assist me, but they were very polite and at least tried. I felt that the hotel's spa was somewhat \"hidden\" on an upper floor. When I finally located it one evening, I found it to be closed; apparently most of their service is done by appointment only, rather than on a walk-in basis. The staff at the hotel's front desk were always cordial, professional and helpful. Since I was in the hotel during the early portion of a work week, the lounge seemed a little quiet. The place was beautiful, with a nice big-screen TV and a basketball game showing, but no other customers that I saw. The staff on that shift were ready to serve, however. I would imagine that the lounge receives more business later in the week and whenever the hotel is full. It was not full during my stay. I really loved the hotel's breakfast buffet in the 'Grand Cafe' on the third floor. The buffet opens at 6:30 a.m., and I found it to be a very enjoyable breakfast experience. The price was reasonable -- I tipped well and still got out of there for under $30. The made-to-order omlette was one of the best I have had in years. There are plenty of hot food items, and they change them up from day to day. There are several cereal choices; the milk was cold, and I found the fresh fruit and pastry assortments to be ample. The dining area is large. When I was there, it was fairly quiet, and I could enjoy my morning newspaper. Just outside the Grand Cafe and down the hallway a few feet is a \"to-go\" coffee and pastry venue, if you don't have time for a sit-down breakfast. The Grand Cafe serves meals throughout the day, but I dined elsewhere for lunches and dinners, so I cannot speak to their menus or services at those times.

In doing my due diligence, I learned from other TA reviewers, that it is beneficial to join their loyalty program which I did before booking. One of the things that concerned me (even though it is work's money) was the $40 a night valet only charge. I usually find street parking or a cheaper lot (both are available nearby though street parking is very limited and the car must be moved by 8:00 a.m. or towed. Interestingly, the $40 valet is for weekdays only, weekend guests are only charged $20. (Can you say expense accounts?) Surpisingly, I was only charged $20, which I am guessing but do not know for sure was that I was there on a government rate. The hotel itself is very nice, staff very friendly, room stylish and clean. The loyalty program previously mentioned exceeds any other loyalty program I am a member of, though admittedly, it is the cause of my minor issue. By being a loyalty member, you get two items pressed (ironed) for free as well as your shoes shined. Very, very nice. You also get free internet (though it should be free anyway), and a choice of coffee or juice delivered to your room each morning. Nice touch! I should also mention that I was given a king bed, corner room. Now to the minor issue. The first night I had two items pressed and the second night I called the front desk and asked if there was a charge to have two more items pressed. I was told on night one, that two items are free and each item after that was $5.00. However, it was not clear whether this was two items a night or for the whole stay, which is why I called the front desk before I got the shirts pressed. The young lady admittedly didn't sound sure about this fact; asked someone else, then told me that I could get two more items for free. When I checked out, there were no charges for this; but two days later I received an email with a $10.00 charge added for the pressing of the items. I immediately called the hotel, left a message for the customer service rep, and...........nothing, no call back, no email, nothing. in reading the reviews, i see that management usually responds to reviews, so here goes. You have a great hotel; I look forward to staying there again, but not responding to a minor customer service issue is the difference between a four and five star rating.

There is a car park a block away for 8 dollars a day, which I would recommend. I parked the car with the hotel valet for one evening, as I had a race the next morning and wanted the car parked in the hotel for convenience. Unfortunately, my car was parked behind another car, and the valet could not find the keys to the other car to move it. So, I waited for half an hour until this was sorted out.

I think that was essential, as it included several \"extras\" such as express check-in, free newspapers, and free morning beverage delivered to the room. Also, the rate that I booked was very favorable, and included parking and breakfast. I was put in a corner room, which was large and bright. The bed was extremely comfortable - pillow-top mattress, firm pillows. The bathroom was large, had a separate shower and had nice bath products. Room service was quick, efficient and good. Had the buffet breakfast not been included in the rate, I probably would have passed on it and gone to a nearby Starbucks. There were a lot of choices in the buffet and the food was pretty decent quality. The fitness facility was on the small side, but was clean and had well maintained equipment that was in very good condition. I would definitely stay here again if I had to be in downtown Los Angeles, and if I was able to get a good rate.

Other good points included spacious bath room, comfortable bed and bedding. A piece of advice here, don't forget to join their loyalty membership so that the internet charges can be waived. You can join after you have checked in. Otherwise the daily internet charge is 9.95 USD if I remember correctly. Our two young children got the kiddie-bags welcome goodies which was very nice. Since we did not drive in Los Angeles, the Metro Red Line and bus stops were just 3~5 minutes away. There is also a couple of convenient stores located in the plaza so we could buy our snacks and fruit drinks etc. California Pizza Kitchen was located in the next building across street (I believe it is located inside Wells Fargo Centre).

I spent 4 nights here over the US Thanksgiving weekend and have nothing but great things to say about it. I had signed up for their Loyalty Program and what a great idea that is. Right from the word go, they make you feel special. I arrived on Friday after a long flight and dealing with LA traffic to get down to the hotel. I pulled my rental vehicle into the driveway in front of the hotel and immediately a bellman came over and helped with my luggage. They have mandatory valet parking here, so I gave him the keys to my rental and was handed a ticket in return and off he went. I went inside to the front desk to check in. I mentioned my name and the front desk clerk looked me up and said since you were a Loyalty Member and we had your credit card on file it is done. The cards were sitting there in alphabetical order just grab it and go. Some people might hate this, but this was fantastic to me. I always hate standing there with my luggage for 20 minutes being checked in. A nice little bonus, the front desk appeared to have an elevator button as there was an elevator waiting for me with the door open. No waiting at all. This little thing with the elevator happened everytime I returned to the hotel. I found that to be the cherry on top of their service. The room itself was one of the nicest I have ever been in. I travel quite a bit for business and have never stayed in such a nice hotel. The room is quite large and features a flat screen LCD TV, granted they do not have HD channels in the rooms, but this is an improvement over many hotels that still have the old tube TVs. The view is great of downtown, I faced South Grand Avenue and had a great view of the MOCA, Disney Concert Hall and the towers on Grand. I love giant office towers and big city downtowns, so this was great for me. The bed was amongst the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. I actually had a great sleep, which is usually the problem when I travel. The bathroom was big and spacious and actually has a walk-in shower stall and a bathtub. Would be great if I had been traveling with other people and needed to use both. The perks of the Loyalty program are great too. It gives you free Wi-Fi, which if you don't have the Loyalty program cost you $9.95/day. In addition, it also gives you complimentary morning beverage service. You can opt for tea, coffee, juice or soda. They give you a little card that you fill out and hang on your doorknob by 2 AM. You can specify the time you want it delivered and whether you want them to knock and leave it outside your door or serve it in your room. I opted to use them as an alarm clock and would have them knock and leave it outside the room. The other nice thing is that they allow you to specify which newspaper they deliver. I had asked for a local paper in my online profile, so they would deliver that day's LA Times and that day's USA Today complimentary. Also, each evening they would deliver two bottles of water to the room as part of the Loyalty Program. Very nice touch. Apparently, the hotel has an outdoor pool and a spa. I didn't seek these out, so I cannot comment on how good or bad they were. I also did not eat specifically in the hotel. I did order room service one night (as the LAPD's chopper was hovering nearby due to the Occupy LA eviction and keeping me awake) and the burger I ordered was fantastic. The hotel is located very centrally in downtown LA and is easy to get to and from. I rarely had any issues finding my way around from the hotel. The local area has a small shopping area in California Plaza, but the majority of things are only open during business hours. There is a convenience store called Famina!! that was decent, it is a Japanese chain that carries your regular US sodas, beers and snacks, but it also carries Japanese snacks. Also, they have fresh Krispy Kreme donuts there every morning. Across the street is the Wells Fargo Building and it has a California Pizza Kitchen in it. In addition, the hotel also has a towncar service that will take you in a 2 mile radius around the hotel. It has limited service to Staples Center, but it gets you across the street from the edge of L.A. Live, so that is good also.

As I didnt get the guys name and its clearly posted the costs for parking, I didnt even bother to dispute the charge.

The boyfriend and I came here after our second date. It was my first time here, but as it was a four star hotel I expected it to be cushy. I purchased the room through Priceline's \"name your price\" deal, so for the quality I definitely came up on a bargain. Driving around Downtown L.A. sucks. The hotel also didn't have a sign visible from the street so it took me nearly 10 minutes to actually find the place! I was tired and ready to get to the room. Fortunately, there was no line and I was able to get there in minutes. I don't like how the halls are arranged-there weren't signs immediately once you got off the elevator telling which way the rooms were. But once I found it, I was pleasantly surprised. The bed was HUGE and full of pillows, just like I like, the TV was HUGE (flat screen) and the bathroom was HUGE! Walk in shower and tub! I think the walls were soundproof (I hope they were) as I didn't hear noise from other residents...or we could have not been surrounded by anyone. Anyways, our stay was quiet and private, just perfect. I know this hotel had some of their own specials that had late check out-a shame that they don't give it to everyone. We actually got lucky and the front desk guy let us leave later the next day as we had missed the original check out time. Now for the parking situation. I was aware that parking wasn't included in the hotel price. Because my boyfriend and I came in separate cars, I parked in a lot that was half the price of hotel parking and he parked at the hotel. It was $30.00. They don't give you your car back unless you pay first. We paid cash upon check out and were on our way. About 6 months later (October) I get a mysterious $30.00 charge on my bank statement. Confused, I do some research to see where it's from and find that it was from this hotel I had stayed at back in May. I call the hotel to get it straightened out. At first they weren't trying to refund me because they didn't think it was their error. After a few threatening calls, however, they realized they had messed up and refunded my money. It was just an inconvenience and unprofessional to charge me for something I had already paid, and then do it more than 6 months later.

The front desk recommended a few places, but advised us to use the free hotel car that will transport guests anywhere within a 3 mile radius. We felt like walking, although in retrospect, should have taken the car. But hey, it's LA, and we should have thought more carefully about that before we booked.

The desk clerk was very helpful, the valet staff was fast and friendly, and the cleaning staff did a nice job as well. I can see why tourists would be skeptical about staying in downtown LA. While it's not in the trendiest part of town, the Omni offers a great rate and is close to the airport and major highways. The downtown area can feel empty on the weekends but restaurants are opened and we were able to find places to satisfy us as well as the children.

Got a taxi (the hotel towncar was busy) to a nearby restaurant (Drago's...yum!) for dinner, and then a shuttle from the restaurant to the Ahmanson to see Les Mis. ( Many of the nearby hotels offer shuttle service to the theaters) After the show, we noticed that there wasn't a taxi stand nearby, so we called the hotel, and they sent the towncar to pick us up. I had mentioned that it was my birthday, and when we got back to the hotel around 11:30p.m., we found that in addition to a lovely turndown service, someone had delivered a \"Happy Birthday\" mini raspberry cheesecake..what a treat! Morning beverage service was right on time, and we were given a late check out of 1pm. Did not use the pool, but it looked wonderful. Breakfast at the cafe was good, and on the weekends, valet parking is only $20. All in all, a wonderful experience...thank you, I'll be back!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "D_Ross_Bradley", "ReviewID": "UR115762182", "Content": "Currently on my penultimate day at this hotel of a 4 night stay (waiting for a conference call to start and thought I would right a review). This is a fantastic hotel right in the middle of downtown LA and certainly lives up to its 4 star rating and most certainly not a 4 star price for the location. I am a solo traveller, I started my LA visit in long beach for a conference and did not want to rent a car during my stay downtown as I hate driving in other countries particularly when own my own without a local guide. The hotel itself is very clean, rooms have all the required amenities; - descent wireless - free if you join their reward scheme (which is also free and can be done when your there) - in room safe - which is fundamental for any international traveller but very few hotel in LA seem to have them - a proper power shower (not a stupid bath/shower low power thing), a bath as well - maybe I was on a \"quiet floor\" but I never heard any noise from the adjoining rooms or hallway. - high taste/standard of food in the restaurant - Starbucks in the hotel on the 3rd floor, which is always good - All the staff are super friendly and very polite - from the reception, concierge to cleaning crew. The hotel and surrounding area feels very safe at night with a high visibility of security staff - not sure if these are hotel security or from the california plaza in which the hotel is located. Some eateries located on the plaza just outside the hotel, during the weekend there was some live bands in the plaza which was great and quite a diverse sound on each of the nights. Also the angels flights which is pretty impressive is located on the plaza and worth checking out - particularly if you have read the book by Michael Connelly. One of the friendly staff pointed out the bench from 500 days of summer which is visible from the hotel ( haven't seen the movie so I don't know if this is a big deal or not) Walt disney concert hall is visible from all rooms on one side of the hotel (2 min walk) and the museum of contemporary art is just outside the hotel plaza entrance - worth checking out even if you are not an art guru. This hotel is a 2 minute walk from the civic centre metro (red line) - which is a great way to check out many of the sites without a car - which is not required.

I understand that it was recently renovated and it is really lovely. The service here is exceptional - from the ground floor staff to the concierge and others in the Club level lounge to the servers in the Grand Cafe. We were told that the downtown area has improved markedly over the past 5 years. The hotel's proximity to LA Live, the Staples Center, the Disney Concert hall and its next door neighbor, the Museum of Contemporary Art, make it a desireable property. And the fact that it offers a free car service within 3 miles is a real bonus. We stayed on a Club level because it seemed to be great value for money and it turned out to be so. The room and bathroom were very spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. The breakfast at the Club lounge was delicious and more than sufficient and even offered hot food - the french toast was perfect as were the pancakes. The Club lounge was a lovely place to just sit and read the paper in the morning or have a drink in the afternoon. We loved it! The fitness center is an adequate size and had equipment that I like to use. There are elliptical machines, bikes, recumbent bikes and treadmills as well as weight machines and free weights. I would have liked a rowing machine, but I get the sense that rowing machines are not that popular these days in general, so I wasn't entirely surprised or disappointed that there wasn't one there. The one thing that it lacked that I really wished it had was a bigger area for stretching, but everything else made up for this.The pool also isn't enormous, but is a very good size and enjoyable to sit around. Overall, it is a really wonderful property, especially if you have a car so that you can get to places like Hollywood, West Hollywood and Beverly Hills. But, there is a lot to do here as well, as Sunday, the Club Lounge concierge so helpfully pointed out. She also recommended many restaurants near by and we went to El Cholo. Her enthusiasm for the area around the hotel was truly infectious. If you are in LA between May and October, I would highly recommend El Cholo's Green Corn Tamales.

When I called them to tell them about my mistake and get my room back or get credit, Hotels.com said I had to get permission from Omni. The Omni said I had to get permission from Hotels.com. This started 3 days of hell trying to call Omni and Hotels.com trying to get my room or money back 3 weeks before my reservation!

She spoke to someone else to translate for her since I could not understand her. No other rooms available with 2 beds, fine whatever that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what i reserved. 2. valet guy couldn't speak English either and it's $30. 3. 845am after long night I was working on a spreadsheet quietly trying not to wake the 2 girls in my bed smoking a cigarette in the smoking room i requested. Then some idiot starts banging on my door demanding i let him in, claiming to be security. I told him I was naked and he demanded I open the door, then I had to wake the 2 girls up and make them put on their clothes too so this idiot could come in to tell me i can't smoke. He couldn't tell me that outside the room so I did not disturb the ladies? Needless to say, he freaked then out so much this morning was not as happy as I had hoped it would have been. 3. the printer didn't work and that was a selling point on this hotel so I had to go to kinkos. Of course, no one at the hotel knew what to do or could bring me a replacement. 4. Never offered key for mini bar, I wanted drink went to open it it was locked called down to front desk lady had to transfer me to operator who was putting me on hold and going back and forth to get me answers. Which was she screwed up so I decided they did not deserve the extra revenue and drank bad LA tap water.

Before we got to the hotel, I made sure to sign up for their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSelect Guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 program. When we got there, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait to check in, as we were able to use Express Check-in already had our card and mini bar key nicely packaged, waiting for us to collect it. As a Select Guest, we got a complimentary bottle of water on our first night. We also got to order morning beverages of our choice, and we had pots of hot chocolate and coffee and small bottles of water delivered to our room, free of charge. It was a nice touch to enjoy those as we were getting dressed to head out for the day. The entire hotel is very trendy and chic. The room was beautiful, with a beautiful view of downtown LA. The bathroom is quite spacious with a separate bath tub and shower enclosure. The hotel has an excellent location as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within walking distance to restaurants and attractions such as the Staples Centre and the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live. It is also within walking distance of the Metro Station and it is easily accessible by buses as well. We ordered room service one night cause we were feeling too tired to go down to the restaurant. They were very prompt and told us within 30 minutes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get our food, and it came exactly on time. The waiter actually brought an entire table into the room, so we were able to comfortably eat! It also shows you how very spacious the room is! The food was extremely good. On our second night, we had drinks in the No\u00c3\u00ab Bar. The Bar had a wonderful ambience, service was excellent, and again, the food was amazing. Throughout our stay, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We asked a staff member at the check-in counter about getting around in the city, as we were prepared to use the public bus. However, she advised us against that and instead recommended that we use the Dash as that was much safer. She even gave us a timetable so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d know how to plan our trip and recommended that we use the complimentary town car to get around to nearby places. We were able to take the town car to get a lift across to the Metro Station, in order to take the train to Hollywood. The driver gave us a business card with his name and the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number for us to call him upon our return, so that he could come back and pick us up. The valet was also so friendly that he offered to take some pictures of us both outside and inside the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobby. Overall, our entire stay was fantastic. It was our first trip to LA and staying at the Omni Hotel gave us a true flavour of what the city is all about. The hotel had all these little touches that made you feel very special. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that you would expect to get at a more expensive hotel, but yet you get it for a very affordable rate. If you have to go to LA, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d highly recommend that you stay at the Omni.

Called the front desk and it took them 15-20 min to bring upstairs, which was much longer than expected. Bathroom: One bathtub and one shower, which I thought was very cool. The tissue box had some sort of nice setup of tissues on top, but once I took those off there was two tissues left on inside the box. This wasn't an issue until I needed them to blow my nose later in the evening. The bathroom is very clean and bright. Pool: The pool was pretty small and I think it was 3' 6\" deep. After seeing the pool I walked away in my swimming trunks back to the room. It's understandable that hotels in downtown LA don't have the space for large pools. Lounge/concierge access: Well worth the extra cost! At 5-9 there are wines, beers, and spirits available. It's open bar so you can drink to your hearts content while relaxing in a large clean room with a nice view outside. The wine tasted okay, there was whiskey, vodka, and congac. Those basically cover my three favorite spirits. They had Heineken, Sapporo, and Corona. There was plenty of munchies to go along with all the alcohol. If you like to drink and relax then opt for this package. Service: For some reason I didn't like the front desk service. I wasn't greeted properly when checking in or checking out. Sort of felt robotic to me and I was almost offended that I didn't get the same greeting as the gentleman in front of me. It was almost as if my age or race had something to do with the level of service I would receive. On the other hand the valet staff and doorman was very friendly. I stayed here instead of at the Kimpton because I chatted with their online rep. She managed to convince me to give Omni a try, which I did and was a bit disappointed at their level of service. I understand that it was valentines day and it might be busy, but I stayed at the Hilton Huntington beach last Valentines day and the service was as good as any other day. Will I stay here again? It's hard to say no because the value was very good, but what turns me off was service, which I less than what I expected from the number one rated hotel in Downtown Los Angeles.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cConvenience and comfort merit return trip\u201d", "Author": "Phoebe059", "ReviewID": "UR56245063", "Content": "The downtown location next to the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Disney Concert Hall was superb.

There is an abundance of safe, cheap , and accessible public transporation around, including a shuttle passing the convention center ( 10 minute trip). Gary was more than helpful finding out bus and train info for us.

I thought the room was very clean and that housekeeping was unobtrusive and excellent. Even though I booked through a discount site (Priceline) I never felt slighted in any way. The loyalty program was available and we got an excellent room. This is not always the case with other chains where I've gotten obviously smaller rooms or poor room locations. The only difference is you don't get loyalty points and this is fair and clearly stated. Tips. Book when there is no major convention at the convention center and you can bid aggressively on price. On weekends it's easy to find nearby parking inexpensively. The valet service is very quick and during the week it is probably the best if you want in and out privileges. I thought the downtown was very walkable to Little Tokyo, Union Station, Macy's, and the Staples Center. If you walk south, ie Staples Center, be sure and find the Bunker Hill steps and use the escalator coming back up hill. MOCA was nice and we had a free guided tour. The room full of Rothko's was worth the $10 admission. Don't pay more than $40 for seats at Dodger Stadium, The upper decks behind home plate are great seats.

Also there was a huge bowl of apples which you could help yourself to. There were 4 elevators so we only ever waited seconds each time. The rooms themselves were spacious , as was the bathroom. The room we had was well appointed overlooking the courtyard with the water fountain. The courtyard adjoining the hotel grounds has lots little food shops where there's a good selection to suit most tastes. Very handy for breakfast.

In the evening you can sit outside in the terrace area and the staff will offer to light the fires for you and they always stopped for a chat. We found them to be polite, courteous and genuinely friendly. If you have a hired car, the valet parking charges at the hotel can add quite a bit to your final bill, so you can opt to park in one of the numerous open air car parks which are nearby and easily accessable although they do not operate an in/out same day system. The concierge will gladly arrange for the complimentary hotel car to take you anyway within 3 miles . There is a good sized fitness centre which leads you through to the pool area which is fairly small but usually empty most days so that's not really a problem. Although the hotel is within easy walking distance of the shops at garment and toy districts, be aware that it is up a fairly steep hill so going is fine but coming back can be a bit tiring but certainly keeps you fit.

The room is pretty standard, with your typical hotel furnishings; the bed was very comfortable. The only two off-notes during my stay: usually at this price range you get a flat-screen TV these days, but here the TV was a regular TV, with only ok picture quality. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch it much, so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem for me. As another reviewer mentioned, the room had a bit of a sour smell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overpowering, but I wonder whether it was time to replace the carpet. Other than that though, everything was very clean and well-maintained. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the restaurant, but a breakfast buffet was included in my room rate. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over the top, but they offered a good variety of breads, cereals, fresh fruit, and tasty hot dishes, including made to order eggs. The bar offers a happy hour from 4-6 pm, with discounted bar menu. Even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order food, the drinks come with complimentary peanuts (regular and wasabi), which were delicious and a nice touch. As with the rest of the hotel staff, the servers were excellent. An extra bonus is the fitness center. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to hotels cramming a few pieces of equipment in a mirrored room and calling it a gym. At the Omni, the fitness room is large enough to fit several machines while still leaving space to walk around. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also well-stocked with towels, water, and even headsets for the individual TVs on the equipment. I was not expecting such a nice space. There is an outdoor pool as well. Budget $30/night plus tips for parking (valet), but honestly that seems to be the going rate at downtown hotels. I had no problems getting my car quickly when needed. There were some commercial parking lots nearby, but I preferred the convenience of having the car located on site. Which brings me to the location. Downtown L.A. is ok and has a few cultural attractions to see, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s somewhat desolate (especially at night). There is a small shopping center / food court adjacent to the hotel, but it's mainly busy at lunchtime. So you will probably find yourself leaving the area pretty frequently, because much of the sightseeing, shopping and dining is located well outside downtown. There are buses and subway lines within a block or two, and the hotel provides a courtesy car that will take you within 3 miles of the hotel, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not absolutely necessary to have a car. But, as someone who strongly prefers to walk and rely on public transportation, I have reluctantly found it necessary to rent a car for any stays longer than a couple of days in L.A. Most of my trips to L.A. are for business though, so the downtown location was still convenient for me. If I were on vacation for beaches and shopping, I might choose to stay somewhere else, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no knock on the Omni itself, which is an excellent hotel.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Il", "Title": "\u201cBad management\u201d", "Author": "webbit64", "ReviewID": "UR35613884", "Content": "I stayed at the Omni in downtown LA on a recent business trip.

The attractions of the beaches and Hollywood are certainly some way away but buses and metro are both within 5 minutes walk and will deposit you onto Hollywood Boulevard inside 25-30 minutes. The Downtown district is full of architectural interest and highly impressive. Views from the top of the City Hall are splendid, a free treat that is often overlooked by visitors. Also nearby is the fantastic Union Station, with trains out to the valley towns. True that nearby Pershing Square and Skid Row are filled with transients after dark and are a bit challenging, but trains to Civic Centre metro stop bypass all of that and provide a more comfortable 5 minute walk to the hotel.

As a member of their loyalty program, we were able to snag their BOGO night promotion. So, value wise, it was well worth it. Check in time was 3 PM, and we arrived around 5ish. No one was at the Valet when we arrived, so we had to wait for a few minutes before someone noticed us and greeted us. Not a good start, I must say. But since the Valet guy was so nice, I let it go. Check in took literarily 1 second. We went up to the check in desk, they asked for our name, we didn't have to wait, our room keys were already waiting. Again, we got certain perks for being a member. I highly recommend signing up for this. I'm a member of a few hotel loyalty programs, but so far, I must say, Omni has the best perks for their members, which include complimentary internet, two complimentary beverages each morning delivered to our room at requested time. We got *almost* everything we requested for: extra pillows, extra towels, extra hangers, slippers, high floor, etc etc. One thing they didn't get right was we had requested for New York Times, but got the local paper instead. Although the Mr. wasn't happy about it, it wasn't a big deal to me. Speaking of slippers, we only received one pair, even though it's indicated there would be two people staying. Again, not really a huge deal. The room was a good size. The bathroom was quiet big too: a tub and standing shower--not sure if this was available in all rooms. We had stayed here previously and we only had a tub in the room. While it's a nice comfy room, it does show its age quiet a bit. The sofa (see picture) in the room looked really old and dirty. Perhaps it's the color that makes it look unattractive. The TV was one of those tube-kind which I don't see in hotels this caliber anymore. It's not a big deal really, except the remote control needed to be replaced. We had to really push down to get it to register. It was a real problem, when we were checking out. We always opt out for TV check out whenever it's available. They didn't have a keyboard so we had to use remote control to type in our email address for the receipt to get sent to us. It took me about 5 mins to get one email address typed in. The Mr. had a chance to use the Fitness center. Good machine selections, although he had trouble with the TV turning off by itself a couple times. One thing that really annoyed me personally was on the first day, the room service that kept on knocking on our doors even though we had the privacy sign up. Location wise, it's not really that close to anything except concert halls. But again, it's very difficult to navigate around LA without transportation, so it's not really the hotel's fault. Just warning to people who may not be familiar with LA that this hotel is not a walking distance to anything exciting. If you do drive, be aware of the $30/night valet parking charge.

(And our friends who stayed elsewhere were!) The room and bathroom were very clean, beds and pillows, were very comfortable, and service was very polished and professional. We joined the Select Guest program and received complimentary wireless internet and breakfast beverages (coffee and/or juice delivered to the room every morning -- a classy touch). The concierge (Amy) provided outstanding and highly professional service (from restaurant reservations -- we just started calling her from anywhere in the city when we were ready for dinner and she would recommend a restaurant for our needs at the moment and make us a reservation -- to phoning us before our arrival to let us know that a package had arrived and was being held for us.) The complementary fruit water in public places, and the on-demand courtesy sedan service (a late model Cadillac driven by very polite bellmen) that will take you short distances for a tip just completed the experience for us. The staff was so nice that we could easily overlook as comical that no matter what newspaper we checked off on our door hanging request each night, we still got the USA Today; that despite our trying four times, they never could get the second guest name into the reservation record in a way that the next person could find it; that the front desk staff told us that the Convention Center was at least 3 miles away and that there was no way we could walk there (it's about a mile and a half and it takes 30 minutes to walk); and that although we were given the complementary breakfast beverage door hanging signs, colleagues in three other rooms who also joined the Select Guest program were not given them until they asked for them part-way into their stay. Also, we wished they had shown a little more eco-friendliness (things like the plastic cups for one-time use with the fruit water and replacing our towels even if we left them hanging in the bathroom, etc.) Tips: 1) The taxi drivers who line up in front of the hotel can be rather expressive in their displeasure at being asked to take you what they consider to be short distances -- i.e., 2 mile, $10 fares; use the hotel sedan if you're not going far and save yourself being publicly berated... I recognize this is not the hotel's fault; it's probably why they offer the sedan service, but if they could solve this problem which at least 5 colleagues experienced during our week in town, it would really improve the guest experience. 2) Grand Central Market is a block away and is not to be missed for cheap eats and a colorful experience!", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cFront Desk Needs More Smile\u201d", "Author": "SKW66", "ReviewID": "UR31176255", "Content": "Got a good deal at Omni through Priceline.

I once called the front desk and I could hear the 'sigh' from the other end when he picked up the phone. Even though my issue was solved but seriously, people could hear whether the other party is smiling or not through the phone. Or may be I might just need to accept that the quality of service would be slightly discounted if I got a great deal from Hotwire/Priceline. Shower area only has room for one person - compared to the spacious room, this is disproportionately small! There was one night when there was a jet of water shot out from the shower and hit right above the shower glass door to the wall outside. This made the toilet paper all soaked and I had been glad that this did not ruin the TV speaker. But there was already a pond of water right outside the shower area. (But I like the TV speaker feature in the toilet - quite interesting! but it would be great to include the monitor as well - they might take reference from the Four Seasons in Hong Kong!) Room Choice: Since I booked this hotel through priceline, even though I have then joined their Select Guest program, I was not assigned to the King Bed room that I preferred. I had to call the next day to check but luckily I got to be transfered to another room on the same floor. Double room - smaller bathroom area: there was not enough space around the sink for 2 people's stuff. King room - bigger bathroom area: other than this, every thing else was the same. Be careful if you take snack from the mini bar as some of them are expired... TV As a 4-star hotel, it is really a wonder why the TV set is still CRT but not LCD. I've stayed in several Asian hotels (both small local and big international 3-4 star) and all of them had LCD TV in their rooms!! I don't understand why this is not the same in the states from the three 3-4 star hotels that I've stayed in in recent years. LCD TV makes the room looks much much much bigger without this huge CRT set in the middle of the room and it makes the whole in-room design style more modern, isn't it?

And there was a big cloud of flies at the waiting area in the entrance!! Quite disgusting... One of the managers, though, was able to pick up my dissatisfaction and offered to take at least a night's valet charge off my bill - which is done more than what I expected!

I told the driver I would be ready to return to the hotel at 11:15 and he picked me up at the restaurant on schedule. The restaurant and the town car service were great. And if you have not heard of the Pacific Dining Car restaurant-it has been in downtown LA for some 60 years . It is about 1.2 miles from the Omni.

I chose the Omni because I wanted a hotel in (reasonable) walking distance of the conference, and I found a very competitive rate through an online hotel broker. I was traveling with one colleague, and we had a room with two double beds. Our room was very spacious and well-appointed, with a large bathroom and extremely comfortable beds. The view was not spectacular-- 7th floor looking into more of downtown LA's corporate jungle. Lots of channels on the TV. Complimentary coffee and tea in the room (though re-stocking of this was very haphazard-- they kept giving us more and more decaf, and no regular coffee, and forgetting to leave cream-- I should have left notes to remind them). Room temperature was excellent and easy to control. The hotel guide said that our room would include bathrobes, but there were none, and I didn't bother calling the desk to have them sent up. The room was very quiet-- I heard no noise from neighbors and little from traffic. Colleagues staying nearby at the Millennium Biltmore, the Westin Bonaventure, and the Wilshire Grand all commented that they thought my room at the Omni seemed much larger and nicer than their rooms. The health/fitness center: I used this facility and was pleased by the amount and variety of equipment. The description of the center in our hotel guide stated that complimentary fresh fruit would be provided there, but I never saw any (only water, and once, small packets of almonds). Problem: on the first night, I arrived in the room to discover the shower handle broken off and was sitting on the floor. I immediately called, and a maintenance person came, \"fixing\" the problem after about 30 minutes of work. The shower remained very stiff and difficult to turn far enough to get much hot water, and I feared that it would break off again (but it didn't). I wish I had insisted that they move me to a different room altogether. Annoying, but not a major problem on the whole. Parking: Valet parking in the hotel garage was $30 per night, meaning that I paid more on parking my rental car than I spent on the car itself. However, I noticed that nearby hotels were charging $35 and $40, so I suppose I was lucky. The parking attendants were friendly and always retrieved my car very promptly when I needed to go out, with the exception of the final morning, which was VERY concerning. I was anxious to beat morning rush hour traffic to get to the airport, and that was the one occasion when they goofed and took half an hour to find my car. Not cool. Business services: wireless internet in-room costs $10 per day-- a bit steep. I think it's odd how budget hotels like the Comfort Inn routinely offer free wireless, and 4-star places make you pay a fortune. However, I paid anyway, and it was reliable. When you're 24 hours runs out, it switches off until you renew, so be warned, or you might lose work. The business center in the lobby charged $6.95 per hour to use its computer terminals. I needed to print some documents there, and when I saw what the cost would be, I went to Kinko's 4 blocks away and did all my printing for $1.50 instead. Business Center = major rip-off!! Downtown LA: unless you're attending a conference or have a specific reason to be downtown, DON'T stay in this part of the city. I had no choice. I found the LA Convention Center rather far (half-hour walk), but there are no hotels actually near the Convention Center, so this problem is unavoidable. There were very few eating options or convenience stores open at night in this area-- the Famina adjacent to the hotel closed at 8:30 or 9pm, I think. Others told me that it was dangerous to walk around at night. This is not the hotel's fault, of course, but be warned-- there's nothing in downtown LA. I'm glad that I had a rental car and was able to drive elsewhere to find food. On the whole, if I absolutely HAD to stay in downtown LA again, I would definitely return to the Omni. However, if I could find any excuse to stay in another part of the city, I would avoid the downtown altogether.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glencoe, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cStill the choice for Bunker Hill\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoLawyer1", "ReviewID": "UR25549296", "Content": "Solid if unspectacular 3.5-4 star hotel in the best of Bunker Hill locales, across street from KPMG/Wells Fargo, just down the street from MOCA and Disney Hall ,on highest spot in downtown LA.

The desk clerk was very helpful and readily upgraded our room to one with a loverly view of the water feature in California Plaza. The hotel's location was great for us! As hotel food and drink can be pricey, the Plaza had several restaurants and a Starbucks, as well a a mini-mart with prepared foods. There were tables outside by the water feature to enjoy coffee or read a book. Everyone we passed, greeted us! The check-in clerk greeted me by name every time I passed.......great memory! The valet parking is pricey, but there were at least 8 people out front opening doors and greeting guests as they parked cars. The room was clean and well appointed with both tub and separate shower. We were impressed with the hotel's restaurant Noe for evening cocktails. There was piano music and a relaxing vibe.

The hotel has a complimentary Limo for trips up to 3 miles The parking is expensive at $30 per night but for a short stay have a snack in the cafe and get your ticket stamped it then costs $5 for 2 hours.... plus your snack.

Very quick and much better than Taxis.

Eat this at the tables in the square outside - brilliant while watching the fountains and birdlife. Restaurants are not special and can be expensive as is the wine but do try the exception, Engine Co #28 in Figueroa St just 10 mins walk for a truly 'american food experience' at reasonable prices and a decent pint called Firestone.

When we checked in we were given a backpack of toys for my daughter. All good. Oh, and our rate included complementary valet parking (normally $30 per night). The only problem was that when we called the front desk last night at 9PM to ask about the circling helicopter a couple blocks away, we were informed that it was due to a movie being filmed (500 Days of Summer was being filmed in the park right outside the hotel during the day). Luckily, we decided not to go check it out, because it was actually the POLICE looking for a SNIPER shooting from another hotel into the street.

Very quick and easy. The room was very large, with bed, armchair + ottoman, desk, and a couch, as well as the obligatory TV/minibar armoir unit.

For a hotel that is based around business people the internet connection and cell reception was terrible. We spoke to hotel staff about this and they said yes it is pretty bad at times. Also another negative was that there was one terrible conierge at this hotel. He told us he didnt know the area that well and he also stuffed up a hire car booking we had made thru him. However there is a very capable female concierge there whom saved us on a couple of occasions. The location is okay once you figure out where you are and where everything else is but it was daunting at first. Overall the hotel is very nice one of the nicest we stayed in, but just wasnt for us.", "Date": "February 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended downtown hotel\u201d", "Author": "augieray", "ReviewID": "UR13922305", "Content": "We had a very pleasant five-night stay at the Omni.

Here are a few of our comments: Transportation: You can take a Super Shuttle from the airport, just go outside by the taxi area and look for the guys in the red and blue jackets. The ride is only $15 per person. On the way back we took a cab ($42 flat rate plus tip) because we were in a rush, but the shuttle is also available from the hotel. We also took the metro (located a few blocks from the Omni) to Hollywood which was a little scary, I would definitely not take it after dark but is a cheap way to get around. Service: My husband and I both agree that we have never experienced such remarkable service as at the Omni! They are unbelievably helpful, friendly and professional. We never stood in the lobby for more than 1 minute without someone politiely asking to help! They were super helpful with any question or request we had. EXCELLENT! Rooms/Hotel Quality: The lobby is beautiful and the hotel is overall extremely clean and well kept. Our only complaint was the lack of counter space in the bathrooms (pretty tight for 2 people and all of our toiletries/hair dryer/etc..) But the bed is wonderful and comfortable and the rooms are very attractive. There is no refrigerator (only the mini bar) so we had to put our wine over ice which was fine. Dining/Location: We only ate at the Grand Cafe at the hoel for breakfast which was very good. We ate dinner at the restaurants in the Plaza which is adjacent to the hotel, both of which were very nice (steak restaurant was more expensive but good). There are also several stores in the plaza to buy snacks, coffee (Starbuck's) etc... which is convenient. We heard that room service was also excellent, but was a little on the pricey side.

The food ordered off the menu was above average but the SERVICE was HORRIBLE! I had to leave the table, after requesting a coffee refill four times, to find someone who would bring us more coffee.

It is in a way true but it makes up for the lack of action through its proximity to public transportation. The Pershing Square train station is just two blocks away from the hotel, an easy walk.

There's not a convenience store within walking distance so if you need to fill up the bar with your own stock, plan ahead. Service can be cold and impersonal but I expected that from a chain hotel.

I booked on Expedia with a good rate about 3 months before my stay. A few days before arriving, I was checking the Omni website for WiFi access and learned there is a charge of $9.95/day. But, if you sign up for \"Select Guest\" which is free and create a profile with your likes/dislikes, you get WiFi access for free as well as 2 morning drinks (oj, v8, etc....) and a daily paper of your choice. Also, if you book with the hotel, you can check in \"Online\" as long as give at least a two hour notice you are coming. Since I booked on Expedia, I could not do this. On arrival, check in was quick. You can only valet park which is $26/night. I got my requested high floor corner room on the 15th floor with a decent view. The room itself is a bit dated. The carpet showed signs of wear with stains. \"Build Up\" was around the shower door. The bathtub had a layer of sediment (or dirt) in it but, since it was late at night and I knew I would not use it (I used the separate shower), I just put a note the next morning to inform the staff the bathtub was \"dirty.\" The TV is standard tube TV with a good representation of channels including HBO. The honor bar was well stocked and is a traditonal \"dorm fridge\" which I like since you can put your own things in it if you want (I just hate the new wave of honor bars that use motion sensors so you can't move anything or put in your own stuff). The big plus was the bed. It was very comfortable and pillows large and soft. On my first night, turndown service was not done. Turn down service was done for the second night. Each morning, I received two drinks and the LA Times left at my door which I specificed on the Select Guest door hanger. WiFi service in this hotel is very spotty both in my room and during my conference. In my room, it seemed like I had to sit a certain way in a specific part of the room to get a solid connection. Anywhere else, it would drop. For my conference, some areas had excellent connection rates while others had none which frustrated several attendees. But, for me the main focus was on my room and it was terrible. Although many rave about the location, I found it to be the complete opposite. There is really not much around the hotel within walking distance. I walked a four block radius and saw nothing in terms of good food, bars, etc... Looking out my window I could see the 110 freeway and of course, it's a parking lot at 5-6pm so, although I knew I could get somewhere in my car it was not worth the headaches to get it out of valet and fight traffic knowing I could only be out a few hours at most. But, the hotel bar; Noe, is really nice and they did have a small menu which I had dinner which was decent but, pricy. Check out was quick and easy but, I was not honored with a \"late check out.\" My conference was all day until 5pm and lunch was after the check out time of 12:00. Having an extra hour would have been nice. But, I was able to give my suitcase to valet and they put it in my car. At the end of day, getting my car leave took a bit of time but, that was expected since everyone who attended the same conference as me was leaving as well as there were other meeting events ending which made a small bottleneck in getting out of the hotel.

It has 2 restraunts, one for breakfast and lunch (which I thought was a little pricey, for example, I had a cappachino and a belgum waffle for $15!!) and they have another restraunt (Japense fusion), smaller selection of food and again pretty pricey considering you could order the Chef's special and spend $100 a person (yikes).

I am \"very\" particular about where I lay my head and I wanted to have the best for our getaway without breaking the bank.

The beds, well, let's just say that some of us wanted to stay just to sleep in the \"heavenly\" bed just one more time. The beds are big, fluffy with lots of pillows and ultra comfortable. The room service was excellent and very timely. A few of us ate at the Noe Restaurant in the Hotel on the first night, granted it is \"very\" pricey, but you get what you pay for. The service was par excellent and the food was wonderful. The swimming pool is a little small and there is no jacuzzi...I did not get an opportunity to visit the Spa, but the prices were quite high. The next day some of us ate in the Cafe, which was very nice and the food had a really nice flare to it. The location was perfect for us as we planned to go shopping at the Garment District which was a few blocks away. There aren't many places open around the Hotel during the weekend, but right outside the door of the hotel, there is a Day Spa where some of us went and had manicures and pedicures and there is also a Starbuck's that stays open on the weekends. In the same area right outside the Hotel in a Plaza there is nightly entertainment, i.e. bands, etc. And of course, you have the Museums and Disney Concert Music Hall right near the Hotel that is also open on the weekend. The Hotel is close to the freeways and Saturday evening some of us went to the Universal City Walk for dinner and fun, which was about 20 minutes away. The Hotel has a courtesy Town Car to take you and pick you up from anywhere within a 3 mile radius. The Valet was steep at $28/night, but there is no other place to park, oh well.....All in all, this is a great place to stay and the only place that I will stay when in downtown Los Angeles....I have stayied in downtown L.A. several times in the past and the other Hotels cannot hold a candle to the Omni....I have already booked another stay with them next month.

Took advantage of a $119 per night weekend rate to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary. * Check-in/Check-out: The quickest, most efficient I've ever experienced anywhere in the world. Check-in was online a few days before our arrival. Our key, etc. was in an envelope ready for us to pick up from a predetermined area the moment we stepped into the hotel. We practically didn't stop from the front door to the elevator! Check-out was just as efficient--drop-off box for the keys, bill already paid. Our package included parking, which saved us $28 per night. The hotel inadvertently charged us for the two nights we stayed, but they promptly reimbursed us with no hassles when we pointed out the mistake. We appreciated this VERY much! * Service: Friendly, always well-meaning staff, who ocassionally lacked attention to detail but attended to us quickly and efficiently. * Perks: The hotel surprised us by upgrading us to \"Club Level\", which included an expanded continental breakfast, cocktail hour and a relaxing lounge with nice views from the 17th floor. Additionally, the hotel surprised us with a hand-typed note acknowledging our anniversary, and left us a $45 bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries on our first night. Nice touches! * Transportation: We had our own car, but didn't use it since we hung around the vicinity of the hotel the entire time. The Omni offers their town car for transport to any site within a three mile radius of the hotel--very convenient. We used a combination of walking (difficult at times because places are widespread or not easily accessible because of overpasses, underpasses and steep inclines), the towncar and a taxi (once). * Exercise Room and Pool: Average--gets the job done. Some of the equipment needed repair. Hallway to this area is somewhat dreary. * Spa: Had an \"ultimate facial\", which included a hand, foot and shoulder area massage. Average for the $150 (with tip) fee. My usual facial back home is $60 (with tip) and is much superior in quality. * Gift shop was under rennovation. Needed lip balm, which the front desk sold to me for $2. * Room: Clean, somewhat dated (early 1990s?) and well kempt. Smallish window with a decent view on the 16th floor. * Neighborhood: Except for the California Plaza (where the Omni is located), the downtown area is not an easy walk. The Disney Music Hall and gift shop, MOCA (Museum of Modern Art) and its gift shop, and the L.A. Music Center, however, are easily accessible on foot. We've been to many big cities around the world, and the only people wandering the streets in L.A. seem to be a few homeless. The throngs of tourists and locals were mostly absent--something were not used to--since the presence of many people is the usual when visiting other big cities. This downtown area is relatively clean. * Entertainment: Expect a quiet downtown (on the weekends at least) and a low-key \"night life\". Fortunately, the L.A. Film Festival featured a documentary film at the California Plaza Saturday night, so we spontaneously attended this event and participated in the discussion with the director of the film and one of the key historical figures from the film afterward. Very cool. TIPS * Check out any specials and packages directly on Omni's website. * At the Club Level: Eat breakfast as early as possible; it gets crowded 45-minutes after they begin serving. * Reserve for dinner, excursions and activities before arriving at the Omni. It makes your weekend getaway run more smoothly and efficiently. * Suggested activities: Watch a play (which is what we did), listen to a concert or take in one of several cultural experiences offered. Check out local listings for nearby events. OVERALL: An excellent value for the money!

The service was fantastic from doormen, valet, front desk, to housekeeping. The rooms were super clean, nice marble floors, super comfy beds, very white clean towels/linen. Pool was small, but your in the middle of the city. I was in Room 617 which didn't get as much sun as room 627 due to the buildings. But if you want a bigger room for the same price get rooms ending in 45... like 645. It overlooks the pool & has much more space due to the location. The only disappointment was the banquet service during the wedding, it was terrible. The banquet servers ignored your requests, just wanted to get in/out & do thier job regardless of customer service. The bar is nice with fantastic bartenders, pianoman, & servers. There is a 'public' international marketplace close by for fast food (chinese, mexican, japanese, thai, etc.) The Wells Fargo Plaza also offers CPK & other eateries. The Italian restaurant in the courtyard of the Omni was just ok. Overall, the inside of the hotel was much nicer than the outside, the hotel service was fantastic (excluding banquet service). I would stay here again. We booked through Fly n Stay for cheaper rates, but some rooms booked through this site had major problems. When they checked in, the Omni asked for Vouchers. The Omni wanted to charge them AGAIN for the room even though it was prepaid through Fly n Stay. This was a bit of a bummer. So if you don't book directly with the hotel, call to confirm your reservations. The hotel is close to the fashion district, chinatown, & the jewelery district.

It was hard to get a good look at the outside of the hotel because we were never standing that far back. Inside, I enjoyed the modern Asian inspired flower arrangements. We found the hotel to be located centrally to the things we wanted to do. Driving to the J. Paul Getty museum, a trip to the Griffith Observatory, walking to the fashion district and dining in Beverly Hills. The staff was courteous upon our arrival and we were efficiently checked into our room. I was a bit nervous because we had a voucher purchased through a discount travel company listed on TripAdvisor. There were no problems and it turned out it was just a really good deal. The hotel is located across from the MOCA and within the California Plaza. We wandered the plaza and found the nearby water features to be very nice, a great spot to sit in the morning with coffee. In general the area was nice although if walking there is an underpass I would suggest you skip walking under. I was surprised to see so many people walking in LA. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encounter any maintenance issues and the room was always made up before we returned for the day. The options for the minibar were numerous and predictably expensive. The bed while made up with layers of padding and soft sheets was so warn I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well many nights. All the padding over the mattress seemed to trap the heat and even with the air conditioning on cold the bed was too hot. This seems to be a common effect of the padding hotels are adding to their bedding. The complimentary toiletries were nice and the towels thick and absorbent. The tile on the floor of the shower was a sad small pale pink tile but overall the bathroom was nice. The counter had enough space, the lighting was bright enough and they even had a make-up mirror. The one thing I missed was a light in the closet. It was difficult to see my clothes after hanging them away. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the restaurant or the room service. We usually had coffee in the room before heading out for the day. We did use the complementary wireless Internet and the valet parking. I have no complaints with either. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn on the TV so I have no comment on that. The view was okay. We overlooked some modern art in the Plaza below. The fitness room was very nice. It was equipped with elliptical trainers, treadmills and stationary bikes for aerobic training. The also had Cybex machines and free weights for weight lifting. They had towels, water and headsets freely available in the room. A couple of the elliptical machines had TV monitors and there was a large plasma screen TV in the room. I noticed the lap pool outside the fitness room but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give it a try.

They immediately arranged to send a free mini-refrigerator to our room so we would have a place to chill the champagne we'd brought with us. Our room was spacious and the bed was exceptionally comfortable and quiet. As Select Guest members we get free coffee, orange juice and a paper delivered to our room in the morning (we used our champagne and the hotel's free orange juice to make mimosas). This was followed by the delicious buffet breakfast, included in our room rate. The hotel is next door to MOCA and virtually across the street from the Dorothy Chandler, Ahmanson Theater, the Opera etc. We are opera and theater buffs so this is a great base when we attend performances. Our experience last month was so terrific that we decided to return this weekend to enjoy the \"Show Must Go On\" package. The $229 room rate includes a $100 dining certificate to Noe, the restaurant located in the hotel, plus the breakfast buffet for two, a wine amenity, free town car service to and from the Dorothy Chandler and valet parking. All in all an amazing deal- break it down and the effective room rate is almost ridiculously low . I'm already impressed by the Omni for this trip because a couple of days ago I received a call from the concierge asking me if I wanted them to make dinner reservations at Noe so we could use our $100 dining certificate, and inquiring about whether we wanted red or white wine for the wine amenity.

The bellmen were very helpful and quick at this hotel. We used car or cab servcie every day and one nice bellman made sure we knew the flat fee or expected rate so the cab couldn't overcharge us. The lobby is small and centers around a strange glass atrium filled with a yellow iron sculpture resembling an animal. The orchids filling the vases at every turn are nice. The front desk is small but there was no line. There was a mixup with my reservation at first but it was quickly fixed. The clerk did not remember to inform me about the concierge lounge, however. My room was a good size with a great King Bed, lots of pillows, a chair with ottoman and a desk. The furnishing looked update and almost new, and the bedding was very nice. The TV was large but not a newer model. There was an open plug available (not under the bed) for electronics and a nice CD player/Alarm clock. The robes were nice, albeit huge. There is a mini-bar with pricey but attractive items like chocolates, nuts, spa products, even a cute little quote book and spray starch for your clothes ($3.95). There is an iron and ironing board in the room, which is nice. Although free pressing was included at the concierge level, they needed about 24 hours to complete it. I liked the bathroom, which had a separate bath and shower, and lovely toiletries. The towels were plentiful and plush, and there were two bath mats provided, which was nice. The marble vanity was a bit small for a woman's things, but there were a few tiny glass shelves and a nice magnifying mirror (you must stand to reach it). Lighting is good and there is a scale (!) in the bathroom. Water pressure was good and the bath/shower temp was nice (I liked the bath salts that were provided), but the sink wouldn't run hot water at all. There was also an interesting switch so you could listen to the TV in the bath without blasting it from the bedroom, but it didn't work consistently enough to be of much use. While it wasn't too hot or cold, I would have like my AC to work just a bit better - even if you set it for 60 degrees, it wouldn't go below 70. Room service was prompt but extremely expensive (+20% room service fee plus $2.50 delivery fee), as is the on-site restaurant , Noe. Food was nicely done and hot on arrival with everything that I requested. There is a bar/lounge where you can order the room service menu, but it really isn't much of a hotel restaurant and is hard to find on the third floor. There are small couches and tables in the hallway near the lounge if you have a group. There is a tiny, tiny gift shop at the back of the third floor. Don't rely on this for much more than a soda, snack or magazine, but the prices were fair. The concierge lounge is on the 17th floor and you must use your room card to access that floor. The breakfast spread was much more than I expected (eggs, sausage, oatmeal, pastries, fruit) and there is an internet alcove available for use. The huge plasma screen TV was a nice touch. One warning about the view from the hotel - there is an apartment building across the street and I noticed lots of tenants (men) who stood on their balconies at night, taking in the view of the hotel. Also, the window jutts out from the building (nice) almost like a balcony, but if you look right or left, you can see anyone standing in their window, and they can see you.

I booked the hotel via their website and used the 50% off coupon that was included with my \"select guest\" card package last year. When I arrived at the hotel, I was informed by the young desk clerk that I would not receive the parking ($26 a night) that was included in my $149 rate because I was using the discount. Then he stated I could not use the upgrade certificate with the discount either. I then asked to speak with the manager. Instead, he must have tried to confirm this himself as when he returned, he told me that I could use the upgrade certificate....but from my experience, this hotel doesn't really have upgraded rooms, other than the Club floor, which he refused to put us in unless I paid an extra $35 a night! I had already read on here of that upgrade being given for free and I declined. Upon opening the door of our room on the 14th floor, I noticed we were given a good size room with a king size bed , when I had reserved 2 double beds, non smoking. Then we were moved to another room on the same floor, this time a standard double room. I called downstairs and asked the manager why this room was considered an upgrade and she said it wasn't! So she moved us one more time! Wait it get's better.... On Saturday after a trip to the Fashion district, we called the hotel for the town car to pick us up, and only after 5 phone calls, several promises that the driver was on his way...1 hour later, he finally made it. I don't know if I would ever depend on that service again. Anyway, when we returned to our room, it had a very strong odor of cigarette smoke.

Next door, MOCA was presenting Night Vision (basically, the museum is open until 11:45pm and has a DJ, cocktail bar, and art station--mostly appealing to young adults). The breakfast spread was really good and had a station with a short order cook preparing fresh omelets, pancakes, and french toast. The only thing that might be bothersome to some people would be the noise generated by the concert and by MOCA. This did not bother us at all, but for those that need to get to bed early, it would be a good idea to request a room on the opposite sides of the hotel that don't overlook either of these venues.

I was able to walk from the hotel to both the Downtown Standard (for early morning coffee since it's open 24/7) and Little Tokyo (for dinner). The latter walk took us through a few blocks mostly comprised of parking lots, which my wife and daughter complained about mightily, but (on friday night) there were always at least some people around and no suggestion of danger. (We took a very short bus ride back). We also walked to a very pleasant cafe/wine bar--open 7 days--at 4th & Main in the Old Bank renovation project. The Omni is also literally adjacent to the main part of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) as well as the other atractions folks mentioned. The Omni is clean and quiet and smoothly functioning, almost unreal.

I thought only rich people could stay at these types of hotels, but with my luck I came across a deal for only $99/night at this really nice hotel for NEW YEARS WEEKEND!. That's right, $99 rate for a weekend. The Room and Hotel: When you pull up to the OMNI to park, you can only valet your car. Prices are pretty steep at $26 for a 24-hour period for hotel guests. Once again, I got lucky because valet was free for hotel guests for the new years weekend. So that saved me $50 alone. The bell boy's are very courteous when you enter the hotel. Check-in was a breeze, took about 5mins to get our room key. We stayed on the 8th floor and had a nice view of downtown LA. The room is very very clean. NO odors lingering around, jus freshness. When you walk in the room, the first thing you'll notice is the big king sized bed with so many extra throw down pillows, you can make another bed with em. Room came with standard TV in a cabinet deal. The OMNI also offers complimentary free internet access to its guests in the rooms, so that was a plus. The bathroom is very big with a seperate tub and stand up shower stall. What surprised me with this bathroom is that it came with a built in speaker in the wall next to the toilet so you can listen to the TV while your in the shower or doing #2. Noise from the other rooms was nearly non existent. This is one of the most comfy beds I've been in, so I really got good sleep. The Grounds: The hotel is very well kept. I wouldn't linger around the downtown area at night because of the homeless population just 4 blocks down. But at the hotel itself, it was very pleasant and relaxing. The Service: Excellent. Staff was very accomodating. They made you feel right at home. Service with a smile everytime. The Price: I scored $99/night for this baby! Regular prices will run you up over $200/night. Look around for internet deals, the pop up once in awhile. Also with that $99 rate, it included 2 days worth of FREE BREAKFAST BUFFET VOUCHERS! The breakfast was really good. The Wrap Up: Overall, my stay at OMNI HOTEL LOS ANGELES was a very nice one. I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel again only for a cheap rate that I got lucky in finding. But staying at this hotel, made me wanna check out the other OMNI'S in other cities such as SAN FRANCISO and SAN DIEGO.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "werebimbo", "ReviewID": "UR4280094", "Content": "Wasn't sure what to expect from the sprawling metropolis of LA after reading various reviews so I picked a fairly central hotel in Downtown.

The design is nothing fantastic, but neither is it over-the-top or offputting. Room service offered some low calorie options, and the mini-bar is well-stocked. When the batteries on my internet keyboard died, the engineer was dispatched within minutes to replace them. The view from my room was wonderful -- a full-on Disney Hall perspective. Double-glazed windows and solid walls ensured plenty of quiet so I could sleep. Shower water pressure was good, but they should have a shelf in the shower so one can lay their razor and/or toothbrush on it versus having to cram it into the little soap alcove or -- gasp -- leave it on the floor of the shower. Each morning I had a USA Today and an LA Times waiting outside my door...nice. I don't read USA Today so it was great to have something more substantive to read. Wake-up calls are from a real human, not some recorded automaton, and were placed exactly on time.

They did apologize and reimbursed us for the cab. I guess my beef is that they should of warned us they might not be able to pick us up instead of putting us in a dangerous situation, and i would of gone to a more touristy area ( chinatown) where they have more cabs.

Air conditioning was great. Unlike a previous reviewer, my bathroom did not have separate tub and shower stall, but it was still very spacious and well-appointed. I did not hear any noise from outside or from other rooms, which is exceptional nowadays. The front desk staff I dealt with were professional, yet down-to-earth (not to mention very efficient). The housekeeper left me a thank-you note for the tip I left her one morning. The town-car driver and bell staff were courteous and helpful. I did not have any meals or drinks at the hotel (which I regret), so I can't speak for the food or restaurant/bar service. I did have some minor issues--I experienced low signal strength and could not connect to the free WiFi internet access. I did not have a chance to ask for assistance on this matter, but I trust they would have tried to help out if I did. Also, there was a problem with authorizing my corporate credit card, but that was quickly solved (somehow their mag-strip reader picked up the expiration date incorrectly). The hotel's image is not hip or edgy, but that's OK because I was a tired business traveler that didn't want or need to contend with a staff of trendy, stuck-up actor/actress wannabees.

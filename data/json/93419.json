However, this one has been grating on me ever since. We stayed at the Carlyle for a weekend at Christmas 2009 as a present from our daughter. My biggest disappointment was the treatment we received from the staff. Because we didn't have bundles of money to hand out to staff in tips for bringing us a few slices of toast and opening a door, we felt that the service we received was non existent. In fact it felt like we were shunned. We did tip but obviously not enough. The first room we were booked into was nice but not the one that my daughter paid for. Our second room was also nice but some of the furnishings were old and worn (not something you would expect from a 5* hotel). On booking out, although my daughter had already paid for our room, we were still charged. After some discussion the bill was put right. The limousine that we booked to take us back to the airport did not turn up. We spoke to the receptionist who told us 'don't worry the hotel has a limousine that can take you' She was obviously new because , when the car did not turn up after another 15 minutes, she was no longer at the reception and we were told to go to the concierge and no further mention was made of the courtesy car. The concierge tried twice to make contact with the company supplying the Limousine but eventually offered to arrange a taxi. We paid out $100 for a 15 minute ride. So, if your Tony and Cherie Blair, John Malkovich or a Rock star, all staying at the hotel the same time as us, you would be ok.

The Bad: small bathrooms with zero luxury as in no heated towel bars, no heated floors, no oversized tubs, no counter space around the sinks, no dimmers on the switches. The closets : pretty good sized but mediocre layout, rooms are not very well decorated, ceilings are not high enough and the interior hallways are on the narrow side. The Ugly: every computer and iPad has to pay 14.95 a night for Internet which in my case meant 4 laptops and I was already spending a few thousands night for our suite. They alculated breakfast in our sitting room the most expensive possible way which meant 150$ for breakfast for 2 and I don't eat eggs.

The furniture was old and sparse, and it was too small for the rooms. The couch in the living room looked downright manky. Through the holes in the radiator covers (which were large and very visible from the couch) you could see big piles of lint and scuzz. The bed was lovely and the bed linens were absolutely first quality, but the lumpy brown carpet made the room feel old. And the bathrooms (two full and one half) seemed either old or improperly cleaned. There were lines of black (fungus?) around the caulking. Where are they hiding the beautiful suites pictured on the website?! Were only some of the rooms renovated? Did they run out of money and do a more thorough job on some rooms than others? And why have people employed full-time pushing elevator buttons when there is such a problem with cleaning and maintenance? That seems truly bizarre to me. On the upside, the hotel has a great Upper East Side location, walking distance from the Met and other wonderful museums. The bar/restaurant is fun and very old New York. And the staff is sweet.

To celebrate a 21st. A celebration type hotel was called for. Of course in the States the 21st is a big thing as alcohol becomes legal. Usually we have stayed in Midtown but this time we went to the posh end of town and the Upper East Side. We booked The Carlyle. Although we were a little concerned that it might be a little stuffy we plumped for it because of its history, its reputation, its fame for jazz and its proximity to Central Park which was condsidered a bonus bearing in mind we were going in summer. We were thankful that we had as the temperatures reached staggering highs and a stroll through the trees of the Park was welcome on more than one occasion. What then about the hotel itself. Quite simply it is, as the Americans would say, awesome. In a city which can at times be revolting in its brashness and ability to go completely OTT this is a place that is luxurious yet measured, restrained, and subtle. It is comfortable with being what it is - that is - pure class - and does not need to shout it from the its very high rooftop. We were greated by the special events manager who had responded to my request for adjoining rooms. She gave us only one room key on arrival however - saying some finishing touches were to be done to the birthday girl's room. We soon found out that these touches were the delivery of complimentary Champagne and cake to get the celebrations off to a wonderful start. We spent time in the bar - birthday girl showing that her 3 years of UK drinking practice had not gone to waste - as she sampled a number of fantastically executed cocktails. We listened to the relaxing jazz. We admired the extraordinary murals on the walls. We had breakfast in the Restaurant - once I had been sent back to the room as I was wearing shorts which were not acceptable - quite right too - I felt my self saying. We sampled the lounge where it is said the great and good of yesterday, the Hepburns and Kennedys would meet, and where the great and good of today clearly still do. The service throughout the hotel was impeccable, the food excellent, the drink better. The rooms old style proper total comfort with all the amenities you could need, the ipod dock and flat screen TV sitting well with the French influenced furniture and marble bathrooms. The hotel lobby and public areas understated in elegance with great art and objects and yet a well equipped and complimentary business centre.. If you want urban cool and modern minimalism dont stay here. The Carlyle is a hotel of a different age, an age of classic beauty and refined living, but it retains its relevance in today's world by being exemplary in every way. It is an oasis from both the constant rush of the city that never sleeps and the world which seems never to even take a breath.

These were my 15th and 16th stays at the hotel, respectively. The Carlyle continues to be one of my favorite hotels, worldwide. This is a hotel of timeless elegance and gentility, with a high level of service and personal attention. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hotel with staff continuity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some the bell staff, room service staff and doormen are the same as on my first visit in 1992. They remember me from stay to stay, and I am warmly greeted. That continuity provides something intangible, and very valuable. During the August, 2010 visit, my wife and I had a Premiere Suite on the 4th floor, overlooking 76th Street. The suite had a half bath, kitchenette, large living room (with grand piano) and bedroom with full bath. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Premiere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suite categories seem to be exactly the same except that, in the Premiere Suite category, one of the two walk-in closets has been turned into a separate shower stall, allowing a separate soaking tub. The room was very well appointed. Each of the two easy chairs and sofa in the living room were inviting and comfortable. The easy chair in the bedroom was also very comfortable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m picky about lighting, and all of the seating locations were well lit. The grand piano was cool to look at, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve much purpose for us. As is always the case at The Carlyle, the bedding and linen were of highest quality (Frette, I believe). The bed was excellent. I visited the hotel alone for the October, 2010 stay, and stayed in a tower room somewhere in the 20s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my first opportunity to stay in the tower portion of the hotel. My view was to the east \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and was spectacular. The bathroom also had a window, and I could enjoy the same view while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so to speak. The tower room had a comfortable easy chair, with very good lighting nearby. It also had a walk-in closet. On the both stays, housekeeping was flawless. Everything happened when it was supposed to, and how it was supposed to happen. The door service and elevator service was friendly and prompt. As has always been the case at The Carlyle, the HVAC worked flawlessly during both stays, and both rooms were exceptionally quiet (this was a pleasant surprise for the 4th floor room, which I expected to pick up more of the Madison avenue traffic noise). I have some rules that guide my stays at The Carlyle. 1) I like bright rooms. Because of that, with the exception of the Premiere Suite mentioned above that was on the 4th floor, I normally stay no lower than the 8th or 9th floors. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found the lower floors much darker when it come to natural light. 2) I follow my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old hotel rule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I stay The Carlyle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is, never stay in the cheapest room in an old hotel, because those rooms can be very very small and/or look into air shafts. From the floor plans, I do perceive that there is at least one room on each of the lower floors that would fit into that category. 3) If breakfast is not included in my room rate, I eat breakfast elsewhere, since it is priced at a very high level. 4) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m always very cautious about room service. Very thirsty during one summertime stay, I ordered a pitcher of Iced Tea (how much could it cost, I thought?). Thirty-nine dollars (before the tip), was the answer. I learned my lesson. The Carlyle is never cheap, although good rates can be had if one looks for them. The service has never disappointed over the past two decades. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had any failings of any the fundamentals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plumbing, noise levels, electrical, HVAC, bedding, lighting and the like. It has met all of my expectations consistently throughout all of my stays. I strongly recommend The Carlyle to anyone who looks for a classic, high service hotel stay with no surprises.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience - true New York style!\u201d", "Author": "GoSTLCards6161", "ReviewID": "UR103301424", "Content": "Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and location.

I'm 60 and have stayed at fine hotels all over Europe and in major US cities. This is the worst hotel experience I've ever had. Off the entrance hallway to our suite was a kitchenette with Formica counter tops and appliances that had seen better days many years ago. The rug in the living area was stained and frayed at the edges. There was a jagged tear in the curtains that looked like it had been repaired by a child. The bathroom was completely walled in mirrors to disguise how incredibly tiny it was. I really doubt that 2 adults could have stood in the bathroom at the same time. After arrival, I called housekeeping to ask for a bucket of ice, since there are no ice machines on the floor, and finally, an hour later, on the third phone call, I just told them to forget it. Breakfast each morning in the restaurant was included in our room package and was about the quality one would expect at a Denny's. We asked to see another room and were shown a Deluxe Suite which was actually in worse physical shape than our first suite, so we just let it go. The Carlyle may have been the epitome of Art Deco splendor when it was built in 1931. In 2011, it's merely faded, tired looking, and cramped. If you really want to stay in a wonderful hotel, go stay in the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco.

I wanted an intimate space with windows and views plus impeccable service for my traveling guests. The Carlyle far exceeded my expectations in this respect, but wait, here's the best part, the room minimum was much more reasonable than other private rooms in the city! So much so that we had an opportunity to add on passed ors'devors that were to die for! During the planning process our event manager, Caitlin, was attentive and responsive to our every need. Caitlin provided us with group block discounts for those staying at the hotel, menu suggestions, layout ideas and floral recommendations. When my daughters decided that they wanted to do table arrangements, Caitlin volunteered the floral room for our use. This was totally unexpected and made the preparation for the event so much fun as we totally felt like inside staff. Caitlin also hunted down a projector for us to show a slide show during the event and the other waiters and staff members were the most friendly and professional people I have ever dealt with. When we first arrived, our room was upgraded to a two bedroom suite and myself, daughters and bridesmaids were treated to a huge sitting area for entertaining, kitchen, entrance foyer with real leather bound books plus two huge bedrooms with apartment like furnishings and fine, European linens. A fruit basket was waiting for us as well. At the event, everyone appreciated the elegant setting, delicious food and overall ambiance and mood. Even after the event was through, the hotel didn't mind the lingering guests as there was not even a suggestion to be ferried off to some other area. We did, however, retreat to the lovely sitting room in our suite for the opening of the gifts. it was the perfect place to unwind and have the convenience of a home away from home. It was even a breeze to ship off all the presents as a package assistant arrived with shipping forms and the whole lot was effortlessly transported to the package room and sent to our residence within a few days. It is really rare that you get to stay in an intimate hotel where your every need is anticipated and you are greeted by super friendly staff at all hours of the day. When my daughters went shopping, they were offered the private Mercedes and only had to tip the driver. Seriously? Where does this happen in this day and age?

That service is delivered with the quiet confidence that comes from decades at the top. The rooms are all that you would expect from the average superluxury hotel. The cocktail bar is charming, the room service delicious. But it is a legend that feels just a lot more real than the competing realities.

The hotel should train their staff a bit better! In the 21st century and in the USA I did expect the hotel to provide complimentary wifi, but was dissapointed that it did not. I can not remember the price of connecting, but it was expensive. Room service was a ridiculous price, almost $25 for a pot of coffee, the mini bar prices were unbelievable, a small bottle of water was around $9 (you can get a large bottle of exactly the same brand for $2 in the local shops!)

That's just the way it is in this city. However, on arrival, (my partner and I at the time were checking in) we were told that they required a credit card - 'standard practice,' we thought... No. We were subsequently informed that we had not paid. I told them very politely that, yes infact the bill had been covered way beforehand as this was my birthday and we wanted no hassle with the room. Whilst they faffed around behind the desk, we retreated to the seating area very embarrassed and were taken into the bar finaly by an over-compensating manager who told the barman to 'look after us' and said the first round of drinks would be complimetary. No such luck, this was on our bill when we went to check out after our stay. Anyway, this was all sorted out and it turned out they had put a lovely birthday suprise/cake/amenities in our room for me on my father's request so that was something nice to have. However, what I was NOT pleased with was that the reason why our check in had revealed we 'hadn't paid.' Their excuse was that their accounts dept. had not transferred the information that we had actually paid. Thanks. Absolutely ridiculous when you consider it's a 5* hotel. So, among the strangeness was a REALLY loud minibar which we had to turn off every night, some food got taken out of our room that was in a brown bag that you couldn't see into and clearly NOT trash, and after we complained about this, we were given lots of things out of the minibar to have for free but they then appeared on our bill too which we refused to pay for.

I do not understand the negative reviews. This hotel is splendid in all categories. The service was perfectly polished and detailed, the best we ever received at any hotel. All the facilities were exceptionally clean. We got engaged over the weekend. When I made the reservation through Rosewood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toll free reservations system, they asked me if there was any special occasion for the trip. I mentioned that I was going to get engaged during our stay. The reservations agent replied that that was nice. There was no further discussion of it and I did not make any special requests. Upon check in, the hotel clerk (Michaela) pleasingly welcomed us by name, stated that they had been expecting our arrival and announced that they had a nice upgrade for us to one of the tower rooms with a spectacular view. We were taken up the elevators by one of their elevator attendants, accompanied by a bellman that opened the door to a spacious corner room with a view of southerly view of Madison Avenue on one side and the entire span of Central Park on the other side. There was a chilled bottle of complimentary champagne, complete with rose petals, a handwritten note from the hotel manager, and luscious chocolate covered strawberries, on the hutch. This was the beginning of a wonderful stay in which no detail was overlooked. Every time we left our room or moved about the public spaces, we were greeted by a staff member graciously asking whether we were enjoying our stay and whether there was anything they could do for us. The concierge made a number of excellent recommendations. After we had returned from a disappointing evening at the Rainbow Grill, the concierge, Javier I believe, welcomed us back and escorted us into the bar and made sure we had the most comfortable seat. He congratulated us on our engagement and immediately sent us two complimentary glasses of champagne. We had not told Javier about the engagement and yet, he (and all the other staff members we encountered) was aware of it. Remember, this was all because of the brief exchange I had with the reservations agent at Rosewood. I took advantage of the fitness center which is a temporary room while they renovate and expand their spa and fitness center, which will be complete in September. Even the temporary arrangement was more than satisfactory. Three new Cybex treadmills with attached TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a few Stairmasters and dumbbells. I suspect the new facility will be outstanding. The fitness center has an attendant ready to address any need that may arise during the workout. Finally, we requested a tour of some of the other rooms. Kelly from Guest Services took us on a 15 minute tour of some of the other rooms. All rooms were tastefully and gracefully appointed and all had unique layouts. Kelly was informative, pleasant and welcoming. Like all the other staff, she made us want to stay only as Rosewood properties wherever we go! Regrettably, we did not take any meals in the dining room. It was beautiful and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve no doubt the service there is perfect. Next trip we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be sure to try it.

It was awesome. It was more of an apartment than a hotel room. As my mother and I didn't want to get on each other's nerves, we really needed our space. We stayed in a suite that had two bathrooms, one large bed room, a living room and two closets. The staff was awesome.

They have a type of crust on the top. The coffee was great too. We stayed at the hotel for about five days; so folks started to know who we were. We also had tea there too.

We enjoyed a great jazz performance in the main lounge. 2. The concierge desk was always super busy. They needed more than one person handling things. Also, this isn't a good place to get Broadway tickets. Apparently, if you book it through them, it'll cost you almost three-times the rate.

Our room although nice, was small, with very little walking room which is not a big deal. Some of the things I had issue with. Room service tacks on a $15.00 surcharge for anything you order. My husband's cheeseburger which initally cost $25.00 ended up costing $40.00. The bar is also quite overpriced. We ordered a vodka tonic which was $18.00. Even by New York standards, that's a bit steep. The TV cable constantly went out. It's rare that it worked properly. An interesting feature of this hotel is that they still have bellmen operating the elevators. Frankly, this is an absurd practice for this hotel because the elevators are very tiny. They comfortably hold about 4 people. The bellmen take up valuable space to perform a needless, if not pretentious, task of pushing buttons. I found riding up and down to the 23rd floor to be a somewhat akward experience with these men who I doubt have any job satisfaction performing this ridiculous function in a claustrophobic space. My recomndation to the hotel would be to eliminate some of the antiquated services they provide and make the hotel rooms and service fees more reasonably priced", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Carlyle\u201d", "Author": "MrMrsBDallas", "ReviewID": "UR8066358", "Content": "I have been staying at the Carlyle for years.

The Carlyle still acts like they have competition and continues to put forth the effort to win and retain customer loyalty. I find the Carlyle is the best of the best in all areas of service, personal touches and care for their customers. It truly feels like I have a home in NYC, not a hotel room. The more you return, the more the staff gets to know you and things just happen.

I was so frustrated that I wrote to the management and they kindly responded with an apology. Time has passed and my husband and I thought we would try again. I called the management office to make our reservation directly to make sure there would be none of the inconveniences of the last booking. They were very kind with making a booking with very little notice. I've written on this website to offer constructive criticism and I will offer when hotels get it right. The Carlyle front staff was trying very hard to please us from the moment we walked into the door. The room was freshly updated and lovely. The managment sent up a bottle of wine, scrumtious chocolate and grapes as an apology for the last visit. The one down side (sorry guys) is the housekeeping staff just isn't on par with the a $800 night room. Turn down service shouldn't come at 6pm and when they do finally come they shouldn't turn down 1/2 the bed, and I shouldn't have had to call for a second hand towel. In addition, there were no face clothes nor any shower caps. What is it with the service at this hotel? Even if I were paying half that amount for a room I don't want to share a hand towel with my husband and I would expect face clothes. The room service breakfast came exactly on time and was lovely and fresh. One thing I don't understand from our previous visit and this visit. We drove to NYC from our home and valet parked the car with the hotel. When we gave the claim check to the front desk we expected the car to be brought around. We waited for that to happen. Each time we were told to take our bags and walk to the garage and get our car ourselves. This time we had to walk through the hotel laundry being loaded onto trucks to get to the garage. I don't understand if they can take the car from us in the front of the hotel when we arrive, why don't they deliver the car to us when we depart? I've never been to a hotel that makes me walk to my car with my luggage after I've paid a valet fee!

There were no chairs other than at the small desk. We both asked to be moved to larger rooms and were accommodated in a nice manner. The new rooms (slightly larger than the original..it did have one nice chair) were only average. By that I mean they were really in need of refurbishing. Sort of frayed around the edges like a nice old shirt. I found the level of service to be average. Often, the room service tray from the previous night was still in the room the next day after the room had been serviced. I had to ask for turndown service at 10:00 p.m., after returning from dinner.

It opened in 1930 as a fabulous uppercrust residential hotel (much like the one where the fictional Nick and Nora lived) and still retains a lot of the original atmosphere. This is probably the only hotel left in NYC that still has elevator operators. The service is outstanding and friendly. Bemelman's Bar is a not-to-be-missed experience for anyone who likes classic places. You can sit and watch a lot of fascinating people while you drink your admittedly expensive but excellent cocktails, enjoy the delicious (free) bar snacks and listen to a live pianist playing jazz standards. If you can afford it, get a suite here, as we did (for $805 per night including daily room service breakfast, which wasn't much more than we'd have paid for a standard room at other high-end NYC hotels that weekend). The suites really give you a vintage residental feeling. They are very spacious and nicely decorated in an old money, slightly shabby chic way, with hardwood floors, antique furniture and carpets. The beds are extremely comfortable. It's a bit like staying at a rich aunt's house. Our suite had a tiny kitchenette in addition to the 1 1/2 baths. (I couldn't help but think of Nora \"offering\" to make scrambled eggs -- watch the movies and you'll get the joke.) It is true that the \"master\" bath in our suite was tiny, because the hotel is over 75 years old and they've kept the original architectural footprint. It didn't bother us, since the bathroom was in excellent shape and had been updated with stone tile and a jetted tub. The hotel restaurant is very good and the \"Ladies Who Lunch\" special 2-course menu offered on weekdays is a value at $24. I recommend the carrot-ginger soup and the salmon with black lentils - yum. If you have a strong preference for everything brand-new and shiny, this is not the place for you. If you need a huge spa-like bathroom, look elsewhere. Looking for a trendy bar? Not here.

Also, at 7 am after a long and happy night, our doorbell rang. We hadn't ordered or pre-ordered breakfast and there was a PRIVACY sign hanging from the door knob.

We returned to the hotel and to our amazement in the lobby there stood Warren Beatty, Annette Benning and their children chating with Jack Nicholsen. In all my years of traveling have I ever come across that level of celebrity in a hotel all in one place. The Carlyle is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, the premier room that we booked is more like a suite in a home, rather than a hotel. I got one of the best nights sleep as the bed engulfs you with beautiful linens and comfort. I have to find out who they use as a florist, as the lobby and restaurant had the most breathtaking floral arrangements that I've ever seen. The lobby in the evening takes on a mystical and magical feeling with the soft lighting on the flowers, oil paintings and beautiful chandeliers. Before we went out for dinner we decided to have a drink at Bemelmans bar - I wish our children was with us as I've been reading Madeline books to our little girl and she would have been very excited to see the drawings on the wall of Madelines journies through Central Park and her adventures with her schoolmates. The next time we book a weekend in New York we will be sure to bring back our children so that we can enlighten them on the museums and culture that this property surrounds you with.

What a great experience! I have always heard the \"legend of the Carlyle\" but did not expend to fall under it's spell while I was there. I travel ALOT so I have seen it all! The lobby was beautiful! I arrived at night and there were candles lit. It looked so beautiful against the black marble, with the crystal chandelier and the silver theme throughout! I was stunned! The front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming. Knowing I had a long trip and must be tired and hungry they offered to have room service sent up. Telling the kind staff that I was just too tired they asked if i needed a wake up call, or perhaps coffee sent up at a particular time in the morning! Oh wouldn't that be perfect! I admit I have become addicted to my programable coffee maker! Visiting how tired I am at this point, they quckly checked me in and explained the hotel's key points, and rang for a bellman! RANG! An actual bell! How, I want to say quaint, but that sounds negative, it was just pleasantly unique! The bellman (whom I learned later in my stay has worked there for decades!) escorted me up and shared a few more stories about the hotels history, he got me all situated in my room and wished me a sound sleep! The whole process from the doorman with umbrella to shield me from the wrath of mother nature to there luxurious linens in front of the flat screen plasma TV wil about 2000 channels, took about a cool 5 minutes! That was it! I have fallen under their spell! The dream continued through the rest of the stay! My wakeup call in the morning with a friendly voice telling me of the days weather, and my coffee quickly followed. Thank god! As I thought about the days ahead I stopped at the concierge for suggestions. We talked about some shows and restaurants that would be great. I went to the marvelous breakfast buffet (try the cheeses!) and the staff again was mighty attentive! I went to walk in central park, i could not believe it was right there! On my out, the concierge had seen me and mentioned that the tickets and restaurant reservations were all set! Everything just fell into place. That is until the night before I was checking out. I realized I had forgotten all my chargers. My cell phone was already dead and my IPOD was hanging on for dear life! I called the front desk to see if perchance one of the staff had my same phone and happened to bring their charger along to work. I was in luck! They have a varied supply! Now to solve the IPOD issue. My biggest nightmare, and 8 hours of a airtime, borken up only by a four hour layover, with no tunes!!! Then as I'm about to hang up the phone I give it a shot and ask the agent on the phone if they have a charger. The voice on the other end mentions that there is an IPOD docking station in the room. REALY? Then I see that on the other side of the giant bed (which I need to get me one for home, its heaven!) there IS a docking station on the end table! So I hooked up my NANO, hit play and listend to the tunes while I solemly packed for my departure from this haven in the city! I miss the Carlyle, the staff and FOOD already! I was there for such a short time, but I felt as if I have been going there my entire life.

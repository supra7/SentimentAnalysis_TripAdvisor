I have booked a king and got to my room to find I was in a double/double. I went back to reception to be told its my fault as no non smoking king rooms were not available so they had given me a double non smoking and that smoking preference is not guaranteed. After having to complain to the manager, they agreed to reduce my room rate until a king room was available the next day. I was not surprised to hear over the days when I was near reception other customers unhappy at the rooms allocated and requesting room changes. The hotel lobby itself is all glamourous and glitsy but the rooms themselves are an embarrassment for this brand. The bath was stained badly ( in both rooms I had), the plaster around the walls was cracking and the bathroom didn't even have a door handle inner. I understand that rooms do wear out, but this was to the standard of a budget motel, not a high quality hotel as they claim to be. It has the big hotel brand set backs as well like having to pay for internet (now standard as free in most other hotels) and no fridge in the room to put a few drinks. On the positive side, the bed was comfortable and the house keeping kept the room as clean as they could in light of the high level of wear and tear to walls and paintwork. For the price, I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere.

The room was your average room, with a unique decor (again, a nod to the days gone by). The bathroom is tiny, and our tub had peeling paint. We were \"promised\" fluffy bathrobes, but our room didn't have any. We were also promised upon booking our room that we would be on floors 3-5, but our room was on the 11th floor. Not that we really cared about that. Another \"negative\" if you can call it that, was we were promised \"Club Access\" which was complimentary cocktail hour fare, and breakfast in the morning. What they don't tell you until you arrive is that children may not partake in this, because it's set up for business travelers. My 10 year old didn't mind, but it would have been nice if everyone in my \"party\" had been able to enjoy the breakfast. What my daughter did enjoy was the pool, and we spent a good part of our brief visit at the Biltmore Health Club. I thought the lobby was breathtaking and the staff very courteous. The one BEWARE I will share with possible visitors: DO NOT STAY NEAR THE ELEVATORS. In fact, if you get to your room and find yourself close to the elevators, insist on another room. Your hotel room will offer you no sound buffering, and you'll hear the \"ding\" of the elevators all night long. Unfortunately for us, another guest on our floor (only a room or two away from ours), came into the hallway and was loud, drunk and banging on doors for several minutes, waking us up and putting a damper on the \"relaxing\" mood the hotel had created for us. I can't blame the Biltmore for that, but beware, you will hear everything going on in the hallway. Be sure to turn on the rooms A/C and it will drown out some of the noise - that's how we survived the night. And lastly - while very courteous and helpful - the VALET service will run you $40 per night, so be prepared for the cost of parking in Los Angeles. I had done my research and expected it, but if it was a surprise I would have been bummed out. Overall, just 3 stars because of noise, and a few details the staff overlooked. On the positive side, it was neat to be able to show my daughter a bit of living history, in this grand looking hotel.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHistoric hotel with a beautiful lobby.\u201d", "Author": "Cadvise", "ReviewID": "UR127315361", "Content": "Good value - rooms are older but have been remodeled.

The hotel is older and, even on the Club Floor, there are signs of age and lack of investment back into the property. That said, we loved our stay. The drive into the property is impressive with immediate and attentive bellman service. The current main lobby is beautiful with a quick check-in process. The main elevators require walking up a short flight of stairs but there is a side elevator on the main floor just to the right of the main set of elevators if needed. For Los Angeles, our Club Floor room was large and nicely appointed. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. The Biltmore does not any longer include refrigerators or coffee makers in their rooms but they can be requested. There is a small daily charge for a refrigerator. The fridge we ordered was delivered immediately and was extremely quiet. The room was also extremely quite even though we were surrounded by other guests. For us, the Club Floor was worth the extra cost. It was open for continental breakfast every morning and provided a happy hour with drinks, appetizers and cookies from 5pm to 8pm every day. The hostess and waitress in the club were delightful and tried very hard to please every guest. Since I was visiting family in the Keck Hospital, I could drop in here for a light breakfast to go with great coffee in the morning without having to wait for room service. I also came in for the evening appetizers which made a complete meal for me. We did try room service one night - it was delivered quickly and the food was adequate as far as room service meals go. We also ate lunch at the Smeraldi's Restaurant downstairs off of the original hotel lobby. The grilled cheese with tomato soup was exactly what we both needed. I would recommend walking down the block to the Water Grill for an excellent dinner. The Water Grill is in the same block as the hotel and has never failed to impress us. Now for the not so good - the room we were in was not exactly clean or well maintained.

Honestly, it needs to be changed. The water is luke warm on the shower, but scalding on the tub. The toilet's flush reminds me of the one from my elementary school days. They provide one bar of soap, where it should be two: bath and facial soap. I understand that this is a historic hotel, but it needs a major renovation. If you're going to the area, I would recommend one of the other hotels.

When we stayed here while attenting a show at the convention center, I was really excited. What a disapointment. Rooms were small and musty. Decor was not kept up, and the tempature in the room was never right. The MOST disapointing was room service. Although they supposedly have room service, I called in my order at about 8:30pm. I was told it would take 45 minutes. By 9:30pm I was starving, and called room service. They told me they were closed, and I would be on my own! I was so mad! I then called to the front desk to complain, and was told that it was an honest mistake by the person who took my order. They then offered me a menu for a nearby Italian delivery that would deliver this late. As I was already in PJs, I asked that someone deliver it to my room. Nope! If I wanted a menu, I could come and get it from the front desk. I sent my hubby down, and we called Italian to deliver. My biggest complaint was the price. We got a DISCOUNTED room from the convention of $135 per night. My friends who ended up here at the last minute paid $175 per night. On top of this, parking was $50 (i kid you not) $50! Per day! And there is no self park option. So my $135 per night was $185 per night, AND they charged LA and state tax on my PARKING, making it ALMOST $60!

My fiance was already staying in the hotel on business for 2 weeks. He was given room 976. I believe this room had to be one of the worst offered at the Millenium Biltmore. The room was very dark, facing a brick wall and the bed was broken. We asked them to fix the bed after my fiance fell out of it. They put a wooden plank under the mattress. It was horrible. The next morning, I asked them to upgrade his room to another room. Anthony at the front desk spoke with the manager, Christian, and we were given 1037. This room has views of both Pershing and the courtyard. There are windows in the bedroom and the bathroom. It is sunny and airy. This was a marked improvement. If you have issues with noise, you will not be happy in this room or any room facing Pershing. The quieter rooms tend to have horrible views. The brighter rooms with views tend to have street noise. The street noise was welcome considering the alternative. You could feel a bit of the energy of the city, view the ice skaters in Pershing Square and see the \"angel\" lights in the sky. Unlike 976 which required an additional power surge cord from the hotel due to the inconvenient outlets, 1037 had adequate electrical outlets. 1037 is not a suite however the layout is spacious and comfortable. It shares an entryway with another suite... I believe 1035. Although there were many guests and a lot of activity at the hotel due to the Showcase children's talent event in the lobby, there was nobody in the spa area. We made use of the wet/dry saunas, pool and jacuzzi. Greg Guzelian at the Gallery Bar was very personable and engaging despite the crowd on some nights. We had the buffet breakfast at Smeraldi's Restaurant most mornings and opted to eat dinner out in nearby restaurants - Cafe Pinot, LA Prime and Drago Centro. The food and service at each was very good. A piece of advice I give everyone, never accept the room given sight unseen. ALWAYS ask to see the room BEFORE accepting it.

Being a massive movie fan, I found the history of the hotel and the events that it has hosted very interesting. There are a lot of photos around the entire building which really takes you back to the 1920's and 30's. The bar and bar staff are very good and the food that they serve is also very good. Unfortunately, the rooms are terrible and in need of a massive re-vamp along with the halways leading to the rooms, they too take you back to the 1920's and 30's but for the wrong reason. Our trip was somewhat spoiled on our last full day, as we were advised by a member of staff at the concierge desk (Josh) to visit the six flags theme park just outside the city. This was something we really wanted to do and so got him to book the tickets on the morning that we wanted to go. On that morning we asked to organise a shuttle however we were told that it should have been organised the night before, when we asked why we were not told the night before when enquiring about the tickets, the answer was \"I must have forgot\". Josh then advised us to rent a car just across the road. We didn't really want to rent a car, however did so because we really wanted to go to the theme park. So, we spent about an hour hiring a car, setting up a sat nav and started to make our way out of the city (40 miles) and when we got to the park, guess what? The park was closed, which everyone apart from the concierge seemed to know. I am in no way saying that this was done on purpose, because it wasn't, the sad thing is that we had spent $140 on car hire and $120 on park tickets, not to mention the loss of 4 hours of our day. Josh really did do everything he could to try and get our money re-funded, but the hotel seemed to refuse, or at least thats what it looked like. All we got from the hotel was $40 to cover the cost of our taxi back to the airport. We were assured that both the hire car cost and park tickets would be refunded to our credit card, however it has been 12 weeks since our visit and still nothing has been done. Its a pity that I have to write a review like this, however no-one from management in the hotel seemed to want to help us or even cared about what had happened. Just to recap - The lobby and downstairs in the hotel is very nice. The rooms and halways leading to the rooms could be straight from a scene in the Poltergeist movie.

The Biltmore tanked on all counts. I was in LA for business for only one night. I was originally given a small room that looked onto a brick wall. As I had to work in the room all day, I asked to be changed to a room with a view. They gave me a new room, but it turned out to be worse. The hallway leading up to it smelled dank, and the room smelled also. I thought it smelled like cabbage or something food-y that might go away after a while, but it didn't. I tried to use the wireless internet, but could not get on to it because the signal was too weak. After staying in the room for a while working, I took my shoes off and walked to the bathroom, only to have my socks soaked with water. The carpet was soaking wet on the half of the room closest to the bathroom, which explained why the room smelled moldy like boiled cabbage. I was hesitant to ask for yet another room, as when I asked for the first change the staff seemed kind of annoyed, and also by that time it was late at night and I just needed to get some rest for the next day. The room was dank and cold, and when I turned the heat on it didn't help. So I didn't sleep well, in addition to the noise from the skating rink below. To be fair, the staff did tell me about that, but they said it as I was walking away already, key in hand, as if an afterthought and as if I had no choice anyway - i.e., \"oh, by the way I hope you don't have any sensitivity to noise because that room is noisy\"... why didn't they just give me a room that wasn't noisy? The hotel is huge and I can say it did not seem at all busy. Then, I ordered breakfast, but when it didn't come at the time specified, I called (and although the card was taken from the door handle), they said they never got the order. It was too late by then and I needed to check out, so I decided to do the express checkout by tv. However, when I turned the tv on, there was an error message saying there was no signal. Later, it took almost 30 minutes for the valet to get my car. (The garage is in the hotel.) When my car finally came, I had to wait again while some tv crew told me I couldn't walk out the door to my car because they were filming. The car had to be driven around the block again, while more filming occurred and I had to wait even longer to get to my car. By the time I actually got into my car and headed to the airport, it was I had missed the opportunity to take an earlier flight out.

I picked it because it was the one among the conference offerings that had some style and unique elements to it. If you like fantastic interior architecture this is the place to stay in downtown LA. It is imbued with the style and mood of 1930s Hollywood; ornate, detailed and glamourous in it's design from the flooring to the ceiling of every public room. It is well worth the stay, just for that aspect. The rooms themselves are small but clean. Not fancy, but perfectly fine and functional. My room, with a single king bed, had the dresser at the end of the bed with not a lot of room to navigate in between. It would have been better to have a slimmer stand for the TV there and the larger dresser farther into the room where there was a lot of empty space that could have been better utilized. The bathroom was also small but they did an admirable job of making enough counter space for it to still be functional. I was alone on this trip so I only had my small toilet kit. I have my doubts as to whether my wife would have had enough room for all her stuff, actually I know she wouldn't have. The bar had fantastic brisket tacos that I got to enjoy two nights in a row. I don't drink so without that food and Ginger Ale I wouldn't have known about the jazz band they had playing. They were fantastic, setting the mood for enjoying the final hours of our conference. The service personnel were wonderful, cleaning the room, helping to get cabs, explaining maps and just in general doing their job very well.

It's 2011, time for all hotels to understand that is a necessity.

It does a very good hot and cold buffet for $19 which includes eggs / omletes made to order, juice, coffee toast etc. This is exceedingly good value for LA and the quality is of the highest standard.

I had dinner at the coffee shop that evening as well as breakfast on subsequent mornings and the food quality was excellent and the prices very reasonable. The valet parking is $40 per 24 hours and during the week that is less than what you'd pay at a parking, but over the weekend (Friday evening - Sunday midnight) you can park your car at the public parking across from the hotel on Grand street (same place where the hotel valets) for $24.00 per 24 hours. There are a number of other eateries around the hotel: a small bakery cafe and a Starbuck's just around the corner, an Irish Pub (Casey's) across the steert on the next block, and many others. All in all I'd say this hotel was fine, I got used to the rather uncomfortable bed and the tiny room, but I wouldn't give this hotel more than 3 1/2 stars.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNoisiest room... evar!\u201d", "Author": "lolawally", "ReviewID": "UR118763537", "Content": "I had to stay at this hotel for my work for two nights.

The hotel is nearly 80 years old but has kept up with the needs of the modern traveller. Our first room was a Club King room on the 9th floor. Lovely sized room with lovely decor and a very comfy bed to sleep away our jet lag after a 14 hour flight from Australia. The bathroom was old, but very clean and had everything we needed. A club room includes breakfast and hours d'oeuvres in the evening included in the room price. .Also includes free wi-fi in the Club Room area. On second stay, we booked a normal king room which was on the eighth floor. This room was much smaller, and we had a couple of problems with the hot water and TV reception. But after a quick phone call to reception we had someone from engineering come to the room within a few minutes of the call. He was unable to resolve the problem straight away. so got us moved to a room further down the corridor. This was a room with 2 double beds, but a much nicer room. The lobby area and all the downstairs areas are amazing. The hotel has such history behind it and all of these areas are maintained beautifully. The Rendezvous Court is a lovely place to have lunch or just sit and have a drink after a long day of sight seeing. Staff where all very helpful and always pleasant. The girl at the concierge desk was very helpful and booked our flight to Vancouver, all just as part of the service that the hotel provides. If you are looking for an ultra modern hotel, this is not the hotel for you. The rooms are dated and perhaps could use a bit of updating, but all in all everything else about the hotel outweighed this minor problem. The only downside of the rooms that I found, was that the rooms do not have a bar fridge. They do provide an ice bucket, and there is an Ice machine on most floors, but if you want to have any of your own food in the room, there is no refrigeration.

We swam every day of our visit. We loved the large marble steam room and there is a dry sauna too. The exercise room and locker room/showers were more than adequate and we appreciated that there was no additional charge to use the facilities. Although parking is expensive, we avoided the $40.00 parking fee by parking at the lot right across the street for $6.00 all day with in and out privileges. It is an outdoor lot on the corner but there is an underground lot across the street too. This hotel is only a block away from the Metro so we took the Metro to Koreatown since we knew parking was almost impossible on a Saturday night. The hotel is also 2 blocks away from Central market which is a great place to pick up lunch. We had dinner at a restaurant called Church and State, which is about a 10 minute drive from the hotel.

The hotel's public areas have been used numerous times for movies, and they were filming whilst I was there last. I stayed in a club level room which I would highly recommend, as it is slightly larger and comes with access to an exclusive lounge, where continental breakfast and pre-dinner drinks are served daily, with access to free wi-fi, concierge, etc. The room and bathroom are a bit old, but it is important to remember that you are staying in an historic hotel. This doesn't affect the quality of the bedding, linens, furniture etc, and these were to modern standards. The service was impeccable - no request was too large, service was prompt, and every staff member I passed greeted me. I arrived at 8am after a very long flight way ahead of my 3pm check-in, and I was given a room immediately. The location was excellent - I managed to spend 6 days in L.A. with no car because access to the more than affordable Metro/Bus system was so easy. People should be aware that L.A. downtown is atypical of other city areas; at night it is relatively quiet, and there are some homeless around. It is not unsafe though, provided you stay away from certain areas. Downtown these days is a vibrant place during the day - I managed to spend 2.5 days just downtown, visiting museums, landmarks, and exploring the historical areas.

Parking is not much of a problem - there are public parkings all around the hotel - I used however the valet parking as it was included in my room. Valet parking was very efficient and fast and I would definitely recommend it. Lobby and public areas The hotels features extensive and big lobby and public areas - all nicely decorated and in excellent condition. Check-in was easy and staff was friendly. We did not visit the bar. Breakfast in Smeraldi's Restaurant We took breakfast in the Smeraldi Restaurant only once - it was a little disappointing. While staff was nice and professional as always - we did not enjoy the restaurant's cold and \"cafeteria\" like atmosphere. But in the ends this would be a matter of taste - food was alright. For the coming days we took breakfast in the club lounge. Rooms We stayed on the club floor and were lucky enough to get a corner room. I would definitely recommend the club floor rooms - they seem much nicer as the standard rooms. The room was nicely decorated and felt somehow \"historic\". Don't believe any comments about small outdated rooms - our room was big and perfectly maintained. Air conditioning was also very efficient. The only negative comment about the room I could give would be the old non-isolating windows - you would indeed hear street noise a little - but on the other hand that's what you gotta expect anyway from a downtown hotel. The bathroom was very nice too, clean, old but in excellent condition. It even did feature a window. Club lounge The club lounge is only open for breakfast and afternoon/evening drinks - a little disappointing. Breakfast was good, selection though not extensive. Evening wines were just average but snack selection very good! Overall - the club lounge is a great place to relax and grab a bite and definitely worth the money. The Biltmore millennium is awesome!

Speaking of downtown LA, it was clear to us that they've spent a lot of effort cleaning it up and it's really become a gorgeous city to explore so do yourself a favor and check it out while you're there, it no longer deserves a 'dumpy' reputation.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDissapointed for the price\u201d", "Author": "Rashedabionka", "ReviewID": "UR116300767", "Content": "I stayed at the biltmore july 2010.

The lobby area is very picturesque and grandiose, while the rooms are a bit outdated and badly lit. The worst part about the room was the bathroom -- I felt dirtier after showering in it than I did before showering. First of all, the shower had three walls (uhh...yeah...), which meant that the entire floor got soaked when you showered. The water pressure sucked and there was mildew and slimy gunk coating the floor and walls. Gross. The toilet was also weird - it was like an industrial toilet that you'd find in an airport bathroom or something, and just seemed to be out of place. Also, the wireless internet is $10/day. Don't think you can just use the business center that the hotel boasts about on their website, because they charge you $0.50/minute for internet usage. Nice, eh? The main gripe I had with this hotel was with its management. I was staying there with a friend, who was the one paying for the room. Her flight was delayed and I ended up arriving at the hotel 1 hour before her, so she called and put my name on the reservation. The hotel manager, Albert, told her that they would need to swipe my credit card for security purposes in order to check me in, but that nothing would be charged and they would charge her card when she arrived. When I got to the hotel and asked for Albert, he was very dismissive with me and had zero interest in handling the situation, even though he was the one who spoke with my friend. He passed me off to one of his hotel clerks and before giving her my credit card, I confirmed with him that it would NOT be charged. He very impatiently told me that it wouldn't be. Fine. Well, the next day I logged onto my credit card account and I had a pending charge of $100 from the Biltmore Hotel. It turns out that even though the hotel didn't charge me the $100, they still sent a $100 authorization through in case my friend didn't show up and I had to pay, which causes the bank to treat it as a pending charge. Even though I asked SEVERAL TIMES about any charges to my card, the $100 authorization was never mentioned by Albert or any hotel clerk. My bank (Bank of America) usually reverses authorizations within 3 business days, but since I was staying at the Biltmore over the weekend, it would not be reversed before I left LA. In other words, it was basically like the hotel charged me $100 and promised to reverse it after I left LA. How does that help?! What's worse is that I intentionally only brought that one credit card with me to LA, because it had a moderate credit limit and I didn't want to go crazy with the spending while I was there on a girl's weekend. It was just a minor annoyance at first, and I went downstairs completely calm to talk to someone about the hold on my card. I spoke with Miguel who was very nice but ultimately couldn't help, and he went to get Albert for me. (Can you see where this is going?) Albert - the hotel manager who is supposed to, you know, actually care about the guests - took about 15 minutes to wander out of his office to do me the favor of speaking to him, and then had no idea what the issue was even though Miguel had briefed him on it. He was immediately defensive about it, interrupting me and talking loudly over me, and told me that he did tell me about the $100 authorization. It was a complete lie, and when he saw that I was getting upset, he changed his story and said he must have told my friend about it on the phone and she didn't pass it along to me. I 100% know she would have told me me something like that, and when I asked her later about it she said that was a lie and he never mentioned ANYTHING about an authorization, much less a $100 one. We went back and forth for about 10 minutes, which consisted mostly of Albert talking to me like I was a 2-year-old and insisting that he was right and I \"didn't remember correctly\". Not once did he apologize for the inconvenience, and whenever he let me speak (a rare occurrence), he rolled his eyes and looked up at the ceiling instead of actually listening to me. After he finally shut up I told him that I came downstairs completely happy and just wanting an explanation, but after being told that my friend was a liar, I apparently had a memory problem, and not being offered one measly apology, I was livid. He shrugged his shoulders like he couldn't care less and that was the end of it. After I informed him that I was going to be writing a negative review on tripadvisor he did say, \"I apologize if you misunderstood about the authorization, but ...\", which is a worthless apology in my book. If you have to threaten the hotel management with a tripadvisor review in order to get a semi-decent attitude out of them, I consider that a hotel I don't want to stay at ever again. He so obviously does not give a crap about the guests of this hotel (read the other reviews that mention the horrendous management!), and his employees looked miserable. In short, this hotel might be adequate, but if you have any problem whatsoever, be ready to want to yank your hair out. I've never experienced such shoddy customer service in my life. I love visiting downtown LA but I can guarantee you I'll never make the mistake of staying at the Biltmore ever again.

Another trip downstairs to mention this and to request some tea bags in my room so I could use the little kettle they supply you with. \"With honey?\" they ask. Oh wow, yes please!

Finally back to the room and ready for tea but no sign of tea bags yet . The good news was that the room no longer smelled bad. Call to the reception and no knowledge of my request for tea and was told curtly there was no honey available ever. OK send tea up anyway, please!..It was there in 5 minutes! The bed was very comfortable but i did not sleep well because of the noise of the buses starting up at 6AM. Perhaps I needed to change rooms again ! The following morning, down to Smeraldi's for the inclusive buffet breakfast. But \"oh no\" says the man, where is my coupon? What coupon? So back to reception...oh dear you should have been given one at check-in, well we cant find any at the moment but we will phone over there to let them know it is OK. Back to Smeraldi's for tea and the buffet breakfast. Tea with milk if you don't mind. The tea pots are weird and don't have lids letting all the heat escape. The waiter forgets the tea bags...are they on a mission to save them for the special and reportedly excellent afternoon tea ???They do seem awfully scarce. Finally get a tea bag, steep it for ages as the water was tepid and add milk....oops it curdles. Did i add lemon, asks the waiter. Dah!!!! anyone 1/2 way in their right mind knows you cant add milk and lemon to the same cup of tea. The buffet was very nice though with an omelette station too for those that like that kind of thing I decided not to move rooms again in case i had to go through all the other stuff again so turned on the air conditioning to drown out the sound of the traffic. It worked! I have rambled on enough now and must go...but one more comment about the little bathroom....bathtub had been re-conditioned, you know painted over and was flaking off in one corner, nice! and the toiletries were so generic that one would not imagine being in a 4 star. There were lots of nice clean towels though and the lighting was OK . Would I stay there again?

The room was large, clean, the bed comfortable and there was no noise and lots of light. I faced Pershing Square. Other friends who were staying there commented that corners were cut on the renovation, e.g., the tub was re-enameled instead of replaced, and was starting to chip; the door knobs were old, etc - all true, so maybe this isn't a full 5 star. I didn't have much interaction with the staff but what I did have was fine. We didn't eat at the hotel - people who don't want to pay a lot for breakfast can walk around the corner to Starbucks or a small bakery.

I took the Flyaway bus from LAX to Union Station ($7) and then the Red or Purple Metro 2 stops to Pershing Square ($1.50), which makes getting to the hotel both inexpensive and about as quick as taking a taxi ($46).

The nice thing about this hotel was the common area. The decor is very nice and to be honest that's what probably attracts visitors to this area. Their bar is also very nice (but very expensive $18 a drink) and customer service was the best at the bar. There was a nice older gentleman assisting us at the bar and he was great! The rest of the staff could take a tip in customer service and work on acknowledging and greeting their customers with a smile. The worst part about this hotel is that people EXPECT a tip, as if what they are doing was going out of their way when actually it's their job. I tip anyway, but their faces seem to beg for a tip. The actual hallways to the rooms were like a scene from \"The Shining.\" Everything was old and looked like it needed some updating. The room itself consisted of one bed, which was very uncomfortable, and one antique armoire which held the T.V. and one nightstand, which was a pain for us given only one person had access to the light. The old fashioned shutters, while gave a nice effect to the room, required dusting and it looked like they had been painted over their dust. There was no mini-fridge in the room so keeping your own refrigerated snacks was not an option. Additionally, the room was very cold and the heat took forever to kick in, while some other colleagues reported theirs not working as well as trouble with flickering lights. The windows themselves have not been replaced so that would explain the noise levels coming from outside and difficulty keeping the room warm. There were no extra blankets provided in the rooms on hand as other hotels would provide. Now, their site says that all rooms are equipped with 1) flat screen t.v.s (false, our room had a boxed older t.v.) 2) mp3 docking station (false, just a telephone) and 3) wi-fi for a fee (No connectivity to the internet in our room, plus the rate would be $10 PER appliance). Additionally, we had to manually turn off the lamps individually, no wall switch to control them which is kind of a pain. The walls were so thin you could hear the elevator bell ringing and people talking as they walked up and down the hallways. The bathroom was the worst hotel bathroom I have seen in a long time. I think hospital bathrooms are nicer. It really looked like they tried to make the interior nice by decorating with a \"nice\" mirror but really, they didn't try hard enough. The paint was awful, the water pressure while I didn't mind it was like you were standing under Niagara Falls, the sink slightly draped over the the bathtub, and one of the mirrors in the bathroom was just plain tacky. They really should have put a mirror in the bedroom because it was difficult for two people to share the mirror in the bathroom. The toilet was old and really needed replacing, no counter space what-so-ever, the bathroom fan looked like it needed replacing, and you could see the outline on the ceiling of an access door. The board rooms where the conferences were held varied from appearance. Of course the Crystal room was nice, spacious with it's balcony seating above. Other rooms however, were UN-AIRCONDITIONED which was awful as the AC was not working. It felt like we were in a sauna since there were so many people in there and we were not allowed to keep the doors open secondary to safety regulations. I was wondering what the hotel staff would have done if someone passed out due to a heat stroke. Their on line site is sketchy. There are no details on where to park. I wonder if that is because valet is $40 a night. And the rooms pictured on their site look NOTHING like the room I stayed in. At the rate of $189 (which was the convention fee price) plus $26 in occupancy fees, I definitely felt better off sleeping at motel 6. If in the area, try the Kyoto Grand. That hotel is A LOT nicer and worth your buck. There are other historical hotels that are able to maintain their historical theme without sacrificing comfort in a MODERN way Overall, my experience with the hotel was poor.

That's a hard lead sentence to follow up, but it's true. We stayed there this past weekend, and were delighted, in every way. Our room was one of the \"club\" rooms on the 10th/11th floors, and it was immaculate, with very elegant furnishings, spotless cleanliness (I couldn't find a speck of mold in the small but bright bathroom), and housekeeping touches that spoke of pride and quality. I was tempted to drop a quarter on the tightly-packed sheets to see if it would bounce but it was too enjoyable to slowly lean back on the soft but firm mattress and many soft pillows! Small toucbhes like a few sheets of actual hotel stationery, table lamps with electrical sockets to plug a cell phone to, and partially-opening outside windows made the room just wonderful. A safe, ironing board, and more (a coffee maker and coffee on request) such as free shoe shining (for Club) and robes. The hotel facilities are beyond description, too: The Club Lounge provides beer/wine and extensive hors d'oerves (some hot) so that we really didn't want dinner, and the breakfast rolls are to die for, with real butter (no nasty little packages), free WiFi and extraordinary coffee. Soft carpets and fresh paint in the halls, and the public rooms and corridors are some of the greatest decorative facilities in America. We most of all loved the aweswome pool in the basement, by the full exercise facility, with actual teak deck lounges, unlimited towels, wonderful steam and sauna rooms, and not a chipped tile or cheap repair to be seen. The staff was wonderful too, from Reception's easy acceptance of my service dog, to the Club Lounge concierge, to the housekeeping staff. Smiles, assistance, and pride were everywhere. Prices? While not in the hostel league, we took advantage of one of the specials on the hotel web site, and found it almost as cheap as a basic hotel. To save money on parking - $40 for valet - we parked in the Pershing Square underground lot for $14, and then entered through the traditional Lobby Court, which is much like Buckingham Palace's entrance must be, except not as small and shabby. If we'd had room for food, Smereldi's was downright budget priced with beautiful food that we saw served in truly elegant surroundings.

On our morning of departure the room was closed with a sign stating movie filming in progress please do not disturb. Our room was adequate. The queen bed was comfy and the bathroom plumbing worked okay. The TV was small. The odd thing about the room is there was no dresser to put clothes in. There was a huge walk in closet with only about 8 hangers. I used the ledge of the closet for my folded clothes. There were a few small shelves in the TV unit that my companion used. There was also a safe in the TV unit. The room was large, so there was plenty of space to add a dresser. The bathroom was also very small, not uncommon for old hotels, but frustrating because of the wasted space in the room and the walk in closet. We could hear people talking in the hallway, but it was not a big issue because we were at the end of the hallway in Room 368 and not many people walked by. If you were closer to the elevators you might be more bothered by noise in the hallways. Of course, the hallways are very long, so the downside of being at the end is you have a long walk from the elevator to the room. We had the buffet breakfast at Smeraldis in the hotel. The cost was $ 20.00, not bad since it includes coffee and juice. Menu offerings were around $ 15.00 without drinks. The buffet included made to order omelets, fresh fruit and some very yummy pastries among other offerings. Try a chocolate croissant. If you want a lighter breakfast walk to 6th street, on the side of the hotel between Olive and Grand. There is a bagel place plus another coffee shop. There is also a convenience store in that block. We did not find the area around the hotel very intimidating, even after dinner at night. There are homeless people, and a few asked for money, but most just minded their own business. The subway station is just a block away and was convenient to get to Hollywood. We also used the Dash bus to get to China Town. The concierge in the hotel gave me a Dash map. I enjoyed wandering around downtown, the ST. Vincent Jewelry Center, Angels Flight and Grand Central Market were all worth a visit. If you want a good happy hour place try the Weiland Brewery a block from the Hotel at 505 S Flower. Just cross Grand and walk past the library from the hotel, cross Flower and take the escalator one flight down to Weiland. They had cheap beer and wine and we mixed with some local Angelinos there.

They said they'd sent an engineer, but then called back to say it was the cable company's fault and they couldn't do anything about it. They were waiting for the cable company's visit \"tomorrow.\" I also noticed some fairly obvious deferred maintainance in the room. For instance, the ornamental drape over the bed was held together by a plastic twist tie because the bracket intended for this purpose was broken. I also learned that none of the rooms in the hotel come with mini-fridges, and the in-room safe was useless because it was located on a high shelf in the closet that I could barely reach. The hotel does not have a spa, but does have a fitness center and an indoor pool. I should also mention that my room was on the more expensive Club Floor, but learned that the Club Lounge closes for several hours during the day and at 8pm every night. The staff in the Lounge were not helpful in anyway. The lounge offers one computer with Internet access, continental breakfast, and evening hors d'oevres. I mentioned to two different staff members that my room lacked a robe, slippers, and coffee maker and both of them told me to \"call housekeeping.\" I've traveled enough to know that in a hotel with an attentive staff, they would have taken care of it themselves. Valet parking is $40 a day, which seems excessive, but really it was the staff attitude and the deferred maintainance that bothered me the most. Anyone who decides to stay here should know that room sizes vary widely. I saw a \"standard room\" on a lower floor that was twice the size of mine on the Club Floor (although it had the same small bathroom). I recommend specifying at the time of booking that you'd like one of the spacious rooms - whether Club Floor or Standard. The beds were very comfortable and the bed linens were high quality.

The advantage of a host hotel is that a shuttle is provided to take runners to the start line at 4 or 5 AM,on race day, so were were willing to pay $180 a night for that safety feature. At check in, we were told, \"no shuttle\". Desk clerks were barely polite, forget welcoming. The hotel is very old, so the old-fashioned rooms were no surprise. The TV provided a laugh; it was a 12 inch box set.. The power on the TV went out several times, but it came back on when he hit the power button again. The TV remote was visibly dirty and had crud on it. I had to wash my hands each time I used it. The bathroom was dirty: the floor had visible water splash spots and was gritty with dirt. The bath tub had a ring of mold in the seams. The pedestal for the sink had a small dark splash of something that could be blood, but that would have been removed with even a cursory wiping... had any cleaning person bothered to do so. The bathtub shower set up had no hand holds with which to steady oneself getting in and out of the tub. I had to grab onto the shower curtain and pray I didn't slip. Before I could even take a shower, I had to call the front desk to send someone to get the shower working. It took two phone calls before someone finally showed up. The faucet was loose and corroded, and the pull knob that starts the shower wasn't working. Maintenance man was polite and professional, he had the strength to jiggle and pull that he got the shower running for me. He said the faucet assembly needed to be replaced and offered to come back later to do that. I asked how long it would take, and he said \"it will take a while\", so I declined. The bedding was clean and fresh, and the beds were comfortable. We were unable to use our laptop computer; in trying to connect to the hotel home page, we got the warning that it is a malware site. There were no vending machines anywhere. The only places within the hotel to eat are three pricey restaurants, but no little snack shop to get coffee or snacks. We ordered room service for lunch, The food came within the 30 minutes promised and was nicely presented and was very good. Cost for a chicken salad and rolls, and a chicken sandwich and soda was $40; that included service charge and gratuity. Server was polite and professional. The hotel was also hosting tryouts for \"America's Got Talent\" TV show, so the hotel lobby were crowded, loud, and chaotic. In fact every time we had to enter and exit through the lobby it was crowded, loud and chaotic. The entry to the hotel for vehicles is narrow and dark, so there is always a delay to wait for a cab or your car to be brought around, and a delay for the vehicles to be able to exit. The valets work hard and really hustle to get your car or cab and load your luggage. Given the poor conditions; they earn their tips. The only staff that was not courteous or friendly was the desk staff. At check in, she was curt and matter of fact. No pleasantry. At check out, he asked my name and kept his head down at the computer until he pushed a paper across the desk at me and said \"there you go\". I had to ask, \"is this my receipt?\" He only nodded yes. No \"thank you\", no \"come again\", nothing. If the lack of amenities, customer service and cleanliness is not important to you, and cost is irrelevant, then you will like this hotel.

After reading some mixed reviews on Tripadvisor I was not sure what to expect. It definitly exceeded my expectations! We arrived early evening and parked in the recommended Pershing Square undergound parking! This is much better than paying the $40 per night valet parking at the hotel. The car park has 24 hour security so did not feel nervous about leaving the car here and is only across the street. We parked on the 2nd level as the 1st is has mostly reserved spaces for a car hire company. You pay each time upon leaving the car park to a dude in a box so it''s better to stay out all day so you only have to pay once a day. The hotel lobby area is really beautiful and the staff were pleasent on check in. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. I agree with some reviews that the bathrooms are a bit aged and can do with an upgrade though this adds to the character of the hotel. I think with most hotels we stayed in during our adventure installing flat screen tv's, this was one thing missing from the room - we only had an old box thing. We only once ate the hotel via room service and was not that badly priced compared to some external restaurants we ate at. I think if I came back to LA I would stay more down the Hollywood end as there is not much to do round downtown. The first night was struggled to find somewhere to eat in the surrounding blocks but found a Wolfgang Puck in the end. Downtown is not a bustling city in the evening like London or New York and there are a lot of wierdos, homeless people hanging around Pershing Square though do not bother you unless you look like a complete tourist! It's not the type of place to walk around at night so better to drive to more populated parts of the city to eat and spend the evening! It's perfectly fine during the day as people are rushing around for work and seems to be a central work hub. Overall not a bad place to stay expecially for the price and as long as you have a car.

Like many travellers with limited intel, I made a decision based on the reviews from tripadvisor, and some independent research on the internet. My biggest concerns was noise levels, accessibility to LA, and quality of the room. From a noise perspective, it was fine for me. My room was located on the 6th floor around a corner from the lift however I did not get much sound from the corridors, and could only hear the lift beep if I stuck my ear against the front door. Which I only did once for testing! As to accessibility to LA, downtown was not very close to all the areas to LA and if I was staying longer than 3 nights I think I would have picked another location. However, as it was I spent most days doing 1 day tours (Universal Studios, Hollywood Homes, Santa Monica and Venice Beach, etc) and it was easy to take Starline tours from this hotel. Bare in mind you need to be there at 8:25am outside the hotel street (50metre walk from the undercover entrance of the hotel) for those tours. Which means you have about 50minutes of hotel hopping before you arrive at Starline to pay the balance of your tickets. There was a Macy's, a jewelry district, a few food places (Mexican for example) and several close convenience stores. Again, based on the purpose of the trip (really just a comfortable hotel to base myself for common tours), I couldn't fault it. There was also a irish pub a bit further down from South Grand Avenue (walk down hill and cross the road, look on your right). The last benchmark for me was the quality of the room. I thought it was above average but moderate to small. The room was a creamy yellow/white, and the carpet was clean but getting a little old. The housekeeping was efficient, never had any problems with fresh new towels (most days I had 3 sets), and bed was always neatly arranged. I slept well in the bed. Concierge and the bellhops were efficient but not \"in-your-face\" which I was glad about. One of them was James, who was very helpful during my stay. Helped me pick the more popular tours (which I later enjoyed). I only ate breakfast once at the hotel, but it was pleasant the 2 guys that attended my table were friendly and helpful about what was available. Frontdesk were also efficient, got smiles from most of them except one lady - but you always get one woman who really doesn't want to be working there. For me, it was not a big distraction compared to my overall pleasant result. Lastly, the place has a nice bar (bit noisy for my liking), and the ceilings were awesome with great detail. All in all, I would recommend this hotel, especially if you're there just for a few days and want something at a reasonable price (72hr special room rate - room only).", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel But Watch for Hidden Costs\u201d", "Author": "LCH31310", "ReviewID": "UR78920038", "Content": "This is a very nice historic hotel in downtown Los Angeles.

We booked it on expedia after checking out other travelers' advices and balancing out the price (at the time of booking this hotel was the only hotel in downtown that still remains affordable after the sales). This hotel has quite a character to it . Grand Hollywood classic. We took a peek at their ballroom, it is very nice and grand but yet still remain a characteristics vintage look to it. Checking in at the hotel, the hotel looks pretty grand on the outside. We were greeted by friendly , helpful staff at the front desk, going up to our room thru nicely decorated hallway with high vaulted ceiling. So far so good , pleasantly surprised. But then the surprise went downhill from there as we were looking for our room. Thru a long long hallway we finally located our room at the far far far end of the building. We entered with the key but to find ourselves in a small gloomy room with 2 doors - 1 of them is rm 772, our room. We were like \"OK..what now\". Upon opening the door, we've found ourselves in a rm of a reasonable size for a king sz bed rm. The bed is ok (very soft with no back support just like many other hotels). The carpet is so so (my hubby mentioned the carpet might has flea as he felts itchy after walking barefoot). The air conditioning was acceptably noisy but effectively cold. However the room does not have the amenity you usually find in even a lower grade hotel; there is no fridge/freezer, no internet (they charge you for a fee though at $11/night or something). It is quite disappointing. The most ridiculous find - the TV, a 15\" tube projection, it is an antique - just like the hotel itself!! The washroom is very spacious, but I wish it has an exhaust fan, the toilet bowl is clean with no pee stain ring, and a fixture that provides enough counter space for the guests to spread their necessities. Parking - it is a HUGE problem. Upon arriving at the hotel (we flew in from Vancouver, rented a car at the airport), we were shocked to learn that the hotel offers valet parking for a whooping $44 overnight. You can find park it yourself for $16 /night at the Perishing Square underground parking across the street, or if you can walk for 1/2 a block, you can find it cheaper for $12/night at a public parking on Oliver Street. It is monitored, bright, well-lighted - many exotic cars tend to park there overnight, so security gotta be good. Location - in the heart of LA downtown. Close of transit and train station.

Always excellent service, the attendants at the front desk are always very welcoming and helpful, all staff members are warm and ready to assist - it's just an enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere. Upon entering it's like it's own little world, despite the fact that it's in a relatively busy area in Downtown LA. You could spend the whole weekend in the hotel and not get bored - multiple restaurants, shops, amenities - the dining can't be beat, and love that there is variety of tastes to choose from. The breakfast is divine - you can choose from the menu or select the buffet option. The rooms are very private and quiet, and the standard room for the inexpensive rate cannot be beat. You're able to stay in one of the nicest hotels in Downtown Los Angeles without breaking the bank - WIN! The Biltmore has several locations for dining, all different types of cuisine: La Bistecca has exquisite dinner entrees and desserts. The servers are welcoming, polite, and on top of their game. I never had to ask for anything - they were always two steps ahead of me. Smeraldi's Restaurant has an excellent breakfast menu and an excellent breakfast buffet. The servers are here are also run the restaurant well. Dinner at Sai Sai was another excellent experience. The food is cooked just right, preparation was rather quick, and the display was one of a kind - one of the best dining experiences I've had for Asian cuisine. The lounge connected to the lobby has a full bar, menu, and sitting area where you can just relax with cocktails. I went on a Friday evening once and there was live Jazz til 2 AM. The cocktails were delicious, and with complimentary bar snacks. If you're looking to visit the Biltmore but don't plan to stay, visiting one of the restaurants or the lounge is worth the visit alone. Whether you're a visitor to town or a local, you must experience the Millennium Biltmore stay - it is heaven.

You could do no better than Room 480 in the Millenium Biltmore Hotel; the perfect room to end everything.

The room itself appears clean, but it's SO depressing and in bad need of being brought up into this century. More dark cream dingy walls and dark, dated patterned carpet decor. I don't know about you, but the first thing I do whenever I walk into a hotel room is look out of the window at the view, which, bearing in mind one was in a big city like L.A., didn't seem too bad. For some strange reason the sash window was covered in chicken wire on the outside, eventhough I was on the fourth floor. I undid the lock and tried to open the window but it was stuck rigid, and when I removed my hands they were black with dirt from the window top which had obviously not been cleaned or dusted in a very long time. Very frustating as I hate having to use air conditioning. The bathroom and bedroom basics were clean, but lurking in the corner of the bedroom was a vile faded armchair which I had no intention of using during my stay there. Even the dark cream shelves for one's clothing were old, scratched and uninviting, and made me feel that I didn't really want my clothing to touch the surfaces. In conclusion, a truly ghastly room.

Some of the reviews were negative and I will admit, they almost swayed me to look elsewhere. I decided on this one afterall because of the smokin' deal I got. I booked through Travelocity about a month and a half in advance and paid fifty/night. That's unheard of in L.A., even sketchy parts of L.A. (which is most of L.A.). My friend and I drove in from Phoenix for a TV show taping and we stayed two nights. The hotel is in the middle of downtown L.A. It's the ideal location for a business traveler. Upon arrival, we were forced to circle the block to get to the entrance because the valet entrance was coned off (just during morning/evening rush hours). We were immediately greeted by the friendly valet. Check in was simple. The hotel is as majestic as it seems. For all of the patrons who complain of it being old, it is old! It's historic! But, it's well maintained. I booked a double standard room. However, when we got to the room, it was a double suite! No one mentioned an upgrade and I forgot to ask! The beds were small (but I'm used to a Queen) and kind of hard but it's all personal preference. No bedbugs, as I've read from some reviews. It was very clean. The bathroom is small but sufficient. The water pressure was amazing (some reviews show it to be weak). We had a fabulous room. We were at the end of a long hall, our room facing another part of the building. We had zero outside noise. We were on the 4th floor. We never heard anyone. The vending machine is expensive (bring your own drinks) and I never saw an ice machine but I'm sure they have at least one! One night we walked a few blocks to an IHOP to eat and it appeared safe. The area is surrounded with chic, city living apartment buildings. Around the corner from the IHOP was a Ralph's grocery store which was convenient. Traveling into Hollywood took about 15 minutes, depending on traffic (which is NEVER predictable). Valet was forty four dollars/night but it's really the most convenient way to park because you have in/out privileges. I never saw the public parking & even then there's a fee and no in/out privileges. We had our own car so I didn't pay close attention so I don't know if I saw public transportation. Keep in mind this is downtown and it's busy during week days and weekend days. Lots of pedestrians, that move at their own pace (at crosswalks). But, I noticed this is the norm in L.A. So, overall, a trip to L.A. requires patience! We only saw probably 1/4 of the hotel and it was amazing. If I could get an awesome deal again, I'd stay there every time. Take away points- For the budget conscious, there is no free parking, no free breakfast, no fridge/microwave, no in room safe. But, it does include a iron/ironing board, a typical hotel hair blow dryer (I bring my own but my friend tried to use theirs and it died on her), non-labeled toiletries and a small TV (who really goes to watch TV?).

However I have decided to write the review again as I think reading a review like this would have helped me to make a better decision when booking a hotel in LA. This hotel was recommended to me by a friend who had stayed here in 2008. The hotel itself is beautiful and full of history, the bus driver on one of our tours called it a 'world class hotel' The room was big, with 2 single beds and a really comfy armchair and footstool. The front desk staff were very helpful with instructions and directions. We ate on the evening of Thanksgiving in the bar (having raced down to our booked restaurant at LA Live to find it closed ) and the lady serving us was absolutely lovely and the food delicious. It was right beside the metro which was great for getting to Hollywood and Universal. However, beware, we came out the wrong door of the station one evening and it took us 50 minutes to find the hotel, thru some really dodgy areas :-( The huge let-down for me in this hotel was the location, based on the fact that we didn't have a car. As mentioned, the metro was great for Universal and Hollywood, but that's about it. You are stuck in the middle of Downtown, even the bus driver on our tour offered to drop the Biltmore guests in Hollywood as \"there is nothing to do around here\" We got the number 16 bus out to Century City on our last day and to say it was an uncomfortable ride would be an understatement - we got shouted at when we got on for - lets just say - not fitting the profile of the usual people who travel on this bus so felt very unwelcome, and journey went on forever. When we were finished shopping we got a cab all the way back to Hollywood rather than get on that bus again. We booked a shuttle with the hotel to get back to the airport and it turned up 30 minutes late and then brought us all around the city picking up other people (with a driver that didn't seem to have a clue where he was going) We ended up nearly missing our flight. So in summing up, this is a lovely hotel and if you have a car I would definitely recommend it, however, if you are relying on public transport, I would stay in Hollywood or Santa Monica. And don't use the airport shuttle!

BUT... if you want to stay in a hotel that has the history, the elegance and the beauty of the Biltmore you have to just accept that your room isn't going to fitted out with modern furnishings and the layout of the bathroom isn't going to make the most of the space. Like most hotels, the Biltmore has rooms of varying standards. Those who are fortunate enough to enjoy a stay on the top two floors (floors 10 and 11) will no doubt be scratching their heads at the reviews left by those who stay on the lower floors. These are their Club Rooms and they have more soundproofing on the walls and windows. The windows also have quality drapes that help keep the sound and light from outside down to a minimum. The furnishings in these rooms is a little grander and the carpets a bit newer. Floors 1 to 9 are the cheaper floors and it shows. They have timber plantation shutters on the windows that do very little to keep out noise and light. There are no drapes at all. The placement of the bed is 10-12 inches from the window, which only compounds the noise and light problems. There is no soundproofing between the rooms and although I didn't hear a great deal of noise from the room nextdoor to mine, I believe this has been an issue for some people. You won't find modern furnishings this hotel, instead you find simple but elegant furniture that is in keeping with the ear of the hotel. Our room, on the 9th floor, and all of the others I saw during our stay, were furnished with a desk, a large comfortable bed, a chair, a large set of drawers and a LCD tv. Our room had a huge closet but I understand this may vary in some of the rooms. The bathroom feels a little cramped but only because of the huge original old tub. Remember the days when tubs were deep enough that you could soak up to your neck and long enough that you could lay back with your legs stretched out? These are the wonderful kind of tubs you get at the Biltmore and they are devine after a long day of sightseeing in L.A.! Yes, you need to pay extra for wifi access in your room. It's $9.95 for 24 hours, but how many good quality hotels provide it free in a standard room booking? Not too many that I know of. In my experience you only find free wifi (and usually breakfast too) on offer in the budget hotels. It's how they pull in customers. There are so many great things about staying at the Biltmore. The food in the hotel restaurants is good and not overly expensive, the location is fantastic - there is a subway on the next corner and the staff were all friendly and helpful but I think the very best thing about staying here is wandering around the public areas of the hotel. There are numerous old photographs that are well worth seeing, including many taken during some of the Academy Awards presentations held at the hotel, and some magnificent ballrooms that are works of art. There was a wedding reception being held in one of the ballrooms during our stay and the room looked stunning. We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and for the most part, I was really happy with the hotel. It's an experience I won't soon forget and I feel I'm lucky to have stayed in the same hotel as so many famous Hollywood stars from years ago. However, I wouldn't stay there again. I say that only because of the windows. If they removed the shutters (or even put them on the outside which would keep the same look) and put up blockout drapes in ALL the rooms it would make a huge difference and I'd be recommending this hotel to everyone as a 'must stay' location. If you can afford the extra dollars, book a room on the top two floors.

The hotel itself is beautiful and is practically a tourist attraction with its ornate ceilings and historic features. Overall, it has a lot of character. It was the perfect place for a wedding and looks gorgeous in photos. The pros: Downtown location Historic character and charm Fairly priced Larger room Has full service gym and a pool The Cons: Rooms are old and the heating/cooling, hot water, and insulation is not as good as a modern hotel. Noise from the street was audible in the room (in fact, they had a pair of ear plugs on the night stand) Not particularly luxurious in the room itself; but sufficient and clean. Hallway seemed a bit worn and the lighting was dull. OVERALL: For the money, I'd say this is a good deal for downtown Los Angeles. The hotel has a lot of character and, in my opinion, it means you will not forget your stay here as easily as a typical chain hotel. However, I am a bit disappointed that the rooms were not remodeled better and that the hotel has not resolved the issue of noise being audible in rooms. I've stayed in other historic hotels that have not had this issue (i.e. Reed House, Chattanooga, TN) and were remodeled better. So, I think there are ways for this hotel to improve itself. That said, price paid to value received was fair. So, I can recommend this to travelers. RECOMMENDATION: To avoid the exorbitant parking charges ($45/nt), I highly recommend parking at the Pershing Square garage. It is only $16. So, you save a lot of money in parking. Also, since it is across the street, it is not far from the hotel and fairly convenient.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible service, outdated policies, and a major disappointment.\u201d", "Author": "MrsHeter", "ReviewID": "UR53630102", "Content": "I've traveled all over the world and never have I left a hotel review.

It is gorgeous, the rooms are comfy and clean, and it really feels like you are getting to stay in part of the history of LA. The price was very reasonable for the quality of the hotel. BUT The day we arrived there was some kind of MASSIVE event being hosted there (maybe a talent show). The whole place was crowded with teenagers, and I really do mean packed. We walked into very tired (and grumpy) from our journey to a very loud and packed lobby and could barely see the check in desk through the crowd of teens coming and going. There was also a herd of people about 6 deep waiting for the elevators. I have been to hotel/conference centers etc. before, but have never previously felt like my enjoyment of a hotel was so severely impacted by its other activities. No the hotel shouldn't be expected to babysit its guests, but equally it does need to take responsibility for the comfort of all guests. Things that could have been done to improve our stay would particularly have included letting use use the service elevator to get to the room with our bags as we clearly couldnt fight our way into the standard elevators with them in the crowd, or implementing some kind of queueing system or reserving one carriage for guests not involved in the event. It would also have been nice if one of the staff had informed the teens when their behaviour was unreasonable (e.g. there was a group of boys practicing their drumming routine in the lobby the entire time we were checking in, and I couldn't believe a) that they thought it was appropriate in a public place, or b) that the staff didn't realise that this might be unpleasant for other guests and put a stop to it). I initialy thought this may be a one off incident, but the next day the lobby was in similar chaos, and the talent competition had gone and been replaced with some kind of graduation party, so I really dont understand why the hotel wasn't better equipped to handle these situations. Given the scale of the event and the impact that it had on our quiet enjoyment of our hotel room, I actually think that the hotel should have put up a warning about the talent event on its website for these dates, as it really isn't something you expect and does seriously affect other guests looking for a quiet place to stay.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quartz Hill, California", "Title": "\u201cOur Choice When Attending Music Center Events\u201d", "Author": "Gail1Marie", "ReviewID": "UR45958601", "Content": "A friend and I have season LA opera tickets, and rather than drive to downtown LA twice this past weekend, we stayed over at the Biltmore.

The first stay on third floor left me feeling very disappointed. There weren't enough furnishings and the ones that were there were ill-fitting or dated looking. The bathroom was small and also looked like it was in sore need of a face-lift. But I got a good deal from Orbitz and the location close to the convention center so I figured it was OK for what I paid. I didn't have a car with me so the high parking fee wasn't an issue. The public areas, as mentioned by others, is magnificent. A true taste of Hollywood from its Golden Age. It has a very rich, almost European feel to it. It is in definite sharp contrast to the homeless camp across the street that is Pershing Square. The swimming pool/fitness center is very nice as well. You can almost imagine the likes of Clark Gable swimming in that pool back in the olden days. The spa was out of commission on my first stay, big disappointment, but I did like the sauna. On the second stay later in the week, I got a room on the eight floor and that was fully refurbished. Let me tell you, what a difference! New tables, a chair with a big ottoman, fresh paint and the bathroom, although still on the small side, was completely renovated. It felt like a completely different hotel from the first stay. I'm guessing they are working on the renovations from the top down? The second stay, however brief, changed my view of the hotel rooms. My only complaints from the newly made over rooms was the tv was small and not a flat screen and the toilet still had an exposed flush valve; kind of cheap looking. Plus the noise from Pershing Square was audible at night. They have nightly concerts in the summer and they usually end around 10:30. Not that it was horribly loud but I'm a light sleeper so if you want to go to bed early, this might be a problem. Having said that, I thought the location was great. Pershing Square is a major hub of the LA Metro and for $5 a day you can get a pass that takes you practically all over the city. That is really the way to get around LA cheaply and quickly.

The windows do open (which I loved) and unlike other posters, provided no outside noise to keep me up. The way the floors are laid out, you can have a very long walk from the one set of elevators to your room. I didn't mind myself, but if you are a guest with problems walking ask ahead of time. The gym was good quality and the pool area was memorable. They restore the 1920s pool and bathing area to great effect. Also locker rooms, showers, sauna and steam available. Nice feature and all complimentary for guests. Most of the staff was wonderful: The parking valets, the bellman, the houseman, the waiters at Smeraldis (a nice restaurant in the lobby) and the man at the coffee stand were always cheery, friendly and accomodating. The problem is the front desk staff and the club lounge employees. I went to the front desk three times total. Each time no other guest was there. Each time no one looked up to acknowledge me. No one ever offered a smile, a greeting, anything. Now they don't need to become my friend, but it can be pricey to stay there. Checking in, my clerk mumbled about my room not being ready (at 4PM) and did I want him to block me to another room. Since I am not an expert on their room types, how am I suppose answer that? I asked if I should choose another and his answer was \"another room wouldnt be as good\". Not exactly what you want to hear upon arrival. So I waited an hour. The club lounge was nice, but the service was really spotty. The concierge and the waiter were usually involved in conversation. Two long discussions about another employee and uniform problems shouldn't be forced upon the hotel guests. ANother night I came up to use the lounge's computer (which is a lovely feature) and had to wait 15 minutes while the waiter looked some things up online.

In August, a full four months after the stay, my credit card billing statement reflected a charge of $645.00 from the Bilmore Hotel relating to that stay. This was inexplicable as my trip was fully prepaid to the travel agent. At hotel check-in I was asked for my credit card number to cover incidental charges that were not the responsibility of the travel agency (certainly a routine request).

I never dreamed another $645.00 charge would appear on my credit card months later. I immediately called the hotel and spoke to someone in the accounting department. They contend that the travel agent refused to pay their bil, so the hotel is billing the clients of the company for three of the seven nights of the stay.

He informed me that they would upgrade me to the club level as that had the quietest room. I didn't get to enjoy the club benefits, but there was no additional charge. He was absolutely right about the quietness of the room. It didn't have a great view as it looked out across a service alley to the back of another building, but it was absolutely silent. One downside is that the toilet had not been cleaned well. But I informed them of this at the front desk and it was handled while I was out at dinner.

The suite is big, at least 500 sq ft. It has a sitting area with sofas and coffee table, plus TV armoire. The bedroom section is very large, with a writing table and another TV armoire. I would say that the room is both old-style and just plain old. The 2 TVs in the room are still the old Magnavox CRT, hidden inside the armoires. The bathroom itself can really use a complete re-do. The sink/vanity is outside of the bathroom. The vanity, instead of standard hotel's marble or granite countertop, it is still the old tiled version. Amenities include a coffee maker, iron/ironing board, bathrobe/slippers, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion. No in-room safe and no mini-bar. Our room faces East right onto Pershing Sq, which brings up my major complaint. It is noisy. We are not used to city noise, and the buses which pass by Perhsing Sq are quite loud.

The bathroom was incredibly small. The room is very big; however, there are not enough furnishings to accommodate the size.

Built in the early 1920's, the decor and construction of the common areas reflect the opulence of the period and show an incredible attention to detail. The service is very good. If a bit more attention were paid to the maintenance of the rooms, it would make for an wonderful experience. My wife and I stayed at the Biltmore for Valentine's day weekend. Although we live in Los Angeles, I thought it would be a nice treat. Overall, we weren't disappointed. We really enjoyed our stay. We paid $169 per night for two nights in a king room on the Club Level. I thought it was a good bargain. Had the suites been more reasonably priced, I might have opted for that, but they wanted somewhere in the neighborhood of $450 per night, so I passed. Common Areas: Most of the common areas in the Biltmore are breathtaking. We entered through the Rendezvous Court, then up the staircase, past the elevators, through the Concourse, and into the Lobby to check in. I had been in the Biltmore before, but each of these areas had my wife looking around in wonder. The bar, ballroom, and other meeting rooms are also elegant and worth a look. The Club Level lounge was great. Although we weren't able to make it for the afternoon hors d'oeuvre, the breakfast was nice. Eggs, potatoes, pastries, fruit bowls, and parfaits. The decor was elegant and pleasant, with a good view of the city. The only common area I would say I was disappointed with was the pool, not because it wasn't nice, but because of the wasted potential. The pool itself is incredible. Great Neptune themed tilework, brass (I assume) railings surrounding the pool and the brass around the windows, the columns; it's a fantastic room. Unfortunately, they decided to put all the workout equipment in the areas surrounding the pool. It's all visible through the windows. It completely shatters the illusion. If the windows were mirrored, or the equipment were in some other way hidden from view, being in that pool room would be like being transported into the Great Gatsby. It's an opportunity for a unique experience that, unfortunately, isn't realized. The room: The room reminded me of staying in my 90 year old great aunt's house. Everything was quality, but old, which isn't necessarily bad, but lacked attention. We had a king room. The bed was comfortable. The furniture was faux antiques. Not anything amazing, but certainly much better than standard hotel furniture, and it was in keeping with the overall decor. The bathroom had nice period fixtures and was pleasant and adequate. The big problem with the room was the lack of maintenance. It wasn't horrible, but it could have been much better. The main problem was the dust. As another commenter wrote, the canopy over the bed and the curtains are both dust magnets, and should be cleaned frequently. I'm sure this isn't happening. On our last morning, I looked above the canopy and saw at least a couple of months worth of dust collected up there. While it didn't bother me terribly, my wife is allergic, and it really annoyed her. She could tell it was dusty, and we ended up sleeping with our heads at the foot of the bed. There are other maintenance issues as well. The curtains had tears on both sides at the point where the rod ends, no doubt due to years of friction. They need to be replaced. There was also a crack in the paint above the molding. It wouldn't take much to fix it. If these issues were sorted out it would bump up the Biltmore experience tremendously. Service: The service was good. The woman who took my original reservation over the phone was very pleasant and helpful. Check-in and check-out were fine. Someone dropped the ball on one request I had, though. I had asked for down free bedding when I reserved, and reconfirmed this a couple of days before check-in. It wasn't done. A phone call to room service and someone was up within ten minutes, but it should have been done right from the start. One thing I was impressed with: the hostess at the lounge asked me how I was enjoying my stay. When I mentioned about the dust, she immediately asked my room number and was going to send someone to clean. Unfortunately, we were checking out within a couple of hours, so it didn't help me, but the attitude was great. It should have occurred to me to call and have the dust cleaned earlier. I'm sure they would have taken care of it. Overall: Again, stunning common areas. Good service. Reasonable rates. More attention to details in the rooms would make the Biltmore a unique and unforgettable experience.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cClassic and Quiet\u201d", "Author": "mandieree", "ReviewID": "UR23807372", "Content": "This hotel exudes classic elegance, the lobby area is lovely and the bar is classic and sophisticated.

When I travel, I always request a corner room on a top floor. In addition, if a concierge or club level is available, this is what I reserve. We traveled to Los Angeles for our son's wedding on New Year's Eve. The bride had blocked rooms at the Kyoto Grand, however gave several other choices including the Millennium Biltmore, Westin Bonaventure, and Standard. We chose the Biltmore for nostalgic reasons given its history and are happy that we did. Upon entering the lobby, one can not help but get caught up in the opulence of the lobby, ballroom, and Gallery Bar. We so enjoyed taking a trip down \"memory lane\" while viewing all the old photographs of past movie stars and Academy Award celebrations. I had requested the club level (concierge level) when booking this hotel. Upon checking in, we were told that the club lounge was closed and we would receive vouchers for drinks and breakfast. I had asked for a large corner room with a rollaway, as our younger son was joining us. I was told that this should not be a problem in terms of size, however, it was. Thank goodness for Jose, the bellman. He showed us approximately five rooms on this level, none of which was ample size. With that, he phoned the front desk and informed Greg of our dilemma suggesting that maybe they could give us a junior suite. Greg was most accommodating, and did just that at no extra cost. In fact, they didn't even charge us for the rollaway! Although the suite was not on the club level, we still received club level amenities (cocktails, and full buffet breakfast which would have been continental had the lounge been open). The room was not renovated as were the ones on the club level floors, but it was very large and clean and housekeeping was most accommodating. I can not say enough about the staff at this \"Grand Lady\". From the parking valets, to the doormen, to the front desk staff, to the bellmen, to the housekeeping staff, waitstaff in the restaurant, and bartenders, their main goal was to make our stay as pleasant as possible, and it was! Given the circumstances, we needed to have a spacious room on this trip.

Was a little worried about staying at the hotel after reading some of the negative reviews, however I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. The hotel is amazing with a very grand feel. On other reviews people have said its old fashioned but I would say its more old style Hollywood glamour. It doesn't feel dated at all, gorgeous decor and the first floor reception and lobby are beautiful. I was shocked when we got to our room...it was HUGE and really lovely. It felt like a suite with a living area etc and a really big wardrobe. The bathroom was quite small but nice and clean. The hotel room had everything we needed, clean comfy beds, lots of info on LA, plenty of space and a big TV with lots of channels. I'm not sure if all the rooms at this hotel are the same but our room was massive. We ate at the Japanese restaurant on our first night as we was too tired to leave the building. Glad we did as it was delicious, really modern, quite pricy but definatly worth the money. Every member of staff at this hotel was lovely and helpful. Reception were extremely accommodating and couldn't do enough for you. The guy at the concierge was really helpful too. He helped us book loads of great things to do... tours etc and helped us save money whilst doing so..he also recommended good places to eat, and all that we tried were brilliant. We did a great tour of LA seeing the Hollywood houses, Chinese Theatre, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, Rodeo Drive etc. Was Fab and we got to see so much of LA that on our other days we could then go back to the places we enjoyed the most. Venice beach is really nice, and has a cool vibe to the place. I love shopping and found the best shops on Melrose avenue, the shops are different and unique there and a lot cheaper than Rodeo Drive or Robertson Drive! We didn't hire a car but buses and trains are very cheap! We didn't pay a lot to stay at this hotel at all and it definatly exceeded our expectations.

To begin with the good - the ground floors are absolutely gorgeous with a great deal of restored original architecture/decor from the 1920's. My room was only a standard but quite spacious with a very comfortable bed, desk, full closet and comfy chair. My room was on the inside of the building, overlooking a quiet courtyard and I heard virtually no outside noise thanks to the white noise generated by the heat/AC. And the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. The workout equipment in the health club facilities were a little squished and I think I used the oldest still-working elliptical machine in North America. But the treadmills are all pretty new and most machines have a personal flat screen. However, that was completely made up for by the rest of the facilities - the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and spa look original and made me feel like some robber baron in the gilded age. The location is excellent for business in or near downtown and is right in the heart of the financial district. It could also be a good choice for tourists because it is so close to the 101, 110, 5 and 10 freeways, so you can pretty much get anywhere. Now for the bad things - all of which are relatively minor and would not stop me from booking here again. First, like many hotels, they charge for internet access, which I find a highly offensive practice. Also, valet is $40/night. This is not unusual in LA, but should be factored into your budget. The tub/shower had a curtain, rather than a door, which kept sticking to me because it didn't have magnets in the bottom. This was particularly gross since the housekeeping seemed hit or miss - I had 3 great days and 2 \"eh\" days. The TV in my room was an old, small CRT type and many of the channels buzzed or otherwise had bad reception. Finally, when I ordered room service breakfast, my receipt had the wrong name and room number on it. When I asked, the staff person told me \"You must have written the wrong number on your ticket, this is for you.\" That was completely unacceptable at this level hotel.

The guest rooms vary widely: mine had an extra 150 sq. ft. of space which was devoid of furniture while other rooms felt cramped, both the result of a quirky building. Furnishings are elegant -- some might feel out of place in such surroundings. Maintenance is decent but imperfect -- expect some slight problem with the room. Some rooms face an ugly inside courtyard, but with the pretty wooden shutters, one hardly notices (even so, consider asking for an outside room). Some minor service issues, but nothing unexpected given the size of the hotel. The hotel does significant business with the consolidator AlliedTPro; if you're willing to prepay for your room, cheap rates can often be found on no-name booking sites, particularly those geared to European travelers. kayak.com was successful at finding several of those for me.

It has a real sense of 'Hollywood history' as so many films have been shot there and in the adjoining banqueting rooms. In fact whilst we were there, there was a film shoot in progess. Front desk staff are particulalry helpful. I was unhappy with my first Single King bed room because of the buzzing from an outside aircon fan and they found me a Double Queen room immediately which was quieter. The rooms itself are not as grand as the lobby. There is also a difference in size between the single King bed room and the double queen bed rooms. The double queen bed room was much bigger whilst the single King room was a bit on the small side. The rooms are clean but I would say that most of the furniture and TV are on the old side. The bathroom was also quite dated. It seems that very little investment has been made in updating rooms in the last 10 years. Wireless internet was expensive at $10 for every 24 hours. Another very expensive item was parking where only Valet parking is available and costs $40 per day. There is a cheaper underground car park for $15 per day opposite the hotel in Pershing Square. The swimming pool is very luxurious looking and made a nice start to every day. There is also a choice of both steam room and sauna room and a decent range of gym machines. Jacquzzi needs some of the jets to be fixed, however. Location was excellent if you do not have a car as there is a metro right outside in Pershing square that has a direct train to Hollywood and Universal studios and takes 15 and 20min respectively.

It turns out that they check out at 12pm. She obviously was new, or so I thought. Then when she charged my credit card for the usual incidentals, I asked how much would be held. She stated no more than $300.00, what she failed to mention that in addition there would be an automatic $300.00 tacked on at the end of that same night for a total of $600.00 being held. I asked someone else the next day when I checked my balance and saw that it appeared to be an extra charge, when they told me that it was not extra, that is usual and customary. I felt that it was deceitful. Be up front. Second, the hotel bathroom toilet had problems flushing. The paint was chipping, and the TV was quite small.

All I can say is that while some of the comments are valid, the good outweighs the bad at the Biltmore. We were 4 people staying in two rooms for 4 nights. While both rooms were the same price, one of them was really spacious with seating area and a large walk in closet, while the other was more or less a standard sized room. The smaller room also had the inconvenience of sharing an entryway with a locked door with another room, so we couldn't just go knock on our companion's door because they wouldn't hear us. The rooms were clean, though obviously not modern, which two of us found charming and two of us weren't as excited by. The beds were great, the linens were nice and the TV was decent sized. My Mom and I used the pool and the jacuzzi which was really something to see, though not the most functional in that the hot tub couldn't seat more than two people. I would agree with travellers who would say that there is nothing around the hotel and this part of the city is pretty dead in the evenings, but as we had other plans most of the time, this wasn't a problem for us. There are only a few restaurants around, but we found one we really enjoyed and went there twice. There are two big downsides we found. The first was the noise. My home is towndown Montreal and even I found it to be a bit noisy at night and in the early morning. Thicker, more soundproof windows would make a great difference. The second was the price of the valet parking at $40 a day. Yes we could have gone to the parking garage around the corner but we were doing a lot of in and out and it just seemed more convenient. But for that price, we would have expected that when we called ahead to have our car brought round we wouldn't have to wait, which was always the case. A small downside was not having ice on every floor, but that was minor.

No, no phone either. Ok, finally a phone behind the bar. Can you please send someone here to see why the jacuzzi is not working. 10 minutes later a guy comes, says nothing (like \"is everyhing allright?\" or even \"good evening sir\"), turns the machine on and goes away (still not saying a thing).

This means that prime tourist sites, such as Hollywood and Universal Studios are only about 20 minutes away. This was important for us because we didn't have a car to travel around.

This was my first trip to Los Angeles, and I was a little surprised to discover how little is actually going on downtown, especially after 5pm, when it turns into a bit of a ghost town. There is a Metro stop a couple blocks away, but the public transit system in LA leaves a lot to be desired. As for the hotel itself, most of the reviews that I've read on here are fairly accurate. The hotel is ancient by LA standards, and it shows in the rooms. The lobby and bar areas are very elegant and grand, and they set up your expectations of the rooms perhaps a little too high. When we got to the room we were quite underwhelmed. It was clean enough, but it's just very old. The door to the bathroom was heavy and creaked, the TV was laughable (I think it was 19\", and it was very old), and the bed itself was just OK. The mattress was clearly past its prime, although we did see a bunch of new mattresses being loaded into the hotel one day. Apparently they are going to replace all the mattresses this summer. I did enjoy the pool, which is a great old Roman tile type pool, although it would be better if it was open later (closes at 8). The workout room was small but will suffice if you're just looking to jump on the treadmill for 30 mins. The worst part of our stay was getting stuck in an elevator. We were going from the 5th floor down to the lobby when the elevator just stopped. We got management on the phone and they were very concerned and responsive, but there's not much you can do to console people when they're stuck in an elevator. We were in there for about 5 minutes (felt like an hour) when the elevator suddenly sprang back into action, went down to the lobby and the doors opened. Management met us there and seemed very concerned for our well being, although they had no explanation for why the elevator malfunctioned.

We chose it mostly because the price was right and the location was reasonable - good access to highways, and close by to some friends. The hotel is a historic property and there is ample evidence of old grandeur in the lobby, bar, and restaurants, which are really quite lovely. It certainly evokes a different era when you step through the doors into the hotel. Our room was suprisingly large with a view of downtown LA. We also had a very large walk in closet - the size of some kitchens in NYC. The bathroom was good sized and had a seperate tub and shower. The shower did not have any place to put anything other than a bar of soap which was a negative. The room has a box TV, desk, and chair. The biggest problem with the room is when you walk in, the first thing you see are very dated linens on the beds. The comforter is literally fraying at the edges and losing its color. The linens were of poor quality and need to be replaced. The carpet in the room was also coming up at the edges of the room and also was not high quality. Those are not things you would expect to encounter at a 4 star hotel. We also could have done without the prom on the Saturday evening of our stay. The lobby turned into an impromptu photo studio and those attending the prom spent a good deal of their time shuttling b/t the dance floor and various hotel rooms in a loud manner. Valet parking is $40 per day, and our car was always ready when we requested it. The hotel charges a fee for internet usage per day. Check in and check out were quick and painless. We did not eat at the restaurants or go to the bar in the hotel. Ultimately this hotel is a high end 3 star hotel, but the above mentioned problems keep it from attaining the 4 star status. Although we would stay at this hotel again if the price was right, we would not seek it out as a place to stay.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hayward, California", "Title": "\u201cNot the best choice in downtown L.A.\u201d", "Author": "sakio", "ReviewID": "UR16616201", "Content": "I really wanted to like this hotel, but can't say I could recommend it to anyone. First of all, I want to say the people that worked there were great. The front desk person checked me in really early and was about as nice as a person could get. The cleaning crew was always smiling and saying \"hi\" so I can't say anything but good things about them. The problems with this hotel are three things: 1. The hotel building is old. Sure, it's beautiful at the lobby level (actually stunning), but that age also makes the rooms small. I'm sure it may have been sufficient in the 1930's, but it's not even remotely up to par for the 21st Century. The bathroom fixtures are old and they make a lot of noise. 2. The room decoration was really cheap. The desk looked like something out of the Sears outdoor furniture collection and the TV.....a 13 incher. C'mon, I can accept the limitations of an old hotel, but a 13 inch TV obviously built in the late 70's or early 80\"s. I just couldn't believe my eyes. Motel 6's have better TV's than that. 3. The street noise, just awful. I've read the management notes on other reviews regarding this and I understand their point, but half of the rooms face the outside streets. You could do better on the lower floors with better insulated windows. I've stayed at older hotels all over the country on business. I've seen how it could be done well. The Roosevelt in Hollywood, The Adolphus in Dallas, the Michelangelo in NYC and the Palace in San Francisco do it right.

When I came to check in, despite the fact that we had made reservations weeks ahead, I was told there were no rooms left. A professional acquaintance of mine happened to arrive a little after I did and after we greeted each other, I was asked by the front desk if we would mind sharing a room!!! Despite not being happy about it, we acquiesced, given that there were \"no rooms left.\" Ultimately, after about 45 minutes, we were given a suite that had separate bedrooms, which was fine, but I had not intended to share a hotel room with someone I barely knew... The room was clean, but I must say I expected a little more in quality-the pillows (dense foam) were extremely uncomfortable and the polyester blankets were too hot. I also have to comment that I am extremely disappointed with the service. I had had a package shipped to the hotel in anticipation of a morning meeting the next day. By the time I got up to my hotel room after the check-in fiasco, it was already after 10:00 pm. I'd been told by the front desk that the package would be sent up to my room. At 10:45 pm it still was not there, so I called down to the front desk and informed them I was going to sleep and to please bring it in the morning before my 8:30 meeting. When it had not come in the morning before I had to go to the meeting, I went to the front desk, who sent me to the bell desk, who then called down to the shipping room to locate the package. They asked me to wait while they went downstairs to retrieve it rather than just bringing it to the meeting room.

The hotel's common areas on the ground floor are simly majestic (a mixture between Alphonso XIII in Seville and Nacional de Cuba in Havana). However this is where the beauty stops, as my room had no views (imagine a U shaped wall and my window at the base at the U - limited views). The most upsetting though after spending all this time on e-mails was the room location on a busy hallway. It was very difficult to sleep (after a 11h flight and 8h difference with London) with all the disconsiderate young girls shouting on the hallway up to 3am LA time (the doors were so thin), nevermind the engine like permanent noise that came from somewhere outside (probably underground) that made even things in the bathroom vibrate). The room did not have double glazing was very basic and looks like a 2 or 3 star hotel. I was offered a room on the next floor but just above, so probably the same problems. At 4am I went to the Business Room to print 2 pages that cost me together with 6min spent online the amount of almost 7 dollars (could be pricey for the Americans).

Everything from the lobby area to the hallways and the architecture was beautiful! I stayed in one of the Club Rooms (business travelers) on the 10th / 11th floor. One of the perks of these rooms is that you have access to the business lounge on the 10th floor which offers continental breakfast in the morning and refreshments in the evening (all inclusive of your room rate). Keep in mind, you are paying a higher room rate, so not sure if it's necessarily worth it for leisure travelers. The breakfast was average (coffee, juices, cereal, fruit & yogurt, and some pastries) and the evening refreshments consisted of sodas, crackers & cheese & meat, fruits, and cookies. It was a nice set-up in a lounge area with tables and couches and flat screen tv's. Internet access is also free should you have access to the lounge. Speaking of Internet access, it costs $9.95 for a 24 hr period from your room. Also, because the building is older, wireless reception is not that great and the signal quite weak. Make sure to bring an ethernet cable along to plug into. Cell phone reception is also quite weak -- mine kept fading in and out depending on where I was in the hotel/room, so beware of that. The room size was awesome. So much floor space and a sitting area with couch and table also. Not sure if this was just available for Club Rooms, or it's a standard feature. The only disappointment was the bathroom size. On one hand you have a HUGE room with TONS of floor space and even a walk-in closet, yet the bathroom was TINY with not much room to move in at all. Also, the tub was in bad shape -- cracks in the drainage area. I think the bathroom needed a renovation. All in all, great place to stay. Excellent location, if you want to be in downtown. Seems like there were quite a few restaurants in the area. I didn't have much time to get out, so I grabbed a bite at Smeraldi's one night and Sai Sai the next night.

I'm not sure I've ever seen a property with so many high reviews right after or before low reviews. I was intrigued and decided to check this property out for myself. I stayed one night during the week and booked a special rate, which also meant that my expectations were quite low for the type of room and service I thought I would receive. I chose to park at Pershing Square across Olive Street and pay $14.00 instead of the $30+ valet at the property itself. Parking at Pershing Square was very convenient (ride the escalator up to the ground level and walk across the crosswalk to the hotel) and also appeared to be quite safe. Security there is very present. Check-in was not only quick and efficient, but also quite friendly. I'm a firm believer that you reap what you sow, especially in large properties that see a constant stream of travelers, many of whom are less than patient. I greeted the front desk clerk with a smile and was treated with a kind, professional demeanor in return. Others have reported problems in this area, but I can honestly say that I saw no issue here. The bellman was also helpful when I asked about parking safety at Pershing Square. The location was perfect for my needs, in the heart of downtown and close to the 101 with easy access to other freeways. My room didn't have the best view, but again ... this was a special rate room. Room 329, though, did have a king sized bed, windows that let in plenty of light, and a headboard that was made up of substantial columns rising to the ceiling ... quite different than that of other photos posted by other reviewers on TripAdvisor. The carpet was in fine shape, the bathroom was in decent shape, and the room was appointed nicely. This is a historic property and one needs to keep that in mind when staying here. It is meant to have some \"old world\" charm. It does and I think it carries that off fairly nicely. \"Old world charm\" doesn't necessitate using cheap sheets and bed coverings, though. Millennium should be ashamed of themselves for keeping very low end linens in this property. That's such an easy thing to update and such an important part of an overall stay. The mattress, too, is absolutely sub-par. I've had better beds and linens in Holiday Inns and Travelodges. That charm requires a certain amount of maintenance, too. The Biltmore could stand some maintenance in spots: mouldings chipped, scuffs along the baseboards, chipping paint on the window panes. Another item that the staff really needs to pay better attention to is the amount of catering/room service items left in the hallways. I was amazed at the sheer volume of items outside doors as I walked to my room ... glasses, trays, half-eaten meals, etc. Most, if not all of it stayed there for the duration of my 1-night visit. Overall, I think many of the lower reviews for this property have been too harsh.

However, the staff was responsive, and the lobby is indeed gorgeous. If you don't like the hotel restaurant, check out the many fine dining establishments now commonplace in downtown LA. Need a car? There's an Enterprise office across the street. There's a lot of potential around the Biltmore. Overall, though, the Biltmore was fine. It definitely wasn't a four-star hotel, and you're likely best off booking it through Priceline or Hotwire.

I arrived around 7pm on the evening of the 25th and was quickly helped with the bellman and the car was whisked away within seconds of it being unloaded. There was no wait at check-in which was polite and professional and the bellman literally followed us to the room with my friend and I with the only exception him taking the service elevator while we took the public one even though we both met up on the 8th floor at the same time. He quickly showed us to our room and unloaded all of our bags as my friend had quite the shopping trip on Rodeo Dr. earlier in the day and asked if we needed anything additional and even offered to fill our ice bucket which I thought was a nice touch. As we planned to go out later in the evening I called ahead for the valet to get the car ready and by the time we walked down after the call which was approx 10 minutes the car was ready and waiting for us. As stated in previous posts with it being an older holtel the rooms vary in size but the room I was located in was quite large and maybe even a bit too large with the furniture that was in the room. I do believe the room could use a bit of an upgrade in terms of bedding but the rest of the furniture seemed plentiful and there were plenty of both electrical outlets in the room for all of the stylist products of my friend to use. While the view of the room wasn't much you could see parts of Olive St which is better then most buildings which are smaller in size in crowded downtowns. Check-out was fast and efficent and once again I called down to have the valet get the car ready ahead of time and this time it was only about 5 minutes after I left the room and the car was ready and waiting once again.

We booked this as a special treat to ourselves because we could not afford a honeymoon since we are both graduate students. Since we are both history buffs, we booked the Biltmore for its historical value and it seemed like the closest we could get to European grandeur without having to go to Europe (or Vegas, heaven forbid). Like others have stated, the entrance of the hotel is spectacular and the pictures speak for themselves. We booked a standard room but we were hoping to get a free room upgrade as most similar-class hotels provide this service for new bride and grooms. In fact, nearly all of our friends received free room upgrades and complimentary champagne and strawberries on their wedding nights in similar hotels in the area such as the hilton, westin, intercontinental, and the hyatt. We walked in with our full wedding attire and received many congratulations from random people. However, we were only met with rudeness with the concierge. The service was curt, there was no mention of congratulation, and when we asked if any kind of upgrades or services were available, the front desk person seemed appalled that we should even ask. When we mentioned our friends who had received this service at the Omni recently, they said, \"Well then maybe you should have booked at the Omni.\" We were not expecting or demanding any kind of upgrade; we just inquired based upon the experiences of our other married friends. The fact that we were rebuffed in such a rude way was a major sore spot on our wedding night. The room we did end up staying in was almost offensive for the price we paid- we have even stayed in nicer hostels in Europe for a fraction of the price. My husband felt sorry that we had to spend our wedding night like this and we were very close to getting another room at the Bonaventure just down the street. We have stayed in their rooms and although they are small, the furnishings and decor are up to par with a 4 star hotel. We even called the Bonaventure from our Biltmore hotel room to inquire about room availabilities, and when we asked about services for new bride and grooms, the concierge replied professionally and guaranteed that yes, the Bonaventure always provides room upgrades for bride and grooms based on room availability, and we would have definitely received a suite if we had booked that evening. We ultimately decided not to book since we were so exhausted from the wedding and we didn't want to have to pay another $35 for valet parking on top of a wasted hotel night fee. The grand days of the BIltmore are certainly behind it. Judging by the service, you can tell that the hotel is struggling as it cannot keep up with its competitors in standard measures of hospitality.

We recently paid the same price for a fleebag motel in Monterey. Pros: * Amazing public spaces. I felt like I was transported to the glamour days of Hollywood past. Felt like a grand old New York style hotel. * Great bar. Not the sports bar, but the main bar attached to the lobby -- was gorgeous. Drinks however, were expensive. My Appletini was $14!! Free nuts though. * Room was charming. High ceilings, nice moulding, bed was comfortable and room was quiet. Who cares that the tv was a bit small...we were not there to watch the tube. *Easy to find. * Neighborhood is not 'scary' like other people have reported. It's just in a business district so there's not a lot going on at night. You'll need to drive if you want nightlife, unless of course you walk over to the Standard Hotel's roof top bar / club which is great. CONS: * Sports bar: ech. Dark, dingy, did not serve late night food. Actually it was really difficult to find late night eats besides the room service menu. * Expensive valet parking at $32 per stay. Also it was very crowded and there was an air of confusion where you drive up. Your car is whisked away before you even know what's going on. Make sure you have all your things with you when you exit your vehicle, I heard it was very difficult to retrieve items after the car has been parked. ************************** We didn't visit the pool which I would have liked to comment on but the pictures look amazing.

After checking in and tkaing photos we were handed an 11 page list of all the films and television shows that were filmed there with the most recent being Dreamgirls, Mr. Deeds, Italian Job, etc. Hollywood apparently knows what type of grandeur this hotel offers. Anywhere in the hotel you felt as though you were among royalty and that old souls had walked the halls and stayed in the rooms.

We had a junior suite and when I called to check my reservation I asked if there was a fridge in the room and was assured there would be. However upon arrival there was not one in our suite.

I travel quite a bit for business, and at this hotel, I feel it's all about the lobby and public areas and the guest rooms are sadly overlooked. When I arrived, I was definitely impressed. The lobby and front desk areas are truly stunning. Front desk clerk tried to \"upgrade\" me at check in (for a $50/night fee). I declined.

What I can't understand, however, is the lack of quality in everything *inside* those guest rooms - small or large. Sheets were thin and paper-like, the pillows were like burlap sacks, the comforter was ratty, and bathroom amenities (shampoos, soaps, etc.) were never replaced during my entire stay even though I used them. In fact, one day the maid knocked a lampshade off the lamp when making the bed, and even though she was back to the room two additional nights - it was never fixed.

Those days are over - I have strict budgets I need to adhere to when I travel for business, and I don't appreciate a $6 charge to print out my boarding passes for my flight (grand total of time in the business center - 3 minutes).

We were here for 4 days only and will not be returning. If you are going to LA for the first time, then look at Santa Monica, Anaheim and Pasadena as alternative places to stay. They are tourist friendly and near to all you will need to do whilst in LA. Avoid the Downtown at all costs.

On arrival, we were greeted in a friendly and efficient manner and directed to our room. The hotel lobby and all the public areas were fantastic. Not exactly my style hotel, I'm more into contemporary decor but the public areas in this hotel looked fantastic with their traditional decor. Once we entered the corridor from the lift though, we noticed that the standard had dropped dramatically. Instead of looking fresh like the lobby, the corridor looked very dated and in need of some redecoration. Once we entered the room, in this 4 star (?!) hotel, we were not too pleased at all. It was grubby in fact. I moved a chair towards the wall to make a bit more space and there were crumbs from the previous guests there which were obviously not cleaned properly. The room was dark, the bathroom was completely outdated, with dirty looking old tiles and the wooden panelling was painted white a long time ago but was now a dirty yellowy colour. Nothing special about this bathroom at all. I wasn't impressed. I was going to complain and ask to change rooms but I decided maybe that I was just expecting too much and that if this room was like this then all of them probably would. Later then we lay on the bed with the intention of watching telly for a while. There was a large mahogony television/drawers unit a few feet away from the end of the bed but with the side of it facing the bed. We pulled out the sliding tray with the television on it as far as we could and swivelled it as far as we could but we still could not comfortably see the television from the bed. This was a very bad set up altogether. Mind you there was 2 chairs in front of the television unit so perhaps you're only meant to watch television from there?! The concierge though, was very helpful, he helped us to organise a rental car and a day trip to Disneyland, he was a brilliant help to us I must say this. On our first morning, we went for breakfast in the hotels restaurant (we mistakenly thought it was included in the price - our fault). We walked in and it seemed to be a bit of a help yourself/we'll take your order at the table set up, so as the waiters were staring at us (but not approaching to explain the routine) we felt under pressure to just do something. So we took a seat at a free table. The waiter then approached and asked if he could take our order, I just wanted a bowl of Frosties and a slice of toast and my boyfriend ordered an omlette. I got the feeling from the waiter that we must have been doing something wrong with the ordering, and caused him some inconvenience but he never took the time to explain what we were supposed to do therefore how could we rectify this? As a result of whatever we did wrong?? the waiter proceded to be quite rude and abrupt to us throughout serving us. He nearly cut me with a look when I asked for a 2nd glass of orange juice. Next thing shock horror, the bill arrived for the breakfast! You won't believe the price. 7 dollars plus tax for a small bowl of Frosties, 5 dollars plus tax for ONE slice of toast with butter, 3 dollars each for the small glasses of orange juice and 15 dollars for an omlette served with a few breakfast potatoes. When we queried the waiter politely as to whether or not breakfast was included he stomped off to check with reception, he came back and said that it wasn't so we didn't argue and took the bill. He left us momentarily while we organised the money. The total bill including tax was around 38 dollars so we put 40 dollars in the bill booklet and as we stood to leave the waiter practically ran over to our table and picked up the bill booklet, in front of us, he rudely opened the bill, acknowledged the 40 dollars and threw his eyes to heaven with a loud \"tut\" because clearly he didn't think that 2 dollars was enough of a tip for making people feel uncomfortable and being rude right throughout our service. The Sports Bar in the hotel was very dingy and really undesirable but we ate there the first night, the food was only ok and a homeless person managed to come in and hassle us for a tip while we were eating. Location-wise, the hotel was only ok too. We rented a car for a day or two which was great and also the metro stop was only around the corner which brought you to most places easily enough but it was a bit of a trek out to Hollywood and Universal Studios. The gym and swimming pool were very poor as well unfortunatlely and we didn't feel the urge to use these facilities once we saw them. Unfortunately, for the price we paid for the grubby accomodation and especially the measly overpriced breakfast, and the rudeness of that waiter, the dirt of the Sports Bar, it was just enough for me to say that for your money you could probably get a better hotel in LA in possibly a better location. I honestly wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone - especially tourists, maybe we had that look about us that they felt they could throw us in any old room and we'd be content because to be honest the hotel seems to hold a lot of business conferences etc during the day and the restaurant where we had breakfast seems to be a classy financial district type restaurant where professionals go for business meetings over dinner or something. They could do with concentrating on their accommodation though. Unless there was a different set of rooms for business guests, then I don't understand how they would stay in this hotel over night?!", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed the Millenium!\u201d", "Author": "susiebee2002", "ReviewID": "UR7565625", "Content": "My husband & I stayed two nights at the Millenium Biltmore in LA while waiting to board a cruise ship.

However, after, that there way no wait and I was on my way to my room. It was unacceptable. First, the room looked like something out of the 1950s -- an older looking, low-level queen bed complete with a 1950s/1960s style cream bedspread and dust ruffle that didn't match, didn't fit, and was torn. There's good retro and bad retro; this was bad. The carpet was stained. The room was very, very small and very dark. The view was of a wall. The bathroom was tiny and poorly remodeled. There was one wing-back chair that looked incredibly uncomfortable. Also, the room was so small that you couldn't possibly sit in the chair and watch TV. TV was on the dresser. There was a desk with a desk chair. However, the desk was the only table in the room. There was no nightstand -- some weird heavy box-like object (like an overturned computer box) was lying on the floor right next to the bed with various wires attached to it. Not sure what it was or what it was for. But no bed light, no place to put anything if you lay in bed. I didn't see a clock. The only phone was on the desk -- not reachable from the bed. The worst part, however, was that there were huge stains on the cream-colored bedspread. At that point, I demanded a new room. I was upgraded to a \"junior suite.\" Very large with separate sitting room, but the furniture was still somewhat dated and I couldn't fairly describe the suite as attractive or luxurious. The carpet was stained. Tiles were missing from the dressing area counter. The TVs (there were 2) were only 19\" at best. The bathroom was ok but small and also a bit dated. Also, no mini-bar and no bottled water, coffee or tea. Not sure if there were vending machines but, other than tap water, nothing in the room to drink. Service was unremarkable -- neither great nor bad. Concierge was helpful. Checkout was slow -- there were 7 people in line and only one person to provide assistance. Room service (breakfast) was fine -- prompt and tasty. Had dinner in the Japanese restaurant; it was good as was the service there. Didn't make use of other hotel facilities. I get the impression that what room you end up with could mean the difference between a decent stay and an unsatisfactory one but am not sure what room or type of room you need to request. There is a club level -- didn't stay there but maybe it's better. Overall, my experience was merely okay (once I was in the second room).

I was on the 7th floor and would have sworn my window was open. The old original windows are in place and the plantation shutters (with some broken pieces) did nothing to muffle the noise. Neither did the drapes.

Lets start with the positve: the price - very good value especially if it includes breakfast. The buliding is very impressive - very grand and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and attention from the waiters very good. We liked the location and used the nearby subway station at Pershing Square to get to Univeral Studios and Hollywood. The public transport is very cheap and efficient. We even got the bus to Santa Monica !! However there are some negatives: We arrived at 4.30pm after a flight from the UK. At first we were told there were no rooms available(despite booking and paying well in advance with a very reputable company in the UK). The receptionist then offered us 1 upgraded room on the Club floor (but not allowed to use the extra facilities on that floor) and were told to phone down at 8 pm to see if our other room was available. So 5 of us - 3 adults and 2 kids (aged 12 and 13) tried to get a bit of rest in a room with 2 double beds. We were lucky - a gentleman checking in at the same time was sent away despite having a reservation number. At 8pm we were advised that our room would not be available until 11pm!!! At this point we spoke to the manger and told him we were going for a meal and when we got back we wanted a room or another hotel. Half an hour later we had our 2nd room - albeit 2 floors below the other one. Because of this probem we did manage to get a late check out free of charge the day we left but only because we asked and it was given grudgingly. The receptionist seemed to think that 1 upgraded room was sufficient compensation. On that subject, the only difference I could see between the club rooms and the standard rooms was the decor, newspaper deliverd to the room and free bottled water! Rooms were clean and comfortable but in need of a little TLC - a bit worn in places and in need of an upgrade. Bath rooms are small even by British standards and definatley in need of an upgrade. Pool - not in use as under repair Location good but a lot of panhandlers about - no problems but may make some people uneasy.

The neighborhood??? I felt comfortable going for walks at 6 in the morning or 10 at nite. as far as the homeless, they are far more polite than the homeless I have met in other cities. More importantly if you take the time to talk to them you will realize that they are just like the rest of us. They were great and no reason to be afraid of them. They are also polite enough to say hello every day and remember you. All in all the Biltmore and the neighborhood were great. If some one wants to stay downtown this is the place to be, a nice easy 15 minute walk to the staples center or the convention center. the staff need to be commended for their positive attitudes and although I am not a world traveler, I would will out any hesitation at all recommend the Biltmore.

As for food, the dinning at the hotel was a bit to pricey for me but there are tons of fast food and small places around the area. Not to mention that Domino's pizza delivers to the hotel. The concierge desk was SO helpful with all information that I needed, from places to eat downtown, to museum hours during the holidays, to getting history on the hotel. The room was very comfortable and clean. There was no mini-bar but I was thankful not to have that temptation. I had just a regular room and was very happy with my choice. All in all I would recommend this for anyone. Very pleasent place to stay within a piece of Downtown Los Angeles history.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pacifica, California", "Title": "\u201cI Love an Old Hotel\u201d", "Author": "dsikula", "ReviewID": "UR4252802", "Content": "Just spent a long weekend at the Biltmore.

We then checked in (knowing we had 9:30 p.m. reservations at their restaurant. It is published as being open till 10:00. The desk did call to say we would be late.) We then asked for our bags to be taken to the room so we could go to dinner. No can do - The bell hop said - You must be in the room and we cannot deliver for 15 minutes. We explained our dinner reservations and he said - TOO BAD! He did relent and take them up about 5 minutes later. We then got to the restaurant at 9:40 p.m. Ugh! We were basically blasted by the extremely unfriendly hostess - this lady should get a new job!!! She is one heck of an unpleasant person to deal with and said - You are bad people - You did not call to cancel your reservations - We are closing the restaurant now - We won't seat you. Get out! Ugh! Here we are hotel guests - who have been mistreated by the hotel - and here we are getting yelled at. We then went upstairs to talk to the front desk. Ugh! He suggested a couple of places we could have dinner....he said only a few blocks away. We arrived at 2 of them and they both were closing at 10 p.m. We then asked the last place - Know of any places that stay open. Luckily the Standard does! And the Standard Hotel actually has Great Food and a fun bar area! We then went back to our room. The toilet was broken....we had to wait an hour for it to get fixed. We also found the bathroom extremely \"tight\" corners. Ugh! For the price, its not worth staying here.... We did find the room service menu to be good and enjoyed the room service Japanese breakfast. Of couse, when we got to use their in room check-out, it too was non functional.

Other than that, the room was fine. Our stay included complimentary drinks, which we took advantage of. I'm not much of a drinker and my martini was a bit strong - the bartender went out of his way to ask if it was ok and offered to water it down a bit, which was a pretty cool thing to offer for a novice drinker like me!

We were excited about this perk until we walked into our room and found 2 double beds instead of the king we had requested. We called the front desk and they agreed to move us to the next room. When we moved into the hallway to wait for our key to be delivered, we were greeted by a very unpleasant suprise--we could hear very loud music and other sounds coming from a room on our hall. The walls are apparently very thin! We called the front desk again and they agreed to move us to yet another room. They also sent security up promptly to take care of the noisy guests. Our new room was very clean and nicely decorated (even mints on the pillows). However, don't be suprised by the very small bathroom. The bed was also very comfortable! The front desk and concierge were not very helpful at times, but occasionally provided good assistance. The valet (which is required) was slow and needs more workers. We made the mistake several times of trying to get our car at noon or 5:00 (when business meetings from hotel ballrooms were letting out) and eventually gave up on getting our car because of the long line. Also, be sure to call well in advance of needing your vehicle, or you will be waiting a long time! The hotel is truly a classic beauty in the midst of a dingy downtown area. There is a ton of history (spend some time looking at the pictures of all of the academy awards held on premises) and the historic decor has been well maintained. We always felt very safe and taken care of. The hotel is also conveniently located to many different LA destinations.

The standard room is adorned with oil paintings and beautiful furniture - the bed was very comfortable. It has a coffee maker. The club room is of course, bigger and more luxuriously furnished. It does not have a coffee maker but you can request one - I suppose the reason is that club room guests have access to the club lounge and are served complimentary beverages (including alcohol) and snacks from 5 - 8pm. There was no fridge in both rooms but ice is available on various floors. We throughly enjoyed our experience at the Millennium Biltmore. The service was great - we were pleased with the room service, bell service, concierge, front desk and housekeeping. We also enjoyed traditional afternoon tea at the Rendevous Court and were impressed by the spread of delightful sandwiches, tarts and cakes. The prices of food at the Rendevous Court are very reasonable and it has a wonderful ambience, casual yet stylish with a fountain in the centre of the room. We had breakfast at Smeraldi's (another reaturant in the hotel) and the food was great. While we were there, two weddings were held in the ballroom. We had a peek through the entrance of the ballroom while they were getting the ballroom ready and it was just so beautiful!! The hotel is also a short walk to department stores such as Macy's and Robinson May's with a number of cafes and restaurants within its vicinity.

You feel like you are walking back in time as you walk through the halls and lobby. There is even a hall full of photos from the first Academy Awards ceremony held in the ballroom. We had no problems with the people who worked at the hotel, from the check-in clerk to the valet parking attendents. Everyone was nice and friendly to us. Our room, which we booked on Priceline, was upgraded to a suite! What a pleasant surprise! There were four of us, my husband and I and our two young children, so the extra space was a wonderful bonus. The suite was the size of a small apartment, complete with a small entry hall, huge living room and dining room plus wet bar and refrigerator, and a separate spacious bedroom (with 2 double beds) and bathroom. There were two TVs, so the kids could watch their shows on one. The rooms were all clean and nicely furnished. The windows had shutters which blocked out the sunlight in the morning. Our suite was located on a corner, so we could see across the street towards Pershing Plaza and over the roof top of a lower building. We felt very comfortable and safe staying here. I peeked into a standard room, and I can report that a standard room is just as spacious as an average hotel room. The same as the bedroom in our suite. I would not have been disappointed with a standard room at all! And all the reviews that mentioned \"no coffee maker\"...we had one, maybe it came with the suite. But you can always REQUEST A COFFEEMAKER for FREE--it is stated in the hotel's guest room book. It also includes packets of coffee and paper cups with sip and go lids. Our only complaint about the room was that the water temperature in the bathroom was uneven. This happened a lot with the shower. The water temperature from the sink was ok. Also, it took forever for any hot water to reach us during the \"slow\" time (Wed & Thurs) in the hotel. Once there were more guests on Friday and Saturday did the hot water come on as soon as we turned it on. I think they need to upgrade the bathrooms, especially the showers! Although we understand that parking space is a premium in downtown LA, or ANYWHERE in LA for that matter, we weren't thrilled about the $24.00 per day valet parking fee. Yes, there are other garages across the street and around the block, but they charge a $6.00 fee for evening entry (between 5pm-12am) and then they charge $2.00 per hour after 12am. The total comes out to be close to $24.00--not much of a savings there. We figured that the money we saved on the hotel room went toward parking, so overall everything evened out at $100 per night.

I booked the hotel about two months in advance for three nights, the first of which was a Universal Studios package (breakfast, Uni Studios tickets and valet parking), the other two the weekend package which included the valet parking. The rates were very admittedly good and unlike one of the reviews I read, the hotel was actually extremely easy to find using google map directions to aide me however upon arriving at the hotel we had to wait for 20 minutes to get into the valet parking area (granted they were having a prom that night). Once we got into the reception area (beautiful but quite empty looking - could use a decorator) we were greeted (and I use that word with a grain of salt) at the check-in counter by a very rude young man who made me feel quite uncomfortable. We got up to our room which was very pretty indeed - until I went into the bathroom where there was a reddish sort of stain on the bathtub and the fixtures were so dirty they looked as though they'd never been cleaned and until I saw the view - we were also on a 'club floor' but with a distressing view of the back of the other building. We waited for our luggage to arrive as we were wanting to go out that evening and needed to change but the time ticked on and on and still no luggage. I also realized that we weren't given our Universal Studios tickets when we checked in nor was there a hotel directory (with room service menu etc) in the room so I called the bellhop to find out where our luggage might be. I was asked by the lady if we had asked for our luggage to be brought up (umm-yup?) to which I of course replied yes, we asked the valet to send it up and even told him exactly which bags were needed. After putting me on hold for an interminable length of time she came back on the phone to say we didn't know you wanted it brought in (umm that's interesting since we were on record with reservations for three days so not really sure what we would do without our luggage which was in plain view in the car!!) and would I like directions to my car so I could go and get it? No exaggeration. Well, I've never been asked this before and was more than a little dumbfounded but after gathering my wits I nicely said no I was under the impression the bellhop would be bringing it up. She then transferred me to the bellhop who shockingly also asked if I would like to come down and get it!! To put this into perspective, my 11 yr old daughter and I were on a three week roadtrip, we had two large suitcases, one smaller suitcase, one laptop, one large toiletries bag and other sundry bags which we carried in ourselves so this was not a manageable amount of luggage for me to go and \"pick up\" from the lobby. Anyway, they eventually brought it up but let me tell you it was hard to give the guy a tip (even though of course none of it was his fault). I then phoned the front desk to ask about the Uni Studios tickets which they questioned me on saying they had been given to me at check-in which I was again surprised to hear (I guess they didn't believe me?) I told her they had not been given to me which I should think would easily enough be checked. I was again put on hold for ages and when she finally came back she tersely said she'd send them up. I then had to ask her about the hotel directory which she said was a housekeeping issue and that I'd have to speak with them about it at which point she then transferred me although I half expected her to hang up so I'd have to phone them myself. I spoke to housekeeping who were very nice. Our luggage still had not arrived, in fact when it eventually DID arrive it had taken an hour and fifteen minutes. By this time it was too late for us to make our dinner reservations in West Hollywood that I'd had for a month so we had little choice but to order from the room service menu and unlike the person from Nebraska who commented that the prices were reasonable (omg - $16 for a hamburger is not what I call reasonable) I must heartily disagree with them and believe me, I'm not the most budget-minded person by any stretch of the imagination. The bill came...$36 for 1 hamburger, 1 tiny half bottle of 7-Up and 1 piece of apple pie with ice cream which included (although I was not informed about this) the gratuity (I added tip to make the total $40) and taxes. When I phoned a day later to ask why the bill was so high they then told me the gratuity was already added and said they'd refund my $4 tip! - this was not in fact done not that it would have made a difference anyway) Quite unbelievable. I very badly wanted to complain about the whole experience but thought I'd wait another night and see how things went. I didn't end up complaining though I truly wish I had done but only because the person who checked us out was so rude and made me feel so uncomfortable that I felt terribly intimidated - he didn't even ask how our stay was (that would have been the point where I would have said something) or whether everything was to our liking - questions which I have come to expect from the calibre of the hotels I stay in. This all says nothing about the surrounding area which is INDEED slummy looking. The area coming from the north from the highway to the hotel is fine (Mus of Metropolitan Art, etc) but the area an immediate block south and all around from there becomes highly unsafe looking and feeling. I had to advise my daughter not to look at anyone as we were driving by, the area IS ugly and scary looking. Your member from Canoga Park who said the area is NOT unsafe is kidding themselves, when he says \"further east of the hotel\" he must mean by further, a block, east, west and south as well and I would under no circumstances walk around with my daughter in the area surrounding the hotel, in fact I wouldn't chance it with a male adult either. I will never stay in this hotel again unless they were to take some serious instruction in customer service and the art of dealing with people effectively. Do these people care at all about how they represent the hotel and the impression they leave people? Apparently not but the hotel management should be advised that this is the downfall of the hotel and a probable reason why they get little repeat business. The hotel's architecture is so very, very beautiful and it's history so steeped in tradition that it's a very big shame it should be ruined by the lacking service of many of it's front-line staff. Shame on this hotel and shame on many of it's employees - a HUGE disappointment.", "Date": "June 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grants Pass, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cYou'll never leave the Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3545318", "Content": "I stayed here for five nights in the begining of June.

Well, we wish we hadn't kept our promise! When we arrived, the front desk peronnel wasn't as friendly as the last time. In fact, they weren't helpful at all. It was the bellhop who was sooooooooo nice. Without asking, he told us everything about LA and what we could do and where we could go. He also told us about the hotel amenities. He was very informative. We stayed on the 10th floor, which is the Club Level. We were told at check in that the rooms had been renovated and we would be very happy with ours. Oh my. If our room had been renovated, I would hate to see the rest. The 10th floor smelled old and musty. Our room and bathroom were dirty. The walls looked patched up and the shower head was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been cleaned since it was first installed. When I sat on the bed, it felt hard as a rock, so I called down to housekeeping to ask for a bed pad. The lady told me she didn't think they had pads and I should call the front desk and ask to be moved since most of the mattresses had been replaced in the last year, but our mattress was one of the ones that hadn't. So, I called down to front desk who said they would check on it for me. When front desk called back, she rudely informed me the mattresses on our floor hadn't been replaced and there was nothing she could do. She said she would send housekeeping up to put a pad on the bed. They did, but I had to jump thru hoops to get it. Because we stayed on the club level, we had evening \"snacks\" and continental breakfast. WOW!!! That was definitely worth the upgrade. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful, with fresh pastries, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh oj and the freshest/sweetest mix of berries I've ever eaten. We ate at Sai Sai, the on-site Japanese restaurant. We had eaten there before and had a wonderful experience. Not so this time. The waitress handed us our menus and returned about 3 minutes later (no exaggeration) and asked us if we had made up our minds. When we told her we needed more time, she became irritated. She hovered over us (without being helpful) the whole time and we felt like we shouldn't be there. It was very uncomfortable. And then our food arrived cold. The 10th floor concierge was definitely much more helpful and friendly than the lobby staff. The gentleman manning the concierge desk spent a considerable amount of time showing us maps of LA and telling us where to go and where to eat. We followed most of his suggestions and weren't disappointed. Check out was a different story. The valet staff must have been in a bad mood because they were rude to everyone. People were complaining to management and staff. It was sad. I'm not sure what happened at this hotel in the last few years, but our stay at the Biltmore was a big disappointment for us and we won't be back. I've stayed at some \"old\" hotels that have updated their facilities without losing their historical charm. Unfortunately, the Biltmore isn't one of those places. I also hope the front desk and valet staff remembers that they represent the hotel and should seek some friendly advice from the bellhops.", "Date": "May 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cThe best choice in downtown LA - one of the best in the region\u201d", "Author": "dalangdon", "ReviewID": "UR3507757", "Content": "The Millenium Biltmore is a classic hotel with excellent service and beautiful atmosphere.

We were extremely impressed with the hotel. We found a great deal for the Biltmore online for $140 a night. This included FREE valet parking, complimentary continental breakfast and hor' dourves and beer and wine in the evening. In addition, this price included an upgrade to the club rooms which are located on the eleventh and twelfth floor of the building. The club rooms are supposedly bigger and offer more services than standard rooms. I wouldn't know because I don't know what a standard room includes. The continental breakfast was great. It included lots of fresh fruit, danishes, croissants, cereal, and two hot dishes. One hot dish was always scrambled eggs (which were very good) and either sausages or bacon for the second dish. Food never ran out. Dinner included two hot hor' dourves dishes, complimentary wine and beer, cheese and cracker dish, fresh fruit and cookies. The food was great and on a few nights, we made it our dinner. Once again, food and drinks never ran out. There was always a concierge and waitress on hand to make sure we were well taken care of during meals. Meals were held in the club lounge which was spacious and had tables, telvisions, and couches. It looked like a big living room. There was also a computer room and fax machine that we had access to during meals. The valet service was extremely convenient and thankfully free(it was part of my package). When you are in Los Angeles, the only way to go is to park in a lot and they all charge. The room was beautiful and the bed was SO comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly and accomodating. We were originally concerned that we would be staying in downtown L.A. which is like a ghost town at night and even during the day (compared to NYC). However, it wasn't a big deal because no matter what, you need to drive everywhere to see attractions. The biltmore is not much more out of the way compared to other locations.

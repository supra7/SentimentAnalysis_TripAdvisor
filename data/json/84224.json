There was seldome anyone manning the front desk. People waited 30 minutes to get checked in. The staff was rude. The room dirty. Bathtub had not been cleaned and the shower head broken. Linens were stained, worn out and had long hair in all of them! (we both have very short hair). You have to take your own garbage out to the dumpster! Other guests on the tv show had the same complaints. Also, this is a big one.... they have posted in their rooms that maid service is only offered after you have stayed 6 nights! Otherwise you pay for the service. The service does not include doing the dishes we had to wash prior to our leaving so as not to get charged. We would have been better off staying in a jail!

After we pulled the covers for some reason the box spring and mattress looked like they were picked up from garbage and had stains all over. The last mattress I threw away was about 100 times better than this one. The carpet looked very old and unclean. Best thing was that, I told my wife that this place needs renovation and when we went out we say a large sign on the hotel wall that says \"All rooms are renovated\".

It is also not too long a drive from areas in LA. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and we stayed there with no problems for 9 nights. The room is clean and comfortable. A maid comes once a week to change towels and clean up. The refridgerator can be a little noisy at night but that was really my only complaint. The bullet-proof glass, as mentioned in some earlier reviews, really isn't that bad. Whilst i was staying there, the glass was always open, There was no intercom, and the receptionist talked to us face to face, therefore seemed to me like a normal reception area.

Rarely do you see windows open in a hotel, but so be it. Problem is the place looks beat up, and with no other hotels nearby it looked liked low income housing. So I park, walk in, and I go to the front desk, and it's encased in bullet proof glass. The guy behind the glass speaks through an intercom so it feels like you are in some type of jail or something. Funny thing is the area is not really that bad. Wierd. I go to the room, and bottom line, it's a Super 8 with a kitchen. Furniture is beat up, and very cheap. The \"desk\" wobbles and the bed is rock hard with cheap sheets. The inside of the room is dark, dreary and very dated. My guess is the place is 10 years old and nothing has been updated since the opening. The kitchen, while I did not use it, looked servicable. I pricelined this hotel, and I bid on a two star hotel for $50. I will never bid two stars again if this is what 2 stars gets you. It's no frills, cheap looking and feeling, dark/dreary, and simply a place to lie your head. Luckily I only had to sleep there, so I did not have to spend that much time there. Despite the below reviews, I never felt \"unsafe\" in the hotel or the area. For some reason they put bullet proof glass in the lobby so that spooks people.

So I trusted the name and took extended stay for granted. When I arrived at the property, I felt extremely uncomfortable as the parking lot was on the opposite side of the entrance of the building. The entrance itself looked more like a prison gate than a $200 a night hotel reception - double armored glass doors. And instead of a bell desk or a reception desk, again there was a safe room with bulletproof glass and a two-way intercom just as you\u00b4ll find in high-security settings. I felt in a prison or in the middle of a gang war, honestly. To pass your credit card to the receptionist involved placing it in one of the metal sliding drawers that can only be operated from one side of the bulletproof glass, and it aint yours !

I need to tell you though, that I would never ever stay at this hotel again. To think that they normally would charged over $100 a night is ridiculous, as this place is no better than the typical roadside motels on state highways of bygone years. The building is nice on the outside but as you walk in to the lobby things start to unravel. The most noticeable and scary part for me is that the front desk is behind a BULLET RESISTANT glass. That alone should tell you that something is wrong, when management thinks it's not enough to have security guards on post in the lobby and patrolling outside, but to also protect their employees like some political figure. The elevators are dirty with stains on the floor and scartch marks along the wall. The carpet along the corridor and inside my room is very dirty. My room is simple which is fine but I think that they have to periodically try to update it as I think it hasn't been renovated since it first opened. The flourescent lighting in the room do not match, some of them produce yellow hues and some bright white. The bed is too soft and they only provide for two pillows. Internet connection is $4.99 but it wasn't good, it was worst than dial-up. Tried calling technical help line but said that the problem is with the ISP company that the hotel does business with. I ended up using the signal coming from a restaurant next door. I am not a picky person, it's just that if a hotel wants to charged something what a 3-star hotel would charge, it should be able to provide descent service, and certainly this hotel failed to do that. So bottom line, I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason.

We ended up at this airport area hotel when looking for reasonable cost for five nights in LA, and we were both pleasantlly surprised by the ESA LAX. For one, the room was clean and comfortable. The \"kitchen\" area lacks an oven, so our frozen pizza was a waste, but it does have a cooktop, a microwave and a fridge. (LIke all rooms with a refrigerator, the thing makes a bit of noise at night which can disturb a light sleeper. Easy to unplug!). The hotel staff sits behind bulletproof glass in their registration area, which scared us at first and which reminds you that you are in an ultra-budget category. But, they are friendly and helpful. The property appears to be about ten years old, everything was working in the room except for the Internet access, which was a giant pain and required an hour or two of technical service, and it never did get going. They don't know anything at the front desk about the internet, so you have to call a toll free number. I got to know the tech rep in Poland by his first name before I left. Luckily, there is a great diner (Dinah's) right next door with blazing fast internet for free. The location is fantastic. Just a short walk to The Bridge, which has Cinema and about a dozen eating places, ranging from nice Mexican and fast food places to some really good stuff at Callendar's Grille. Safe area -- we didn't see a plane or any evidence of being near the airport. Definitelly worth a try if you are looking for a decent, clean but cheap place in the LA area.

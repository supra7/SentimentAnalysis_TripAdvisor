The double suite with the pull out sofa was perfect for the three of us. It was a simply appointed room, very minimalistic, and clean. Two beds in a separate bedroom, small bathroom, living room area, and a tiny balcony. There was a refrigerator and a microwave in the living area, but no sink, and just two glasses. The room was just near the elevator, but apparently all of the suites were. All rooms overlook the pool as well. It is a nice garden area with a good pool, but it is surrounded by hotel, so all the sound is amplified. And the pool opens at 0600, and plenty of parents let their children run screaming to the pool at 0601. So don't stay here if you are looking for peaceful. The walls are very thin, and I am pretty sure we heard every noise coming out of our neighbors. The coffee maker in the room is awful... so they offer free coffee in the lobby, but it is not always full. Since they charge you for Starbucks just across the lobby, I figure they lure you to the lobby with the offer of free coffee, but figure you will drop the two dollars if it is empty and pay. It worked... anything was better than the room coffee. There is a small yogurt shop in the adjacent shopping center... it was very good! Parking was easy, but the entire place is behind a shopping center, and off the road... it is just an odd layout with the location, pool, and coffee.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat for a quick stop\u201d", "Author": "Wynchesster", "ReviewID": "UR127070699", "Content": "I was in Phoenix for a week on business, and I wanted to stay the weekend on my own dime to explore and do some hiking. When work was over I moved to this hotel for the weekend. I'm a loyal Marriott patron collecting my points and occasionally getting those free nights when I travel. For me, this place was a perfect fit. The location was good as it was close to Camelback mountain, which was a great hike. The hotel itself is perfect. The rooms are nice and clean and well decorated. The pool in the courtyard is well maintained with lots of chairs and a towel service. There are nice cushioned seating areas in and around the pool that are shaded. Those are great places to have a drink, do some reading and stay out of that hot sun. Just by chance, there is an LA Fitness right next door, and I do mean right next door. I just happen to be a member so this was a fantastic bonus for me. The only gripe, and it has been repeated before, is that they still do not have wi-fi access in the rooms. Wired access only for your laptop, but that renders my wi-fi only iPad useless. They have wifi in the lobby and common areas. The signal was weak out by the pool and came and went which was annoying. But this is still minor.

It was quite small. When I asked to see something else they did find a room opening to the pool area. This was pretty nice, however, the room was strangely lacking in amenities. No lotion, 2 thin bath towels, and no suitcase stand. As a result we had to work out of the suitcases on the floor. This is not a leisure hotel.

We had a room on main floor just off pool. Pool and hot tub were good. Free coffee was good. Within two or less blocks. Numerous good places to eat with cheap happy hour snacks and drinks. Grocery store, public library with free internet accesss. Numerous specialty stores including Trader Jacks, a high end used clothing shop,ethnic cafes. We had a rental car but never used it.

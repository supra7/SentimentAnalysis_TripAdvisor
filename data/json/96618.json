First time in Branson - wasn't what we expected (of the town, that is!). The town sprawls out along the top of several hills. There was still quite a lot of damage from the major tornado of 29 Feb 2012. It doesn't appear that the Fairfield Inn was affected. Looking up the street address for this property we ended up on the wrong side of the major highway through town. You have to take the street in the opposite direction from the Titanic - not sure what street address would work. We had to call the hotel as none of our GPS's were right! Front desk staff were extremely helpful. We had hoped for a top floor room but they were not available as the hotel was swapping out mattresses and they weren't putting guests on the floors where work was in progress. Although the hotel didn't seem old by any means there's evidence that the owners continue to invest in it. I'd rate this better than the average Fairfield Inn. Plenty of free parking right around the hotel - we were able to almost park outside our room albeit there were still stairs due to the hilly terrain. The front desk staff have quite a few handouts with info on attractions and shows and they can also assist with these if you'd like. Overall I'm surprised this hotel is currently ranked #54 out of all hotels in Branson.

Old hotel, but rooms clean and comfortable, quiet. We stayed the night before New Year's Eve and it was packed; we had to park in the back. There is an entrance door there that opens with the room key. We couldn't get wi-fi to work; could have been our laptop, but no problems with it prior. Since we had one evening in Branson, we wanted to make the most of it. Stopping at an information center was very helpful. We learned that after the New Year's weekend, things pretty much come to a halt for Jan. and Feb. and start to resume slowly in March. There's a brand new section by downtown Branson, called Branson Harbor, I believe. Just head for the water past downtown and you'll see a new outdoor mall. There's free parking. Being Christmas time, there was a huge Christmas tree in the center and lots of decorations. Even without that, it's very pretty. There's dancing waters with fire, to music, and lots of open seating to sit and watch. We were told there's over 100 merchants, including restaurants, and several new small businesses. Seems to be something for everyone. Again at Christmas time, the Lights at Shephard Hills, are not to be missed. This is where you drive your vehicle through 2 1/2 miles of animated decor. It's pricey and per person, not per carload, but your ticket also includes going up the tower to see 360 degrees of the area and a free hot chocolate or cider at a nearby giftshop. Took us 1 1/2 hrs. there. Festive and nice! Not sure if the breakfast had the pancake maker, as I'm a fruit and yogurt eater. The raisins, nuts and brown sugar are great extras. No check-out for us, since we request the bill to be slipped beneath our room door during the night. We'll definitely be back to Branson. We had a great discount through \"family and friends\" and we are Marriott fans.

While it was not terrible, it was not up to the standard you expect (or at least we expect) from a Marriott property. Halls kind of musty smelling. Bathtub had hair in it. Staff was not rude....more of an \"I'm doing my job and that's about it\" attitude. My husband was in the bathroom when housekeeping knocked on the door. He told them 3 times to wait a minute...the third time being as she walked in the bathroom....obviously he was not happy. The front desk, again, was not rude, but had an \"oh well\" attitude. Breakfast had the staples (waffle, Jimmy Dean sandwiches, cold cereal, toast, hard boiled eggs), but that was about it. Nothing wrong with what was there...just none of the \"extras\" you expect from a Marriott. We are Marriott members, so always stay in a Marriott property. If we are back in the area, we will probably give the Residence Inn a try. the location of this Fairfield was nice (you could take one of the alternate routes - blue I think - directly to the hotel and miss the main street traffic!), but that isn't worth staying there again.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Charles, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPlain\u201d", "Author": "travelchick39", "ReviewID": "UR84759722", "Content": "I stayed here on a weekend trip with family.

We checked a ton of websites and finally chose Fairfield because there are so many Mom and Pop type hotels in Branson that it's hard to know their reputation or what to expect. We've stayed at many Fairfields in the past and figured that even an average Fairfield experience would suit our purposes. (my son requested an indoor pool which also influenced our decision) So, we booked on Marriott's website and received a very good rate of $65.99 including continental breakfast. While booking on the site, we had the option to request early check-in. Upon calling the hotel the morning of our arrival we were told that our room was already available -- it was 8 o'clock in the morning! That was a first. The hotel: while it was typical of Fairfield decor and layout, there was something about it that seemed not quite up to par with Fairfield's we have visited in the past. The hottub wasn't as clean as we'd like, there wasn't any hand lotion in the rooms, the lobby was very dim--it just seemed a little on the drab side. With that being said, there were some extremely pleasant experiences. The beds were amazingly comfortable, the room itself was very clean, and the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I cannot comment in the breakfast because we opted for Krisy Kreme down the street. I gave this hotel an above average rating, not becuase of the hotel itself, but because of the staff, comfort of the beds, location, and price. I would highly recommend this place for a family who will not be spending a lot of time at the hotel -- perhaps a one or two night stay. Any longer and you might want to opt for a hotel with a few more amenities. This hotel is in a great location just off 76 with a walgreens right next door. There are a lot of nearby restaurants and activities. The staff, once again, is very accomodating. I would not recommend this as a romatic escape.

The staff was very friendly and competent. The breakfast was great. Some shortcomings in the room itself. I would definitely stay here again. PROS: ROOM: had a harborview room on the 12th floor (top is 15) which had a great view of downtown Boston, especially at night. The room was spacious and clean; the bed quite comfy. ELEVATORS: 3 of the fastest elevators I've ever been on in a hotel. Over my stay, I never waited more than 5 seconds for an elevator. BREAKFAST: complimentary Full breakfast at Harborside Grill (lobby restaurant) for Diamond Gold Passport members. No coupons, just charge to room and removed. Yurio is especially friendly and efficient, but all are great. INTERNET ACCESS: free to Diamond and Platinum members. Both wired and wireless available, average speed for hotel HSIA. Just accept charges on screen though you are not actually charged on your folio. FREE SHUTTLE SERVICE: pretty much runs continuously between all airport terminals, the MBTA airport station, and the hotel. You are supposed to call the Hotel for pick-up; there is a free courtesy phone in baggage claim. MassPort also runs a shuttle (route 66) from all terminals, to the MBTA airport station, and then to the ferry dock next to the Hotel--it's free but not as reliable as the Hotel's shuttle. The subway stop at the airport is NOT within walking distance of the Hotel--and you're talking to someone who likes to walk! It's a very convoluted path I would not even attempt. FITNESS CENTER: 3 treadmills, 1 elliptical,1 bike, and weight machines. The room is large, well-ventilated, and looks out on the water. CONS: ROOM: thin walls. Seem to hear more of neighbors and hallway activities than average BATHROOM: no towels bars! There is a single hook behind the door. I'm baffled. There is definitely enough room for a bar next to the sink and bathtub. The bathtub spout is a firehose--way, way overpressured. The showerhead could use a flow restrictor too. ANALOG TV: this is an older flat-panel on the smaller side. The analog resolution is pretty horrible; Is HD programming out of the hotel's budget? FITNESS CENTER: no small workout towels. Had to snag the gigantic bath towels from the pool area. There was a fridge for \"chilled\" towels but I just want a normal room temperature towel like most hotels supply. I suppose I could bring the small hand towel from my room. While I enjoyed this hotel overall, it may not be a good \"base\" hotel if you want to tour Boston because of the required \"shuttling.\" The water taxi, at $10 for a one-way trip, while convenient, is prohibitively expensive compared to the 7-day $15 MBTA pass. But if the room rates are good and you don't mind the extra time to get into Boston, then this hotel is for you.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Andover, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "Bella349", "ReviewID": "UR125374781", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here to have a girls night out and watch the Oscars.

It took us an hour hitting closed streets, not known by GPS. I called the hotel, and I think Bobby the Concierge Mamger talked us in. Being very frazzled, he very kindly offered to comp our parking which was a classy move. The hotel is gorgeous. The lobby is spacious and quite inviting considering how large it was. I liked the there is a lovely restaurant adjacent to the lobby, which had delicious Food and a stunning view of Boston Harbor, overlooking the downtown skyline. The elevator had surrounding windows, so you can see the lovely view as you ascend to you room. We were on the 11th floor, the rooms were on the small side for a hotel of this stature. I did enjoy this hotel enough that Even with the things wrong with it I will list below, I think I'd stay there again and take the water taxi or Subway into the heart of Boston. Some things need fixing. There is NO need for a hotel with this many rooms, catering to many business customers to charge $12.95 PER unit for Internet. Definitely take my advice!! This hotel competes with much higher end hotels for the same type of costomer. Free Internet could make the difference to budget minded companies choose this Hyatt! Also, the heating systems are terrible. We had to turn ours off, but then the people next door had theirs on and it sounded like a freight train was coming through our room. We can't be the only ones mentioning this! We Changed rooms but it's evidently a flaw hotel-wide. This is the first 4-star hotel I've stayed in with this heating issue. This is a 1-2 star hotel issue!! The parking is over priced for the area and they should think about lowering those rates a bit (although our's was comped, I am just passing along information. I'm going to nitpick here: more glasses, hand towels, washclothes, and towels should be in each room. It felt like the barest minimum was given for our use. A bottle of Aquafina Water went for $5.00. REALLY!!! I've stayed in some very pricey hotels, and they might charge $5.00 for bottled water in the room, but it's Evian or comperable water. One more nitpick. I'd called for extra pillows, but it took them an hour and a half to get to us. They SHOULD have free bathrobes in every room at that level! Two big things to rave about: the bed certainly was heavenly, I slept better than at home. And Bobby, the Manager Concierge, was truly exemplary at helping us overcome several problems. A really terrific young guy, named Devon helped get us a 4:00 checkout the next day, as we were picking someone up coming from Seattle and the plane wasn't scheduled to arrive until 5:30 that afternoon. It allowed my husband to nap comfortably as we were driving 250 miles after we picked them up to go home. As I said before, dinner was very, very good in the restaurant, which looked over at the Boston skyline and was quite spectacular as all the building across the river were lighted up. Very lovely! A very nice gentleman named Denice waited on us. While we were waiting in the lobby for the plane to arrive the next afternoon, we were well taken care of. Jorje came over, introduced himself to us and asked if we needed or wanted ANYthing at all. Several waiters did the same thing followed by a big smile and even offered us a glass of water (free, I assume) while we waited. I guess I want to say that the level of amazing pampering appears slightly out of sync with the level of amenities and I think corporate needs to offer the whole package if they want to upgrade their image as a whole. You have amazing people who go out of their way to help out and/or make things more comfortable. You do them a disservice by not offering a classy, unique room to go with it! I want to thank Bobby, Devon, Jorje and Denice and every single other person on staff at Hilton Harborside for helping to make this trip a fun trip in the end and let them know I'll be back next time if for nothing else, but for the top-notch way they all helped us out under all circumstances. Come here for the vacation, or shopping, or just to wait for a flight.

I can't say enough goods things about this hotel, its staff, and the Hyatt brand. First off, the view of the Boston city skyline from this hotel is STUNNING, especially at night. It is well worth paying the extra for the Harbor View if you are staying longer than just the overnight. The restaurant and grounds all have the same gorgeous view so you can still enjoy if your room is located on the airport side. The grounds are attractive and well maintained and there is a harborside promenade around the property and harbor for those looking for a morning walk or jog. The staff are friendly, courteous, attentive to detail, and go out of their way to make sure your stay is comfortable. As I said, I stayed here several times over the summer. Many staff members even recognized me from my previous stays, greeted me by name, and all treated me like royalty. Even staff that was walking by or in the hallways always had a smile and a friendly hello. The level of service here is top notch and I believe this is the Hyatt philosophy of excellent customer service and making every guest feel special. I ate several meals in the restaurant and found the food to be well prepared and delicious. The menu is not extremely expansive, but they do a nice job otherwise. The morning buffet is especially delightful if you are taking your time and have the opportunity to sit on the patio and take in all the sights. If you book on the Hyatt website, they often have package deals that include the breakfast buffet, which is a really good value. I had two favorite servers, Milton and Yuri, who went above and beyond normal service, but all the staff and hostesses did an excellent job. Want to see the sights and do something in the city? Just ask!! The concierge is ready with suggestions, brochures, will book you a harbor tour or call for a water taxi. Anything you can think of. The water taxis are a great idea to go back and forth across the harbor. I used them the whole stay and never retrieved my car. I mean, what a great concept. You get a boat ride and a cab all in one! Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Love the beds and toiletries. My only slight complaint would be the level of noise that you can hear in the hallways. One of the reasons I always travel with earplugs.

The hotel is beautiful and the views from the water side are rightfully 4 stars, and they rightfully market the hotel's rooms as doing a great job of masking the airport noise. All of these are on the plus side. However, on the down side the walls between the rooms appear to be made of paper. I was awoken this morning to my neighbor's 6am wake-up call, and I am now aware that she has allergies. Every time she sneezed or blew her noise, I heard it as if she were in my room. Also, I had the chance to listen to maintenance work on my other neighbor's phone at 7:35am. Good stuff. Given that, I could probably give it four stars, but if you, like me, needed to utilize the transportation provided by Hyatt to get around the airport, you better set your expectations. It seems as though they have only one bus. I went into the city for dinner last night and took the T back to the airport. From Terminal A, it took 49 minutes from the time I called for the shuttle to the time I got back to the hotel. This morning, I took the shuttle back to the terminal for my flight out and the shuttle stopped at two rental car companies before the terminal. Hint to Hyatt...people getting on your shuttle going to the airport terminal are actually on a schedule. People that are going to the T or to rental car counters are not. Get the priority straight or offer a terminal shuttle. With this experience in mind, I cannot give it four stars. It's a lovely property, but for an airport hotel that is less than one mile from the actual airport, the frustrating shuttle experiences bring down the rating.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel with some outstanding staff\u201d", "Author": "JRK2011", "ReviewID": "UR117799744", "Content": "My family and I recently completed a 3-night stay (2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 Sep 2011) at Hyatt Harborside in Boston, MA.

The restaurant manager; Josh Katz, and staff; Milton, Patrick, Vinny, and Dennis made our meals at the Harborside Grill more enjoyable and our overall stay in Boston a success.

Th lobster Mac was a bit bland in taste and my linguini with shrimp was a bit overcooked. BUT the breakfast the next morning from the a la carte menu was superb. I had the Lobster Eggs Benedict, and hubby had the Lobster Omelette. Both were very tasty and beautifully presented and service on both dinner and breakfast was excellent. To be honest, we wished we had gone for something a little more simpler for dinner such as the Fish & Chips, but this was our first night in town and we wanted to try something special.

Only thing - would love to have a fridge to keep my drinks cold and a safe to have a bit more peace of mind when leaving laptop, blackberry etc in the room. But no problem. Its is an airport hotel and my room faces the airport, but I couldnt hear anyplane noise at all - insulation is brilliant. - View - half the rooms in teh hotel face the airport, east facing and ideal for plane-spotters, and half the rooms face teh harbour and downtown Boston, west facing and beautiful view. Unfortunately I got one of the rooms on the airport side, - Harbourside grill - I had breakfast here for three mornings and a dinner as well. Delicious Crab Cake Benedict. Reasonable buffet. Good waffles although they didnt have whipped cream that morning (?). Full breakfast buffet for $25 which I think is on the expansive side. Continental for $16, which still seem a bit expensive. but desont bother me too much and this is similar price to others Hyatt's I have stayed elsewhere. - Location - The view of Boston downtown across the harbour is to die for. In fact, the veiw is listed in Top 10 Boston guidebook as one of the top views in Boston. The drawback is, downtown is across the harbour. The pier for Water Taxi to go to downtown is right outside the hotel but costs $10 single, which I think is expensive. Alternatively, the hotel has free shuttle bus to the airport from where one can take the silver line metro/bus. This option is much cheaper but takes longer. - Staff - They are friendly and helpful.

The downside is you will need to take a water taxi ($17/return) across the harbor or drive to get back over to the city and parking is $32/night. The upside is that you have a waterfront location with views across the harbor towards the city which are just beautiful at night.

We stayed at this hotel twice on both ends of an east coast college scouting trip. We had Room 1011 (Harbor View King) connecting to Room 1009 (Harbor view two doubles). The rooms were modern and comfortable, but the air conditioning definitely makes a lot of noise at night. We chose this hotel specifically to be close to the airport after a long, cross country flight into Boston and to be close to the airport for an early morning return flight. As far as location goes, you can't get much closer to the airport than this, unless you're staying at the Hilton. To some reviewers, the location is a positive but for others it's a negative. It worked perfectly for us. However the hotel's airport shuttle was very ineffective, both arriving and departing. Other reviewers have noted that they waited a long time after arriving for the shuttle to pick them up, and that happened to us, too. The shuttles from the hotel back to the airport are not regularly scheduled either, and we wound up waiting a long time to get out of the hotel and head back for our flight. Scheduling them at regular times would make a lot of sense. Also, you can take the Water Taxi shuttle from the airport instead, it has a stop right next to the hotel. And as a last resort, you can walk. It might seem a little out of the way at first, but it's only about a ten minute walk. (I walked from the Hyatt to the Budget Rental Car lot...instead of taking the hotel shuttle back to the airport and then jumping on the Budget shuttle back to their property. The Hyatt's front desk staff was friendly and efficient. We paid $194 per room, that's the AAA rate and includes breakfast, a pretty good deal. There was a promotional rate advertised in our room of getting a price break if you get a second room, but it wound up being about the same as the AAA rate and didn't include breakfast. We loved the harbor side view, it was beautiful at sunrise, at sunset and at night. We could have saved money on the airport side view, and if you like watching planes takeoff and land, that would have been pretty enjoyable, too. The view from the elevator is stunning as you come up from the lobby level, you are suddenly presented with a view looking right down one of the shorter runways! We took the water taxi across into Boston each night we were there, which was fun. You can buy tickets at the front desk and charge them to your room, or you can buy them onboard. Same price. Sure, it was a little pricey but what the heck, it's an easy way to get around when you don't have much time and/or don't know the area very well. At night, the hotel's \"Lighthouse Light\" comes on and sweeps across the dark sky, very cool! The bathrooms were well appointed and quite large but there are no towel racks anywhere at all. So when you're done with a shower and after you've dried off, there's really no place to hang up a towel. Kind of weird. Now, for the skunks. After arriving in the evening and checking in, we were seated outdoors on the patio. It has a lovely view across the water of downtown Boston. The patio is edged by grass on one side and some landscaping bushes and flowers on the other. Unfortunately, that landscaping area is inhabited by a family of SKUNKS! After about thirty minutes at our table, I noticed some of the bushes moving around and figured there was an animal of some kind in there. That's when I got a glancing peek at Skunk #1. At first, my family thought it was a cat but I said \"No, that's a skunk. Watch out!\" It wriggled back into the bushes. A short time later, skunks #2 and #3 came out of the bushes and started moving towards our table. Other people had noticed this, too but we were the closest table to the skunks and I was afraid we were about to get sprayed! Other diners seemed entertained by this, but none of the waiters appeared to be bothered. The ditzy hostess just giggled and didn't seem capable of giving us a straight answer about the situation.. The skunks eventually moved away and we eventually got our meal. Postscript: the next morning, I spoke with a couple of staff members of the front desk. They said the hotel certainly knew about the skunks, but that the animals had been \"de-skunked\" and were harmless. It certainly would have been nice to know that during our meal when we ate nervously. Speaking of the meal, one quick aside. Getting our food took almost two hours! The restaurant staff seemed completely overwhelmed by a big wedding reception that was happening right next door to the hotel on the same property. When we complained to the manager about the long delay, he took half off the total bill. That was a nice gesture and saved us about $75. Afterwards, I wondered whether the hotel should put up any kind of sign about the skunks or let people know when they checked in what the situation was outside on the patio. I'm undecided about that but I certainly did not appreciate my unexpected meeting at close proximity to a family of skunks during dinner. I'll be extremely curious if this review gets any response from Hyatt management. In spite of the skunks and the delays getting to and from the airport, I'd stay here again.

After reading some of the reviews I was pretty convinced that the location is the main issue of the hotel. However, after looking at the options to get into Boston, we didn't really find the location to be that big of an issue at all, and our overall stay at the hotel was quite good. We didn't get the city view side of the hotel in our room, but the only time we really looked outside was in the morning to see if we needed an umbrella or not. Commuting wise it cost about 20 dollars to get into Boston, and about 15 dollars to come back. Another option we had was the water taxi which was 17 dollars for a round trip or 10 dollars for a one way. However, the best option we found was taking the Airport shuttle to the Subway, and buying a weekly pass for $15 dollars. I found that going into Downtown Boston took a mere 20 minutes including the wait for the Airport Shuttle. Considering I only had to tip the shuttle driver, I spent very little to get to Downtown for the week. Once I got into Downtown Boston, everywhere was walkable, and the transit maps were very easy to navigate. I ended up spending the whole week commuting around Boston this way, and I didn't feel like I lost any precious time seeing the city because of it, while saving money in the process. As for the rooms, we got a King size bed with all the amenities. The towels were replaced daily, the beds were made daily, everything I expected a hotel to do for a customer it did. The bellmen gave prompt service and the front end counter staff was more than helpful in all my requests. I asked them what I could do to print some emails off my Blackberry, and they just told me to email them and they will gladly print it for me free of charge, rather than having to pay for the business center to do it. Although in regards to value I don't know how that fares. The rooms were about $200 a night at the Hyatt, but factoring in the location of the hotel, I would be interested to know how much it would cost to stay in for example Downtown Boston to know if the value was any good. But from speaking to the event planners who hosted the event at the Hyatt, they mentioned they saved much more money having it at the Harborside than at a hotel in Downtown Boston, and attendees were given additional discounts to the water taxi which was an added bonus. Either way, our stay at the Hyatt Harborside was very enjoyable and other than not being able to step out the front door to see Downtown Boston, there were absolutely no issues with this hotel whatsoever.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicopee, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!

Nope, bell hop has to do it ($$tip). Want internet? $10 a day (MacDonalds is free but not the Hyatt). Parking? $30 a day as a guest. Want breakfast? Be prepared to pay; no free continental here. Poor excuse for a buffet $25, eggs and sausage alone $17. I could deal with it if there was another choice, but there is NOTHING nearby. Big thing is that this is not the hotel to stay at if you want to see Boston. Water taxi or ferry is $10 per person one way, (you can also take the subway from/to the nearby stop and the hotel will pick you up at the station for free (about a 15 minute wait), but it isn't as convenient as you might want if you're there to see Boston [plus the subway line going to the airport was out the Sat we were there]) so you end up hanging out in Boston all day (we rested at the Marriot) until after dinner and then dragging back to the hotel late. My family ended up eating up all we saved on the room on transportation and food at the hotel; we could have just stayed at a pricier hotel close to downtown and had a place to go back to rest and recuperate before dinner. Staff was okay, but inconsistent. One person would be the most helpful and nice person in the world, the next the rudest and moodiest - you just didn't know what you were going to get.

But after three hours of traveling I was hungry and thirsty and eager to get to this hotel. The ride in the shuttle bus was just short of terrifying.

As frequent travelers know, the food service on a multi-hour flight is now limited to a one ounce package of pretzels, the thought of a late night meal once getting to the hotel was not to be. What I really wanted was a cold beer which was not possible, in spite of the fact there were two bartenders behind the bar at 12:30 AM. When I approached the bar and requested a beer, the bartender simply gestured by waving his hand across his neck signifying the bar was \"cut off\". Not a word was uttered or a simply apology saying the bar was closed. I had to settle with a bottle of soda from the closet gift shop off the front desk. I guess all that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd forced the price of soda to $2.50! I wonder why they could not have offered a cold beer in this little closet? Surely they would have made at least $10 for a beer if a soda costs that much. One would think this hotel might think about having some sort of late night snack available for late arriving guests. I have had more considerate service from a Residence Inn. But Hyatt, a supposedly high-end hotel that caters to business travelers? At least they might have suggested a late night pizza place that offered delivery service. I am sorry but this hotel has totally lost sight of who their guests are and what there needs might be.

Positives: Stunning view of the harbor and downtown (though you pay an upgrade fee for rooms on that side), typical Hyatt top-shelf lobby and restaurant, attractive and decent-sized room with fashionable decor and seriously high-quality bathroom flooring, counter, etc. Very clean. Negatives: Location is tough to reach: The water taxi or T ferry is a ton of fun in the summer, but not so much in mid-December. The hotel shuttle to the Silver Line or Blue Line can take a startling amount of time when the weather is bad. The Hyatt franchisee's decision earlier this year to fire the housekeeping staff and replace them with minimum-wage workers was depressing, and I very much regretted supporting it by staying there (But once Priceline takes the bid, you're locked in). You can see the little things are getting away from management here - such as an old room service tray and a roll-out bed left in the hallway for a half-day. The Typical to Hyatt, the nickel-and-diming is out of control. $4 candy bars in the 'gift shop,' $5 bottles of water in the room. Charges for Internet, $32 a night for parking (try the Logan lot instead, it's cheaper ... or skip the car altogether, as we did. Once you get into the city, the T system is terrific. Driving in Boston is a nightmare, and parking is worse.) The restaurant is, of course, astronomically overpriced. Beautiful location with low light, table candles and/or attractive small lights that allow you to enjoy the harbor view at night. A nighttime burger or drink would be great - just didn't get time. Breakfast was good, but way overpriced. The evening visit would be more sensible. The fitness center has a decent number of quality machines, and the pool area COULD be a gem. It's indoor with a hot tub nearby, all surrounded by curving floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on the harbor and downtown. Ought to be magnificent, right? Sadly, some bean-counter put in a cheap acoustic-tile drop ceiling (the sort of thing you'd find in the Motel 6 lobby) with blazing lights.

We paid for a superior room for our last night which included a harborside view and because we wanted a good night's sleep after a week of noisy hotels. Our check-in was insignificant - the receptionist was not particularly welcoming. Our luggage was swiftly yaken in hand by Ryan the bell-boy who was very informative and keen to help. He explained that there was a wedding reception on at the hotel that night and pointed out the internet facilities near the lobby, which you had to pay for - the first rip-off considering a lot of cheaper hotels provide this free these days. Our room was very comfortable with a great view of Boston. We ate in the Grill which turned out to be very expensive although the food was good and service reasonably quick. We went to bed early as we were both tired. There was a drinks machine and ice-making machine outside our door and the fan from the ice maker was loud so we complained to the front desk about it and asked to be moved. They explained that all the rooms had been taken (due to the wedding reception) and assured me that the fan switshes off at about 11pm which it did. We were woken up at about midnight by guests returning to their rooms (noisily) from the wedding reception and these included the guests in the next room, which was divided from us by an adjoining door. They had invited guests back to their room for drinks and were talking and laughing loudly and we could hear their conversation through the connecting door. Eventually we had to complain again and someone was dispatched to ask them to keep the noise down (which they did to a certain extent). However, other guests returning to their rooms occurred over the next few hours and kept us awake. The drinks machine / ice maker kept us awake all night with people getting drinks and ice all through the night - can people not do without a drink of coke at 4am??? Either the lift or drinks machine kept making a pinging sound all night when being used - can engineers not design these things to be quiet??? Can guests entering/leaving their rooms not do so without talking at the tops of their voices - jerks??? We could even hear kids running along the corridoor above us at about 2am. When we checked out next morning the guy on the reception was pretty aloof and didn't even ask us how our stay had been. Hotels these days seem to be too involved in the entertainmemt business and have lost track of what they were designed for - to provide us with a quiet night's sleep. These drinks machines outside guests rooms should be de-activated between 11pm and 7am. Effectively we paid through the nose for a superior room and got an inferior room.

The pricing at this place is wacky...there are some items such as the Angus Burger w/ fries ($15) that are reasonable. Other menu items, like the buffet breakfast (now $30, up from $25!) are incredibly overpriced. But there's an easy solution to that--just get the items that are a better deal! Oh, I almost forgot the best deal: 30 oz. draft (one glass and a little carafe on the side) of Sam Adams Seasonal for only $10!!

Unfortunately, the fireworks were cancelled! Obviously that wasn't the hotel's fault. The hotel has an amazing view of downtown Boston--if you book a room with a harbor view. Otherwise you are overlooking the parking lot and the airport. The hotel itself is pretty standard Hyatt (the decor, etc.). The hotel is relatively new, so you don't have to worry about ending up a hotel that had a \"renovation\" that was no more than new paint and carpets, yet. I mention this because parts of the hotel (mainly around the conference/reception rooms) are pretty beat up. The hotel has an awesome gym (with a great view of Boston) and a nice pool (it's really designed for doing laps). Getting to and from the hotel by car is relatively easy, but they kill you on parking fees. Expect to pay in excess of $30 dollars to park your car--as a guest! They have a shuttle from the airport that is convenient, and that I believe is free (unlike in Europe). Getting to downtown Boston is easy by car, but don't rely on a GPS to get you there. You have to go through a tunnel, so you'll lose your GPS signal and come out of the tunnel with your GPS effectively useless when you need it most. We took the water taxi to downtown Boston from the transportation center right next to the hotel (VERY convenient). The hotel room service food was excellent (and I've stayed at other high-end hotels that had crappy room service food), and the staff that brought the food were all excellent as well.

With an impending snow storm coming I actually booked this hotel as our connecting flight from Canada arrived at 8:00 a.m. and our onward flight to London was that evening and Boston was expecting a snow storm. Upon arrival at Terminal B, waited on the curb in the \"courtesy shuttle\" area for a while before I called the hotel and found out that it is necessary to call for the hotel shuttle. Hotel shuttle arrived within 10 minutes and we were off to the hotel. TIP: It is not necessary to take the hotel shuttle, which does weave it's way around the terminals and can take up to 15 minutes to arrive at the hotel as other reviewer's have said. It is possible to take the airport's own inter-terminal shuttle bus marked \"Boat Docks/Water Shuttle\". Get off at the boat dock stop, it is right beside the hotel and literally 20 steps to the side hotel entry. The shuttle is free and is more frequent that the hotel shuttle. Although I was unsure if the hotel would allow my son and I to check in at 9:00 a.m. when their posted time clearly indicates 3 p.m., I was pleasantly surprised when Louie at the front desk not only allowed us to check in, but even offered us a choice of bed type. Our room was 1507 and had a great view across the harbor to the skyline of Boston, until the snow storm arrived that afternoon. The room did have a hotel information book; however, there were no envelopes or writing paper inside the book. The room itself was clean, modern and did have black out curtains on the window. The public areas were also clean although there is not much of a lobby. There is a sitting area on the second floor overlooking the first floor restaurant with excellent views of the city. As other reviewers have stated there is a water taxi service just outside the hotel to the city. However, it probably cheaper to take the shuttle to the blue line subway and get into the city this way. I met several other hotel guests who went into the city this way for dinner and they seemed quite satisfied with their decision. All three elevators to the guest rooms are glass and offer a great view of the airport and city. Breakfast buffet was $25; however our waitress did not charge me for a coffee and granola when my son ordered the full buffet, which I thought was nice. Although it turned out that we didn't end up staying overnight, we did on our return journey through Boston two weeks later. Again, the room we were given on the tenth floor was facing the city with a great view of the city lights. On our second return stay I booked from an airport Internet terminal, again on Priceline for $65 ($80.96 with taxes/fees), about 30 minutes before we arrived at the front desk. This time I flagged down the hotel shuttle outside the terminal. Upon arrival at the desk the reservation was already in the system and was again offered a choice of bed types. The front desk even provided me with a razor and shaving cream free of charge. On this second stay, my son and I ate dinner in the restaurant. We both had the surf & turf and the bill total came to just under $100 with drinks and gratuitity. We both thought the meal was amazing. I used the Internet in the Business Center, just to the right hand side of the front desk. They charge 0.50 per minute with a $5 minimum. A credit card is needed. It would have been great if the hotel had a free terminal for guests to use, but I did find the speed of the Internet excellent. On both visits we did not use the pool, but we did take a look at it. It seemed adequate with a small pool and hot tub. There is an exercise room adjacent to the pool area and there are changing facilities within the pool area.

Better value for $80 less - you bet! Rooms are of a good size and are very comfortable.

The drying equipment didn't work and they were unable to get a replacement. To be fair the front desk attended very promptly and offered a free upgrade to a room with a harbour view.

Surprisingly what lets the hotel down is the staff. They do not offer the levels of service and attitude for a hotel of this standard. A few examples: The front desk did not even welcome me, they just asked for my name,asked for a credit card and pointed to where the elevators were. They did not even tell me the room number. No one asked if they could help with my bags (single woman travelling alone with 2 bags, 1 huge) . Once I got to the hotel room (around 6:30 pm) A group of housekeepers was cleaning (?) a room across from mine. Actually there was one person in the room and the others were in the hall chatting but keeping it loud enough that the one in the room could hear and participate. After about 15 min, I popped my head out the door and just looked at them. I thought that would be enough for them to get the message. I was wrong, after about another 15 minutes, I opened the door and gave them the SHHH sign (they didn't speak English) and they just looked at me and continued on with their loud chatting.

No queue to check in on arrival, left luggage with bellman & headed up to the room - luggage was delivered within 10 mins. Our room on 9th floor, had a fantastic Harbor view - so good you could take a photo from the room!!. Room had 2 Queen beds, medium to firm matress, with good quality linens, room was decorated in a modern style. Armchair by window, ipod docking station, bathroom with tub & shower but no bathrobes. Toiletries were basic - I have to admit though am not a fan of the hyatts portico toiletries. Room was clean but not overly large. Glasses & ice bucket provided (ice machine on each floor). NO aiport noise whatsoever from the room, but you can hear noise from the corridor - lucky for us we had quiet neighbours!! The lift is fun - you get a waterview as you travel up & down!! There is a nice patio area outside where you can dine or have a drink with a great view (at night the staff light candles & lanterns & its quite lovely) - but the indoor bar area was a dissapointment, not inviting & not a place to linger. Staff seemed overstreched but remained polite. Food was good but not great, Calamari appitizer was very large (enough for 2) and tasty. The water taxi is available just outside the hotel - be sure to use the \"walkie talkie\" to call for a taxi as they appear to wait offshore rather than at the dock. We used the service to get to Boston & it was a fun experience. Taxi service runs till 10pm, so you do not have to dine at the hotel restaurant. Although hotel was busy the pool/gym was empty, we used both. Lockers/towels provided & water, cool towels & apples were available. Pool is saltwater & affords you a view of the harbor whilst you swim The jacuzzi was very hot.

I needed to be at the airport at 5:30 am, so I decided to priceline my way to a room at the Hyatt Harborside. I used a well known website that helps people figure out what hotels priceline offer, in what area, and for how much. Anyway... I checked in very quickly and efficently. The view of intown from across the harbor is just amazing from the lobby! The lobby echos as well, just an odd side note. I asked for a rather odd request, I wanted the a great view of the airport to watch the planes come in. Usually they get harbor view requests, but being a Boston native, I'd seen and sailed it enough. We got a room on the 10th floor that overlooked the cargo terminal, some runways, and Terminal B. It was great! The elevator was pretty with again great views of the city as you escalated up! Liked previously said, I could not hear an airplane but the real \"traffic\" was outside in the hallway! You could hear everything from outside that door! Not a big deal but those tripadvisors were correct! The first thing I did was to go swimming in the pool! The view was amazing from the pool as well. They had towels, cold water, cold towels, and apples in the gym beside the pool. They had plenty of quality towels poolside. The pool was indoors and could be noisy with kids! BUT! The pool water was saline (a bit of salt and fresh water)! It was great on my skin! It felt so good, that I didn't take a shower after! I felt nice and clean getting out of the pool! The pool was the right temperature and clean! I took the local water taxi into for 10 bucks and had a great meal at Boston favorite Legal Seafood. Ironically, I had filet mignon at a great seafood place! Anyway, I took the water taxi back and spent the night watching planes come in. It was wonderful! The room itself was very clean, modern, and comfortable. The wake up call for my early fight was arranged by the front desk and I was on my way using the shuttle which was very prompt. Overall, an excellent stay at the Hyatt! I would highly recommend using this hotel even if you're just staying intown. I love the view of the city and airport, plus it's just fun to use a water taxi!

We didn't even bother checking out officially. The video check-out wasn't working, and we weren't in the mood to deal with anyone at that point.

I was told \"yes, no problem\". When we arrived, I was told \"we don't have any smoking rooms facing the harbor\". I was immediately angered. I took the N/S room facing the harbor because thats the reason me and my fiancee came here. On the TV, No NESN or Fox.Comcast channels (Bruins, Red Sox, Celtics). When we entered, we found the bathroom was covered in black hairs on the walls, shower and floor. Even though the clerk at check in stated it was a Non smoking room, the room next door smelled like cigarettes and cigars. What hotel seriously allows smoking rooms next to non-smoking rooms? Because our room was non-smoking, a nice little note was left stating a $250 charge would be assessed if we smoked in the room. We could smell the other smoke from the neighbors. We had to go down 4 flights and to the front to smoke because we were afraid of our $99 turning into over a $400 night. We watched a movie, and decided at 11PM to order room service. Closed. What four star hotel closes room service at 11 PM, especially if it's in the middle of nowhere when the airport restaurants close.

The walls in this hotel are very thin and you can hear quite a bit of what I would consider normal noise from your neighbors.

We were greeted warmly by an incredible bellman, who helped us with everything. The front desk staff was very nice, and helped us with any questions we had. We didn't have one problem. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer than the original 3 days we had planned. IT WAS THAT GOOD! Honestly, we stayed at the Sofitel in Philly, and this hotel was better. The rooms were clean and roomy. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the staff was friendly and helpful.

This was also true on the way back with other people complaining about when the Shuttle would arrive (I waited 10 mins but I guess I was luckier on the way back). All the staff could say was that they were \"busy today\" 2) The room was a \"disabled\" room with a pathetic bathroom, no bath and a wasbasin about 18\" square 3) The rooms are very noisy. Anyone talking in the corridor can be heard - and as the room was the 1st room from the lifts I could hear everyone coming to their room - this ended around 1am in the morning 4) This is an airport hotel, so I got woken at 5am, when people started leaving to get their flights, by the lack of soundproofing in the doors. 5) As previously stated in another post - you cannot close the curtains. There is a blind but this is not completey suitable so light does get in easily 6) The front desk looked amazed when I responded to their question \"and how was your stay\" with a \"not very good\" answer. All they could say was \"I am sorry, I am sorry\" like some scratchy record. No offer to see what was wrong or attempt to fix it. 7) I'm glad I didn't pick up the hire car until the following day when I checked-out as they would have stung me for another $30. This was a truly bad experience. I will never stay there again. It is not value for money and my previous view of the Hyatt brand (which previously I have had the very highest regard for) has been destroyed.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cNot at all pleased with my Hyatt experience\u201d", "Author": "Webini", "ReviewID": "UR5534368", "Content": "Stayed at the Hyatt Harborside on 7/29 for one night.

If you want to see Boston there are much better options unless you have a car. As I said the view of the harbour is beautiful - it you can see it! Our room had a lovely view of the parking lot. This is probably because it was a Priceline reservation but don't expect to automatically get the nice view. Several complaints about this hotel. The first being that you cannot close the curtains! There is a \"privacy\" curtain that is very thin but you cannot close the drapes. This is a major problem if you have a room facing the parking lot as the room is very bright at sunrise and there is not a thing you can do about it. No fridge, no minibar. The towels you could literally see through. The TV is vintage 1990. Dust you could write your name in on the top of the bed. Oh yeah, and $30 parking!!!!

Nice Boston hotels are very expensive, but we got a good rate thru Hyatt.com. Our room was clean, and very quiet. The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. They have one restaurant with a breakfast buffet that was great. This hotel is right next to the water taxi dock. The MBTA commuter boat (F2, F2H, see MBTA.com) runs across the harbor to downtown, about 5-10 minute ride. Also the Rowes Wharf Water Taxi, and the Boston Water Taxi. If you buy a round trip ticket on the taxi, note the DIFFERENT company. There are several stops in downtown, so it is easy to get around. The Hyatt shuttle can take awhile for pickups from the T blue line stop, so the water transportation is a lot faster. Also, with all but one tunnel closed in the city, traffic via cab can be bad. Next to the dock, the T runs a shuttle to the airlines, which is quick and easy, as there is always a bus there. Take the water taxi to Long Wharf or IMAX, and cross over to Faneuil Hall. Walk down the main market and get some of the best food ever at a decent price. Boston, $$$ to live in and visit, but one of a kind.

The hotel was amazing, and a great value for the $139 per night I paid through the Hyatt website. My room was tastefully furnished, with a plush and generously-pillowed king-size bed, loveseat couch with coffee table, desk and desk chair, dresser, and large TV. I especially appreciated the coffee maker and to-go paper cups. I took the T from downtown to the airport and then took the hotel shuttle bus to the hotel. The shuttle was a bit slow to arrive (maybe 15-20 minutes waiting time). I also took the shuttle from the hotel to the airport the following morning, which was extremely speedy, with the shuttle waiting outside the hotel when I got there and dropping me off at my terminal within 7 minutes. Dinner at the hotel's restaurant was good, but overpriced at $28 for a basic veal scallopini dinner dish with spinach and risotto. For future reference, I think I would have ordered room service which had some options in the $12-18 range. Given that the hotel is near the airport and little else, you're a captive audience and don't have much choice of dining options. That said, the wait staff was pleasant and ambiance enjoyable. When I let them know that I needed to eat quickly because I was expecting a business call back in my room, they graciously expedited things. I didn't explore the pool, gym, bar or business center, but I gather that they all existed. The walls were thin enough that I could hear a bit of the conversation of my nextdoor neighbor, as well as his television. However, it wasn't so loud that it kept me from being able to fall asleep. Service was excellent, with the front desk staff always addressing me by name when I called down with questions, and delivering wake-up calls (yes plural, I needed a follow-up call to make sure I hadn't fallen back asleep) in an non-automated and timely manner. Overall, the Hyatt Harborside had the feel of a much more expensive hotel, but without the large price tag. I would certainly choose to stay here again for a night before or after a flight from Logan.", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairhaven, MA", "Title": "\u201cImpeccable\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4451358", "Content": "Stayed here before a morning flight to the BVI.

The lobby is elegant and minimalist, and refreshingly calm. It's got nice seating areas with huge windows offering you an incredible (and I do mean incredible) view of Boston's skyline, particularly at night. The hotel is also very pleasantly fragrant - they must definitely scent the air because the lobby, elevators and hallways all have a hint of fragrance. The rooms are large and comfortable, with more modern minimalism, excellent in-room furnishings (great work desk and a sofa) and comfortable beds with too many pillows! Bathrooms are large and modern, with Portico bath amenities (No body lotion tho - it must be a Hyatt thing). I agree that the room service is pricey, but it's also very good. In-room movie and entertainment options are great. The workout room next to the indoor pool is very nice, again offering a great view of Boston. I agree with many posters on the location. It's fine for access to Logan, but waiting on shuttles to get to and from the T station to go to and from Boston or Cambridge is time-consuming. The shuttle drivers are friendly and accommodating though, but make sure you keep 50 cents in change or a cell phone to call for the shuttle from the T station.

This is an older hotel that used to be a Fairfield Inn by Marriott. My room door (339) was very hard to open, they must have re-carpeted without trimming the bottom of the door. The room was small, the bathroom is very small. The window seals are failing so many of the windows are fogged up. The internet worked great. Breakfast was basic, there were waffles you make yourself, but no bread for toast. The AC did not cycle so I woke up at 2am and my room was 62 degrees! It is an OK budget motel. Good price (about $50), good location with easy access to office park and I-465. Bed was firm, but bedding was older and the fitted sheets wouldn\u2019t stay on the bed. The outdoor pool was cold so I didn\u2019t go swimming. The hotel is far enough away from Michigan Avenue and I-465 that noise is not a problem. The Holiday Inn across the street has a large water park that must allow the general public (for a fee) and customers park all over Wesleyan and Depauw Blvd creating congestion. Restaurants are all over this part of town.

It started as a Fairfield Inn, and then switched to a Super 8. Since it became a Super 8 it has steadily gotten worse, and this year is enough to send us looking for a new hotel for next Memorial Day. When we walked into our room, we noticed that it smelled off. I would say that it reminded me of a place that has a dog with long hair and it smells like pet and burnt hair after vacuuming. The floor of the shower was dirty looking. The first night we noticed one of the pillows was completely ripped down one side. We left it out of the case for the maid to switch it out. When we got back, the pillow was back in the case, with the ripped side pointing in instead of out. And the floor felt like there were spots missing under the carpet, walking around the room would be a series of us and downs. The sheet kept coming off the bed, and everything just felt plain dirty. I wanted to walk around with my socks on the floor. I think it started out poorly when we checked in, we gave the last name, and nothing was verified. We switched from one credit card to another, and the man at the desk never asked for a signature or anything, even though the names on the reservation and the credit card were completely different. I could have checked in with anyone's credit card, and no one would have known. On the plus side, there is a nice beautiful flat screen HD TV in the lobby.

Plenty of parking and exterior appearance was decent with very nice abundant flowers in front of the lobby area. Check-in(arrived at 3:15 p.m.) went smoothly and the male attendant was friendly. I was assigned a 2nd floor room 222 which had a king bed(although I believe it was closer to a queen size). I was surprised at just how comfortable the bed was to sleep in, although you should definitely bring your own pillow(s). The bottom sheet was a flat sheet instead of a fitted sheet like a previous reviewer mentioned so by morning time I was laying on a bare mattress. The restroom/shower room area is a little cramped for space but it did the trick. The drain in the shower was apparently partially clogged though so I was standing in ankle high water by the time I finished my shower. The only other problem is that if you are on the 2nd floor, it is difficult to use your room key card to call the elevator up to the 2nd floor. I had to try on average about six times with my key card before I was successful in calling up the elevator. The FREE continental breakfast was nice and it ran from I think 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.. I got down there at 8:00 a.m. and there was still plenty of food(waffle maker, cereal, milk, banana).

The woman at the front desk acted like she would rather be ANYWHERE else but there. We were checked in without any problems, thankfully, and headed up to the room. The appearance of the room was fine for a super 8, and it smelled clean, but the room was FREEZING cold. We checked the temperature setting - the A/C was on the lowest it could possibly be, but it still felt like the arctic. As we were getting in to bed that night, we noticed that the bottom sheet on the bed was a flat sheet (not fitted) - this is fairly common in hotels I've stayed at, however the sheet was too short to be tucked in, it wasjust hanging loosely on the bottom. When we woke up in the morning, it was to a bare matress. The bottom sheet had bunched up in the middle of the bed. Additionally, the bedspread was made of a very slippery fabric, and that had ended up sliding on the floor during the night. With the freezing temperature and no top blanket, we were pretty miserable. Not to mention that the mattress sagged a little in the middle, so my husband and I were smushed up against eachother. The shower was fine and we headed out for the day. We returned that night, ready to shower, to find that the maids had taken our used towels, but had not replaced them with fresh ones. We had no towels. We called the front desk to have them bring some up, explaining that they had been forgotten. The woman at the desk told us we would have to come down and get some ourselves, because she could not leave her desk (even though we had already seen her out back smoking a few times - apparently it's okay to leave the desk for that). One of the primary reasons we selected this hotel was that we were told it offered free wireless internet. I set up my laptop and was directed to a log on page for the free internet - I just needed an access code. I called the front desk to find out what it was, but was informed that the internet was disabled at night -- ?!?!?!? I was VERY disappointed about this - I had work to take care of and could not do it because I couldn't use the internet after 10, and it wouldnt' be available until 7. We were gone during the day, as many people who stay at a super 8 would be (it's not some luxury resort where you feel comfortable lounging in your room during the day), so we were unable to get any use out of the \"free internet.\" I would never return to this super 8 again, and do NOT recommend it to anyone else.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Paul MN", "Title": "\u201cA mixed bag, check your room upon arrival!\u201d", "Author": "MnSensei", "ReviewID": "UR7171908", "Content": "When I arrived on Wednesday aroung 5 pm and went to my room I flipped on the light switch, nothing.

On the plus side most of the staff was friendly, the free wireless is great and there is an adequate tv selection, nice pool and good parking. I had a couple other issues though. My room wasn't cleaned until between 4pm and 5 pm daily even though I was out of it by 9 am, and when I didn't get plastic cups or an ice bucket I couldn't find a maid who could speak enough english to understand what I was missing.

The elevator was old, scary and small, so we only used it to go up and used the stairs to come down.We felt very safe walking from Bourbon or Frenchman at night. Quiet area and good hot (free) coffee in the morning. Parking was a bit of a goat rope (you need a map), but its free and that's unusual in New Orleans.

This is what I wrote in my trip report about Villa Convento: I had room 302 and LOVED it! It's for a certain type of person though, I think--if you're excited by the sound of my husband's room at the Hilton in the Business District (cookie-cutter) then you might not love Hotel Villa Convento--it's very funky. My husband and I both adored it though, especially the exposed brick wall and the balcony facing Croissant D'Or across the street! There isn't anything but wrought iron separating the balcony from its neighbor so it doesn't really have much privacy, and the building across the street has a balcony, but I LOVED it out there and spent huge parts of the day out there, reading, eating, drinking, people-watching, even though it was REALLY hot! I love that you can see into the Beauregard-Keyes House garden across the street, which is supposedly haunted. The elevator is also super-funky (200 years old, floral-padded and only fits 2 people) and I loved it, but I did try to take the stairs for the most part! The inner courtyard is cute and the way some rooms open onto it reminds me of Armistead Maupin's Barbary Lane.

For the remainder of our stay, Room 302 was a perfect fit with a wonderful view. We could even see the tops of ships as they went down the Mississippi (the sea wall kept part of the view obscured) We also view many carriages going by in front of the hotel as well as a second line parade and the filming of a commercial. The bed was very comfortable which made it very easy to sleep. Even if you don't get a balcony room at the Villa Convento, there are plenty of outdoor stairways and balconies where you can take great pictures or just get some excellent views. As on my first visit, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Vince was ever smiling and happy to tell us about area attractions and life in the French Quarter.

We had no desire to stay at the typical hotel that's perfect to a fault: no charm, no character, all cookie-cutter. You don't get that with Villa Convento. Granted, we stayed in a suite, but if the other rooms are anything like that one, I can't imagine I'd think any differently about the place. The bed was comfortable, the porch/balcony was relatively secluded with a great view of New Orleans proper, and the courtyard had a pleasant European charm. The staff was extremely courteous. We got there and the room wasn't ready yet, so Warren had a locked closet to stash our luggage while we grabbed lunch at the French Market, which was well within walking distance. Speaking of distance, its proximity to Frenchman Street (where we spent our evenings hopping jazz clubs) was close enough that it didn't feel as if we were walking miles to and from our room. If I had to critique anything, one big one is that you're not allowed to adjust the temperature of the a/c. In July and August that probably wouldn't be an issue, but April isn't so hot that we need constant air conditioning. Having only one trash can was also a bit vexing, since we would bring food back to the hotel to eat later and would leave our take-out boxes half hanging out of the tiny trash can. We were also under the impression that a whirlpool bath was included in the suite, which it wasn't, but perhaps we read the website wrong.

My friend arrived the day before I did and was offered room 104 off of the courtyard, instead of the 2nd floor room that we were originally suppose to stay in. Since this seemed reasonable, she agreed. What a disaster!! It started when entering the room and having the room door handle fall off in her hand...it went downhill from there. The smell of the room was awful. She was told that this was an old building and she may not be \"used\" to the musty smell. \"Musty\" doesn't even come close to describing it. After trying to put up with the smell and finding that it was almost unbearable, she requested a change in rooms - but was told they were booked full and we couldn't be moved. The entire place needs to have a deep cleaning. There was black mold very visible in the bathroom corners/ceiling and on the bath mat. Moths were flying around in the room. We could have put up with the holes in the walls and the worn furniture but the lack of cleanliness was appalling. We didn't unpack anything as we didn't want the smell and anything else invading our clothing. Our belongings still picked up the odor of the room and it was very noticeable when we moved to a new hotel. The room was so dim, even with every light turned on, that you couldn't read a book. Parking is free but make sure that you realize it is 5 blocks away. Thank goodness we were able to find another hotel. A positive - they didn't hold us to their 72 hr cancellation requirement but we did give them a 24 hr notice as we couldn't immediately get into another hotel.

I knew when we checked it that this was a building built in the early 1800s. I knew that the rooms would be smaller and not have all the fancy amenities that the crown plaza would have. I booked this for the old world charm and the convience of being smack dab in the middle of the french quarter. It turned out that my husband and i both had the flu the entire stay and spent a large amount of time in the bed.

When we first opened the door, I immediately smelled \"pee\" and my friend smelled \"bachelor flop house.\" The smelled didn't improve even after leaving the balcony door open for a while. We ended up buying incense to sort of cover up the sour smell. It rained that day, while we were away. Upon returning to the room, I stepped onto wet carpet that literally soaked through my sock. It wasn't a small area, pretty much the majority of the area between the bed and the balcony door. (That explained the sour wet smell.) When I mentioned it to the front desk, I was told: \"Huh. I thought they fixed that. Sorry.\" Seriously, that was it. The floor was damp for the full 3 days and 2 nights we were in the room. Then we started actually looking around the room. Holes in the wall. A nail hole filled in with something blue--toothpaste? Water stains on the ceiling and wall. Dust that had turned into dirt in most corners. Even the cord for the hairdryer was gross and dirty. The bathtub didn't drain, so you had to take a shower standing in dirty water standing up to mid-shin. (Sadly, I always seemed to get the second shower, so two people's dirty water up to mid-shin). On a positive note, the location was great. Able to walk everywhere, and much less noisy than mid French Quarter. The front desk, while not really caring about the state of the room, were very pleasant and otherwise helpful. The balconies are *great*. Perfect way to start your morning is to walk over to Croissant D'or and wake up with coffee and a pastry. Be forewarned, however, that the balconies are *awful* when your drunk neighbor comes home and talks loudly on the next balcony at 3AM) In closing, if you don't mind stinky, dirty rooms but crave a great location, this is the place for you.

Admittedly the hotel is on the older side. Our room was the middle balcony room on the 2nd floor and had carpeting and smelled a little musty. The neighboring balcony rooms both have hard wood floors I believe and didn't smell musty at all. For the price compared to other French Quarter hotels and for the location I can't say anything bad about this place. Across the street you have the famous D'Or Bakery which has what I think are the best chocolate croissants in the US. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the parking situation which requires toting a key back and forth to get your car out. Would be great if they would upgrade the garage door to work with the hotel keys or some other type of code. There was actually plenty of street parking right on Ursulines Street so we only had to use the garage 1 night to clear the street for the parade route.

Hotel Villa Convento was half the price of the Cornstalk Fence Hotel where we already had 5 nights reservation for the rest of Mardi Gras. Almost no room anywhere is worth the price you pay at Mardi Gras, but that itself is the price you pay for going to Mardi Gras. We arrived about 10:30 pm and were greeted by friendly desk clerk who gave us the all the basic information. Our room was a Queen Courtyard room. The interior of the building was very cool (if you like old and historic). Understand we have spent nearly 40 nights in 13-14 years coming to New Orleans annually and have stayed at many places. There was hot tea and coffee available in the cute little lobby which faced the street with windows open and was a very cozy seating area. Down the hall to find our room we passed an information board where they changed out the daily weather and happenings for guests to see. Out into the small but quaint courtyard we found a fountain and plants and a few tables with chairs. There appeared to an ice machine there too but we didn't use it. Our room had wood floors (very cool), a nice bed, brick interior walls. The ceiling fan was a great asset. Individual cooled room with fan option provided maximum comfort and background noise though we never heard any other room noise. We got several orbs in our photos from the first five minutes in the room but experienced nothing else ghostly during our 1 night. The sink is in the room with a separate room with shower and toilet. Plus: Location is excellent. Ceiling fan. Individual controlled air and fan (I'm a light sleeper and the background noise was great). Building and rooms are funky historic. Being parrotheads we loved that Jimmy Buffett had reportedly lived there in an apt. Rooms were clean and didn't smell smokey although there was a slight musty smell (but yeah you have to remember old, historic building in a damp city). Flat panel tv on the wall. Minus: Not much closet space (a rack in the corner of the room), but we didn't require any. Paint job looks like it was done by a six year old. Really, attention to detail with paint and maintenance was lacking in our room. The biggest minus as previous reviewers alluded to was that we woke in the a.m. to a smoker sitting 4 feet from our door puffing away. We couldn't open our door without letting the smoke inside. Nasty. Would be better to make the small courtyard nonsmoking too because the smoke hangs there in the courtyard. The Hotel Monteleone this is not, but that was not what we were looking for. As we told the clerk upon check-out, this is our kind of funky place and she said summer rates were really cheap (maybe half price), as we indicated we might be back in July. We mentioned above we spent the next 5 nights at the Cornstalk Fence Hotel, but we'd come back to the Hotel Villa Convento before we stayed there again. We'll stay most any place in the Quarter once.

Other things to be aware of is that the hotel falsely advertises that you will have a nice breakfast everyday in fliers and quite obviously online with photos, etc. This is 100% not true. There's coffee in a thermos at reception and of course a lovely cafe across the street where you pay for your own. Parking was a fiasco.

We stayed at the Hotel Villa Convento. Its family ran only, which is great and we got a great price. I have read several reviews and some not good. Let me tell you what it does not have, it more than makes up for it in the friendly family staff, location, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cozy quarters and no matter what room you get your sure to have a beautiful time. I chose this hotel for many reasons: about 8 years ago my now ex-husband and I stayed there over night while I was on tour. It was fantastic and I feel in love with it straight away. The other reason is I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a parapsychologist and this hotel is very active. We stayed in room 300 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which a female and male ghost tend to roam. The bed shook, had my foot crabbed, was told to get out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not like get out!!! He wanted me up out of bed because it was 8:30am and I felt like sleeping in. I had my foot tickled one night and I heard the most beautiful music from an old Victrola play which had soft violins. I even saw a female ghost in the apartment across from the balcony at 1am one night. I did have a heard time sleeping because of the activate, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very sensitive to these things and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I went there for an got it. Even the smell of perfume, which neither me nor my friend wore because all the humidity during the day and night (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pointless). The ladies of the House of the Rising Sun never sleep and are still working. We had a balcony which we took advantage of every day and night. The room was freezing even thought the ac was set on 72 my gage said it was 52 near the bed but 72 at the ac. We bought the owner a bottle of wine and meet another guest who was there on business. We drank wine in the lobby with them and had a fantastic time. Because the owner is local he told us about all the great local restaurants to eat at. We found this place called the Green Goddess it was one of my very favorites. There chief buys the freshest foods and the menu chances every two weeks. It was so much fun!!! I PROMISE you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy you stayed at the Hotel Villa Convento and tell them Lady Gigi Frost sent you!!! We had clean sheets and pillow cases everyday, a freshly made bed, clean towels, soap everything we needed. THE BED WAS LIKE SLEEPING ON AIR - SO COMFORTABLE!!!With this said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the W or some swanky hotel, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got caricature, charm, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite (minus the ghosts), it has serious history and it is the only place I will ever stay when I visit N.O\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!!!", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cCozy and Unique Hotel in a Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "memphisbelle84", "ReviewID": "UR72478947", "Content": "This hotel is located at the far end of the French Quarter on Ursulines.

Villa Convento offered the most affordable rate as one of the French Quarter's most historically colorful original homes. On the shuttle ride from the airport to the hotel I watched everyone else get off at massive remodeled hotels on noisy bourbon street and other high traffic corners. I was among the last stops. As the bus turned the corner onto Ursuline Street the sounds of tourists instantly diminished and it was although I had just went through a time capsule. To my right was the Ursuline convent lined by picturesque historic homes with just enough wear to confirm their authenticity. The shuttle parked in front of Croissant D' Or (a favorite among locals for pastries other than beignets and coffee). Directly across the street was the Old Creole townhome with 25 rooms (Villa Convento). My point is- everything about this hotel including it's location is AUTHENTIC to the soul of New Orleans that entices most us wandering from less romanticized places. The courtyard was eerily tranquil other than birds chirping above the old water fountain chipped in several places. I was worried my son would be a nuisance to this place- not so. I wouldn't scare anyone away by suggesting this place has troubled ghosts or anything... but the place DEFINITELY has a spirit... or two about it; hard to describe. Whatever it was it had an unusually calming effect on both my son and I. I am someone that NEVER stays in my hotel room even for a minute when I go anywhere- and I have stayed at some really nice places. This place was unlike any others; exceptionally unique. I truly could have stayed in my room and in the courtyard the entire time and still felt like I had absorbed a substantial part of New Orleans' spirit. This place is a MUST try for anyone that is really into history and especially the more colorful history of the Vieux Carre. This place is also a \"make possible\" option for anyone who wants to have a memorable experience without spending loads of money. That said the staff here is PHENOMENAL. Loved every one of them. Warren, Erin, Casey... And one other girl who was also a total sweetheart (I feel bad forgetting her name) were all totally welcoming, knowledgeable, and honest. Very very impressive staff. In a nutshell if you want a place with all the bells and whistles of enormous commercial complexes and massive hotels- this place is NOT for you. If you want somewhere that tempts you to hold your ear to the wall with the suspicion that you'll hear whispers from the past- this place is PERFECT. If you want to escape to somewhere peaceful and quiet with the all the historical charms of New Orleans being unobstructed by drunk and/or frenzied tourists- this place is TOP NOTCH.

The bathroom had a plastic shower curtain that was ripped. Fingerprints from guests past were all over walls, doors, near light switches - does no one wipe down the walls? The art work was also ripped or dented along with the wall paper. Water stains also marked the ceilings and walls, shoeprints and luggage scrapes scarred the interior of our room. A fresh coat of paint or new art from a flea market would have helped. The bed was bowed - like sleeping in a hammock - that definitely added to the poor sleep we got. It was so cold in the rooms, that we were provided with electrical heaters. But there was no comfortable medium. At night the air was so hot and dry your mouth, tongue, lips and nostrils dried up and in the mornings we had sore throats. The bathroom sink is in the bedroom and it would clog with in seconds of brushing your teeth or washing your face.

There was no heat in our room, unless we used the space heater, which was a fire hazard. The place was a badly organized, badly maintained, filthy mess, had no heat, an elevator at the end of the hall that woke us up with banging and groaning every time it was in use.

We were unfortunate enough not to be able to park in the 10 minute loading zone due to several people being parked there for an extended time. This made unloading and loading the car difficult since it is a one-way street and people would not wait for us to get our luggage (lots of honking and ugly looks). Other than the parking problem (which is quite common in the French Quarter), check-in and check-out was a breeze. The staff was very friendly and helfpul.

It wasn't very big, but who plans to stay in their hotel room while in New Orleans? The room itself was clean, but had a funny odor to it. The ceiling had some major stains, but overall things were fine. Bourbon Street is 2 blocks away, as well as the French Market. There are plenty of places to eat in the area, and shopping is good as well (I would suggest Royal Street). New Orleans is a changed place of course, and could really use a face-life (as well as this hotel). I spoke with other tourists during our stay, and they all agreed that most hotels in the area (even the very expensive ones) need a major overhauling these days.

It was crawling up the brick wall in our room! There was another one under the night stand as well that peeked its head out at about the same time.

Plaster is falling off of the walls, the chairs in the entry are threadbare, and there are water stains on the ceiling and walls. Some of the problems can be attributed to Katrina, but many can not. The carpets were not vacumed the entire time we were there, with the same pieces of lint and small debris never removed.

The bathroom walls had splatter spots that could have been easily washed off, along with simple things like washing light switches overlooked. Also, while the location of the hotel in the lower French Quarter is very quiet, we could clearly hear the conversations and TV from the room next to us. One day, when we returned from our activities, the room had not been cleaned and when I mentioned to the management that the maid had missed our room, was told that we wouldn't have maid service the next day either because the maid had gone to Houston! I think some of the staffing problems can be attributed to the shortage of labor because of Katrina, but, in general, I got the impression that the owners were just letting the place get rundown out of apathy or because they know people will continue to book there because of the location.

The carpet is worn, there is some peeling wallpaper and chipped paint, but for me these cosmetic flaws are mitigated by the old building's charm, its great location, and the friendly Campo family. I stayed several nights in 302, which I like because it's on top (no annoying footsteps overhead), has a balcony, and is away from the noisy elevator. I love the exposed worn brick and, while smaller than some hotel rooms, the room was roomy for me. It was spotless, and they've added hair dryers, irons, and ironing boards since my last stay. I like having the sink/vanity separate from the bathroom. There was a ceiling fan plus AC unit, which one needs in late October. There's also satellite TV. I grabbed newspapers from the street each morning and read them on the balcony as local folks washed off their stoops and swept their sidewalks below me. The Campos are always full of tourist tips, and I enjoyed meeting the newest family member, Oyster, a Lab they rescued from an oyster bed who hangs out behind the registration desk. Try the funky Clover Grill diner on 900 Royal for 24-hour-breakfast. There's also a full A&P grocery on Royal, and a Walgreen's near the Jax Brewery mall on the river. If you have a car, be aware that there is zoned parking everywhere in the Quarter, meaning many spaces are limited to two hours if you are not a resident. Also, construction vehicles take up a lot of parking space. I always find paid parking in lots on the edges of the Quarter, some of which use the honor system for payment.

Cannot understand at all why people still complain about a place this nice and this reasonably priced?", "Date": "April 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but could be better.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3283211", "Content": "My husband and I decided to stay here for our first trip to New Orleans in November. The location, price and ambiance were great but I could not help feeling that with a little effort it could have been so much better. The staff was amazing from the time we booked reservations to the end of our stay and the location was everything we could have asked for. I think the balcony was what made our room. We ended up spending every night on it talking while watching people walk by. The elevator was a bit run down but was very European and I kind of liked it's antique charm. The hotel in general could use a little renovation though. Our room seemed continually humid (yes I know this is just part of NO), but we could not get our AC working right. On a few occasions we were kept up by the sound of other people in their rooms. Like a previous person mentioned the plant on our balcony was dead and the pot filled with cigarette butts. If you are willing to overlook a few of these things for the location and quaintness then go for it. If these are the things that really bug you I would find another hotel.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, however, our room was filthy!\u201d", "Author": "Elaine_K_SA", "ReviewID": "UR3237535", "Content": "After reading other reviews of the Hotel Villa Convento, I looked forward to our stay with much anticipation. The location was great and the price was right, so what could be so wrong? Our room was filthy! The floor in the sink area had a thick accumulation of dust and hair in the corners and the white light fixture over the sink was so caked with dust and dirt, the color was dark gray. In addition, the walls were filthy and stained, badly in need of a fresh coat of paint. Finally, to top it all off, the stench of stale cigarettes was so overwhelming, I got sick to my stomach. (Did I mention the flower pot FULL of cigarette butts just outside our door???) Our bedspread had several rips, as well, and the lamp shades were also caked with dust. I could go on... When I politely pointed this all out to the gal at the front desk, she said I would have to speak with the manager about the light fixture. What??? I tactfully mentioned the only thing needed was a wet rag treatment by the cleaning staff. She acted like I was asking for something unreasonable! So, when the light fixture was still filthy after they \"cleaned\" the room, I took one of their towels and cleaned it myself. (It only took ten second!) The bottom line is there appeared to be no pride of ownership. The common areas were dirty, too, so perhaps this hotel has gone down hill since the previous reviews were written. Advice: If you have dust allergies like I do, don't stay at this hotel; especially in room 105.

The elevator may be small to some, but we found it to be a perfect fit to the entire hotel. This was the first time we stayed in the quarter (an area filled with a rich history) and we found the hotel to be very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of other parts of the french quarter. We could not hear the other guests staying on either side of us and we got a great night's rest every night. The balcony was my husband's favorite part.

While the outside could stand a little attention (i.e paintwork) the room was very nice; I just considered this little \"flaw\" part of the ambiance. After all, I didn't go to New Orleans to stay in a hotel room! If you go in knowing you're not staying at the Ritz, but an original old New Orleans brothel, you'll enjoy the stay.

The elevator is a bit scary and slow, but once you get used to it, and realize its a great peice of historical architechture, you dont mind it so much! Their breakfast consists of pastries and yummies from the delicious cafe across the street. The room was nice and spacious, with a living room and a wonderful JET tub!

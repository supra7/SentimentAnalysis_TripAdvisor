Old/Outdated. Musky smell in room. Filthy carpets everywhere. Faded furniture and decor. Shower was nasty with missing paint on metal. Towel very very thin. Ugly beach lots of rocks not pleasant at all. You have to pay 8.00/day just to park a rental. Pool was small and so was hot tub. Not appealing at all. Seemed to be an older customer service, everyone I saw looked to be over 60 or so. We stayed 6 nights and they wanted to move us every other night, we were promised an upgrade but denied it once we were there. I will never return. I recommend biting the bullet and paying the extra money to go up to the nice resorts with beautiful beaches. Bus fair is only 1.00 to ride into Lahaina front street and you will only need one day for that. One positive was the bed was comfortable and sheets where nice and smooth. Good luck.

Having usually stayed at major Kaanapali hotels, we decided to try Lahaina Shores at the recommendation of a friend. We were leery as some of the TripAdvisor reviews were not complementary reflecting a dated property, but as others have stated, it is important to request an upgraded renovated 'premier' ocean front room, which we did. The hotel is not quite as fancy as many of the major hotels, but our room was exceptional looking as it had been recently renovated. The room was wonderfully appointed and modern and most importantly right on the ocean, where we could hear the waves roll in as we sat on our Lanai or dozed off to sleep each and every night of our five day stay. We found the staff to be helpful and courteous going beyond the call of duty at every opportunity. The grounds were lovely and there was never a problem obtaining a lawn chair. To top it all off, the location is the best on the Island enabling one to walk back and forth to town for shopping, strolling or dining without the necessity of a car. The only disappointment from our point of view was the absence of a fitness centre of any form with the closest one being a ten minute drive away. Anyway, this quaint hotel was perfect in all regards.

The second room was nice. I was told that the rooms are condos and the owners decide when to do the upgrading. Good luck with that. Were we the brunt of an overbooking pratice? I'll never know.

The main complaints fall into 2 categories the construction noise and the room condition. The main remodeling construction of the lobby area and the external structure is now over so the construction is now contained to individual rooms The problem with the rooms are that they are all privately owned and as such are in very different condition. Some are great some are terrible.I am sure most people are shocked when they get to there room after looking at the lobby they probably think they stepped into a different hotel. The lobby area and furnishings do not honestly represent the room space and furnishings you will stay in, in most cases. In an attempt to correct the this disparity between the lobby and the rooms the ownership have made it mandatory to upgrade rooms for people in the rental pool , this will fix the problem but in the meantime there will be construction noise in individual rooms as they are being remodeled. I have stayed while a room close by was being remodeled and the noise was not that bad but then again I am in Hawaii so I spend most of my time on the beach during the day not in my room. In conclusion I would say that Lahaina Shores is a great place to stay, the alternatives are huge resorts that give you the feeling you could be in any place in the world . I would suggest 2 things, first call the front desk directly before you arrive to make sure you are getting the room you want ,( they also have slightly higher priced rooms that have already been remodeled ). You can also book the rooms from the owners directly at VRBO and these tend to be nicer rooms but are also usually a bit more expensive as they charge a cleaning deposit.

The pool and hot tub were nice and relaxed in those every evening after long days discovering Maui. There were an adequate number of beach chairs and most people just lounged on them on the lawn. The grounds were pretty with palm trees and tropical flowers. We used the parking lot for $8 per day and always found a spot.

We were not disappointed! This hotel is made up of condo style rooms where some are privately owned and some are managed by the hotel. We chose room 507 with an ocean view which was privately owned through VRBO. The room was recently updated and had new appliances, marble counters, tile floors and new carpet. The view was amazing and there were automatic blackout shades to keep the sun out in the late afternoon. The only reason I am not giving this 5 starts is because I am a tech geek and the tv was outdated and small, the radio display would not work and would often turn off, and wile there was internet, it was not wireless and the cable would not reach to the porch. I bought a 25' cord from Radio Shack and was easily able to over come that problem. Internet was expensive but I needed to use it to stay in touch. The location right in the town of Lahaina is a huge reason why we returned. All the restaurants, shops and stores are less than 5 min walk away. We saved a ton of money mixing drinks to go in our room and wandering along Front Street. We stayed over Halloween and there is a huge annual street party where thousands of people fill Front Street in costume and party. So many fun costumes! Just next door to the hotel is a retail center with a fully stocked convenience store and a restaurant called Betty's. Betty's has free wireless and every night there is a Luau right out there window that you can enjoy for free. The luau is operated by another business but it's like you are right there in the audience and can see the whole thing. Lahaina Shores is NOT an all inclusive resort with porters and waiters and huge sculpted walking grounds. It has an adequate pool and a hot tub and there are enough sunning chairs for the guests. The beach is narrow but is quiet. If you are looking for a pool bar and huge beach this is not the hotel for you.

Therefore, there has been horribly loud construction sounds and jack hammering from 10:00 AM till 5:00 PM. I am currently listening to this as I am writing this review. The first time it was happening, I didn't think much of it cause we were leaving anyways. All other weekdays, it was not an issue because we were gone the entire day. The weekend and Labor day were not an issue as well because renovations were not happening those days apparently. However, today is Tuesday, our last day on Maui, and we are exhausted and not feeling well and the jack-hammering/ banging is occurring. I called down to the front desk twice now and the first time was told there was nothing they could do, no matter where they put us in the building, we would hear construction happening in one of the rooms but that I would receive a call back to inform me when the construction would stop. That call never came. So I called back again frustrated that I couldn't even make a phone call or speak to my husband due to this loud noise. This time, I spoke with a woman who denied that there was any construction happening around our room. She more or less was arguing with me about it but said she would call and find out if there was construction happening but still stated that there was nothing that could be done.

Since I couldn't get a flight home from Kauai, I made the trip and stayed in Maui overnight. He had reserved an ocean-view studio with a king-size bed. We arrived at about 9:30 PM on Sunday night, anxious to check in and find a restaurant for dinner.

After reviewing the various bookings and room availability, they reassigned us to another room. Because it was so late, I headed off to one of the restaurants next door hoping that they were still serving (they weren't), while my husband switched the luggage to our newly assigned room. When we reunited, I learned that while we had an ocean-view room, it had twin beds. So much for the room that we had reserved. The other problem that we encountered was the overall maintenance of our room. Because the shower head was not properly installed, on first use water sprayed all over the room. We were able to fix it, but the point is that it shouldn't have been necessary. The other problem we encountered was that the iron did not work properly - it was too hot - and it burned one of the shirts that we were ironing.

We chose it because of the location, price, and good trip advisor reviews. We stayed in Maui before at Kaanapali Beach at the Royal Lahaina. We found this hotel to be nice. The room was very large and had a nice size kitchen with a full size refrigerator. The bathroom was nice and I liked the fact that the shower and toilet area were separated from the vanity and sink. Our view was a mountain view and okay. We did look up into the mountains but also overlooked the parking lot. But the balcony was large and fine for our needs. We were in close walking distance to the tons of shops, galleries and restaurants on Front Street so that was a plus. The hotel had a small pool which was nice and they supplied towels. Parking was $8 per day in a secured lot. We were right at the beach, but it was very small and not very appealing. I would suggest finding another beach to visit. There are so many beautiful ones on the island, so drive to another location for a better beach. The concierge offers a free talk and a continental type breakfast on your first morning with some danish, muffins, coffee and juice. She will book any excursions that you are interested in. Also, I liked the fact that there was coin operated laundry available on many floors. We did laundry on the first day we arrived since we had already spent a week on the Big Island and this saved us from packing so many clothes. All in all a nice place to stay at reasonable prices. I woudn't call it luxury, but it was clean and well maintained and accomodated our needs. The only thing that would have helped would be an included breakfast.

I was able to open this interior door and see my neighbor's door, where I could hear them inside the room. The other side of each door doesn't have a door handle, so I don't think you could actually open your neighbor's door. But, my door was loose in the frame, so it might not take much to get my door open. I called down to the desk to explain the issue and a maintenance person came to my room.

Of course the comfy bed and pillows helped as well Before bed, we received a phone call from the front desk to check that everything was satisfactory and to see if we needed anything. So kind and thoughtful. The next morning we awoke to beautiful sunny skies and clear waters (just what Lahaina is known for). Our view from PH #7 was priceless! We could see the beach and the waters in front of the resort, the quiet, small harbor with boats coming and going, the offshore islands, etc. It was everything you wanted to see your first morning on Maui! Throughout our stay, we were always greeted by kind and helpful people at Lahina Shores. From the front desk, to the activity expert, to the housekeeping service. The pool and spa area was a great place to relax and read and sun bathe - with barbeques near by those nights we stayed in. We loved spending time on the lanai of PH#7 on the patio furniture that afforded us the wonderful views and in the evenings we had the soft music from the luau to eat to!! The beach was just STEPS from the resort and always quiet and calm. The resort is located on the BEST beach for swimming and paddle boarding but also close to surf lessons and good snorkeling. The resort itself is also in the perfect location to walk to 505 Front Street for: surf lessons, restaurants, a luau, and a massage or a spa day! It is also located a short walk to downtown Lahaina with even more amazing restaurants, art galleries, the Banyan Tree, shopping, etc!

Either way, the grounds are pretty and it is just steps from the elevator to the beach. It is a very quiet relaxed atmosphere without all of the commercialism of the big resorts. All units have kitchens, and there are a couple of barbecues on on the grounds. The beach isn't exactly the best on Maui, but it is uncrowded, and offers some good snorkeling. If you go out in the morning while the tide is low, and walk south on the beach, you can walk out thigh-deep into the ocean and enjoy seeing a tropical aquarium full of fish, eels, octopus, and maybe even a seal. This is a no-frills resort so if you are looking to be pampered and waited on, this is not the place for you. If you want comfort and the real feeling of Aloha, this is your place!

I'll try to be concise. Our room, 411, was well equipped. The Murphy bed was comfortable and folded up easily to create more space. Kitchen amenities were fine although having plastic tumblers for pool drinks would be a bonus; mine was a deal at $1.99 at Longs. Housekeeping provided two coffee pouches per day, each enough for 4 cups, so as I am the only coffee drinker, we did not need to purchase coffee. Fresh towels were left each day, and the room well cleaned. The green towels, for pool and beach, are plentiful and one can easily request more at the front desk. Two towels will cover the poolside lounge chairs; there were never issues in getting a chair. Grounds and building are kept clean, staff is pleasant and the location great. Because the beach is narrow, and is a bit pebbly when entering the water, it is not ideal for water play; bonus, perhaps, as it tends to be quiet. Best entry spot is towards the north end of the building. Note - to get to and from the beach, a room key is needed to open the gate. Also, this hotel is not suited to young children who are old enough to run around.

We even survived the Tsunami. Got evacuated to the Lahainaluna high school up on the mountain. We did not fear for our lives but worried the hotel would take a hit and we would have no place to stay. This happened on our second nigh there and the hotel made it. Hardly a sign that anything happened. We even went on a sub tour the next day and the water was clear as can be. Maui was beautiful, the town of Lahaina was a treat. Restaurants galore and shops for all kinds of things. One thing I must say, if you are going to schedule a luau do your self a favor and book the Feast of Lei Lei. We went to 2 luau's. one at the Hyatt, drums of the Pacific. Might as well have been in Atlantic City, the show was horrible. The Feats at lei Lei the so authentic and the food, high end fare, was excellent. We were right on the beach with the sunset and waves crashing on the beach. This was the high light of our stay. The Hotel did not have the amenities that some higher end hotels have but the rooms were clean and the staff very friendly. we had a studio which had ample room for 2 with ocean view. And the view was simply breathtaking. We were on the 6th floor which gives you a view without obstruction. The beach was nice, could not surf but it was clean and the water so clear you could see your feet at night standing in knee deep water. We plan to be back in 2012 and every other year after that. The plane ride was horrible but well worth it. The ride to Lahaina was gorgeous. Mountains on one side of the road and the ocean on the other.

It is not fancy by any means - but very quaint and a good price point. It is a little off the beaten path of Lahaina, which makes the beach quiet. Yet, just steps away is a nice little shopping area (505 mall) with a fun restaurant (Betty's Cafe I think) and a wonderful little art galery (great prices too), and it is just a 5-10 minute walk (or run) into the heart of Lahaina. A few lessons I learned in my 4 days there: I heard the Molokini snorkeling was not worth the money so I rented snorkle from a local shop and went to the black rock by the Sheraton - very nice. You can park at Whalers Village for 3 hours free with validation. I stopped at Hula Grill for a snack on the way out. There are other good places on the island and the snorkle shops will help you. The Ulalena show is very nice evening out - and walkable from the hotel. The shuttle to/from the airport is around $50 each way, so I went on to Priceline and bid $22 on a car and they accepted it. Well worth the money to have a car. For local gifts like beach towls, wooden bowls, etc. Wall Mart is a great value. You'll save a bundle. And lastly, if you get a chance to visit the Big Island - do it.

(I recommend spending the extra money on the ocean view if you can -- the sound and breeze is worth it!) The furnishings were typical rattan and the TV was a flat screen, with many channels to entertain us during the early morning hours of our jet lag. We skipped the complimentary \"sell me some side trips or a time share\" breakfast and walked down Front Street right into the thick of things with all the restaurants and shops there for the choosing! We wandered to the grocery store and picked up some food, and then back to our room with our fully kitted out kitchen.

The rooms are independently owned so you don't know what type of shape they're in before you check in. I'm sure some owners put more pride in theirs than the one we were given. We didn't like our room at all. It was very outdated and needed improvement. I don't wan't to be overly critical because we saw some rooms that looked pretty nice but you don't have a choice of what type of room you'll get. The location is good, being right on the beach, but the beach isn't that great. Very shallow water and a lot of rocks in the ocean. No snorkeling in front of the hotel. It's convenient to shops and restaurants just down the street and a short walk away. If you book a ocean view room, the view is very nice, but the mountain view rooms just look over the parking lot. This hotel doesn't have a restaurant or bar/lounge so you either have to make your own meals in your room or go out to a restaurant. It has a small pool and hot tub and a decent grassy area for sunning, but there just isn't anything special to \"WOW\" you about, except for the ocean view.

I can't say enough about how beautiful the oceanfront view was from our balcony! Absolutely spectacular!! With the amazing view and the beach literally at your back door, there really was no need to go anywhere else. The beach was very private. We stayed the last week of July through the beginning of August, which you think would be a busy time of year, but at any one time, there were no more than 5 other people on the beach with us (usually less). The hotel only has about 6 or 8 beach lounge chairs right next to the water, but we always found some empty. There are plenty more lounge chairs for sunning yourself up next to the pool and on the large, beautifully landscaped grassy area around the pool. We booked 2 adjoining studio condos so that the 4 of us could vacation comfortably. With 2 teenagers girls, having 2 bathrooms was a must! Their room had 2 full sized beds and our room had a queen sized Murphy that stored in the wall. Having our bed out of the way, made our condo the roomier of the two, so we hung out and ate meals there. The room furnishings were outdated, which is the only thing I scored down in the ratings (that, and wanting free wifi). The kitchens are supplied with an adequate amount of utensils, serving pieces, etc. But, they do not have even basic staples (salt, pepper, sugar), so you need to bring or buy everything that you'll want to use. I brought my spices from home, as prices for groceries are higher than in the states, and I didn't want to buy another jar of dill, when I only needed 2 Tbsp for my recipe. The staff was wonderful! Very, very friendly and helpful. Being just blocks from downtown Lahaina was perfect. We walked there everyday to shop, have a bite to eat or see a show. For a list of some of the stores and restaurants, visit www.frontstreetlahaina.com. Ulalena is a must see! A captivating performance of Hawaiian culture and history. Don't expect a luau type hula show... this is dramatic and romantic and adventurous and thrilling and funny. Like nothing you have ever seen or heard before. The live band is amazing!

Kimo's for fresh fish, prepared how you choose, and tropical drinks! Our favorite spot to snorkel was Turtle Town, just south of Wailea... lots of fish and lots of turtles. They are protected, so stay 10 feet away and watch them gracefully glide through the water. Don't just look for them deep in the sea.. I was in waist high water, when one popped it's head up near me.

We decided to stay here because the property was ocean front and very close to Lahaina. The view from our room was excellent. We were no more than 30 yards to the ocean and had a spectacular view of the island of Lanai. The ocean in front of the property is surprisingly shallow. You could walk waste deep out to about 75 yards from the beach and at that point there was a reef you could stand on where your whole body was out of the water. Snorkeling was not great though. We did see a few fish but there are better places to snorkel. This property is about 300 yards to the start of all the shops and restaurants on Front St. and takes no more than 10 minutes to walk to. That was a very nice plus as we never had to drive to get to Lahaina. We had an ocean front studio which was plenty big enough for the 2 of us. If you\"re a family with anymore, you would probably need to get a one bedroom. The ground floor rooms are more expensive, but don't take a mountain view-all you get is a view of the parking lot. The rooms were a little dated but clean and comfortable. And the swimming pool is a bit small but the area around the pool was very nice with plenty of grass and shade.

We found the VRBO website to be an excellent site for checking out the condos, with pictures, and you can also check the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s availability calendar. The lobby has been recently refurbished, and is beautiful, as well as a lot of the rooms. The hallway carpets are a bit old and dirty but not a problem overall. The hotel staff was very helpful; if you call for information they never answer the phone but leave a message as they do get back to you. The building is plantation style, which I find very charming, and they take pride in the appearance by asking that no towels and such are hung on the balconies, makes for nicer pictures. The resort grounds are well kept and the pool and hot tub were very clean, the ocean was still warmer than the pool though. The ocean couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any closer which is why I booked this place, so close that we had to close the sliding door at night as it was so loud but it was still great. The hotel has a concierge who works for Expedia and will help you book any of the many activities that are on offer on the island, although you might still save a bit by pre-booking on the internet. The morning after you arrive there is a welcome presentation including juice, coffee and muffins and was great for our first breakfast as we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had time to shop yet. I went parasailing, which was fantastic, and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 just wanted to take pictures from the boat, they do charge for all passengers. Because he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t participating we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to take advantage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcearly bird special\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for some strange reason, so it cost us $110 as opposed to $90-95 if I had booked it in advance on the web. If you walk up to the boats directly to book a trip on the spot, they do charge extra. You see lots of cheap prices in Lahaina when you walk in to town (5 minutes) but most of them are tied to a timeshare presentation. The resort is 20-30 minute ride from the airport and we found Speedi Shuttle, located in the airport, to be the easiest and cheapest way to get to and from as you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a car if you are not planning to venture out of the Lahaina area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cost $54-58 for 2 of us. Lahaina is a small, very touristy town but it has plenty of good bars and restaurants and lots of little boutiques, discount stores and 2 grocery stores. Foodland is pretty close and if you sign up for their card, we just gave them a phone number, you get the member discounts; Safeway which is at the other end of town, is accessible by bus. Right next to the Lahaina Shores is a small mall that has a couple of good, albeit fairly expensive restaurants, as well as Betty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is more reasonably priced and serves breakfast through to dinner. There is also another venue that has a luau every night which was kind of nice to listen to while we watched the sunset on our lanai. Kimos in town was a great, middle of the price range, steak and seafood restaurant, not as much as Ios or Pacifica next door but a step up from Cheeseburger in Paradise or Bubba Gumps.

We knew about the construction beforehand, hence the great rate. The hotel itself is in a great location, very nice beach and not crowded at all. Not a frilly place . Lots of lounge chairs on property but only 6 on the beach. The whole time we were there there were no more than 12-15 people on the beach. We did not use the pool but it looked fine. The ocean is very shallow there so snorkeling was easy and we saw many fish. And you can see the whales from the balcony which was fun. There is no rental rafts or anything there so you have to go buy or rent somewhere else. I went to safeway and bought a little umbrella and went to costco for rafts and food. Lahaina center of town is just a short walk down the street so that was great but not to close to be noisy. However these rooms are individually owned and some are nice and some are not. Our room was not. We were told it was a king bed, it was a queen and very uncomfortable. The whole unit is very outdated and dirty. Housekeeping is very poor. The carpet was very stained and I found FOOD under the bed and dead bugs on the sheets. Minimal equipment to cook with, we just grilled out (there are two gas grills on the side of the hotel). The room was basically like a motel room. Other places we have stayed in like this had more room amenities like dish soap, more bath towels, condiments, etc. I know this sounds picky but these things add up. They do have 3 washers and dryers there , cost was about 4.50 to do a load (wash & dry). The updated rooms I'm told are R-507 (king), R-517 (queen), R-109 (premium), R-111 9premium), R-212, R-302. I did not see these rooms personally, this is info from front desk. There is a desk downstairs to book excursions, there are many to pick from. I do recommend renting a car if you want to see the island. It is very easy to drive. Warning, if you do the Hana drive plan on a whole day, it takes 3 hours to drive 30 miles, and bring drinks and food. There is a little roadside food place just before you get to Hana, wonderful garlic shrimp and coconut shrimp. Hana highway is very twisty and narrow, they call it the divorce highway, if you drive it you will see why . :) I for one will never do it again!

Basic kitchen stuff. Might want to bring your own salt and pepper, they only had those little packet type things. Bath products all provided each mornng. Construction was pretty much done.

I first found the listing on VRBO, and the worst part of every stay is having to leave! As soon as we leave, we both start looking forward to when we can return. This will sound crazy (my wife says I'm crazy) but last night I actually had a nightmare....I dreamed I was back home! Fortunately, I woke up to the sights of swaying palm trees! I am personally amazed every time I see a negative comment about Lahaina Shores. At first, my wife and I were a little put off by those reviews, but in reading them carefully, it looked to me to be written by people who thought it was going to be a Resort, like the big Marriotts. We were just at the Marriott St. Kitts the second week of January, and it was very, very nice. The $25 hamburger and $8 beer was fairly tasty, and they had a couple of very nice ($$$$) restaurants on site, but you couldn't just wander down the street to find neat shops and reasonable local cuisine. So, to temper this review, my wife and I solidly prefer a non-all-inclusive-resort type of location. Now, that said, when you arrive at Lahaina Shores, the lobby is spacious and inviting. The view of the ocean from the lobby sets the mood. This is going to be good. Lahaina Shores has no restaurant or bar, but next door is a selection of each at 505 and Lahaina Shores has a direct walkway built over there so you don't even have to go out to the street. The real reason we chose Lahaina Shores over other condo rentals initially was the proximity to Lahaina town. It is literally a 5 minute walk to the Banyan Tree and all the shops, restaurants, and bars along Front Street. If you want to go on a whale watch, snorkel cruise, or dinner cruise, the boats leave from just the other side of the Banyan Tree. If location is important to you, you have no other choice. The reason we prefer non-resort properties is both for the ability get out and walk to things as well as to be able to cook for ourselves some. We get tired of eating out every meal, even when it is a $15 bagel just downstairs at a resort. We usually make our own breakfast, and when we get lazy, Betty's is just next door. We like choices. Now, from my tone, you can imagine the shock of reading the post below about unit #403. I will admit, and I have advised the owner, that the tub needs to be replaced. There is nothing unclean or unsafe about it, but there is about a 4 inch section where the fiberglass has separated and the top layer peeled off. The owners have assured me that this will be repaired this summer. We just use it for a shower anyway, so we really aren't negatively affected. Everything else in that post is an exaggeration. I was here for 2 1/2 weeks in December with my family, and am now in the middle of our usual 4 week stay to avoid the winter on the East Coast. While my family was here, I got to visit four other rooms that they were in. We were all aware of the construction in advance, and received a discount because of it. I can honestly say that the construction didn't affect us at all. A little noise here and there, but no dust or dirt, and the workers we did run into were careful to stay out of our way. They seemed to understand that we were on vacation. Luckily, in December, the contruction was at the other end, on the other side. I'm sure that helped. Now, the contruction final phase is primarily in the penthouse units on the top floor, so we are even less aware of the construction in progress. Would I rather the construction not be going on? You bet. Am I letting it bug me? Not in the least. I've been in the room two weeks, and we rearrange the furniture as soon as we open the door as we work in the mornings, but I'm going to post pictures so you can see that this is a beautiful place. Do understand that when we arrived, the place was spotless as it had just been cleaned. We rent directly from the owner, so we choose to do our own cleaning, which is taking place tomorrow. Still, I think you will be able to see that #403 is in great condition, with an unmatchable view, and so close to town you can walk in for a cup of coffee.

The check-in process went fairly smoothly, though there was much construction going on outside so we weren't sure where to park upon our arrival so we could get checked in. I figured out something workable though and my traveling companion (my senior mother) stayed in the vehicle while I spoke with the front desk. All the front desk folks I interacted with during our whole stay were super helpful. We were assigned to room #331, an efficiency with two separate beds. The kitchenette was functional and supplied with enough utensils and equipment to allow for basic meal preparation. The fridge was on and pre-chilled, so it was ready to accept some breakfast basics and snacks that require it's use. Our room was clean and kept so throughout our stay by our wonderful maid, Phyllis. The property will clean rooms daily, however it's up to you to do your own dishes/cookware. The construction that was SUPPOSED to be wrapped up around Sept. 2009 is still ongoing. Sadly I had to inform my travel agent of this and ask if we should find alternatvie arrangements. My TA contacted them and Lahaina Shores gave us a \"relatively accurate\" appraisal of the state of repairs. Due to it's excellent location, allowing us to walk to much of the town of Lahaina, we opted to give it a go. considering all the rooms there and the construction being confined to one end of the building, our chances were good we'd be insulated from the intrusion of construction repairs. Well, odds were not in our favor on that. The rooms across the hall from us were all undergoing construction as were the ones directly next to us on the north side. I will say they had plastic on the hallway carpets to minimize construction dust, but it was still there. Location, location, location. That's really why I had settled on Lahaina Shores when I was setting up our vacation. (well, budget, too) but convenience and walkability to Lahaina-town was an important factor since my mother loves to walk a bit. Due to her health & age, she can't hike or do long walks so having options available that were close and not requiring too long of a walk or the use of a car (we had a rental, but let me say finding parking in Lahaina isn't particularly easy at times). Our room overlooked the ocean at tree-top level. This made seeing possible whale sightings a bit on the tough side, however the view was sitll wonderful. If you're expectations are realistic, I feel you get a reasonable place to stay. I'd certainly NOT pay full price for any room here while there is ANY construction going on. Bargain for a decent discount. Convenient? Absolutely! Four Seasons Quality? hehe, no. When will construction be completed? a GOOD question. First it was Sept., 2009, then it pushed back to Dec. 2009. I'm guessing probably Sept. 2010.

The room my husband and I stayed in was certainly dated. The furniture reminded me of the late 1980's era. The kitchen was NOT fully equiped which is completely misleading by the website. Your best bet is to shop for plates, cups, bowls, etc... at a dollar store prior to arriving for you accomodations as the quality of the \"fully equiped\" kitchen is poor. And do not forget to buy cleaning products if you want to have a clean / dirt-free stay. A part of me certainly wanted to spend an entire day cleaning the dirty fridge handle, the dirty light switches, etc. The amount of dirt that has accumulated over time on the light switches, etc is clearly evident! Another disappointing aspect is the Internet. Lahaina Shores does provide you with Internet, however you have to bring your own computer/laptop. It would have been helpful to know that the accomodations only provides you with an internet wire. So, if you plan to use the internet, your best bet is to either bring your own laptop or go to one of the Internet Cafes in town. Other issues/concerns include the telephone connection which was often full of static. After several attempts at manipulating the telephone cord, the static sounds would go away. The static made it very very very difficult to hear your conversation during telephone calls. And as for doing laundry... well.... that's another issue. I did laundry a few times and each time I encountered difficulties with the washing machines. Basically, the washers would not run unless you slam the washer door with great force. All of the machines have the same issue. And as to how hard to slam the washer doors.... well... as hard as you can and until the washing machine works. I was privilaged enough to be shown that trick by the helpful staff. As for the construction... well... I knew all about it. Yes it was distracting, but my husband and I spent very little time in the condo during construction hours. The nice things about Lahaina Shores Beach Resort includes: - the amazing view of the Ocean, considering you have an ocean view suite. - the helpful, friendly and accomodating staff. - the nightly rate for an Ocean View ($139.00 - during construction) - the nice pool & hot tub. - the proximity to the beach. (Note: beach is has lots of rocks mixed with the sand). - the amount of lawn chairs available for use. - the proximity to town. - the smoke free environment. The big question is whether or not we would stay here again. Well...the answer is no. Once the construction is over, the cost of accomodations will be inflated back to the normal rate. The stay will not be worth the cost and your best bet is to pay $100-$200 more a night with alternative accomodations where you will be satisfied/content with your stay.

We planned to stay at the Lahaina Shores Beach \"Resort\" on our honeymoon and were not pleased from the moment we arrived. The \"resort\" was under construction and we knew this going in to our stay there, so the tarps, workers, and noise were to be expected and that is not our gripe. The staff (both of them) were not only unfriendly, but down right rude and unaccommodating. We were \"greeted\" at the front desk by the most unfriendly person that we encountered on our entire five day stay in Maui. When we informed her that we were on our honeymoon and had been married the day prior she said nothing and gave us our room key and little direction. Upon entering our room, we were greeted by one of the most unkind smells that I have ever smelled outside of a port-a-john. The room stank of musky urine. It was also about 90 degrees throughout the majority of the hotel; the exception was the elevator which was kept at a balmy 100 degrees. The bed in the room was a standard twin, the room would have been considered clean but only by our 5 year olds standards. With further investigation/inspection of out honeymoon accommodations we found that the room was outdated, the paint was chipping, the fixtures were very old, and the AC hardly worked due to a clogged air filter that more closely resembled a lint trap then an air filter. After our first 20 min in the room there was a knock on our door. We opened it to find the only other hotel worker we saw that day standing there, seemingly high as a kite, with a warm bottle of Korbel in his hand. He handed it to me and turned around and walked away, saying nothing. We soon came to find out that our \"resort\" had no room service, for there was no restaurant on the grounds, and no bar at which to get cocktails to bring onto the beach, something we were looking forward to on our honeymoon. The pool was closed due to construction, and we were told we could use the public pool 5 blocks away. We had asked for a ocean view suite when we made the reservations 3 months prior, but got a \"partial\" ocean view that we could only see from the very edge of our lanai. Basically this hotel had nothing to offer a honeymoon couple, not even working AC or friendly service. It was a Motel 6 on the beach. Bed, shower, toilet, stove. That's all you get. LAHAINA SHORES BEACH RESORT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADVERTISE THEMSELVES AS A RESORT.

Funny thing is, upon checking out of Lahaina Shores Beach \"RESORT\", and telling the lady at the front desk (even though we could tell she really didn't care) about why we were not going to be staying with them for the rest of our honeymoon, she said, and i quote, \"Oh, what you want is a RESORT, and this definitely is not that.\"", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

It was also a priority to have a kitchen, and it completely delivered with everything we could need. The wall-sized screen door allowing us to sleep with the sound of crashing waves was something out of my fantasies. The staff was wonderful--I even accidentally broke something in my room and they were immediate and professional in their attention and charged me what had to be much less than replacement cost for the item on the island.

It was amazing! The VIEW from ANY area in the condo was breathtaking. The lanai stretched from the corner of the bedroom alongside the entire wall to the end of the corner of the living area wall. There was a seperate mountain/oceanview lanai alongside the kitchen/eating area. If you opened the sliding glass doors, turned on the fan and closed the screen door, you could hear waves crashing and feel the most amazing ocean breeze. A perfect view of Lana'i was directly facing you. The bathroom was even great and had the cutest shower area (you can see the photo...won't waste time with bathroom reviews:)..) The kitchen was fully stocked with anything (besides groceries.. we stopped at Down to Earth in Kahalui immediately after picking up our rental car for FABULOUS \"health\" food and delicious local produce) we needed to cook with... pots, pans, dishes, paper towels, fridge, freezer, blender, microwave, stove top..... There was also a TV (like you need that on Maui) and sitting area with a filled bookshelf and desk with IA ($9 /day or $40 per week, i think) As for the bedroom itself, besides the indescribable view, I am not a good person to rate the comfort of a bed- it was better than most, but my husband is the manager of a mattress store and home is ALWAYS better than away... there was a desk, chair and LOTS of storage space. Besides our gorgeous home-away-from-home's room itself, the location of Lahaina Shores it more than perfect (unless you like the \"convienience\" of a resort complex). It is next door to the 505 Front Street Shops that houses 2 of the best restaurants on Maui- I'o and Pacific'o. Also a well-known luau \"Feast at Lele\" several art galleries, a Whaler's General Store (that got alot of our business during our stay) and several smaller cafes and restaurants that we didn't have a chance to try. The other shops and restaurants along Front Street are a pleasant stroll away. We didn't venture out to other areas for dinner simply because Front Street Lahaina had so much to offer and we didn' teven have to get into our car. You name it, we ate there.... (I will review those seperately) There are so many shops to check out which became a nightly activity- strolling Front Street as well as making a stop at \"Scoops\" an ice cream shop at the \"end\" of Front Street that serves Lapperts ice cream- The Lahaina Harbor is also very close to Lahaina Shores Beach Resort. This is where many of the tours depart from. If you have any questions, I don't mind to answer them.. we LOVED our 12 day stay in paradise and WHEN (not if) we return, we will again stay in room 501!!!", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cHit and miss\u201d", "Author": "hawaiigal_8", "ReviewID": "UR16451676", "Content": "Lahaina Shores is a hit-and-miss proposition.

We had to call maintenance twice -- first, the a/c didn't work and also because the closet doors were stuck and we couldn't open them (and in a small unit you definitely need to stash the luggage somewhere). They did fix both the a/c and closet doors. The only saving grace was that this unit overlooks a luau next door, and each night we got a free show.

We were in a studio unit with an ocean view. The resort has a very nice entrance and impressive lobby. The surrounding neighborhood is a little seedy, though. The resort is located within easy walking distance to Old Town Lahaina where there are many shops and restaurants. The white railed bannisters at each lanai look quaint from a distance, but there's some serious paint peeling going on. Paying extra for parking was annoying; it should be included in the room price. Extra annoying is that the parking garage smelled like a dumpster. Our room (#215) had a beautiful view of the ocean. However, it was located right over the pool and Jacuzzi, so there was a noise problem for anyone who wanted to retire before 10 PM. Even after that hour, the resort's maintenance crew made a racket by dragging the plastic chairs across the cement floor. Before sunrise, the maintenance crew would be out there again, hosing down the area and making more noise. The furnishings of our room were quite nice and well-maintained, although I found it odd that the floor board trim was missing. Unfortunately, there is no dishwasher in this unit, so my vacation included washing dishes. The first time I left dishes in the sink, planning on washing up at the end of the day, the maid squirted a large amount of dish detergent into each bowl, glass, and mug and left. (One such squirt would have sufficed for a whole sink full of dishes.) It took me forever to rinse away all the bubbles that resulted. The maid blew her tip with that stunt. The maid service was a little hit-and-miss anyway -- mildew on the tub's tile, dirty doorknobs, sticky countertop, etc. I would recommend this resort to anyone who didn't mind a place that isn't brand new but still a good value.

We stayed at Lahaina Shores for the whole time. We were able to stay at a cheaper rate much less than $200 a night, after a little searching. Location is not bad. It's the lower end of Lahaina so you can leave to other places like Kihei and Kafului in the morning without too much traffic and coming back. It's a little too long walk to completely tour around the old town Lahaina though. First thing surprised us was we had to pay for parking each night. $7 a night. Come on! What else can we get around in Maui? They should at least grant 1 parking spot per room, after paying around $1000 a week to stay. The cart insert for parking gate is on the opposite side of the road, which made getting into the lot a little awkward. We stayed on oceanfront studio. I loved to leave the window open (w/ screen) and listen to the waves and fall asleep. However, almost every night we had to shut the window in the middle of the night, because of some idiot people smoking in the balcony on adjacent units. Wind from ocean pushes smoke back to the building if somebody smokes on the balcony. Hello? this is 21st century! Smoking is so lame! Especially when people break the fire law and smoke within 20 feet from the building. Apparently each unit is owned privately and resort manager can't do anything as far as people smoking on the balcony. Our room was non-smoking, but it doesn't mean a whole a lot if I have to smell smoke every night. They said there are hotels in Maui that has strict non-smoking policy. I guess I'm not staying in this one, again. Other reason I stayed at this place was because it is a condo. However, the kitchen equipment was cheapest grade tools you can buy at walmart. Knives were so dull (looked new) and pots and pans burned like hell every time. Almost every night I heard other units having get together party of some sort - sounded pretty young.

It isn't an ocean view, but the view of the mountains from the lanai is super, great for a morning coffee and sunrise or an afternoon cigar, Make sure you have plenty f film in your camera. The unit is just recently decorated and looks like it came out of a magazine. We wanted to save some money so we shopped at safeway (make sure you go to the customer service counter and get a shopping card to use instantly and save more), which is right up the street at the northern end of lahaina, and we ate dinners in the condo. It has a full kitchen with everything you need. We also packed lunches for the daily snorkeling and sightseeing trips. It was right next to town for shopping and other ventures from the marina (parasiling, snorkeling, deep sea fishing, etc.). The concierge at Lahain shores was more than helpful in planning our week. The hotel was a little more relaxed than some of the other big places to stay, very clean hotel and friendly people, but it had all the necessities, closness to shopping and fun, outside gas grills, smaller but noncrowded pool, quiet beach, good snorkeling right from shore, etc. If you want to contact the owner directly he has an e-mail and website; email : lahainacondo@yahoo.com website : [--] You acn also contact me at rprofancik@hotmail.com", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasanton CA", "Title": "\u201cJust What We Were Looking For\u201d", "Author": "LahainaOwl", "ReviewID": "UR8221152", "Content": "Our family of 4 stayed in Maui for 10 days. We spent 6 days at the Westin Pool & Spa Resort and 4 at Lahaina Shores - Penthouse #6. I'm not sure about the other rooms there but this penthouse was perfect for us. We all agreed, we wish we had stayed there longer. Not only was it half the price, but the room was 3-4 times larger than our room at the Westin and completely remodeled. The kitchen was nicer than mine at home, with granite & all new appliances. There was a comfortable king size bed and sofa bed for the kids. The 50\" plasma TV and DVD player was perfect for late nights watching movies. We also loved the clean, nicely tiled bathrooms, one of which had a double shower. I thought I might be disappointed with the view of the mountains, but it was beautiful. I read some of the other reviews which mentioned the pool. To be honest, coming from the Westin, it didn't compare. If you're looking for a fabulous pool with water slides, this may not be the place for you. However, the pool was fine for us - It was an ordinary pool, but it was clean & NOT CROWDED. This you won't find at the Westin. It was also literally a few steps from the beach, which was narrow, but nice and also not very crowded. My favorite part about the place was its proximity to the town of Lahaina. We walked a half mile to town every night, which meant not having to hassle with or pay for parking. The restaurants and night life in Lahaina are fabulous. Great for families or singles. Our favorite place to eat was an inexpensive little place called Pasta Penne. Not much ambiance but the food was great, especially for picky kids. All in all, we would highly recommend this condo.

Me and my girlfriend had a wonderful time at this perfectly located resort. The Room: Let me start by saying this is not the typically resort quality room. It reminds me a lot of the older condos that are available along the California coast. Older appliances, older carpet and tile but clean. For the price of the Ocean View room is exceeded expectations. If you are looking for the five star decorations and new pillow top matresses do not stay here (Stay at one of the Wailea resorts). The Location: If you have never stayed on Maui you are going to want to spend a lot of time on Front street for shopping, eating and hanging out. If you have stayed on Maui before you know what an awesome place Front Street is and for both of these scenarios this resort is perfect. It is right on Front Street and close to everything. It is not very noisy as some of the reviews have stated but you certainly want an Ocean View and as high in the building as possible. Things to do: You have to do the following if you are in Maui. The Maui Magic trip to Molokini was an outstanding snorkeling trip but it takes the long way to the snorkel site (if you are looking to snorkel more find a different one). The Road to Hana is another must for 10-20 bucks you can get a CD that guides your trip and it is worth the small investment. Eat at KIMOs - this place is right on Front Street and by far is the best place I have ever eaten (the steak and seafood is remarkable and the service is great). With drinks you are looking at $30-50 per person. The Maui Princess Dinner cruise is also great -the food wasnt great but the view and people you will meet are well worth the trip. I would highly recommend doing any type of excursions early on your trip as you may meet some people you would like to hang out with during your stay.

The unit was recently renovated by its owners, Tom and Ann Meyers, (lahainacondo@yahoo.com ) with beautiful tile floors, granite countertops and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen and a wonderful shower in the master. The lanai is huge and faces the mountains. Initially I was very bummed that the view was mountains instead of ocean, but they really are beautiful and since you are looking at the ocean all day long, it really didn't turn out to be a negative at all. The decor in our condo matched the \"Tommy Bahama\" style of the lobby and is very nice. The pool area is clean and nice, and although it is small, our kids had a great time playing in it for hours a day. The best part of this property, in my opinion, is that you can go from the lobby to the pool in 10 steps and 10 more and you are ON THE BEACH! We had some in our group that wanted to be on the beach all the time and others that wanted the pool, so it was very convenient that it wasn't a couple football fields away. The beach is narrow, but you don't need a large beach for the amount of people that are generally there. We were never crowded on the beach--and we were there during spring break. A big plus was sitting on the beach at 8:45 and seeing the fire dancers at The Feast at Lele's right next door--about 20 feet from us! We went to a cheaper luau (kids) but this one looks beautiful! This property is within easy walking distance to the busy downtown area--which we did every night for dinner. There are also wonderful restaurants right next door (IO and PacificO) if you want more expensive seafood/asian. We parked in the outside lot for a few dollars a day--because our SUV seemed too tall for the parking garage.

The rooms are nearly all different due to the fact that they are individually owned and the decoration is up to the owner. Because of this, online reviews can be VASTLY different, and you could easily get the wrong impression! We stayed in the penthouse unit. It was graced with granite countertops, tile floor throughout, luxury bath/shower in the bedroom and an additional bath/shower in the main hallway. The kitchen is full service (HUGE COST SAVINGS with a grocery store very nearby) with all new appliances as of January 07. The 50\" plasma TV was great for a late night movie. The view from the Lanai (facing the mountains) was just awesome, and the sunrise takes your breath away. The Lanai (porch, for us mainlanders!) by itself was larger than the suite we stayed in at the Hyatt Regency the week before! The owner has some outdoor games, rafts and even some basic snorkel gear available for the tenants of this unit. Since Lahaina shores is easily the tallest building in Lahaina, the view from the penthouse unit is unobstructed. We got our unit directly from Mr. Tom Myers ( lahainacondo@yahoo.com ) and it is the only one I can reccomend, but I GUARANTEE I will stay again. Although rates are subject to change, we were able to book the room for less than half of what a double cost at the Hyatt, and this room if it were at the Hyatt would cost AT LEAST $1200/night! Yes, it is THAT good. Remember, you must contact Mr. Myers directly in order to get his unit. The town of Lahaina is within easy walking distance, even for the older traveller, and offers plenty of reasonably priced dining, as well as unreasonably price offerings for those who like to throw money at things (seems to be a lot of those in Hawaii...). Lahaina shores has a protected, but small beach that is clean and perfect for sunning. The water just off the beach is quite warm due to its shallow nature and protected sea wall. A quick swim offshore with my snorkel gear revealed beautiful butterfly fish, tobys and pufferfish - even a decent sized eel! (this is WAAY beyond where you would swim if you werent snorkeling) There are a lot of smooth stones in the water, so water shoes are reccomended. Because it is protected from the waves, it is calm (almost glass calm) 90% of the time, and is perfect for floating leasurly on a raft. There is a small pool and hot tub as well. There is also a activity service. The penthouse has protected, indoor parking available for a few dollars a day in the adjacent building. The staff was very, very nice. There were no issues of cleanliness or critters. Renovation was complete when we went in January, and the hotel is beautiful. Kaanapali is a short drive up the beach, not more than 10 minutes.

The room (#235) was clean and comfy but probably could use some updates in decor. The lanai was nice but kinda smelled like old, wet cigarettes to me (my husband did not think it did.) Our daughter slept on a rollaway but it was very comfy and clean. (some friends of ours stayed in a room that had a murphy bed. they were NOT impressed.) The view from our lanai was breathtaking and we could see whales, ships and the like. I did request a room higher-up but they were full and could not accomodate this request, which I understand. Each condo is individually owned and this accounts for the different decors and room standards. Housekeeping was wonderful and very, very accomodating. They were the sweetest people. Front desk staff weren't rude but certainly weren't very friendy.(We stayed during the owner's convention and this might have played a part in this.) I was definitely not impressed with the activity desk. When we went down to clarify some things about an excursion we had booked the agent sighed and asked,\" Didn't so-and-so explain ANY of this to you? Okay, here we go again....\" I was quite taken aback for when I spend $250 for dinner cruise, I feel I should be able to ask questions if I need to. LS has a wonderful pool and spa. The area was kept very clean but did not open until 9am, which was a pain (especially with an eight year old.) Lahaina Shores' beach is not a beachgoers beach. It is rocky and shallow. I wouldn't advise going in without water shoes as some of the rocks are kinda sharp. It's a great beach for sunset walks but not recommended for beach activity, per se. We took a five-minute drive to Kaanapaali Beach every day and used the beach right in front of the Royal Lahaina (whose staff were wonderful, accomodating and gracious, even to us non-guests.) We recommend this beach for those that want to use the beach for swimming and sunning. We also advise that you drive to a grocery store (we went to Smarts) and load up on beer, snacks, sandwich stuff, etc. This will save you loads. Prices at the groc stores were not at all outrageous. We also bought a collapsible cooler to take to the beach with us that came in SO handy on a number of occasions. LS is right at the end of Front Street, where all the shops and a great deal of resturaunts are located. It was a great location for us, because we could just walk back to the hotel after dinner and drinks. Not far down the street is the famed Banyan Tree, which is cool. Parking is very convienent...there is a parking garage right next to the hotel and we never had any problem finding a spot in the first or second rows closest to the hotel. It is $6 a day and usually had a parking attendant present. Next door to LS are some resturaunts and Feast at Leles. We were not at all impressed with Hecocks, the resturaunt next door. The staff were very rude. We ate a quick bite at Gaby's one night and that was enjoyable. We also ate at the Lahaina Fish Company (fantastic with a great view) and a Moose McGuillicuddy's, which was okay but did not live up to the rave reviews of our friends. Also, we had an awesome breakfast at the Pioneer Inn on Cruise Ship Day and it was fun to see the cruisers come off the ship. All of the resturaunts mentioned have very reasonable prices and good food. (Lahaina Fish Co. was a a touch on the pricey side but well worth it. Ribeyes were comparable to what you would spend here in SD. I had a wonderful Reisling with swordfish. Delicious.) Maui is the most beautiful place I've ever had the pleasure to visit. If we go back, we probably won't be choosing Lahaina Shores because of the dismal beach opportunities but it is a perfectly fine hotel and most of the people we talked to (mostly older folks) had been coming to LS for years and years and said they love the place.

A word of warning though, Maui is very laid back, and most places in Lahaina close up at about 10pm as we found one night when we tried to get a late dinner.

The location is perfect....right on Front street near all of the shops, bars, and food. We stayed in a privately owned condo which was reserved through Most Romantic Vacations. Other condos here are reserved either through Classic Vacations or directly through the owner. The condo we stayed in (335) was ocean view for about $200 a night and it was awesome to wake up to the ocean and watch the sunset. It was a little outdated but nice. There are also Mountain view condos which we toured. They are larger and remodeled for about the same price we paid for the ocean view. The Mountain views are also very nice. All of the condos have kitchens which is nice if you are planning to stay for a while. The pool and hot tub are nice. The crowd seems to be a little older at this resort.....so if you are looking for party party....you may want to try somewhere else. Kelly at the Expediafun concierge desk was really helpful. We booked all of our excursions through her. They are located right in the lobby. Parking is about $3.50 a day and because we had a small car we were in the \"stinky\" garage next door.....hold your breath. Lahaina is within driving distance of pretty much everything. We would totally stay here again....we may try the remodeled mountain view instead. We recommend you go whale watching with the Pacific Whale Foundation....they were very informative, go snorkeling at Molikini with the Mahana Nai (sp?, twin dolphins), see the theatre show Ulelena (sp?) in Lahaina, check out Kanapali beach. We did the Road to Hana and the views were amazing but this is a VERY long day....so if you don't have much time we don't recommend it.

Stayed 1 week in Maui and another in Kauai. In Maui, I stayed the first 4 nites at Lahaina Shores and the remaining 2 nites at the Grand Hyatt. I travelled with 2 other 20 something girls and we are all from the NYC area. We stayed from Dec. 15- Dec. 22. Weather was perfect every day for us! HOTEL: So with that said, we didn't mind staying at Lahaina Shores at all. We came to Maui to do a lot of activities so we stayed there cuz it was cheap and a good location. We moved to the Hyatt after to enjoy a luxurious hotel. So, if a lot of your days are gonna be filled up with activities out of the hotel, no need to stay anywhere that nice, which is what we did. The room we had faced the mountain view which was lovely. Every morning we could see the sun rising from the ridge of the mountain. We also rented a car to get around, and for compact cars, they direct you to park at the garage next door in the shopping area. This garage STINKS!! Thanks to other tips on tripadisor, i went to the front desk and asked to be moved to the upstairs/outdoor lot which is right outside the hotel. That lot is usually reserved for larger cars but they were nice enough to hold a spot for me for the rest of my trip. Everyone at the hotel is very nice and pleasant. The room itself was for the most part clean but nothing spectacular. I think all rooms have kitchens which incl. a large fridge, a stove, and a microwave. This was great as we bought food for breakfast to eat before we went out for the day. Honestly, we hardly spent anytime in the hotel at all. I think we only went out to the beach behind the hotel twice. The beach is okay, very small but water is clean and sand is clean. Pool is a joke but who cares when you can hop in a car and go to a big beach? LOCATION: As for location, I am really glad we stayed here cuz it was a good drive to get to places. It's about 30 min. to get to the airport (no traffic) and about 1 hr to get to South Maui. For the Haleakala sunrise drive, we left at 3 and got there by 5. For the Hana drive we left at 8 and got there by 11. To get to Northwest maui is another 30-45 min cuz there seems to be more traffic up there. Also, its very close to all the shops on Front St. so at night we would walk down Front St. for the shops and stuff. IO Restaurant is right next door and has excellent appetizers/ambience!! It's rated #1 in the island. Bamboo Grill is also next door and is like a fast food/bar place and totally sucked. Don't eat there! ACITIVITIES: -Haleaka sunrise--I LOVED IT. It was really the most beautiful thing I ever saw. I think everyone's experience will be different b/c the conditions will not be the same every day. we were really lucky and the day we went was very cloudy. It's the most beautiful when it's cloudy as the colors reflect better. We did not drive to the summit top but saw it at the overlook at the Visitors Center, which is the same as the summit anyway. Definitely cold and windy so you need to bring stuff for coverage! Flashlight helps too. -Hiked to Haleakala Crater on Sliding Trails--Hated it on the climb up but it was worth it. Can't describe it. Everything is ddead there but beautiufl and silent. Hike down to crater should take an hr but it took us 2 cuz we stoped to take a million pictures. Hike up took us 2 hrs. The change in elevation hiking down is like 1400 ft so it is hard on your lungs but anyone can do it, just try to start early right after sunrise. The trail is by the Visitors Center as well. IF you want to go down to the crater, there will a fork in the trail--one that continues onto Sliding Trail, another that takes u to the crater. If you take the LEFT you go to the crater. Even there there is another fork. Everyone always takes the wrong path (the right side) and slips/sides their way down. Stay LEFT to the big boulder rock and though you have to climb down some rocks, much easier than the right trail. -Ziplining--Definitely book in advance! it was so much fun. i was nervous at first but as soon as u leave that platform, u do feel safe in your harness and can relax and enjoy it. The last line is the longest and the 'scariest' cuz u literally fly at 40-50 mph but so much fun!! -Drive to Hana--only worth it if you're going to see Black Sand/Red sand beach. otherwise the views are nice, but nothing really spectacular. Waterfalls = stream-size water falling down the side of the mountain. Also depends if it has rained a lot or not. The drive itself is kinda fun tho--you definitely wont get bored driving cuz of all the turns and zig zags/ We got lucky and encountered zero traffic. Also being in NYC we are used to diriving in small spaces so we didnt think it was that difficult at all. I think Haleakala drive was more difficult. you HAVE to get shaved ice if you see it at the food stands on the way to Hana. Shaved ice is the best! Its like a better version of a snow cone and you can get diif flavors like guava or mango, etc. -Pacific Whale Life Foundation whale watch tour--waste of our $37. I guess i can think of it as donating money to charity. But since it was early in the season we didnt see much. When we did see whales a few times, all i saw were dots in the water. There is a rule that boats cant be 100 yrds of a whale. I dont know how far 100 yards is but it seemed to me like we were 1000 yards away. I did a boat cruise in Kauai where they dont enforce that rule and we saw whales VERY UP CLOSE--like maybe 30 ft away. BUt that was just luck. Otherwise, we also saw flying fish on the whale watch tour and that was it. I think it's better if u go in Jan/Feb. BEACHES: We beach hopped as much as we could. We drove to Polo Beach, which I think is the beach in front of Maui Prince hotel. it was nice. Clean. South Maui beaches are suppose to be the nicest ones on the island so just drive down and find one! The Maui Revealed blue book helped a lot. Everyone who goes to Hawaii uses that book. I think its more useful for maps cuz people's opinions on good/actviities will always be different but the maps helped a lot in finding beaches most tourists prob wont know about. West Maui beaches like Black Rock at Sheraton was ok. That place is best for snorkeling on West maui. We didnt have time to snorkel in South Maui but heard its the same. SHOPPING: really, buy all your souvenirs at Walmart. Its the cheapest there, and its pretty much the same stuff on the island.

We decided to spend half the week in Maui and the other in Oahu. First, let me just say that we LOVED the town of Lahaina. It was a great town. There was everything you could imagine. The cruise boats stay here when they dock in Maui. There are about 10 blocks of shops, restaurants, and anything else you could possibly need. Now the hotel. While it had a great location, the hotel was a bit outdated. We stayed in a studio room. Ocean front view to die for. The bed had no bedskirt and honestly, the bed looked like it was just a rollaway. It wasn't that comfortable. We did however thoroughly enjoy the balcony. We were on the end of the hotel and we could see the \"Feast at Lei Lei's\" which is right next door. There's a four course meal and a dinner show. There are no restaurants in the hotel, but we walked five minutes down the street and found dozens of places to eat. If you like French Toast, make sure you try it here. They make it on Portguese sweet bread and it's awesome. Get it with pineapples on top. May not sound great, but it was the best! I had that at \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\". Oh if you go make sure you get the smoothies. They are $5 but worth every penny. Most tripadvisor reviews I had read before booking this place said the staff was amazing. And they are. They are super friendly. The hotel is a beach front hotel. And while there is little beach, we discovered that all of Maui is like that. If you want the true beaches, you have to drive about 10 mins away and you will find it. Overall, we loved Maui. It was very laid back. We loved the town of Lahaina. If you want a hotel in the heart of a town, stay at Lahaina. If you want just the hotels with the beaches..stay in Ka'anapli (sry can't spell) and if you have the money and want to be spoiled..then stay in South Maui. But Lahaina will give you the true Hawaiian feel. Oh, and make sure you go to the Old Lahaina Luau...great show..open bar...but book weeks in advance (like 4-5 weeks).", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Coast, California", "Title": "\u201cA great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Tina380", "ReviewID": "UR5982389", "Content": "Lahaina Shores was recommended by our travel agent because originally we were going to be joined by my 82-year old mother and stepfather. The agent thought that being close to downtown Lahaina would provide them with something to do while we went sightseeing. In the end we went by ourselves, my parents decided the travel would be too much for them, but we were already committed to this hotel. I was disappointed when I learned this hotel did not have a business center, since really the only extra I look for in a hotel is the ability to access internet from their computer. This much said, Lahaina Shores was a very pleasant surprise. We arrived from Waikiki, where we stayed in a highrise hotel. Lahaina Shores looks more like an old hotel, reminded me of the Sheraton Moana Surfrider in Waikiki. Very charming and feels luxurious without the formality and stuffiness that are normally part of the package in a luxury hotel. The hotel is directly on the beach. You enter on Front Street, then in the back there is a jacuzzi and a pool and a grassy area to sit and relax. This area is separated from the beach by a hedge and a locked gate which opens with your room key. There is a very narrow strip of beach there which is suitable mostly for walking, but you could swim there and then relax on the chaise lounge on the hotel grounds. Half the rooms face the ocea and get a beautiful view of the ocean and neighboring island Lanai. Our room was on the second floor, a corner room facing the mountains. The room was spacious and cheerful, we had two large balconies. All rooms in Lahaina Shores have fully equipped kitchens, and I was impressed how well the kitchens meet a guest's needs. There is absolutely everything you could need. Potato peeler; bottle and can openers; cutting board; knives, mixing spoons, measuring cups, cutlery, china, pots, pans, dishtowels, dishwashing liquid, dish rack, sponge. I probably left something out but trust me all the basics are there. The kitchen has a microwave, a full size range and oven, sink, and a full size refrigerator, plus a toaster and a coffee maker. Complimentary coffee is supplied each morning - both regular coffee and decaf. The room had a modern decor with an old time feel to it, very pleasant. Good bed, large TV that worked well with I think 70 channels. Standard bathroom, but the sink/vanity area is separated from the bathroom/toilet area with a door, which is very convenient. There is a large closet with extra pillows and a beach towel for each guest. The air condition was easy to set and worked well. We had two large sliding doors, both had two sets of drapes. One set was light filtering, one was room darkening. So anyone can get the effect they are after. There is a dining table with chairs for eating, a dresser, a couple of night stands with lamps, and two large chairs. Everything looks new, is clean and in great condition. The service was excellent. Our first morning here was the day of the earthquake off the Big Island. Most hotel guests were spooked. We're from Southern California, so an earthquake didn't faze us as much, but we were still impressed that the hotel served the guests coffee and fruit and sweet rolls, since the earthquake was at 7:07 a.m. and most didn't have yet breakfast. We were without power and the hotel staff definitely did their best to calm the guests. They told us they received no tsunami warning and explained what would be done in such a case. It was comforting to know there was a plan and we would not be left to our own devices. The hotel withstood the shaking and they informed us to move our cars from the underground parking, since it was likely to flood when they could not pump the water out due to the power outage. They did have an alternative parking lot ready for us, so moving the cars was no big problem. Fortunately power was restored within 3 hours on Maui. Other pluses: parking is right next door, very convenient. Location is good. On the ocean, a 5 minute walk to the center of downtown Lahaina. Pleasant lobby, soothing Hawaiian music always playing. Pleasant and efficient staff. Next door is a shopping complex, 505 Front Street, with a couple of restaurants, a convenience store, and some specialty shops geared to tourists. Negatives: we found two. One, there are no safes in the rooms. Generally, we find a safe to be very convenient. And by the way - next time you say you don't carry any cash when traveling: After the earthquake there was no power and stores accepted only cash. Debit and credit cards were useless. Luckily power was restored quickly, but on Oahu they were without power almost 20 hours, and you never know how long it will take. The hotel does provide a safe which works this way: you get a key and the hotel staff has a key. It takes 2 keys to open the safe where you will put your things. Access is 24 hours. If you lose your key to the safe, they will charge you $100. The other negative was no business center in the hotel. We need internet access and prefer the hotel to provide a computer that usually charges something like $1/5 minutes. Lahaina Shores has no business center. In the adjacent 505 Front Street complex is an internet cafe that can meet this need.

The lanai and beach had front row seats to a wonderful sunset every night, and again, no crowds. We could even watch kids surfing from our lanai.

The nice beaches of West Maui are only a short drive away; make sure you check out Kapalua Bay. It was the very best beach for sunning and snorkeling.

We were a little nervous at first, since this was for our honeymoon. We pulled up to the hotel/condo and it was very nice. The staff is very friendly. They greeted us with a bottle of champagne. We stayed on the 3rd floor. I would say from the 3rd floor and up would be the best views of the ocean. Our room was very clean and quiet. It had central air, full kitchen, huge closet, large fridge. Everyday the house keepers would clean it for us. This was a nice change from staying in condos with no house keeper. The best part of Lahaina Shores was its location. It is one of only a couple places to stay in Lahaina directly on the beach. About 20 feet from the outside pool was the beach. We were there in June 2006, and at the most there was maybe 2 or 3 couples on the beach at the same time. It was like having your own private beach. Of the 10 days we stayed there, we never once seen any sea life in the ocean out front. Lahaina Shores beach has a barrier reef which keeps the sea life pests away. The beach was very pretty white sand. There was some coral in the ocean but it wasn't too bad. We never had to wear shoes in to swim or anything like that. Also, right next door to Lahaina Shores they have a luau every night. It never did annoy us. From Lahaina Shores, it was just a short walk into town. We only rented a car to see the rest of Maui. Of all the towns to stay in in Maui, i would highly suggest Lahaina if you like shopping and good food. We visited Kaanapali and wasn't empressed. It was very crowed there and just too commercial.

There was something for everyone; the ages of our group ranged from 12 to 84! Kaanapali beaches were our favorite, only about 5 minutes from Lahaina Shores.

If you want a high-rise hotel with tons of people on the beach, then try the Sheraton or another resort, but if you want a FABULOUS family vacation then go to Lahaina Shores. They even provided fresh beach towels each day, and let us use their pool and facilities even after checking out (our flight wasn't until 9pm). This was the best way to spend a relaxing, perfect location and reasonable vacation than anywhere else.

It was our first trip to Maui but our third trip to Hawaii. I really wanted to give the rating as excellent but there were a couple issues I think they could fix. Our room was an ocean view one bedroom. When we arrived I was told our room was on the 1st floor and after reading some reviews I ask to be moved up to the 3 floor or above. There were no ocean view one bedroom units available for our entire stay and we didn't want to move for the last few days. We went to the 4th floor to look at a mountain view one bedroom and a ocean front studio. The hallway in that floor and the 3rd floor smelled funny. Not a real stinky smell but a old musky smell. We decided we didn't want to walk down these halls several times a day so we kept the one bedroom on the 1st floor. We were so glad we did because it was perfect. Only a few steps to the small pool and spa and our granddaughter (age 14) could go out by herself to swim and we could just peek out at her from our lanai. We had a great view of the ocean and the sunsets. If we go back and I think we will we will ask for the first floor room just like this visit. The beach was fine for walking, for swimming I would recommend some beach shoes there is a lot of coral out in the water and you need to protect your feet. We snorkeled but didn't see many fish until we got all the way out to the reef that is about 50 yards or so from the beach. If you look at the north end of the resort there is a small stream that runs out into the ocean. If you swim straight out from there that is where we found the most fish. The beach is very safe to just float on the blow up mattress that the hotel provided. We didn't know until the last day that there are two very nice BBQ's at the south end of the resorts. We cooked 3 meals while we were there and we would have used the BBQ if we knew it was there. I think they could lower their prices on doing a load of clothes. It colt $2.00 for the washer, $3.00 for the dryer, $1.00 for soap and $1.00 for fabric softener. If you think you are going to need to do laundry put a zip lock bag of soap 1/4 cup it is a front load and that is what is recommended and pack some fabric softener sheets. Also bring some dishwashing detergent the small tablets. I bought a small box and used it 4 times, I only did a load of dishes every other day and left the rest of the box there. Our room was kept very clean and we were given fresh beach/pool towels each morning and we could have more anytime we ask for them. The staff was all very friendly eveyone had a smile on their face and was willing to help you and answer your questions. What are you waiting for.......just go..........and have a great time.. We went to the Four Winds II trip to Molkini Island to snorkel and it was a great trip and had a very good BBQ lunch hamburger's, hotdog's, vegiburger's or chicken breast sandwich. The crew was very helpful and friendly.

However, when we got there, the staff was VERY friendly and helpful throughout our stay there and we even got upgraded to an oceanview room which made the stay even better. A note to people, they have 2 parking lots (one under the building next door and one out front) and we got the underground parking initially. All you have to do is ask the staff to see if you can get a top lot parking when someone leaves and then just check back every day and you should get one in one or two days. Just outside the lobby was a pool that barely ever had people in it and if there were people, they weren't kids so it wasn't a big kids splash pool. The hot tub was also perfect in the evening times when a slight breeze blew through and got a bit cool. Just beyond the pool, is the beach. Now, I saw some people swimming in it but it's not a fun beach to swim at as there are no big waves to ride in. However, if you want calm water so that you can just lay on a float (which the hotel provides)- this is the beach for you! Our room was on the 4th floor and it was very well kept. It was clean and spacious and the fridge really helped with all the fruit we would buy and eat for breakfast. We visited all the other towns on the western side of the island from Wailea on north and this was our favorite because it wasn't crowded like the other hotels. The Grand Hyatt (up in Kanapali) has TONS of people laying out by the pools and it looks like a zoo. The resorts on the southern side had fewer people but cost a fortune. Lahaina was just a fun town to be at in the morning and at night for dinner and that was the only time we were really there (morning and night) so it was perfect. I do think the town gets a bit touristy in the afternoon but we spent our afternoons in the water snorkeling everywhere so we didn't mind. One side note, we went on the Molokini and Turtle arches snorkeling trip with Eco Adventures and it was amazing. We will definitely repeat that snorkeling trip every time we visit the island.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMaui on a budget.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5294233", "Content": "We recently returned from a 10 night stay in Lahaina. (May 2006) We have been to Maui many times, but wanted to find a hotel that was conveniently close to town, a bargain in regards to rates, one that had a beach on the property, and one that was clean and a place where the staff were friendly. Lahaina Shores Beach Resort met all of our expectations. Our room was a studio mountain view, complete with a small dining & kitchen area, and a lanai where one could sit and watch the sunset over the mountains. My plan was to upgrade the room, but when I saw the incredible view of the mountains, that were frequently decorated with the largest rainbows I had ever seen, I decided I was happy in our bargain room. We were on the 6th floor. I recommend a higher floor if you have an option. As for the beach, it was pleasant to sit on, but wasn't the best swimming conditions.(a lot of seaweed). When the tide went out, one could walk for miles. And from the beach, one could enjoy the almost nightly luau held at a restuarant next door. There is a small shopping area next door that has pretty much everything you need, and town is only a short walk away. The resort has washers & dryers, but it cost about $5.00 per load. Not included soap. Unfortunately, they close at 8:00 pm. Parking was $6.00 per night plus tax. The structure smelled pretty bad. They did have a lot outside of the hotel, but parking was restricted there. There are irons, ironing boards, & blow dryers in the room. We never had any trouble finding a free lounge if we wanted to lay out, and the resort was willing to give you extra towels when you needed them. The jacuzzi is small, so if you want to soak at night, get there early. It closes at 10:00 pm. The rooms did not have safes. But they did have deposit boxes at the front desk for no charge, but one needed to get assistance every time you wanted to use it. The charges for lost safe keys & parking cards were a bit high. Thankfully we didn't loose ours. Overall, our trip was great. We will definately go back to the resort again.

We booked through Andrea's Maui Accomodations, who I found out booked through Condominium Rentals Hawaii. I would NOT book through Andrea's again. When we checked in it was around 9pm and the room we were given was completely filthy, dirty dishes in the sink, dirty towels in the floor, chip bags and trash all over the counters and the trash can was full. I called the front desk and was told since I booked through a rental agency I had to contact them. Of course, Andrea's voicemail stated that they did not work on weekends so you are out of luck if you want to speak to her on the weekend (not that it does any good). I called the emergency number that was on a paper in the room but the girl told me she didn't have another room to move us to that night and that we would just have to make do. Since we assumed the sheets were dirty as well we had to either sleep on top of the bed or sleep in the floor. The next morning we had to call CRH again (even though we told a manager would call us first thing) and they moved us to another room. When we got to that room, it was clean but it had all the cleaning supplies on the cabinets, towels all over the place, a curtain rod on the table, etc. I called CRH again and told them about the room and she (Charla, who was very nice and helpful) called the front desk again and we went to another room. The next room we went to was clean however it had twin beds instead of a queen bed that we had requested and it was on the 4th floor and we had requested the 5th or 6th floors. We went ahead and unpacked because by then we were exhausted and tired of moving from room to room. Plus it was no way to start our anniversary vacation. When we did hear from Andrea she basically told us that WE had to get the compensation from CRH for the trouble at check-in. This to me, was not right because we did not book through CRH and had I known that was who she used I wouldn't have booked with her either because of the reviews I have read from other travelers. After a whole week of trying to get a hold of CRH (kept leaving messages that weren't returned) I finally called Andrea back and told her that I had left messages with CRH but nobody was calling me back. This was on Friday and I knew if I didn't get any response then I surely wouldn't hear from anyone on the weekend. Andrea did call back and say that CRH was going to compensate us and had tried getting a hold of us. We had left the room to go sightseeing and there was a message waiting for us at the room when we returned. Upon arriving home I sent and email to Andrea's Maui Accommodations to at least let her know of our disppointment with her services and to also let her know that it should have been her job to notify CRH and not mine, seeing as how I booked with her and not CRH. I received a very nasty reply stating that she detests working with people like me over such small incidents. I don't think that I would say that upon our arrival we received a room that was less than satisfactory and the fact that I had to spend MY VACATION TIME to contact CRH every single day. As far as Lahaina Shores the room view was awesome but there are rocks out front so it's really not a swimming beach. I had read from previous views (I thought) that it had a good swimming beach and I guess if you have reef shoes then it would be ok. It was great for snorkeling though and we were told that the Lahaina area was best part of Maui for snorkeling. The grassy area where the beach chairs are is small but we never had any problems getting chairs. The part I didn't like was not being able to take the chairs on the beach. Being at the ocean is always windy and laying on a towel in the sand is not fun when you have sand blowing in your face the whole time. We didn't encounter any rude or unfriendly staff but didn't really need them except on check-in and check-out. The resort is within walking distance to Front Street where the Banyan Tree is and all of the shops and restaurants. You can also book all of your tours/cruises through the activity desk they have in the lobby or at any of the shops set up on Front Street. After all the trouble we had checking in we did enjoy our stay there, but probably would've had a better time without the twin beds. We would probably stay here again but would make sure who we were booking it through. I did hear a couple inquire about rooms and they were quoted $240 a nIght for oceanfront. I would not have paid over $175 for the OF rooms and not nearly that much for the mountainview rooms.

The room was clean and reasonably well equipped for making basic meals. We were in one of the \"private\" units (we went thru VRBO(-)), so we did not have much interaction with the front desk staff other than check in and check out. As part of that arrangement we did not have daily maid service, but for just a week that was ok. The room was clean but somewhat dated in decor and carpet. I think they are in the midst of an upgrade as appliances were new. We did not see other rooms except on the website, which seemed to have more updated furniture, countertops, etc. But hey, you're not spending a lot of time in the room so it wasn't a huge deal for us. It's within walking distance to old Lahaina town for shopping and occasional meals out. There is also a convenience store right next door at the 505 Front Street area, which came in handy a few times. The pool is somewhat small, but there were not a lot of swimmers during our stay. We had the pool to ourselves quite often, ditto for the beach. It's not as nice as some of the Kaanapali beaches, but definitely usable with kids. Water was calm and depth was shallow for quite a ways out. Good for kids to try snorkeling. One drawback: On the ground floor rooms you hear noise from people outside coming home late, as they walk by your door to the front of the hotel. If you're an early and light sleeper it might be a problem but it usually ended about 10pm. We also heard muffled noise from the luau next door a couple of nights but it ended around 9. If you want a quiet, out-of-the-way place with minimal noise and no touristy distractions Lahaina Shores is great. You just need to keep in mind it's probably a 3-4 star (out of 5) place - don't go with expectations of a full-blown Marriott or Hyatt resort and you'll enjoy your stay.

The 6th floor rooms definitely had better views because it put you above the parking lot and power lines. The view of the mountains was gorgeous with a rainbow almost every day. This hotel is in a great location. So much is within walking distance (shops, restaurants, galleries, whale watching, snorkeling & dinner cruises). A luau is held every night and we were able to watch it from the penthouse balcony. At least one of the previous reviews talked about the luau getting annoying after the first couple of nights, but we loved it. Sitting out on the lanai with the sounds of the luau was magical. There is not a restaurant on-site but there was one right next door as well as a general store where we picked up soda and snacks to keep in our rooms.

Being older, and not as brave as we once were, we loved snorkeling in the shallow waters right outside our hotel. Don't forget to wear those rubber shoes (I can't remember exactly what they are called at the moment)because it is rough going in your bare feet. Actually most of the time you need them in Hawaii if you are going in the water. We could see the yellow coral from our window. There is no restaurant on the premises, but there is a nice place very close by. We were within walking distance to Lahaina and the shops and the famous banyon tree in the square. Our room had twin beds (we usually prefer doubles, but this was a minor thing) and a refrigerator, microwave if I recall correctly and sink. We had a wonderful maid who even went beyond the call of duty and washed up our dishes one morning. She was so pleasant. Lahaina Shores was peaceful, clean, in good repair and the views on the water side are wonderful, magical. We were about 3 floors up.

For example, one day we asked for an extra beach towel because housekeeping did not provide us with clean beach towels in our room that day (for some unknown reason). The front desk clerk told us we were provided with beach towels in our room and they said they only had one clean beach towel left which they reluctantly gave to us.

This trip was scheduled to return at 11:00 a.m. at Lahaina Harbor (just a couple blocks from the hotel)and check out time is 11:00 a.m. They would not allow us to check out 15 minutes late. Therefore, we had to check out at 4:30 a.m. and store our bags in a room off the lobby and we had to move our car out of the hotel's parking garage at 4:30 a.m. When we returned from our fishing trip, we happened to be in the lobby around noon and we saw another person checking out of their room around noon. So apparently some people are allowed to check out after 11:00 a.m., but not us. They do have a hospitality room which was great so we could take a shower before we left for our red eye flight.

It was like we had the island all to ourselves. Seeing the sunset was amazing and we felt like we were in old Hawaii. I totally reccommend it. I stood up in the jeep while my husband drove, it was just great. Haleakala -- We could have passed on this. We got up at 2am, exhausted, drove for 2 hours, froze our ---- off for an hour before the sun even came up. It was nice, but not worth the 4 hours total in the car and the freezing. Molokini - Awesome! We had dolphins following us and jumping, it was great. I reccommed it to anyone. But if you go on a cheaper cruise, rent your snorkel gear.

He couldn't fix the problem himself, so another electrician came and then a senior manager came and they fixed the problem in 45 mins. Great service for a difficult-to-troubleshoot issue. Because we booked a condo, we had to park in the yucky parking lot right next door - but it was so convenient, it's really a minor complaint. Also, the condo rental agency told us that we would have to get our own toilet paper and paper towels after we had used what was there, but whoever owned that particular condo had stocked lots of extras, including extra bedding and towels.

We walked 1 block for Pacific'O and I'O restaurants (prefer Pacific'o), the general store, and shops. Lei Spa is next store and nice way relax. Then, you walk about 5 blocks and you are in downtown Lahaina. We stayed 4 days so reducing travel time and hassle driving to good beachs, excursions, and restaurants was important for us. Aside: I'O restaurant offers a \"Fete.\" Though we did not go, it was nice to watch the performers row the canoe into the ocean at sun set, torches and all, in preparation for the party. We could also faintly hear the music from our balcony (lanai in Hawaiian) as we sipped wine and watched the sun set on another day in Paradise.

We had 2 adults and three teen/college-age kids with us. Layout is one large private bedroom with king size bed, then one main room with a sofa bed, 5th person on a comfortable rollaway put in either room. Main room has a dining table for 5, kitchen has a nice serve-through bar, and good fridge/stove/dishwasher (also mini-washer/dryer in a closet). It was plenty of space, with a full lanai accessed by a sliding door from each room. Excellent a/c (it was hot and muggy in August); free beach towels checked out at the front desk daily; all very clean; good housekeeping; quick elevators. The shops next door are perfect for older kids (and adults!) -- a general store, the surf-lesson place, etc.. The pool is nothing special, but clean (and, no floating toys allowed), the hot tub worked well. Both are right in front of the hotel on the ocean side; then it's only steps through the (locked) gate to the beach. It's a short walk down to the Lahaina docks and Front Street - you can walk either on the beach- or go out the other side of the hotel and walk on Front Street. A couple of flaws: the sofa bed was not comfortable (pretty common in hotels), and first they gave us some egg-crating to help; next night gave us a queen size mattress for the floor instead, which worked better. The hot tub (and pool) were only open from 9 am til 10 pm, and you often want it earlier or later than that. The \"activity desk\" is run by Expedia, who should be embarassed by their pushy sales people, but they did have full information on all the activities on the island -- and this big push on buy-your-activitiy tickets *here\" is all over Maui. Overall, very clean, very pretty if not wildly modern (they told me they're renovating room-by-room), extremely convenient to all the fun in Lahaina, and a great bargain for a family, particularly after you stop at Costco near the airport and stock up the fridge. We would stay here again with a group. Great things to recommend: Goofy Foot Surf Lessons - from little kids to adults, guaranteed to stand up or you get your money back. Lessons near the docks, where the waves break in only 4-5 foot water, and, yes, everyone stood up! Kimo's restaurant in Lahaina -- great seafood & steaks, meals for about $22-25/person include sides and salads, right on the water, with live music, chosen as favorite 'special-occasion' restaurant by locals. Cheeseburger in Paradise -- lunch right on the water, but *not* known for their cheeseburgers -- great fries, great fish & chips, great atmosphere. The Marriott at Kaanapali luau -- half the price of the others that are touted ($47/person), and worked well for a family who doesn't want to spend $90/person for a few hour luau! Great buffet, gorgeous setting, good music, dancing, funny comedian, kids will like both the show and the food.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location but...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3793117", "Content": "Well we had no idea how awesome the location would turn out to be, and as it is, that was the only really great part about it.

It is indeed only 8 miles from the West End airport, but there are no commercial passenger flights into that airport, so I am at a loss as to why the hotel management would list that as the airport from which they give directions in this website. The airport for all passenger travel into Maui is Kahului (OGG) airport which is located 21 miles away. It takes roughly 45 minutes to drive from the airport, so renting a car to explore Maui is a must-do. It is a very nice drive of open highway paralleling the beach. Kaanapali is the huge tourist resort area which is about 5 miles further down the road. Expect to pay 2-3 times as much to stay there, and yet have to drive to the area right next door to this hotel for shopping and entertainment. All of Lahaina town is within a 2-15 minute walk. Other comments in this website complain about no on-site resturaunts. This is true, but about 150 feet from the front door of the hotel is the resturaunt and shopping plaza that other hotels send their patrons to for the best in dining and shopping. Therefore, the only thing that is lacking is room service. Big deal. I could not be happier with the location. The hotel itself is actually a condo complex of studios and one-bedrooms. Private individuals own the rooms, so each room is decorated differently. Most are neat but spartan. None of them are lavish, but all are in good repair and quite acceptable, consistent with a 3-star hotel. A wicker/Rattan wall unit that opens up into a \"Murphy Bed\" was in our uit. These are common in studio units in the tropics. The kitchen was well stocked with the usual utensils and pans for cooking. The day staff was very helpful and knowlegeable. However, the night staff was surly and grumpy and of little or no help. This ranged from the front desk guy who scolded us (from across the lobby) for not turning our pool towels in by 10:00 PM (when the pool closes) to the night watchman who sees himself as a draconian enforcer of the rule that the the pool and hot tub MUST be vacant at 10:00 PM on the nose. Apparently they believe that adults need to have a 10:00 curfew. After speaking to guests from other hotels, there seems to be a 5:00 PM curfew for pool activities at other hotels. Odd, very odd. There were very few kids at the hotel, so there was never a problem with cannonballs in the pool or hot tub, and no problem with loud disturbances of anykind. IF you have kids, you should try a place like the Kaanapali resorts where kids are abundant and they have child-oriented activities. This hotel is not oriented to entertaining the guests, it just provides a clean, safe and convenient place to base your stay while exploring Maui. I mean really, a person comes to Maui to see the island, not to explore the inside of a hotel. My biggest complaint about the ammenities of the hotel is the total lack of Internet access. There is no possible method to hook up to even check E-mail. There is even a hefty charge for local calls, so finding a way to even find a dial-up access is prohibitive. The Livewire Internet Cafe and Coffee House is about a 2-minute walk down the street. The current charge for Internet access there is $6 for 30 minutes with your own laptop or $6 for 20 minutes with their computers. Not too bad, but I would have rather been able to stay in the privacy of my own hotel room and paid the typical charge of $9-12 per 24 hours for wireless access, as most hotels charge.

We chose to stay at Lahaina Shores for a few reasons. First, as most will agree, was the location. This place has the best location on Maui if you want to stay in a fun atmosphere. It's not for you if you want total seclusion, mayby Kihei is a better option, but if you're looking for a place where you can walk anyplace you may want to go with respect to food, drinks, shopping, then Lahaina is a great option, and this place is situated perfectly. Second reason we came to find out to be true was the weather. At some places on the island, especially further north near the Ritz, the wind was a little much. Lahaina is very calm, and relaxing. As for this hotel/condo specifically, it meets all needs. It has the basic ammenities, and if you want others, they are within 200 feet of the hotel, just north. Let's face it, even if a more upscale place to stay has more to offer, you'll pay for it anyway. The service was great. The staff had the room cleaned no later than 2:00PM everyday. We stayed on the mountain side of the resort. Completely fine, as the mountain you get to see is amazingly beautiful.This place was great!

We feel it is the BEST value in the islands. I see a few reviews that are not favorable. Guests need to know that the units are individually owned and are decorated and up-dated by the individual owners. Thus the reason for the differences in the rooms. Some owners have had their units damaged by guests and will not put a lot of money in maintenance or decor. This is true of any condo. Also, the mountain view rooms will face the street and parking lot and are not as desireable as the ocean front rooms, but they are less expensive. The oceanfront penthouses, on the 7th floor, are a fantastic value and very comfortable. As for bugs... you are in the islands, they are a part of life, although we have never had a bug problem. The management is currently updating the public areas of the facility, but it takes time. We have no financial interest in Lahaina Shores so I have nothing to gain from offering this info.

The hotel is basic, yet clean and very nice. It has a fun sized pool and is right on the beach. If you get the ocean side you will fall asleep to the sounds of the waves in your ears and by the end of your trip in your heart. It should be noted that this is NOT a Resort per say, and does not compare to the services/rooms offered at the likes of the Four Seasons or any other 5 stars super hotel/true resort. If you need that kind of service you should think about another place to stay and of course pay. However, for the money this place is great. All the rooms come with a small kitchenette which is a nice option for reheating things you may pick up from one of the many great places to eat on the island. The staff is great and let it be known that they are there to help you 24 hours a day. If you book ask for an upper floor room (fifth floor or better) and try to get one that is to the south end of the hotel away from the party/luau that sometimes takes place at a nearby club. ( The party/luau ends at 10 PM so don't worry about being kept up all night) Also the hotel is about a 1/4 mile (15 min walk) from the fun of the beach town called Lahaina which is just the right distance to be. You should however get the rental car. You have parking there at the hotel for 3 dollars a night. I booked a small car via Alamo and was offered a jeep for only 100.00 more at the counter, for a total of 350.00 for 10 days (this would have cost me 650.00 had I booked a jeep on the web) I am told that this, \" we have a special\" thing being told to you at the counter, is very common.

It had mostly good reviews with only a few negative ratings from those who stayed on the lower mountain side rooms. My fiance' and I went on this trip for pleasure and it was our first visit to Maui. We chose to stay in the city of Lahaina because of the rumors that it was a fun town with shopping and many restaurants to chose from. Overall, I believe we made the best choice in locations on the island compared to the northern beaches kaanapali and kapalua and southern beaches of wailea and kihei. Anyways, back to the hotel, we opened the door and were pleasantly surprised to find a clean room with awesome ocean view. We were in a studio ocean view. For the price, which is considerably less than many of the hotels on the island, it is a great deal. The ocean is so close and the waves quietly roll in all night long putting us to sleep after long days of siteseeing and beach bumming. The room had its own small kitchen w/ full size fridge, stove & microwave. Although we didn't really use it other than to warm up some left over local food. The lanai is a good size and the window overlooking the ocean is the length and height of the room which made for beautiful sunsets. The staff was extra friendly and always had the aloha spirit. We felt welcome and smiling faces always greeted us. As for negatives and why I wouldn't give this place a 5 star rating- it is a bit old, the building is mostly made of cement looking bricks colored in a greenish tone, kind of makes the place look a bit outdated. There is no restaurant on site and parking was at the shopping center next door (it's very close though). No amenities at this site other than the pool, ok for a quick dip to cool down but a backyard pool is likely bigger than this thing. The beach is non-existent during high tide but shallow waters allow for floating on a blow up raft right near the hotel. Overall a good place for those who don't spend too much time in the room other than to shower, take a quick nap or sleep. No roaches, no big bugs, simply a clean room, much like a nice Motel 6 like other people have said. On the island, you must take the road to Hana, rent a Jeep and take it around the entire island, see spectacular waterfalls right off the road, practically deserted beaches (the black sand beach), seven pools, and for awesome local food, look for the \"local kine grindz\" sign near Hana. A couple of local guys bbq'ng in their front yard w/ the BEST local food on the island. Local food in town and around Maui is hard to find and not very good, Cheeseburger in Paradise is good, Rick's seafood terrible, Aloha Plate Lunch overpriced. I recommend beaches: Makena beach #2 is beautiful, deserted beaches around Kihei, Kamaole Beach #3 for swimming, black sand beach for pictures, Napili Bay for turquoise waters, and on the trip from the airport to Lahaina there are some less populated beaches w/ waters up to the waist 1/4 mile out, crystal clear turquoise. An unbelievable trip w/ 5 nights at Lahaina Shores, a good central location, clean, and within walking distance to all of Lahaina.", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot Impressed\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2171233", "Content": "Our travel agent recommended Lahaina Shores for the second part of our honeymoon trip.

This was a spur of the moment trip for us and we were on somewhat of a budget. We had been to Maui before and we didn't think we wanted to stay in a big resort in Kaanapali or Wailea. We wanted to be closer to the action of Lahaina and we wanted to be able to walk to dinner each night. We also didn't want to be stuck eating breakfast and lunch at a resort every day. We could not have asked for a better place to stay during our trip. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room and the grounds around the hotel were very clean (and up to my standards which are extremely high). The location was close to town but still quiet. There were no screaming children around during our visit which also made it more enjoyable for us. The pool is small and the hotel does not offer the amenities of a resort so it is probably not the best place for families. The guests seemed to be couples of all ages from mid 20s to 60s. We upgraded to an oceanview room. Definitely worth it. We had a great time watching the sunset on our lanai. All in all it was a perfect choice for us. The price was reasonable and we were able to relax without fighting crowds around the hotel and no one bothered us with anything. I would highly recommend this hotel. I know that we will be back someday.", "Date": "May 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olds, Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1892363", "Content": "I have a hard time understanding why there would be any negative reviews of this hotel. I just returned from Hawaii, the last week of April being spent at the Lahaina Shores. It exceeded all of my expectations ! I stayed in an oceanview on the third floor and it was a close to perfect as you can come for any amount of money. Big, airy room, well cared for, everything in very good condition, clean and very comfortable. The lanai looked over the grounds and the ocean, with a view of the luau next door in the evenings. Except for the evening entertainment ( which one can hardly complain about ), it was as peaceful and picture perfect as one could ask for. I even sat and watched the whales out in front of the hotel on two different evenings...amazing. I would recommend the Lahaina shores to anyone, without hesitation...I can't think of one bad thing to say about my stay there. I absolutely loved it and will definitely stay there again. I can understand those on the ground floor being unhappy...but that is to be expected in any hotel, at any price. If you want an oceanview and do not want to be on the ground floor, you have to pay the extra for it...anyone should know that. It would be no different in a $300 a night luxury hotel. Pay the extra for an ocean view on the third floor or higher....you will not be disappointed and it will be worth every penny. For those who care to complain about the little things...this is NOT a luxury hotel and they do not claim to be. If you want a five star....go and stay at a five star...and pay for it. If you want a beautiful, quiet hotel, on the ocean, with a beautiful view and peaceful grounds only a few short blocks from downtown Lahaina....stay here. I got every single dollar's worth out of my stay here...and more.", "Date": "May 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clayton, NC", "Title": "\u201cOlder but affordable\u201d", "Author": "Caniac2006", "ReviewID": "UR1880512", "Content": "We definetely plan to stay here when we go back.

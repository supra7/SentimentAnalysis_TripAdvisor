Upon arrival, I think I walked into a chaotic staff moment; The front desk attendant was speaking very loudly at another staffer and I had to wait until things settled down. I was early for the room (2:15 for a 3pm check in) and I was told the room was not ready but I could use the bathroom and wait in the lounge. The latter was tiny with no water or cheer (like flowers which are in some of the Tripadvisor photos). Another customer joined me as we both waited. The room was quite clean and nicely appointed with pleasantly scented soap, shampoo etc. Although on the small side, it was more than adequate and the bed/pillows were super comfortable. The TV remote didn't work which was annoying but no complaints. After I checked out, I realized that the hotel offers breakfast buffet and wine and cheese. I returned to the hotel room one night and the cardkey to the door had been deactivated. The staffer did not think this was unusual at all, but it was inconvenient given the long day I'd had and the fact that my feet were sore. The Front Desk attendant never bothered to describe the amenities offered which was a shame. The staff is friendly almost to the point of being casual. An earlier review mentioned a helpful staffer opening the elevator door for them; No one did this during my stay, in fact, the front desk guy and the lobby attendant who were sitting side by side at the counter only 4 feet from the elevator merely pointed and told me to pull on the door.

Liked the bathrobe too. All of the staff I encountered was professional, friendly and non-intrusive, and they were nice to my dog - who fortunately is a quiet, polite little pup. The morning breakfast buffet was perfect for me and I loved the self-help coffee/cappuccino machine that could be accessed all day. I looked every day for the wine/cheese in the afternoon and it never seemed to be out or maybe I always missed it. Great location - around the corner from the Lexington line. I never needed a cab. It was an easy walk to Central Park and the Met. All kinds of convenient stores and restaurants in the area. Best deal of all - every third night free, so I had two free nights over seven days which brought the average room rate down to about $300 - including misc charges and all NYC taxes which add about 20%.

In addition they offered a \"stay 2 nights, get the 3rd night free\". Although I had read reviews that the rooms were small my husband suggested that I call to make sure that the petite queen had a closet. I was told that the petite queen room had NO closets. When I was hesitant about keeping the reservations I was first upgraded to a super queen and then a deluxe queen with no additional charge. I was quite happy with that solution. We found the room very small but adequate, although the only bureau was a night table. We took the phone books out of the drawer and shared the 3 small drawers for the 2 of us. There was a small closet, with ironing board and iron, safe and umbrella! The light bulb in the closet out and I neglected to report it. The TV did not work the first night and we were told the IT man was supposed to come but apparently had not. We were not satisfied with that but were told he would be coming. We woke up the next AM pleased to find the big screen flat TV on the wall was working! The room was very hot each night and we could not find a thermostat. We slept with an open window which solved the problem but we felt it wasn't energy efficient & the person sleeping next to the window was a bit cold. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. There were plenty of snacks and drinks to purchase from the top of the desk. There was a wine and cheese gathering each evening in a delightful small dining area and each morning there was a delicious continental breakfast of croissants, bread, cheese and meat, jams, granola, milk, yogurt, juice and an espresso/latte machine in addition to regular coffee and tea. There was an adjoining comfortable sitting room with current newspapers. The rooms as well as the the dining and sitting area were tastefully decorated in a brown and blue motif with beautiful silk wall paper. There were lovely fresh flower arrangements in both rooms and lovely roses at the front desk. In addition each floor had delightful mosaic tile framed pictures on the wall and each room number with mosaic tiled. The hotel is pet friendly and one of the staff had her little dog there.

The rooms are tiny, but very charming with soft colors, nice lighting, and great beds. Our room had a small desk, large TV, queen sized bed, and decent closet space. Expensive mini-bar (but aren't they always?)....do wish they had offered free water though. Wireless internet service was great as was daily newspaper delivery. We were on the 7th floor and maid service came late (around 2pm), but we are not \"morning\" people so this didn't bother us a bit. The bathroom is really small and the water pressure on the rain shower a little weak, but other than that, they did a great job with the space. The breakfast area is small, but cozy. Don't expect a full on American breakfast, but the rolls, cereal, coffees, and tea are a great addition to the place. I loved the textured wall paper...might have to add some to my dining area back home. We also enjoyed the free evening wine and cheese further adding to the romantic, charming feel of the hotel.

There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel but there are plenty of alternatives in the surrounding area and the hotel staff are very accomodating if you want to bring food/drink back in to the two rooms that are used as communal areas. Breakfast consists of cereal, various breads, ham and the usual beverages so is ample. A real selling point was the wine and cheese that was made available in the evening, especially if you are with a group. As far as location goes it was fine. Only a couple of blocks away from Central Park and the subway so it was a good staging point but it would have been quite a walk to the main attractions in Downtown Manhattan....taxis were the best solution.

The room size was also not an issue, it was a King (upgraded for free w/o even asking) size room and had plenty of space and a lovely bathroom.

Also we booked a hop-on bus tour and it stopped right in front of the Guggenheim as well. I couldn't have asked for a better location especially if you're after the museums, Madison Avenue shops, and the Park. Just east of the Franklin is a plethora of restuarants where you'll find something for every pallate and budget. The hotel has some real perks too. The continental breakfas was awesome - chesses, pastries, the most amazing crusty bread, proscuttio, cereal, juices, and the fantastic cappucino maker. It was a delight and was all I needed to start my day. For the record I never saw the buffet run out of food, nor did we ever have any trouble finding a place to sit and eat.

One set of towels, one glass, one robe, etc. We had to ask for a second set of towels etc. and only got exactly what we asked for 1 large, 1 small towel, no face cloth and none of the extra accoutrements. Breakfast was nice if you don't mind eating in a hallway. They had fresh fruit, pastries and cereals, though I was told they ran out soon after we left for the day, the food was good. There was a mess up on the second day and the room wasn't cleaned. I guess a prankster turned over the please tidy my room sign. Did we get an apology? NO. Nothing, a single set of towels when we asked for clean. The others were still wet on the unmade bed. The next day I expected an apologetic clerk, an offer of discount off our next stay or a voucher for lunch at a local restaurant. I've stayed at a lot of hotels that try to look after the clientele, most offer something when a mistake has been made. This place, nothing.

The Franklin seemed to fit all the criteria. Their website wasn't working when I booked, so I called. I specifically asked the man I spoke with if they had valet parking and he said yes, even quoted a price for it! I knew the rooms were small so ordered the King Deluxe, and went down with my daughter for a 3-day stay. When we got there, a very friendly doorman said, \"no, no valet.\" But pointed me across the street to self-park. Okay, weird mix-up. I hoped for the best. Inside, a pleasant-enough desk clerk checked us in. The hotel was built around 1920, I believe, and has a lot of charm. There are two small but nicely laid-out public rooms--a front parlor and a rear area with tables and chairs. (More later). The EXTREMELY friendly doorman brought us up to our room in the old-fashioned elevator. Elevator door opened to claustrophobia-inducing, narrow, low-ceilinged corridors. \"You have the largest room in the house,\" he said. That made me happy but when he opened the door to our room, I almost laughed. I've stayed in tiny rooms in NY before, but this one took the prize. HOWEVER, it was spotlessly clean. The linens on the King bed were pristine and gorgeous. The bathroom was teensy, but again, clean. Nice amenities. No fridge. Bright (we faced the street). Couldn't open the closet door fully because it hit the bed. Morning was best at this hotel. The complimentary continental breakfast they serve is really wonderful. First of all, they have a great machine that makes quite good espressos and cappucinos and such. For a spread, they had prosciutto, good french bread slices, good jam. Sliced fruit. Mini croissants that were flaky and fresh, not hard out of some bag. Pleasant tables to sit at, either in the rear room or the front parlor. Good selection of newspapers. They did a stand-up job in this department. (I believe they also serve wines and cheese at cocktail hour). I think if this hotel had been in a more central area, or closer to the park, or if there hadn't been two of us in the room, we would have been fine with it, but we realized we felt too claustrophobic and stuck in left field after all.

We had small carry-ons and the room size was just fine for us. The King had very adequate space, and a much larger bathroom. The rooms were spotless, wonderfully appointed, with great beds, linens, towels, and bath products. Great flat panel TV (which we never used ... being in NYC!), and cool phone and i-home alarm. The hotel is located on a quiet street, very convenient to public transportation. Service was excellent. Breakfast was very nice, consisting of a variety of breads and sweets, cheese and excellent prosciutto. The espresso/cappuccino machine, as noted by other guests, is a hit. Late afternoons, they serve artisanal cheeses and wine, a great touch and actually very useful when walking all over town during the day and wanting to relax for a couple of hours before going out in the evenings. The hotel has a nice sitting/reading room, the rooms have fine bath robes and slippers for people who want some relaxation. If I were to go to NYC for a work trip, this would be a top place to consider, mostly because it has a very nice and relaxing environment.

The staff was so friendly and accommodating that I felt guilty if I beat them to the elevator door and opened it myself, which didn't happen often! The continental breakfast each morning was great and saved us spending the extra money at a corner Starbucks or deli before starting our day. And with breakfast hours until 10 a.m., we didn't have to get up at the break of dawn in order to enjoy it. The wine and cheese reception was a terrific amenity. After full days of walking the streets and sightseeing, we came to look forward to the reception as a way to recharge before we regrouped for nights on the town. The room was small - I would suspect that's the norm in Manhattan - but the amenities, by far, made up for that. The flat-panel TV made the most of the room's limited size. A huge TV for the room and great if you're taking a few minutes to rest your feet in bed. The plush bed, the fancy soaps and shampoos, and a spacious shower made up for any lack of space to put a suitcase. And, as a journalist, I loved getting the New York Times delivered to my room each morning and having the Wall Street Journal at breakfast. The location was prime. The 6-line on the subway is around the corner and carried us nearly everywhere we needed to go. It travels from the northernmost part of Manhattan to the Brooklyn Bridge in the south, and is one train away from going all the way to Battery Park (Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Ferry). I loved our proximity to Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it was fun being in a part of town where millionaires are as abundant as taxi cabs.

We looked at hotels for hours and eventually I settled on the Travel Inn or Chelsea, so naturally we ended up at The Franklin as she thought it looked 'cute'. On arrival it looked pretty much as I expected having read many reviews about the place. We were greeted by very friendly staff who took our bags so fast I thought I was being mugged. On getting to our room, the door swung open and to our surprise we found ourselves in a room that seemed to have been designed for Hobbits. I'm sure JR Tolkien would have been impressed, but I was less so. Even less impressive was the view of a wall about 3 ft away from our window. Nevertheless we maintained our Great British fortitude and refused to let this put a dampner on proceedings, and to be honest I was glad we did...though seeing the bathroom did test this to the limits. I want to get to the good bits so let's just leave my description of that as small and move on. So, as I was saying, I was glad we did... The bed was great, in fact the small room meant I could see the TV at night perfectly from my bed, which meant my wife could get some sleep without me moaning. The hotel was peaceful as it was away from the main hustle and bustle of the more 'popular' places. Our daily bagel breakfast was a delight courtesy of the very local bagel shops (though I think they're on just about any corner). We didn't try the food there, mainly due to reading reviews on this site and being scared that if I touched anything we would be charged for it. The 'mini bar' is rubbish and extortionate, so no change from most hotels there then. This distance was not always good however for getting to lower manhatten. The first day we walked through central park, this was about a 5minute walk to reach, then to make our way down the park was a good 20 minutes further. From there we managed to get to what I would consider the main touristy bits. This was a fair walk and was soon to become a painful one for me. I would however say that it was a very nice walk and one which I would take again, but not necessarily what you want every day of your holiday. The tube back was often long and at the wrong times a bit of a nightmare, but soon this was going to be necessary for me. I say this as I injured my knee on the second day. When I say injured I mean couldn't walk on it injured. This was when the distance of the hotel really caused us problems. Now, I'm 28, but was hobbling around like I was three times that. This gave me an insight into what it would be like to be older, more aching person and stay at the hotel. I would say don't do it, it's a painful experience. Another point we got from this is if you want to spend most of your time visiting Chinatown, Greenwich, Times Square, Broadway and all the other lower manhatten areas, be prepared to have at least 1-2 hours taken out of each day on the tube if you stay here. Showing the British grit that has taken me this far I refused to let this stop our holiday explorations... and showing the British tight fistedness that has afforded our recent holidays I refused to be robbed by those cab prices. Therefore, I hopped everywhere. Oh yes, I hopped to the tube station, into the tube (up and down stairs I might add) and wherever we went for two days, until I got a knee support and could put light pressure on it. Still, for the price you can't complain. As a rule of thumb for future visits we take, we will not be staying in any hotel that is higher than about 65th, this is easy walking distance to most of the main attractions, including central park and there seems to be some fantastic hotels around there. If I were to some up The Franklin in as descriptive a way as I can muster I would say it was nice, not really any more to say on it.

Everyone that works here is really, really nice..and I definately would return to this hotel again.", "Date": "September 16, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Franklin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93575-Reviews-The_Franklin-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$240 - $461*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">164 E 87th St</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Off Lexington Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10128</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "93575", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/26/46/26460826c731fa00b8ced1ec48fd62df4large.jpg"}}

Frankly, I was o.k. with the room experience but the \"included\" free breakfast was horrible. We have a line that ran from outside the restaurant into the hall only to get to the buffet common area to find sub-par food; I like bacon or saugage with my meal; they have sub-par ham slices with pineapples in broth; the minature donuts were stale (it reminded of day-old bread store off-brand products). I get to the egg station only to find they don't make omelets; yet another strike here. The cereals are tolerable and the milk o.k.; the juice (mind you I'm in Florida, land of Oranges) and the orange juice was worse than Tang and about the same consistency. It gets better, I spoke to the conceirge desk over the phone a week or so before the trip to ask them about Disney theme park tickets and to compare. I asked specifically about the rates for (2) 4-day park hopper tickets. The rates they quoted me was $520 (tax included) for two tickets (no strings or stipulations). I re-affirmed this with the man on the phone and said I would purchase them once I arrived; he said that would be fine. The morning of my first full day I went down to the conceirge desk and was told the rates would be over $690 bucks. He proceeded to tell me that the rate was probably a rate qouted by the \"other person\" at the same conceirge desk, stating that he works for a different company. Clearly this tactic is a bait-and-switch tactic to get you hooked into sitting through their timeshare pitch. It is my opinion that this is fraudualent misrepresentation when one purports to be the conceirge desk only to bait and switch you on the terms given over the phone. So beware, this hotel, their service, and their business practices are not representative of a good hotel or vacation experience and don't get suckered.

The good: The location of the hotel was perfect. We could get to the Disney Parks in a matter of minutes and other conveniences (restaurants, shopping, 7-11, etc) were right at our fingertips. The staff seemed friendly and the buffet was good. The not-so-good: The room was fairly nice, but it really did not accommodate us well. We were expecting the bedroom and the living room areas to be much larger than they were. They were rather tight. My husband and I had a king bed and the girls slept on the sofa bed in the living room. The bathroom and sink separated the living room and the bedroom, with the sink being in between the two rooms. The layout was a bit odd. The door to close off the bedroom was on the side of the sink area closest to the living room. It didn't make much sense to have the door in that spot, in my opinion. That said, if my husband and I wanted privacy, the girls would not have been able to use the sink or have access the shower/tub/toilet. My husband had to get showered and dressed before the girls woke up and he had to actually leave the hotel room so they could get ready. It was quite inconvenient for him. Access to the internet was imperative for us as I was taking online courses and my husband was teaching online during the vacation. Unfortunately, internet access was expensive at Buena Vista Suites. Considering they charge a resort fee, one would think wi-fi would be included in that charge. Not so, unfortunately. Everyday, we drove to a nearby McDonalds to work on our laptops. Another inconvenience. When the four of us returned to Orlando a few months later for vacation, we stayed at Floridays Resort. It was significantly better! My husband and I had our own bedroom and bathroom, and the girls had their own bedroom and bathroom. Also, the girls each had a full-size bed. It made them quite happy that they didn't have to sleep in the same bed as they did before. Additionally, we had a living room, dining area, full kitchen and washer/dryer. It was quite spacious and we didn't feel as though we were on top of each other. It was truly a home away from home. They did charge a resort fee, which was the same as Buena Vista, but it included wi-fi access. We also paid several hundred dollars less than we did at Buena Vista Suites, but we got so much more for our money. We stayed at both places from Thursday to Tuesday, so one cannot say that the difference in the price was because of the days of the week. If you do not need a lot of space or access to wireless internet, and you want to be close to Disney, Buena Vista Suites may be a good choice. However, if space, wi-fi access, great amenities, and an affordable price are what you're looking for, check out Floridays! It's approximately 6-7 minutes away from Buena Vista Suites and worth the extra minutes.

The Buena Vista Suites seemed to be perfect and also seem to be somehow connected to the Carribe Royale next door. All good news I thought. Orlando is a town full of hotel competition keeping prices down. I have stayed in nearby motels for only $35/night that included an adequate breakfast. The rooms were clean and functional. I thought it would be good to try something else at about $100/night. I was told it is an all suites hotel. When I arrived one person at the reception was helping a guest. The other was talking to another employee. Finally that employee walked away but the other person still didn't acknowledge me. I stood there for 5 minutes before she finally looked up. I figured that is a bad beginning. The hotel room looked fine when I opened the door, but there was a stale air odor. Unfortunately there is only one window that cannot be opened, so any air change would be from the HVAC or by leaving the hall door open. The room was functional, but the furniture was tattered and chipped. I found some mold in the bathroom. Although there was a cleverly folded swan towel on the bed and the tissues and toilet paper had nice folds, the bathroom smelled like urine. It was almost sickening to go in there. It made me wonder how clean the rest of it is. I also wondered why do all the folding and not bother cleaning well? I decided to eat in the restaurant one night. They were very nice and accommodating. The food was also quite delicious, which I find to be somewhat uncommon in Orlando and was totally unexpected in this hotel. That was a huge surprise. Another person I spoke with at the reception area was also charming, so it seems that first day was an anomaly. By the way, they do offer internet connection for a fee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I believe it was under $10/day. The smell of the room changed this morning. Around 5am there was a very strong garlic odor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as if standing right over the skillet browning garlic - oddly stronger in the room from the HVAC than in the hall. It was annoying enough I had to get ready to leave sooner than planned to get away from it. I guess $100 isn't bad for a tattered smelly room in some markets (NYC), but here with all the competition, I was very surprised. Over the days I was there I noticed there are many tour groups here but also families and foreign visitors. The breakfast isn't very good, but is adequate. It isn't much better than the $35 nearby motel. I normally tip for included breakfasts, but here they had dollar bills hanging around as it if were a strip joint. They would make you egg, but expected a tip. Same with clearing the table. It seemed a bit in your face. I would recommend this, but with hesitation. I would also tell others in the 30 years I have been coming here each year, I have found many other better values nearby.

We also used the complimentary $25 gift card to the hotel's restaurant for room service. The food was actually quite good. I brought it back to the room & before I was even able to unpack it there was a knock at the door. They had forgotten the dressing for my salad so they ran it up to me. ALL of the staff I dealt with were very friendly! Even the lady at the store gave me some plastic silverware so I wouldn't have to buy a whole box ( I only needed two forks). We were on the 7th floor facing the road. I gotta say, I couldn't hear a thing from outside, & I'm a light sleeper. We used the pool & found it clean & peaceful. If I had to list some complaints It would have to be the no bacon & the missing drawer pulls on my bureau. Also, the parking lot is a little deserted. My husband & brother are both police officers so we were safe but I would have been nervous, otherwise. I have read all of the bad reviews & I have to say I'm a little shocked. Our stay was great!! I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. We will definitely stay here, again the next time we are in Orlando!!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cVery nice place\u201d", "Author": "Carol W", "ReviewID": "UR121929244", "Content": "This is a great place to stay if you want a reasonably priced and comfortable hotel.

As one previous reviewer stated \"Canned peaches and pears really!\" The pool and hot tub are nothing to write home about and need work. Now here is the reason that this hotel is not great and a major issue. There is no exhaust in the bathrooms of the suites! My son used the bathroom and an hour later is still smelled. I checked the grille in the bathroom and there was no air movement. I assumed that the fan must be broken. Later that day in the shower I looked up and you could see mold on the ceiling. Further inspection showed mold on the walls mostly near the garbage can. You could even see where they had painted over the mold so they know its there! The next morning on the way to breakfast I asked to speak with a manager regarding this. He said \"that it is hotel policy not to have fans in the bathrooms\". I could only assume that the grille in the bathroom was for supply air from the heating/AC unit which means that air blows into the bathroom. This would also mean that any smell from the washroom would be forced out the door into the rest of the suite! The manager offered to move us to another room and I declined as we already had our things unpacked. He also asked if I wanted to elevate my complaint to a senior manager.

Noise from the hallway was more than most places, but my room was not far from the elevators where people were getting off and rolling their suitcases across the tile to go to their rooms. I also had several disturbances from a rude family with small children who liked to run and yell down the hallways. The adults also tried to enter my room on at least 3 occasions by sliding their key cards into my door lock and then trying to open the door.

We had a late check in and Mr. Ulysses was on duty and he was just so friendly from check in and on through our visit. The pool etc. is not full power resort size, but at the same time is adequate since we're so burned out each day after returning from the parks.

The free breakfast is nothing special, but still a step above a lot of complimentary breakfast options. They have eggs (fresh cooked available but no omelets), meat (sausage, bacon, ham rotated daily), french toast, potatoes, and some fruits along with toast, donuts, and yogurt.

The next morning the manager moved us into a different room on the 5th floor which was excellent and more in line with what we had seen on their website. We also received a complimentary voucher for free food to compensate for the inconvenience. The two spacious rooms, two flat screen TV's, fridge, and mircrowave our definitely a plus. We did have some minor issues that were immediately corrected by the staff. I was not able to access internet for two days until I called the techinician and he hard coded me into their system through the end of my stay, from that point forward I had no issues as long as I used my laptop in the living room. The room was very clean, the only problem was housekeeping for some reason did not like to replace shampoo, conditioner, and some of the coffee supplies that we were using. We had to call and request these on our own. Somehow we had very bad luck with our keys that were demagnitized so after about four times, they had a technician take a look at the door lock and after that we had no problems getting in.

We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and would definitely recommend it to others who are traveling in the area. When you compare the price of this hotel to one of the Disney resorts, the difference is staggering. Our total for 5 nights was about $550 and we had room for 6 to sleep comfortably. This hotel also offers free shuttles to all of the Disney Parks, so that part is covered as well. We didn't actually use the shuttles because we wanted the freedom to come and go when we wanted, but they were available and the time schedules were printed with 4 or 5 departure times and as many return times. They didn't offer as many shuttles to every park, but there were at least 2 shuttles to every park each day. The parking at Disney is $14 for all day and you can come and go as you want for that price- to any park. Check-in was simple and quick and the hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and nicely decorated. Our room was the 2-queen lay-out, which had 2 queen beds in the bed room and a queen sofa sleeper in the living area, separated by a door that can be closed if needed. In the center of the room, there is a bathroom with a vanity and sink outside the door, which is handy when you have multiple people who are getting ready at once. The room also had 2 flat panel televisions- one in the bedroom and one in the living area. This was very nice as well, given the wide array of tv programs everyone in our family prefers. The breakfast each day was excellent. It was not only great because it was FREE, but also because of the options you had. The first day they offered scrambled eggs, sausage links, french toast, and potatoes on the buffet bar. They also had fresh fruit, yogurt, doughnuts, bagels, dry cereal, and toast. For drinks, they offered orange juice, milk, chocolate milk, coffee, and 6 kinds of soda. They also prepared toast for you and prepared eggs to order. The dining room was large and easily could hold 150 at a time, so there was never an issue finding a table, even though we were in Orlando during a busy week. This free breakfast saved us a bundle in 5 days. A similar breakfast would be $10 per person easily. We have 7 total family members (including our 2-year-old) so the breakfast alone for 5 days would come to $350. I know the Disney resort offers meal plans, but I also know they charge a high price for them, so this free buffet breakfast pretty much sealed the deal. I've noticed some others reviewing this hotel have said there is no free internet. I checked with the front desk and was told to type in my confirmation # in the box when logging in and ours would be free- and it was. I suppose this is only applicable when you stay a minimum number of nights. We stayed 5 nights, so you might ask about that. Otherwise, the price would have been 8.95 per 24-hour period. The pool was excellent as well. The configuration was nice because it offered 2 shallow ends and the center of the pool was the deepest, so our smaller children were able to swim on either end. The pool also offered a take-out window from the restaurant that was on-site. The prices were not too terribly high, but we were operating on a budget and didn't take advantage of this option. They also had a hot tub/whirlpool which my wife utilized. It was a large, 8-man whirlpool about 30-40 feet away from the main pool and my wife said it was very nice. Overall, we were very pleased with everything. We saved about $2000 between the room cost and the breakfast and I don't think we sacrificed very much in the way of comfort and amenities.

Through our event we paid $99 a night. The good: The room was very nice. Large couch area, big TVs nice king bed, fridge, microwave. Mostly friendly staff. The bad: Where do I begin... $8.99 for use of the internet on your own computer...really?? Got our check in date wrong: wasn't that big of a deal, they fixed it right away. Went to front desk to ask for scissors because I forgot to bring my own. Front desk would not let me take them to the room even if I left my drivers license. So I had to bring down what I needed to cut-- at this point a little bothered but not that bad yet. Forgot to put a shower chair in the bathroom for my husband who is in a wheelchair-not that big of a deal, they brought one after I called. BUT then my husband tried to transfer on to it but it was so unstable that he could not sit on it.--Really Really annoyed by that. No wake up call that we requested. Thank goodness I set the alarm so we did make it on time.--really really annoyed by that. Go to get breakfast for my husband who is unable to come down stairs at that point to get his own due to his disability. I go in and get a plate for him. I go to the elevator and an manager (I think) opens the door quickly from the back and states to me \"you need to eat in the dining room.\" I explained why I was bring the food to my room and he said \"well, I didn't know that.\" Then proceeded to rudely state \"you need to tell us that so that we can give you a to go box\". I have never heard of a hotel not letting you take the continental breakfast to you room so I was unaware of this crazy policy.

Got a fantastic deal on the rooms (Google around, and check their website for their one-day weekly specials). Great sleeping due to excellent bedding and the fact the bedroom is further separated from the hallway by the living room and an interior door. A/C worked great, much better than other Orlando hotels - and not humid. Free Breakfast was decent... yes, on weekdays the fruit was limited to tinned peaches or pears, but if you need fresh fruit the 7-11 across the street has some at a good price. CVS also directly across street. Great experience with staff, they went out of their way to be helpful. Good experience with reservations staff on phone also, as I had to make a couple of changes. Pool very clean and nice, and food available poolside is EXCELLENT (albiet a bit pricey). Recommend your own car, easy drive to all Disney parks and ok for Universal also. Room had secure safe in closet (you set our own code), small fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. Good TVs, though we didn't watch it much. The back side of the hotel (facing the parking lot/forest) is quieter than the front, and if you look hard you can see Downtown Disney and the Epcot globe. Optional wi-fi is expensive, but they tell you that up front. Most McDonald's have free wifi locally if you really need it.

I was not going to let some jerk talk to my mother that way so i asked to speak to a manager and some girl comes out and didn't speak once after i told her what happened, didnt even apologize. The third shift guy on the other hand did apologize in such a way i wanted to smack him. He said well im sorry your mother didnt understand what i was saying and basically calling my mother a liar. Anyway i know they video tape the lobby so i hope this gets in the right hands of maybe the real manager and they review the tapes and let go of those two. They should not be in costumer service.

One morning we had a late start due to a morning rain storm. They cleaned our side of the hallway already. We weren't expecting them to clean our room since we were so late coming back, but to our great surprise they did. Also every night they made the pull out couch and left it open for us. The one bad thing about the hotel was the food selection in the free breakfast. It was lacking choices. No english muffins, no bacon, no cheese. Pancakes were every other day.

There is LIMITED shuttle service to Disney World, Animal Kingdom, etc., and a taxi is $20-$25 each way. DO NOT fall for the discounted tickets scam in the lobby. I was told, by the man at the desk, if I bought the tickets at Disney, the total would be $838 for 2 kids, and 2 adults, for 2 days at Disney, if I listened to their sales pitch the next day. He would save me $313, for a total of $525. I passed, as I wasn't going to sit through a pitch, and I had researched tickets and knew the cost would be $664 if I bought the tickets at Disney. Would I have saved some money? Yes. But I don't deal with liars and cheats. Our queen suite was very cramped with 2 adults, a 4 yr old, and a 6 yr old. The restaurant wait staff is painfully slow and does not listen. We ordered dinner on our 2nd night and it took 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken. Another 23 minutes for our dinner order to be taken. And then 25 minutes before our food arrived. There were 3 tables of 5 or less in the restaurant and this was the service we got. On our last night there, I went down to order a kids chicken tenders meal, with chocolate ice cream, a burger, and a Buena Vista salad, with 1 additional drink and an additional cup of vanilla ice cream. There were 2 families in the dining room at that time. While waiting for our food, on 3 occasions men came to the bar to order a drink, only to leave after 1 for 5 minutes, and 2 for 10 minutes because no one was behind the bar to wait on them, or servers asking if they could help. That's 25 minutes of me waiting for my food. And then when I get it and get back to the room, the kids meal was wrong, the ice cream was wrong, and the drinks were wrong.

Would recommend a gps for your car trips to/from the airport, and for finding your way home at night from the parks just as a backup (another genius idea is the hotel is lit up at night so its easy to locate). There were free shuttles for the parks each day but we didn't use them so I really can't comment on them, we used our own car to get around. The morning breakfast was wonderful, so much to choose from, lots of hot items, bacon, sausage, french toast, hash browns, pancakes, eggs cooked to order, fruit, cereal, coffe, tea, milk, juice, donuts, bagels, toast, etc. Our kids can only eat all natural foods, so having the eggs, fruit and bagels was perfect for us.

The rooms has two LCD TV's so you can watch your programs while the kinds can enjoy theirs. It also has a small fridge and a small microwave but it has only one sink, the same one that you use to wash your hands and teeth so I found a little complicated to eat in the room or cook anything.

I contacted the front desk immediately and they sent someone to repair it. Not a great start but at least they were responsive. The extra living room was nice to have, which is one of the main reasons I stay there or the Caribe Royale, but the furniture is a little run down. The coffee table weighs about a thousand pounds and you can't move it around if you want some legroom by the couch. I also found the bed to be pretty uncomfortable, but that may be because i'm used to a king and our room had 2 queens.

The weather was beautiful, and we were hoping for a good vacation. In some ways, the Buena Vista Suites met our expectations, and in other ways, it did not. Rooms-- The suites are very clean and spacious. We had no problems with housekeeping (as other reviewers have), and we had more than enough room for us and some friends who visited for a couple days. We especially liked the microwave and decently-sized refrigeration that came in the suite. Pool/Hot Tub-- While we were there, we had the pool/hot tub area almost completely to ourselves. No need to compete for a chair. The pool wasn't that large, but with no one really using it, it was perfectly sized for us. The hot tub, on the other hand, was more like a bath tub. The water was hot, but the jets would not work. I complained to management the first two days, and gave up after that. Free Breakfast-- The breakfast here was decent, but not as expansive as I've seen at places like Embassy Suites. Everyday, there were breakfast potatoes, french toast or pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, grits, mini doughnuts, sliced oranges, canned fruit, dry cereal, and a large bowl of yogurt. I was hoping for some other, slightly healthier options, like oatmeal, more fruit, or different varieties of yogurt (like I've seen at Embassy Suites). Either way, it got the job done for breakfast. Location-- This is the one aspect that I really disliked about the hotel. The hotel is located on the intersection of two busy highways. You virtually cannot walk anywhere, except for the Caribe Royale next door. There is a CVS, a pizza place, and a take-out Asian food place across one of the highways, but there are no pedestrian paths to get you there. You basically have to wait for traffic to slow down and J-walk. Free shuttle services to the Disney parks is nice, but if you want to go to Downtown Disney, your only option is to go in the evening. Taking a cab ride or shuttle over to the Downtown Disney area will run you about $15-18 one way. There are no free shuttle services to the airport, so a cab ride will cost you about $40-45 one way while a shuttle is $21 per person. There are also no free shuttle services to SeaWorld or the Universal Parks, so you are looking at shuttle prices of about $18-23 per person. Food-- For some reason, it does not appear that you are supposed to order outside food to this hotel. When we checked in, we were told to ignore any pizza flyers. We did order room service one night (food was fine, but a little pricey), and tried to order Dominos pizza another night. We ordered the Dominos pizza online, and when the pizza guy finally got to the hotel, he said something like \"Did you order online? We aren't supposed to deliver here, so I got confused with which hotel it was.\" From then on, we made sure we were in a location that we could eat both lunch and dinner.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daytona Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201c3 C's for leisure and business travelers\u201d", "Author": "biyahetayo", "ReviewID": "UR91017693", "Content": "Why 3 C's? Convenience, Comfort and Cleanliness My family (4) and family friends (5) came to Orlando for a brief vacation in a last minute decision. Looking for a decent hotels/suites I researched thru internet, this impressed me the most for the affordability and the 3 C's I consider when vacationing. Convenience: Walking distance across this hotel are CVS, 7-Eleven, gas station, pizzas and restaurants. The hotel is only a few miles to Disney, Sea World, Universal Studio and shopping to Orlando Premium Factory Outlet is pretty close. In and out to I-4 highway is somewhere a mile (at exit 68). If you want a fine restaurant, Caribe Royale Hotel of Orlando is right at the back of your suite (walking distance) with 3 finest restaurants you can find in Orlando. Comfort: Bedroom and living room are spacious. With two full size bed in your bedroom and a separate living room with wider sofa bed/sleeper, you can fit a total of 6 adults in your suite. Both rooms have 42\" Flat Screen TV's and plenty of huge drawers where you can store all your stuff. The living room has a dining or office table with internet access, chairs, microwave, refrigerator and coffee dispenser. A privacy door between the bedroom and living room gave us the best comfort when my children were watching tv/movies and playing video games with their friends anytime. Cleanliness: A very busy suite/hotel yet they maintain the high standard of cleanliness and hospitality. The rooms are well-maintained, no bad odor, spotless linens and towels. During our daily free breakfast I noticed the employees are professionally and presentably dressed, quick food replenishment, they worked harmoniously and very polite. With so many people coming in and out during breakfast, the dining tables, chairs and floors are amazingly clean at all times, My children couldn't refrain from giving constant tips every time we had breakfast, employees deserved this extra reward from us. My family and friends admire the hard work of these employees, they are the facade of this business. I talked to some visitors in that hotel, their only complain was the key card entry to the their room. Just like what I experienced on my first day, I have to go back and forth twice to the receptionist to rectify the key problem. Technical personnel fixed it instantly. This doesn't prevent me from giving the best review in my opinion.

My boyfriend and I stayed for 9 nights. The Staff was the most friendliest I have ever dealt with! We were greeted with a smile and \"How are you\" every time we walked in the door! The rooms were nice and large enough for the 2 of us! The king bed we had was very comfortable! I checked for bedbugs as I know this is a growing problem and did not find any! I am a Health Inspector by profession so this was very important to me. The small refrigerator and microwave in our room was a great convenience. We had a problem when we used the dryers in the 4th floor laundry room as they did not work and we spent the money to use them but the staff was very accomadating when I went to them with the problem. They had the housekeeper dry our clothes and then brought them up to our room. The Shuttle service to the parks was great not a small van but a bus that was very comfortable! The only other problem we encountered was that the food for the breakfast buffet was lukewarm at best and again this was important because of what I do for a living so after 4 days of this we decided to eat elsewhere! We had the free breakfast included with our stay so we were dissappointed that this was a problem. The Management really needs to do something about this and I hope they do if they read this review. The housekeeping staff was great! We had a small problem with our safe in our room but it was fixed within 10 minutes! Overall this Hotel is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone but I would think about getting the free breakfast if it is something you would like to have included with your stay here! The only other thing I was dissappointed with was the charge of $8.99 for the high speed internet service. Most Hotels will include this at no charge or provide free wi-fi.

The fact that it comes with a free breakfast buffet is an added benefit. I really don't know why people bash the buffet, which is FREE. My only wish is that they would have fresh fruit and not the tropical fruit salad. But everything else was hot and continuously being refreshed. Two things about the room that I didn't like were that the toilet was behind the bathroom door in an awkward position and the flip lock on the hotel room door was very low. We had our 4 year old with us and she would have EASILY been able to open the door had someone come knocking in the middle of the night. We solved this by taking the SUPER heavy coffee table and placing it in front of the door. (Might have been a fire hazard but I was willing to take that risk.)

I inquired at the front desk about getting a cart since we had cases of water & other heavy items and they paged housekeeping to bring one. 45 minutes (and several inquiries) later, I gave up and carried everything to our room without the cart. When we arrived in our room, one of the first things you notice is the security deadbolt that was dangling broken from the door. My father (being the type of person he is) used his swiss army knive and put the lock back on the door. The other thing I noticed were the long back hairs on the bathroom floor, in the bathtub and around the toilet. I know that people aren't perfect so we swept them up with a towel. One of the perks of choosing this hotel was the free breakfast buffet that is offered. I guarantee that I have learned from this lesson and will never even consider that a reason for choosing a hotel in the future. The free breakfast in the morning was less than appetizing. Every day that we attempted to eat downstairs the scrambled eggs were so undercooked that it looked like they were in a cheese sauce. One of the days there was some sort of ham with pineapples swimming in grease. Of the 6 nights that we stayed at the hotel we had to do our own housekeeping chores 4 of those nights. The only reason that housekeeping was done on 2 of the days is because I specifically told the front desk that we needed it cleaned at 8:30 in the morning. There were 3 days that we arrived back at the hotel after 4:30 and housekeeping still had not shown up. Then it was a hassel to track down a housekeeper, exchange our towels & coffee cups and even take out our own trash. The only time we went out to use the pool, the music on the outdoor speakers were so loud that you couldn't have a conversation. Complaining to the front desk only prompted them to turn the music up louder. When I go on vacation, I don't expect everything to be absolutely perfect, but with the amount of hotel competition in the Orlando area you expect hotels to go above & beyond. I certainly do not expect to have to clean my own room and be a housekeeper (I do that enough when I'm not on vacation).", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nassau, Bahamas", "Title": "\u201cOMG!

The hotel staff were very friendly and worked very hard to make our stay an enjoyable one. Parking was free. There is a shuttle that takes you to and from the Disney parks but we chose to rent a car and drive ourselves to avoid the crowds and come and go when we wanted. In the lobby, there is a \"ticket\" desk which is really a time share rep in disguise. We did agree to get our tickets from them and saved a fair amount of money. It cost us a few hours early on Sunday at a time share presentation. BVS included a hot breakfast for free every morning. There was a fruit/yogurt/cereal bar, a hot buffet of pancakes, scrambled eggs, ham/bacon, oatmeal/cream of wheat. A cook on duty was able to make fried eggs and toast/bagel to order. The restaurant was extremely busy from 9-10am but when we went earlier, it was quieter. Lots of tour groups seem to stay here so timing your breakfast before they arrive in the restaurant is helpful. The rooms were comfortable. Lots of space for a family of four. The cleanliness was OK...I would have liked to see a bit better job of vacuuming and some the bed linens were a bit worn but they were clean. The beds were new, high top and comfy. The down comforter was nice. One child slept on the pull out couch which was a bit lumpy. Two large flat screen TV's helped to keep the peace between our kids. The fridge/microwave allowed us to do some shopping at the nearby Wal-mart and stock up on snack foods,drinks and lunch items which helped to cut our costs for food (which can be considerable at the Disney parks). There was LOTs of storage spacke for clothes in the big dressers. It would have been nice to have a few more hangers in the closets and hooks in the bathrooms. The sink outside of the bathtub/toilet room made getting ready in the morning easier for everyone. I did use the laundry room and it could use some work. It was a bit dirty, the machines were run down (two dryers were out of order) and having to buy the laundry soap down the hall in the gift shop was a pain (I brought my own). The hotel was generally quiet except when guests were returning from the parks late at night and thought it was OK to yell down the halls. However, the rooms near the main road were insulated well enough not to hear the traffic. The kids used the pool once but it wasn't necessary with the Disney waterparks so close.

Selections every morning included eggs, potatoes, grits, oatmeal, a meat, a fruit, yogurt and dry cereals. Large variety of drinks included the typical breakfast selections as well as sodas. Also to be had each morning was either pancakes or french toast. Meat selections were either link sausage, bacon or ham. (Only one kind each morning). There were also small donuts available. You could also have made to order omlets. The only things that could have made it better would have been gravy and biscuits and/or toast. My mom and her friend who travelled with us ate lunch in the hotel restaurant and ordered burgers. Mom reported it was one of the best burgers she ever ate. The hot tub did not work one night but it was working later in the week. If you are travelling with a group of 5 or more, and some of you are required to sleep on the fold out sofa, note that you will hear every sound made in the hall. The doors to the rooms do not close easily....they slam and some folks don't seem to realize how far the sound of slamming doors and their voices carry. I slept in both the bedroom and on the sofa different nights during the trip. As long as you are in the bedroom you will hardly hear any noise. I did fill out a comment card suggesting that signs requesting that guests observe a quiet time between 11 pm and 7 am be posted. I think that might help the sofa sleepers. Shuttle service to Disney offered. My mom and her friend decided to visit Animal Kingdom one day and went out to meet the last bus returning to the hotel for the day and there was no room for them. They were told to call the hotel and request another bus. When one didn't arrive they eventually caught a cab. Upon returning to the hotel they went to the desk and explained what happened and were promptly refunded their cab fees. Very good, acceptable resolution to the complaint. We had need for internet and it posted a charge of 8.99 per day for wi-fi, we agreed to pay the charges and got access, however, the charges did not appear on the final bill.

The line gets a little packed but mainly because few people notice the buffet is also on the other side.

Short drive to other restaurants like Golden Corral, McDonald's, etc. plus the outlets. Overall, a great visit!!!

A door separated a bedroom with 2 queen beds and a small living room which allowed the kids to maintain their early bedtimes without being disturbed by the grownups. The excellent price we found on mousesavers.com ($89/night) included a full breakfast each morning (which was served early so we could arrive at the Disney parks on time), and free parking. The hallways were a bit loud at night but the living room was a good buffer for the bedroom. The condition of the rooms was fine with the exception of a broken faucet handle the day we arrived (it was repaired the day we notified the front desk) and a lack of detail cleaning (there was an old pacifier on the floor by the bed).

There is a small smoking area off to one side in front of the building and most people put their cigarette butts in the trash but a few slobs left some butts on the ground. The room was clean although the carpet and arm chair in the bedroom have seen better days. The beds were comfortable and the lights in both the bedroom and living area were adequate. The in room safe is a good size so you can actually store stuff in it. The refrigerator and microwave are in the living area and there are drawers where you can store snacks. The freezer did not freeze the water placed in it but maybe the thermostat was down too low. The hotel has a mini store where you can purchase beverages and microwaveable stuff (the store does not sell books). There is a CVS and a 7-11 directly across the street but the street is actually the highway and I did not see crosswalks. I did cross the highway on two separate occasions. There are two coin operated laundry facilities on the property. One is located on the first floor and the other is on the 4th floor. It costs 1.25 to wash and 1.25 to dry a load. The mini store does sell laundry detergent and dryer sheets. The breakfast buffet consisted of scrambled eggs, potatoes, grits and oatmeal. The breakfast meats rotated daily with ham, bacon and sausage. Pancakes and french toast sticks also rotated daily. Fried eggs are available as well as toasted bagels and toast. In addition, there are mini donuts, yogurt (served in a huge bowl), cold cereal and oranges. I think one day there was canned pears but the only fresh fruit available everyday was oranges. The coffee was not too bad. You are not supposed to remove food from the breakfast serving area but you can take your coffee as there are paper cups for the beverages. Overall, the breakfast was adequate. I did eat at the restaurant one evening since they hotel gave a voucher for 15% off. Again, the food was just ok. I had French onion soup, a ceasar salad with grilled chicken and soda. With tax, tip and discount the bill was $21.07. The hotel does offer a free shuttle service to Disney parks but there is limited shuttle service. There are only two morning and two afternoon departures to the parks and two returns in the evening. When the park is open later than usual, there is generally an extra pick up after the parking closing. However, you are advised to give yourself 30 minutes to get back to the bus if you are in Magic Kingdom so you will not be able to hear the music that accompanies the fireworks but you can still see the fireworks from the parking lot. In addition, there is only one return from Downtown disney and that is at 11:20 p.m. I had arrived at the hotel and planned on spending the afternoon having lunch at Beaches and Cream and then head to Downtown Disney but I missed the first afternoon departure and the second was scheduled for 4:00. The hotel called a cab but in actuality they called a car service and it cost $21.00 to go from the hotel to Disney Boardwalk hotel. I returned to the hotel by taking Disney transportation to Hollywood Studios to catch the evening shuttle back to the hotel. I prearranged transportation to Sea World with Mears but learned that there is a public bus that you can catch at the ticket and transportation center in Disney and it costs $2. I don't know how late the bus runs but I did see the bus at night when returning from the Magic Kingdom. My hotel rate was from a one day sale so I got a decent rate for my four night stay.

I was not aware of this until my daughters and I were walking to the pool and I was \"suckered\" in with \"Do you have your tickets to Disney World?\" Of course they are very friendly until you figure out what is up, then not so much. We got accosted by whomever was behind that desk every morning on our way to breakfast. We just smiled and said \"no thanks\" and kept walking. Our room was comfortable, cleaned every day, and we had plenty of towels. The fold-out couch wasn't the most comfortable, but the kids did ok with it. We all had plenty of room and having 2 tv's was a huge plus. It was also very nice having a fridge available to keep water bottles cold and leftover food. There is a CVS across the street, the kids and I walked over a couple times to buy supplies and snacks. I also thought they charged a bit much for internet access, but after researching other hotels, found this is pretty universal. We did enjoy our stay, and it was very convenient and close to all the attractions. The breakfast buffet was pretty much the same food every day, but it was hot and saved us a lot of money since we didn't have to buy a meal for the 5 of us to start the day. We stayed 6 nights, and I made sure to leave a tip for our housekeeper, who made sure to thank me when she saw us coming or going from our room. We would definitely stay again!", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Great Price\u201d", "Author": "dhazelett2", "ReviewID": "UR51877341", "Content": "Very clean, friendly and close to the attractions.

Think they need servicing, or else we just picked 2 bad dryers, b/c even with two cycles...our clothes were still pretty wet. We complained to the front desk, and they gave us our quarters back.

I feel we had a great deal (thanks to a tip on the mousesavers.com website) at $99. a night. The location is great: it is about 5 minutes to the entrance to Disney World, and also close to the restaurants and shopping, making it very convenient. There aren't too many hotels closer to the parks (even those in Downtown Disney aren't closer, not to mention more expensive). All the rooms have been redone recently so everything looks nice and clean, nothing outdated. The one-bedroom suite has a living room area, with a large flat-screen tv, a fridge, a micro-wave oven and coffe-maker. The bathroom with exterior sink/vanity separates from the bedroom area. The bedroom is cozy with high-quality linens, extra cushions, and very comfy beds (even the kids noticed...) and a 2nd flat-screen tv.

You could also order your eggs and toasts or bagels. There are free shuttles to the parks, but I was glad we had rented a car for more flexibility (they did not seem to run very often). The pool was nice and clean but not very big (in March, there was very little people there, even if the water was heated) with enough lounging chairs and palm trees in the background. We had a problem one night: there was almost no hot water. We called and their response was as it should be. They apologized and said they would send someone check the boiler right away and sure enough, 15 minutes later, there was plenty hot water. What didn't I like ? Not much. Like many Orlando hotels, it's located on a busy road . There is not many trees and you have a view .. on the road. Also, you can hear a bit of the trafic noise even on the 7th (and last) floor.

For $79.95 we got a 2 queen suite; the living room has a small couch, chair, desk & office chair, and breakfront with microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom sink is outside the bathroom, in the short hall between the bedroom and living room. Really nice decor, 2 flat screen TVs, marble sink counter, wonderful beds. I would note that the rooms are a little on the small side. The heated pool was actually warm; you can order food poolside. One note for management - they have yet to replace the outdoor key-card gate to the pool area, and it is in bad shape (dangerous pointy metal at bottom). It's a little odd that, to access to the pool area, you either go through the restaurant or go outside, past people waiting for the shuttle bus, and then to the pool. The breakfast was nice - scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, waffles, muffins, donuts, cereals, canned mixed fruit, etc. You can also order poached or over easy eggs, toast and bagels at the counter. We had no problem with crowds but I can imagine in the summer there would be a line backing up at the counter. Oh, yes - real plates and utensils - no foam plates or plastic forks! Decent sized fitness room with 2 treadmills, stairmaster and nice multi-station weight machine. There's also a game room, but some of the games weren't functioning properly (we were reimbursed). The elevators are really nice and super fast! This has got to be one of the very best values in Orlando, particularly if you like the suite idea. I would guess prices might rise now that the renovation is done. (www.mousesavers has special rate codes, although it's sometimes cheaper just using AAA.) The location is great for WDW, etc. - centrally located, close to Downtown Disney, too; about 12 minutes from Magic Kingdom. 5 minutes from Premium Outlets. If you can't book here, another hotel with suites that I like is Comfort Suites Maingate East - not separate rooms but one room with a small divider wall, sofa/coffee table and wet bar with microwave and refrig. The other nice suite hotel is Doubletree - near Downtown Disney, which has two BIG separate rooms (and free continental breakfast if you book through www.mousesavers.com).

Mini-fridge and microwave very handy. Free breakfast buffet every morning. Laundry room has coin-operated washing machines and dryers. Well stocked gift shop. Arcade game room for kids. Very spacious and comfortable lobby. Nice pool and hot tub. Full time concierge service. Free shuttle service to Disney parks. Awesome room service food. Nice restaurant available for lunch and dinner. CVS drug store, Pizza take-out, Chinese buffet and Ponderosa restaurant located right across the street. Cons; It's hard to complain about a $89 deal in the overpriced land of Disney. If I were to complain, here are my thoughts; Sleeping in the sofa bed \"room\", the walls are paper thin. I could hear the opening and closing of every door in the vicinity. The crying kids next door with their yelling parents is not the best wake-up call. It was also very loud every time they flushed their toilet or used their sink. The free breakfast is worth what you pay for it. The bus service to Disney leaves at 9:00 am to some parks. With the parks opening at 9:00 am, you cannot get the jump on the crowds. Even though the hotel is a couple of miles from Disney property, our bus trip back from the park took over an hour, as we had to stop for pick-ups at each of the Disney parks. After a long, hot day, that return trip seems excrutiatingly long. The lobby has two computers with Internet access that can be used for $10 per hour (hint: use the monitor on the left-the monitor display on the right is broken). Crossing the road on foot to get to the drug store and restaurants across the street is VERY dangerous! My kids and I were nearly hit by a car that was weaving between lanes and FLYING.

Also, the pool was dirty. Not just bugs and leaves. It had black slime on the edge of the tile where the water level is. Also it didn't smell as if the water was properly chlorinated. Asked the front desk because I was worried about the water safety (I have two small children) and was told pool is maintained daily but they'd send out someone to check. Maintenance guy did come out sometime later. He didn't dip the pool, check the water or anything. He just picked up wet towels and put them away.

Pros: Great customer service. THey called us a week prior and asked if we needed golf reservations, tickets , etc, and confirmed our reservation. THey also sent an email a few days prior to reconfirm. Check in went smoothly. Breakfast was good in our eyes. Can't understand the complaints about the food. It's free folks. Come on! THere were eggs made to order, sausage, fruit , cereal, yogurt, breads, danishes, etc, juice, coffee, etc, all fine food. Got a letter when we returned thanking us for our stay. Nice touch customer service. People will remember this. Never in my 46 years has a hotel contacted us so much to see if we needed anything or to remind us of an upcoming visit. Rooms were clean, beds were on the soft side but we slept well. No outside noise except the loud toilets flushing. Very close to Disney world maingate. WE stayed on the road the hotel is on and within 3-4 mins , we were on Disney property. Very convenient. THey also have a free shuttle for folks not wanting to pay the $10 parking fee. Not sure of the times. All I do know is they share the shuttle with Caribe Royale and there are at least 3 going and 3 return times for the shuttle. Cons: THe hotels pool and hottub were dirty with dead bugs and leavesin the pool and hot tub when we went out to swim at 6:30 pm. Maybe the pool boy already left for the day? Again, loud toilet, and rooms were a little worn and tatered. Our non smoking room smelled of stale smoke. Since we had an ok from the desk before we even booked the room, to use the Caribe Royale pool ( Next door sister resort to Buena Vista) we decided to walk arcross the parking lot to the Caribe Royale. Boy were we glad we did. Absolutely beautiful pool. Waterfall, slide, nice , huge pool. THe kids really enjoyed their time there. Nicest pool I have ever swam in. THe photos don't do it justice. Advice, watch your little ones coming off the slide. The current from the waterslide is strong and pulls them away from the edge of the pool. Had to grab an arm of a little one and bring her to safety because the parents were in their sun chairs while their child was in the pool alone. BIG NO NO FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!Tips: My advice , stay at Buena Vista Suites for the free breakfast, use Caribe Royale's pool and book on Mousesavers.com, much cheaper rate than the hotel site. WE even saw Caribe Royale folks walking over to the Buena Vista for the free breakfast as they don't offer a free one. Hope this helps someone.

This experience was the exact opposite. The hotel has either changed since I last visited or March/April is not the time to stay here. It was dominated by field trips. I like high school kids, and I was on many high school trips. That said, they don't create a very family friendly environment, even when they're on their best behavior. Additionally, we had a very bad event occur while at the hotel. While I won't go into the details, I will say that bad things happen at hotels all the time. It's not what happens, but how management responds that matters. The management was condescending (supervisors were great, but the head manager was horrific), uncaring, uncommunative, and downright rude. It's clear that our business and our experience was unimportant to the manager, and as a result, I would never stay in this hotel again. About the hotel itself: It's very close to disney, it has two separate rooms (which amounts to an 8x8 living room w/o a window which has a door separating it from the bedroom/bathroom), which is why we've stayed in the past. The hotel has two years of additional wear, with no updates. There were some pretty major issues with the room that were just cobbled together, and the hotel is in major need of an update. It's fairly dirty in general at this point, mostly due to aging. The quality of the breakfast buffet has gone way downhill. The fruit on the buffet bar is canned; the eggs are undercooked and runny, and all of the heated pastries (waffles, pancakes) are pre-packaged and often cold, hard, and inedible. The only saving grace is the over easy eggs that are cooked when requested. Regardless, it was nice to leave for each day with a full stomach.

Put up do not disturb sign and when we left the room at 3:30 there was a note saying maid had been there and if we needed clean towels etc to contact the front desk. The maid cart was not on our floor at that time. I expected no cleaning that day. However I had forgotten something and came back to the room about 15 min later to find the maid had returned and was cleaning our room. Staff was extremely friendly. Breakfast was adequate and beats paying for a meal outside the hotel! Kids mostly at from cereal bar. hubby and I had the eggs cooked to order. arrive to breakfast early- it gets crowded by 9. pool was just a pool but being at WDW most of the time, we only used it 3x for about an hour and that was sufficient for the kids. It's extremely close to WDW- AK being the closest to the hotel and very easy access coming and going. daughter clogged the toilet with too much tp 2x (how embarrassing!) called maintenance and they came both times within 5 min to fix problem. got internet rate of $89 per night. would definitely stay again.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cStinky rooms and they try to bill for broken pictures\u201d", "Author": "billmd", "ReviewID": "UR5512573", "Content": "When we went into our room it smelled like someone had been smoking but it turned out to be the cleaner they use.

The outlet mall is really close though, that was a nice break! The Caribe Royal, it's sister property, is a magnificent property and right next door - I've stayed there before and was impressed! The Buena Vista needs a facelift. The linens and furnshings are very worn and need improvements. We called for a crib (turned out to be a playpen) and it came immediately. The bathroom is a decent size and the extra sinks were a big plus. We were in an end room which gave us a bit more space - rooms sizes are excellent. Staff was ok, but not overly attentive. There was laundry on the first floor which was great to use instead of dry cleaning.

This hotel does have a nice lobby and the staff is friendly but it's pretty obvious that this is a very old hotel that must have changed hands a million times.

The refigerator was falling out of the cabinet but the little microwave and sink was nice to have. The phone lines went out from a lightning strike while we were there and the staff did not let us know about it, which could have been a disaster if we didn't bring our own alarm clock. They could have slipped a note under the door about the phone lines, that's not asking too much. Didn't use the pool since it was raining, but it looks nice. The complimentary breakfast was just \"average\". They have canned fruit, instead of fresh and it is pretty much the same everyday. The silverware was all bent up and the cups were all styrofoam. Be careful of the shuttle to the parks.They stop at the property next door but blew us off twice. Be aggrressive with the staff if that happens, they can phone the bus company to send another one. Also, be careful about where to catch the \"return\" bus because they make you wait in the middle of the park's parking lot on lanes 9-10.

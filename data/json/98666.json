We tried to check in early, knowing that we would be returning late in the evening, but could not. We returned to the hotel at 11:30 p.m. to find a lobby full of people waiting on their rooms. The hotel was fully booked, and the rooms were not cleaned yet. The person behind the desk was rude and condescending, like it was our fault that the maid hadn't cleaned our room yet. It was 1:00 in the morning before we finally got to go to our room. In the room, the shower fixture was broken (I managed to fix it so I could take a shower), there were damaged and missing tiles in the shower as well. To top it all off, there was a nest of crickets living in the curtains. What fun to listen to all night. These crickets were huge! The only thing we got out of this was a hard time and a form appology letter from the manager. I would never stay at this hotel again and would not reccomment it to anyone!", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, AB", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Customer Service!!!\u201d", "Author": "TEEZ_R_US", "ReviewID": "UR8407684", "Content": "We were supposed to origionally stay at the Best Western, Market Centre, but their a/c was broken down, so they relocated us to The Quality Inn for the same rate. We went to check in, and there was a little bit of confusion to why we were checking in there under Best Western. Once it got sorted out, we checked in our hotel room. We were a little surprised, as the hotel lobby was nice, but dated. The front desk people were really nice. All of the rooms' doors are on the outside, so you go from hot and muggy, into a nice air conditioned room. Right away, you can tell it was older. The way up to the room wasn't very clean, and the room itself was not too impressive. The walls are thin, and you can pretty much hear a conversation from outside, and people walking from the floor above. The hotel is overdue for renovations, but as for the customer service, I give that a 5 star. The free shuttle service to downtown is a bonus that we liked. Free continental breakfast was really good, with lots of choices - make your own waffles in the shape of the Texas state. Breads, yogurt, cereals.....juices...danishes. We had no idea what to do as tourists, and again, the front desk helped us beyond our expectations. We would stay there again, once it gets renovated. ; )", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cA Mixed Review\u201d", "Author": "TinaMarieTexas", "ReviewID": "UR8018267", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel twice this month, once for the apparel market and once for the gift show. Each time I booked two rooms - one for me and one for an employee. My room was clean and the bed was comfortable both times. I had a hard time turning on the water in the sink and the toilet barely flushed. I couldn't help but think about the very dark rug with flowers on it and the dark striped bedspread. I didn't want to walk on the rug barefoot and I kicked the bedspread off. The first time the rate was very cheap compared to other hotels, but the second time it was alot more. The first time the dining room (breakfast only) had food on the carpet and a very limited menu. The second time it was cleaner, but still very limited - but it was included with the room charge. We were told that next market they will serve a full breakfast and still not charge extra. The employee had a smoking room each time and the second time her ashtrays were not emptied and although she received clean towels, the used towels were left on the floor. Would I stay there again? Probably not. After reading about the safety issues and theft issues - I don't think so. The people at the front desk were friendly and they provided a shuttle to the Trade Center. We found it was faster to walk over to the Double Tree next door and take the regular market shuttle.", "Date": "June 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cPretty Shabby\u201d", "Author": "tgrlilly77", "ReviewID": "UR7628045", "Content": "My husband and I along with our sister & brother-in-law stayed here for a 3 night stay. Honestly I wouldn't come back. It was overall an OK experience, but the cleanliness and general upkeep of the hotel was something to be desired. It wasn't dirty, but definitely not well tended to. Management? It didn't look like there was any, at least not anyone who cared about the general ambience of the hotel. Price was OK, though we stayed somewhere a bit cheaper in Plano that was MUCH nicer. My husband & I enjoyed the pool, but again, not very clean. Staff was friendly as far as we experienced, especially Casey! Thanks. I completely agree with the other reviews about the hotel desperately needing remodeling. Come on Quality Inn Corporates! If you want better business, you gotta do something to help yourselves out...especially for downtown Dallas.

Thought it might have gotten better. Staff is rather disorganized and not very professional. Market shuttle completely undependable. (I had to take cabs every time over to the market center). Seven of us waited for the shuttle to pick us up at market and no one ever came. When we arrived at hotel via cab, we learned the driver was in the bar. He came out of the bar (I'm not saying he was drinking), looking like he hadn't shaved in 2 days. The poor kid at the counter that night was completely overwhelmed with check-ins and phone calls but handled it with a smile. Paint peeling off tiles in in bathroom. Maid did not empty ashtrays, and one of the pillowslips had dried blood on it! My commode tank overflowed, but they were good about getting it fixed.

I stayed at this hotel for three days to attend a anamation convention, I check into my room then left to return to the convention.

I immediatly contacted the manager to report this and also the police. The manager said they would ck the key log and get back to me. This was Fri. evening I did not hear anythig back from the manager until I looked for him on Monday before ck out time. His responds was that i must not had close the door completely. Everyone knows hotel doors are heavy and usually easily close by themselves, I did not have any problems opening or closeing door. The manager offered me nothing for my lost he said it must have been an other guest well i also had a X-Box system in that room and it was not taken. I think that is very weired that a quest theif would leave behind a x-box. Other than this experience my stay was good the shuttle driver where good, as was the room service.

The Hotel arranged a driver to take us into Dallas in their shuttle van and pick us up later. They also picked us up from the Greyhound depot when we arrived and drove us back there when we left.

It was an experience of some good things with some truly awful things. It got off to a bad start when the front desk said there was no record of our reservation, despite it being booked 6 months previously and confirmed with our travel agent. The young woman at the desk seemed skeptical of the fact that we had reservations and only when I provided documentation did she approach her superior. After this hiccup we were assigned our room and went to it via a very smelly hall and elevator, the latter had empty beer bottles in the ceiling, which remained there for our stay. The walkway to our room was littered with beer bottles and cigarette butts (it must be pointed out that there was a lot of football fans staying in the hotel that weekend). The room itself was pleasant and comfortable. The bed was exceptionally good but when we went to enter it for the evening we found a used Kleenex under the sheet. This was bad enough, but when we returned from a day's sightseeing two nights later, there was a soiled female G string atop our TV cabinet. We contacted the front desk who simply said 'Oh!' and we were told to leave the G string on the walkway for the maintenance man to collect. We preferred not to even speculate what had transpired in our absence for the day, renting rooms for prostitutes came to mind given the locale is a little 'industrial' with many bail bondsmen nearby. Our last night there made the thin walls become evident with a couple having very noisy sex next door, which accentuated the prostitute theory. We were told of the free internet access but the terminal was broken for 2 of our 3 nights. The front desk reported to us it was 'not working' when we approached them and had a shrug of the shoulders when we asked when it would be fixed. Having said all of this the breakfasts were superb and the complimentary shuttle was great. We had a driver who was exceptionally friendly, courteous and helpful. I only wish I could recall his name as he was the bright spot of our stay. Whether to recommend the place to others or not, I really don't know. Our whole stay in Dallas was punctuated by bad luck from the moment we touched down in DFW, so this could have been part of said bad luck.", "Date": "October 16, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quality Inn Dallas Market Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98666-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$79*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1955 Market Center Blvd.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75207</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "98666", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/83/8e/838e9f14d2ef00122f2a443b1aef3f611large.jpg"}}

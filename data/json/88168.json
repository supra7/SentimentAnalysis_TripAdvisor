Bathrooms are spacious. While the rooms are not spacious, the beds are comfortable enough and the view is decent. The only negative I have with the facility is the lack of above-average sound proofing. For a hotel boasting the nightly price tag the Hyatt Regency does, one would think the doors would block hall sound better. Light sleepers should take note of this. My husband is a light sleeper and suffered a poor night's sleep due to hall noise and we were at the end of the hall. The work-out facility seemed very nice with a good variety of machines and chilled towels.

We arrived early on Saturday (around 2pm) and were promptly greeted and checked in to room 1524. Check in was simple, friendly and efficient. Room: Newly remodeled with updated furnishings, linens, etc. It was immaculately clean, the safe, keyboard, fridge, ice bucket, were all easy to find. The bed was very comfy and there were plenty of pillows, something that is rare any more. The room is equipped with TV, access to the internet, recycling bins, a fantastic desk/work station, etc. The end of the desk that faced the window had a charging station as part of the desk - hookups and charging for everything from composite cables to USB ports for charging. I travel for business and rarely see this feature - ideal for the business traveler, or those of us who travel with multiple devices. Bar: Great drink service - friendly bar tender - Patrick was a hoot! We did have to ask/remind the staff that we wanted to order food. Once the order was in it arrived quicker than expected and everyting was excellent (Pep Pizza, Turkey Clubs, Fries and salad). We were able to charge to our room or pay at time of service. We stopped back about 10:30 after the race and enjoyed a few more beverages before heading up to the room. The bar was pretty crowded and service was slow as there were only two bartenders. Restaurants: Subway, Starbucks and a Pizza/Italian Fast Food place were all open at different hours. Subway had good service and fresh food. The pizza joint wasn't open until the evening and Starbucks was open on Sunday morning but nearly out of pastries by 9:00. There are two additional, more upscale restaurants that we weren't able to try. Location: This hotel is in an ideal location for pretty much any activity downtown. The city is incredibly clean and very lively. Within a couple blocks walk any direction from the hotel were plenty of dining choices. From Steak n Shake to Ruth Cris and everything in between you would never go hungry! Walk to the stadium/convention center was 10 - 15 minutes, incredibly easy and safe. Parking: We opted to self park - $22/day. Navigating the garage was a bit of a challenge and it's not easy to get turned around when the garage is full and you hit a dead end. If you're there during peak time I would recommend Valet. The other half of our party did this for $30/day. Overall, this hotel was a great deal for an event weekend ($128/night booked through a 3rd party site) - having stayed at this hotel I would be willing to pay anywhere between my rate up to $175/$200/night. The only frustrating part of our stay were, as others have mentioned, the elevators. There were a lot of people in this hotel - between some college banquet awards, a wedding, St. Patty's guests and race guests and waiting for an elevator took some time and become increasingly frustrating as people pushed and shoved wanting to get on the next elevator. When there are fewer people, this may not be an issue - but for us it was really the only problem with our stay. We will definitely stay again.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmette, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location!\u201d", "Author": "Augiethelab", "ReviewID": "UR125527072", "Content": "This wonderful, updated Hyatt with an imposing 20 story atrium is within walking distance of everything in this very \"happening\" smaller city.

My room had peeling wallpaper in a corner, scuffs on the wall, worn, cracked caulking in the shower & dirty tile grout - things you might accept in a motel during Spring Break, but not the standard for a decent business hotel. Again, hopefully these issues will be remedied during their current renovation. The location however, is first rate, smack in the middle of the compact downtown area and easily accessible to all the main venues.

We were excited to be within walking distance of the big mall and to Lucas Oil Stadium for the race. I have a chronic pain disorder and sometimes have to use a cane to help me along. After walking all day due to exploring downtown and the race....we decided to stop in the hotel bar for a cold drink. The place was hopping with people drinking and having a good time, most of them casually dressed in button down shirts, slacks or dresses. My wife and I had just come from the race in jeans and hooded sweatshirts (mind you we paid $200.00 a night for a room just as everyone else) I took a seat due to my hip bothering me, my wife continued to the bar. I watched her wait for 20 minutes, with no line in front of her stand at the bar and be completely invisible to the bartender. I went over to her and said \"let's go to bed\".

If not for priceline, I would never stay at a hotel like this. Even though it is a great hotel, the fact that parking is $30 a night and they charge for Wi-Fi, where every place in America has free wi-fi (starbucks, panera, gyms, malls, etc) shows that this company is just out to rip off there customers. I got the hotel room for $47 (plus tax). So for me, it was still a great deal. But out of principal, to have to pay $30 a night for parking when you are a guest is like going to a restaurant and then charging you extra to sit down at your dinner table. I have learned over my 7 years of using Priceline that the higher the star rating, the more you are charged for stuff you get for free at lower star hotels. Example, 2.5 star you get free breakfast, free Wi-Fi, free parking, etc. 4.0 star you pay for parking, breakfast and wi-fi. I bet at a 5 star, you have to put quarters in to get toilet paper. The main difference in the starts is the lobby area. The best room I ever stayed in was a 2.5 star Wingate hotel.

After a recent bad experience here, I feel obligated to balance the scales a bit. I\u2019ve stayed here twice and won't be back. The first time I stayed (last year), the front desk person was impersonal and disinterested. I'm a Diamond Gold Passport member, but received none of the personal attention or recognition I have come to expect from (and have received at) other Hyatt properties. I even had to ask for my Diamond amenity - that was a first for me. The young man behind the counter seemed put out that he had to do the minor paperwork required for that - and when the amenity finally arrived, the fruit provided was green and ineditble. I ended up throwing it away. Upstairs, the room was still dirty when we arrived and we had no towels. We were leaving to meet some friends, so we just called the front desk and requested service. When we got back 2 hours later, the room had still not been cleaned. In all it took over 3 hours to get housekeeping up to our room to finish cleaning it and supplying us with towels. The service in the restaurant at breakfast the next day was very slow. There was one waiter trying to service too many tables, and he appeared to be more concerned with something in the kitchen than providing service anyway. The food was mediocre at best. We were talking with some of the other people in the dining room (we all had plenty of time to kill) and they all had similar horror stories regarding their stays. The crappy elevators probably don't need any more comment, but here goes. They do take forever, which is amazing since the doors snap open and closed in a couple of seconds when they do finally arrive. If you are hypnotized from the long wait (and it's almost impossible NOT to be), and you do not immediately jump into the car, you can easily miss it and have to start your wait all over again. Considering how expensive this hotel is, and the fact that it is a Hyatt property, we expected much better. On subsequent visits to Indianapolis, we have opted for the Mariott complex just up the street, and we have been very satisfied there. Last month, however, we were meeting friends at a restaurant directly across the street from the Hyatt for our anniversary. To avoid having to rent a car, we opted to stay at the Hyatt again. What a mistake! We reserved a King size bed and asked for a low floor (to avoid having to use the elevator). Once again, I received no recognition of my Diamond GP status, until I pointed it out to the desk clerk. This time he offered the amenity, but, remembering the poor quality of the edible (or inedible) amenity on the previous visit, I opted for the GP points. The gentleman behind the counter unapologetically told us our room was on a high floor. When we got to our room, we found we had been assigned a room with two double beds! Not double Queens, double beds! The carpet was worn and stained, the TV screen was filthy and one of the lamps had a burned out bulb. When I complained to the front desk and requested the King size bed room we had reserved, I was told there were none available. My wife and I ended up having to sleep in separate beds on our anniversary! Back at the front desk, we were given a song and dance about how the room type is subject to availability and the young man whined about how they were under renovation. As if his excuses would matter to me! I even had to remind the gentleman that I was entitled to additional Gold Passport points since they were unable to accommodate me. He seemed annoyed that I kept referring to my Gold Passport membership. When I checked my account a couple of days later, neither the amenity points nor the bonus points were on the stay. I had to call customer service to get the bonuses. Needless to say, I have learned my lesson. One bad stay might be an anomaly, but two is a trend. Given that 100% of my experience with this hotel has been bad, I can only assume that all these positive reviews are being posted by shills for the hotel. Maybe the employees get a little something something for going online and providing positive feedback?

Kelsey, a young lady, checked me in. I was assigned to Room 902. Upon entering, I noticed that it was one of those adjoining rooms separated by a door. I immediately went back down and told Kelsey that I was not comfortable being in that type of room, so she gave me Room 816. As I was walking down the hall to room 816, I observed a group of high school (or college?) students running up and down the hall, being loud and boisterous, and they went into the room right next to where I would be staying. I felt that Kelsey put me in this room next to the rowdy students out of spite because I complained about not being comfortable with the first room. I went down to the front desk yet again. This time I spoke with Nick, a young manager. He was insistent that he could not accommodate me any further, so I asked him to cancel my reservation and that I would go next door to the Westin. As of yesterday (10/29) my bank account is still showing Hyatt Regency charges, but I will be sure to keep a close eye on this situation. While I cannot rate this hotel per se, because I did not stay there, I do want to comment on the hotel's design. The interior hallways overlook the lobby. There is only about a 3 foot railing, certainly not enough to keep some young reveler (or drunkard) from falling many, many stories to their deaths, landing on the lobby floor It is very scary, a very poor design. I might be willing to try another Hyatt Regency at some point but certainly not this one in Indianapolis.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice, but not for the price.\u201d", "Author": "BadRat", "ReviewID": "UR119420028", "Content": "Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Indianapolis Oct. 15 & 16, 2011. The hotel is going through a top to bottom renovation. The top four floors are finished and floors 16-12 are closed for renovation at this time. We stayed on the 11th floor while some friends stayed on the \"new\" 20th floor. Our old room was still nice and clean, spacious and comfortable. There was no real control of the room temperature, only the fan. (We like to sleep at 65, not happenening here.) The tub / shower was nice. There is no vent fan in the bathroom. The rooms are all adjoining and at 8:30am someone from the room connected to ours tried very hard to come into our room. This woke me from what was otherwise a very good nights sleep. The bed was comfortable and sheets nice with a high thread count. The room had a large flat screen TV with a fair number of channels. Our friend's \"new\" room only had a walk-in shower, no tub. The power went out to half their room, and there was no phone service. I guess they still have to work out the bugs. Overall the hotel was nice and clean with an excellent location. Downtown Indianapolis is beautiful with lots of shops and restaurants. Be forewarned, there is a bunch of major construction going on on several streets downtown. A lot of detours and closed sidewalks. It will be really nice when all the construction is finished for the Super Bowl. There are numerous nice hotels downtown and I'd compare prices. The Hyatt was pricy for what we got, but the wedding reception we attended was held in one of the hotel ballrooms.

The ceiling in the bathroom was the worst, I had to force myself to not look up. The floor of the tub was pretty bad, and fortunately they provided a rubber mat (which was in good condition, thank goodness). The rest of the room seemed fine. Beds and linens were clean. Looks like they updated the wardrobe/closet & coffee area in the past 5 years as these were relatively modern and seemed newer than the rest of the room. Carpets appeared OK, no big stains or anything that seemed unclean. The hotel is beginning some massive renovation project, starting with the top/22nd floor & working it's way down. So there is hope! The lobby & bar areas are very nice, clean, and modern in style. Staff, again, was great in all areas. Elevators are slow when there are conventions in town. If you ask for a lower floor you have better luck in getting up & down quicker (floor 5 is the lowest with rooms). There is a Starbucks in the lobby, along with a Subway & Pizza place. Very convenient & a big bonus! Starbucks is only open from 6am - 12 noon each day though, so when you need that 3pm pick-me-up it's hotel coffee.....there are other hotels nearby with Starbucks inside the lobby as well & they are usually open later. JW Marriott has a very large Starbucks with seating areas all around. All the hotels in the block are connected to the convention center via covered/inside walkways. It is oftena longer walk than going outside, but the option is there for rainy days - also nice if you are a lady with kong hair & want to avoid humidity & such before a long day in a convention booth! Lot's of places to eat & drink in downtown Indy, so the need for a car can be skipped if you have transport to/from the airport. Shuttles can take 30 min for transport, and the indy airport seems pretty good for security, during a large convention we made it through security in less than 10 min (would have been OK to arriv 1hour before flight, we arrived with 2 hr & had time to eat).", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cI love this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "CRMays", "ReviewID": "UR117814351", "Content": "This Hyatt has everything.

We arranged for a late departure, got to our room only to learn that we were locked out: the hotel had not processed the late stay arrangement. That took 20 minutes or more to get fixed. We were to be given complementary parking; on leaving, that also took even more time and required us to track down the organizer of our event, required her to track down the parking manager, and even then it took the staff lots of time to figure out how to get the computer to deduct the charge. Not exactly a speedy departure. The upkeep was also not good. The floor outside the elevator on our floor was not vacuumed for the entire time we were there (popcorn or peanut pieces all over). The towel dispensers in the restrooms for the conference attendees were not all refilled. The service in the hotel restaurant was also bad, the food for one diner arriving after everyone else had almost finished, despite repeated requests for it.

This Hyatt definitely has it. There are other hotels in the area too, but this one is great! I stayed here for a conference, so I also had the experience of being in the ballroom and several meeting rooms. My first impression was from finding how to check in from driving in. I pulled into the driveway and the valet told me to park in the garage under the building. It was the weirdest layout of any parking garage I've ever seen - like a maze with haphazard spots everywhere. It was a little confusing to navigate, but I got a spot close to the elevators with ease, once I found them! When I checked in, there was a person helping direct people to open front desk employees. The employee who helped me was very nice and honored my request to have a room without an adjoining door - I'm a light sleeper and those doors always make you hear the person next to you! I got a room that was down a hall, away from the elevators and the atrium. When I walked in, the set up was a little different than other Hyatts I've been to but it was nice! Big bed, desk, chair, TV, and decent sized bathroom. Maybe a little smaller than a normal Hyatt but still roomy enough. I was also pleasantly surprised to find a mini fridge in my room. My room was really quiet and I slept so well! I brought my white noise maker because I always sleep with it. I heard some traffic from outside but not much.

The meeting rooms were nice and the employees kept them clean and well stocked with water, paper and pens (and without trash) in between meetings. The ballroom was nice and the temperature was good there. Some rooms got a little hot or cold but it happens. I love that they had a pizza place, Subway, and Starbucks in the lobby, as well as a bar and restaurant. Very convenient for someone on a tight schedule. They also have a large gift shop with all sorts of stuff - except of course, what I needed! No stamps, and no books or magazines. Bummer on that.

It was VERY humid outside. The group I was with was very overheated and dehydrated from being outdoors all afternoon in the sun, and so it was with much anticipated temperature relief that we all checked into our rooms at the Hyatt Regency Capitol. The hotel was great, by the way; spotless, friendly, and reasonably priced with modern accommodations everywhere - super location too. Once in my room, I couldn't get cool enough fast enough - but unfortunately, found out I was doomed to stay that way. Opening the door to my room I expected a comforting wall of moving cool air when I stepped in. Instead I was hit with a wall of static warm stuffy air. Grrr - hate that. Most frustrating of all, I found myself stuck with one of those ridiculous placebo thermostats, you know, the kind that lets you think you're changing the temperature, but you never really do. It's the HVAC equivalent of a sugar pill. It was a fully modern, new high-tech thermostat, and it appeared you could dial any temperature range you wanted. The thermostat accepted my inputs for a temp in the 60's or even 50's, but the room temp never budged from 72.8 - period. Nothing I could do would actually chill down the room. Now 72.8 is fine for the elderly and 98 pound stick-people who always complain about the cold from the slightest puff of breeze, but us grown men who are not iron-deficient from farther northern parts need some real meat-locker style air conditioning on a hot day when it's 95 outside once in awhile. Why can't each person in each hotel room truly always have full temperature control, on demand. All the rooms my buddies were in were the same way, and they were really peeved too. When thermostats are rigged like this it is extremely annoying, because they appear to let you have more control than you do, so why can't the hotel just be honest about it. Either disable them, remove them, or put a sticker on there that states the system is rigged for a certain temperature. Then, say that on your website. So I know not to stay there. I would most definitely stay there again, just not in the summer. I'm sure the whole chintzy air conditioning thing was some sort of cost-saving least-people-complain setting, and probably hiding under a green label. It marred an otherwise extremely nice stay.

I informed them that I had decided to add a second day with a second confirmation number. He made it sound as if he he took care of it in their system. The room itself was clean. I did not have a view, but for the amount I paid, I really wasn't expecting one. The numbers in their phone directory were not correct. I called the number they listed for Valet and found it was for Housekeeping. They told me I had to call the front desk to have the valet get my car. They did not clean the toilet very well under the rim, and there were mold spots in the restroom. The picture of the pool makes it appear as if it could be a full size pool. The pool was small considering the size and price of the hotel. It was so crowded that it was basically just standing around in the pool as no one could really swim. All of the computers in the business center had notes taped on them stating the computers and printers were not working. On day two, my room key stopped working so I had to go get a new key. I called the front desk for the valet to get my car ready, but did not receive an answer. When I went to check out, there was only ONE person working the front desk at 11am on Monday. There was a line of a dozen guests all trying to check out. Not one of the FOUR kiosks where you can check in or out on your own were functioning, so everyone was forced to wait in line.

Despite that, we found it difficult to get to sleep because of the street noise we could hear inside our room. Although we were on the 19th floor, we could hear motorcycles racing on the street below the hotel until midnight. In fairness, there appeared to be a motorcycle convention in town, so the hotel may be quieter at other times. I was also disappointed by the bathroom in this hotel room. The rolled up vinyl bathmat by the tub was disgusting, and I expected, but did not find, a magnifying makeup mirror like most big city hotels provide. Although I appreciated the low voltage florescent lighting above the bathroom vanity, it was too dim for applying makeup. Overall, the room was comfortable, but had a dingy feeling.

They are doing construction on the plaza in front of the hotel so after I got off the shuttle it was a bit difficult to figure out how to get into the building. It was next to a mall and a very short distance from lots of restaurants, although the city appeared to close down after 6 PM. I checked in on Monday and stayed through Friday. Check in was easy, I was asked if I wanted a higher or lower floor and preferred higher. The lobby was very well maintained and the elevators were quick. I was on the top floor, #20, in the farthest room from the elevators. I wondered if these rooms were given to people paying less because the window in this room did not look outside but rather the inside of the hotel (it was like overlooking the inside of a mall because there was an office building attached to it and I could look into the offices. The two biggest drawbacks to this room were that you couldn\u2019t tell what the weather was outside and whether to bring an umbrella and that you could hear the lobby music from the hotel. Because I could hear music in my room at 10PM I called down and they lowered it. The room was very comfortable except for the deodorizer which I believed they used daily on the carpet, it was very fragrant and gave me a headache. A nice perk was that they gave you a small tube of toothpaste in the room. There was a small refrigerator in the room too. Because I was the last room on the floor it seemed that everyday I was the last room to be made up. I typically left my room early in the day to attend the conference and everyday when I returned at about 1 my room was still not made. On one occasion I had to call downstairs because they hadn\u2019t made up the room. On the second night of my stay at about 10:30 PM someone was turned on above the room that made the whole ceiling shake and rattle. It turns out that there were air regulators above my room that was used to vent the bathrooms in the building and the whole mechanism was quite noisy. The front desk did have an engineer come up and he told me that the air handlers were above my room and he would shut them off. (This happened again and again I called to have them shut off) The staff was very helpful and addressed any concerns I had quickly. Even to the point of calling me back days later to see if everything was going well. However, they never offered to change my room at any time, however the hotel could have been sold out as there were several conferences going on. The hotel does not have free internet service and spotty wifi service. You either have to connect hard wire to the hotel service and pay 9.99 a day or buy the T-mobile wifi service for the same price. Note that the T-mobile service had a number of dead spots and did not work in the conference rooms and when it did work service was slow. The gym was a typical gym for a hotel. It had several treadmills and ellipticals with some weight machines and dumbbells. Not fancy, but if you do a light workout it would probably be fine. There is the national Institute of Fitness and Sports nearby (about a 12 minute walk) that has all the equipment and weight trainer could need including an indoor trace and lots of aerobic classes. I only ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant but it was fantastic. The breakfast buffet was $14.00 and it included made to order omelets and lots of fresh fruit and breads.

I don't know if it was intentional or not but I feel like we were terribly misled regarding some of the fees and amenities. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt one and think \"maybe I didn't hear them right\" but when it happens to you three times, I think something shady is going on. For starters, they advertise self-parking for $20 and valet for $28 on their website. However, when you get there they tell you the $20 is only if you leave your car for 12 hours or more. Less than that and you have to pay an hourly rate. I was incredibly disappointed in this because I even called ahead to confirm the parking prices prior to our trip and there was no mention of in-and-out fees, just the $20 daily self park. When I spoke to the manager about this she claimed that this was b/c they use a City garage and have no control over thhe be rate and all the hotels in the area are on the same arrangement. That is not true. The previous year we stayed at the embassy suites across the street and paid $20 to self park and were able to go in-and-out as we pleased. That was strike 1. Next, the hotel advertises wi-fi as one if its \"amenities\" but when you get there they charge you $9.95 a day. There is no mention of this fee on their website so I naturally assumed wi-fi would be fee as I stay in hotels probably 15x a year for work/leisure and have not been charged for internet access in at least 3 years. I complained to the manager that I don't consider paying for something everyone else offers for free to be an \"amenity\" and she did waive the fee after some spirted discussion. Strike 2. Finally, we had a package which included breakfast. Again, I double checked this on the phone when I made the reservation and when we checked into the hotel. So both days we stayed we ate at their breakfast buffet as that is what we were told to do. When we checked in, the front desk said the restaurant would bring us a bill and to charge it to the room and they would delete the charge at checkout. However, when we left they told us our package only included 1 breakfast per day and we would have to pay for the other one. At a cost of $20 each! For a simple buffet that you would get free at any hampton inn or homewood! Strike 3.... In summary, I felt their customer service was very poor for being a Hyatt and many of the fees and charges were misleading at best. I would urge anyone considering this hotel to consider the total cost of the stay and not just the room rate they advertise as they wil hit you up for a number of things most hotels provide for free.

My stay at the Hyatt was overall a nice stay but there were some issues that I encountered that made the stay less that it might otherwise have been. The room was wonderful, the furniture was excellent, the bed and pillows were as comfortable as one could want, the air conditioning was effective, the water pressure was good, and the maid service was perfect. If the room itself were all that were being graded, this would be a top-notch review, excellent all the way. I heard comments by some attending a convention while I was there that the hotel had not been in the best of shape in the past. That has changed. I could not ask more comfort from the room. Price: if you drive, add $20/day for self parking or $25/day for valet parking to your room price. If you use the internet, add $10/day for internet access. So whatever your quoted room price is, add at least $30 per day. Soft drink machines charge $2 for a 20oz drink and do not accept cash, only credit cards. Check in and check our were quick and easy. My special request for my room was not honored, possibly due to the convention taking place. As usual, the luggage carts are reserved for bell service, so, unlike with less expensive hotels, I had to make several trips between my room and car to move my belongings. PROBLEM 1 - There are insufficient elevators though they did not seem to be excessively slow. There was a small convention at the hotel (about 500 people they told me) over the weekend and the first couple of days of the week and the elevators were often jammed. Sometimes it was hard to get the elevators to move when the doors closed.Not only did I notice this, the convention attendees were regularly complaining about how long it took to get an elevator. The hotel staff used the passenger elevators for bell service and there were several wheelchair-bound convention attendees who were having trouble getting a place on the elevators. If the elevator service is inadequate with a small convention there, I cannot imagine how it would be with a larger one. PROBLEM 2 - There is an adjacent mall with food court but the hours of the businesses was uneven. Nothing seemed to be open for breakfast on the weekend. After a couple of trips over there, which requires quite a walk, I quit going. There were plenty of nice restaurants in the block across the street from the hotel, so there were no problems at lunch or in the evenings. In the hotel lobby are a MacDonalds and Subway, neither of which seemed to have adequate staff to handle the demand of the small convention, even on the weekday mornings.

First, the good - * The beds are very comfortable * The lobby and atrium is very impressive * The front desk and bellhops are very friendly and helpful * Right in the middle of everything in downtown Now, the bad - * The pool/hot tub is tiny, and closes at 10pm. Worse, the next morning it was also closed with no explanation given. At noon, it was still closed. We could only speculate that they had water quality problems, as the pool was very cloudy. * Rooms feel cramped. * We noticed black mold in the shower. * As others mentioned, Wi-Fi is nowhere to be found except high-priced T-mobile pay service. * The parking garage has a 6'-2\" limit. If you have a luggage carrier, you are classified as an oversized vehicle and must pay the $27 valet fee. Overall, it is a pretty nice property that would sit firmly in the 3-star category. Just because a hotel has a great lobby/atrium and location does not make it 4-star if it has all of the shortcomings we found.

I call and they tell me that they are having an issue with the water. While I shave with this filthy water, my daughter trips and hits her face on a piece of furniture. I call to the front desk and ask for help and they say that they will send security and an EMT right away. 25 minutes later, I call down and tell them to cancel the EMT and that I would take my daughter to the hospital myself. They apologized and said that the person who took the call did not take note of what room I was calling from. Maria from security then came up while I got ready to leave and she was as nice as she could be.

The Good: --The staff was incredibly accomodating overall. Each person, from the folks behind the check-in desk, the employees at the Eagle's Nest to the bellmen and valets were very courteous and very nice. I saw one employee get absolutely berated for a several minutes and he took it in stride, handling it the best way he knew how (the dispute was over a business owner who was there for a conference and how the bill had been presented to him). --Room service was actually, for once, above my expectations. It arrived quickly (within 25 minutes) and the food was both hot and tasted good. --Valet service: The way that cars come to the hotel for dropoffs/pickups is a bit tight; the lanes actually run under the second floor of the hotel. The valets did a great job of getting people in and out of their cars and clearing a lane for the next set of vehicles to come through. This was especially impressive in the hour or two before the Indianapolis Colts played the Chicago Bears in a preseason game as many people were parking at the hotel parking deck and the RCA Dome (the Colts' stadium) is literally a block away. --Fitness center. This hotel actually has a fitness center that has a rack of dumbbell weights. Granted, they only go up to fifty pounds, but still--it's the first I've seen. They also have several weight machines where you can work out your chest, back, biceps, shoulders, and legs. The other half of the room contains several treadmills, elliptical machines & stationary bikes. I was fairly impressed. The pool is tiny, and it's an indoor pool, but I've never been keen on hotel pools so it didn't matter much to me. --The bed. I found it to be very comfortable, and while I'm not a big \"pillow\" person, I kind of liked having 8 or 9 pillows on the bed. The room had its own controls for heating/cooling (some earlier reviews seemed to indicate that this was not the case) and while, yes, the vent is over the bed, it IS adjustable by just standing on the bed and fiddling with the vent slats. An earlier reviewer had mentioned that it was impossible to change the vent and that is not the case. Also, the room had a mini-fridge. --\"Stuff\" in the lobby. The hotel shares a large open atrium with an office building. On the ground floor of the office-building side, there is a quickie-Italian place (kind of like a a local Sbarro-type place), some sort of breakfast/lunch \"tavern\" type place, a Subway, a McDonald's and a gift shop. Coupled with the new bar/restaurant that seemingly just opened on the hotel side, you have several places from which to choose to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner without ever having to leave the hotel. --Location, location, location. This hotel, as mentioned before, is a block away from the RCA Dome. It is also connected to the Circle Centre mall (which has dozens of stores and a movie theater). (I would explain how to get to the mall via the Skywalk system, but you're just better off asking a hotel employee so that they can point it out to you.) Several dozen restaurants and/or bars are located within a two to three block area. The state capitol building is also a mere block from the hotel. The Bad: --Yes, the hotel is undergoing renovations. This fact is plastered all over their website. Anyone who has booked this hotel should have known that it was under construction, so is it really fair to complain about the construction? I found that the employees were doing their best with the situation. My only concern was that it seemed as if the construction work was moving...at...a...very...slow...pace. Their website indicated back in March that the renovations would be finished by the beginning of August, but they looked only half-over when I arrived. I had no problems with hearing any construction noise in my room. --Internet access. How can a hotel bill itself as a business traveler's hotel and then charge $12 a day for Internet access? It's absurd. Charge another $12 for the rooms just to at least act like you're trying to be accomodating, Hyatt. --Conference rooms. If you're going to host a conference that expects to have 250 people attending, how about providing ample seating space? For example, setting up a two-person table and cramming three chairs behind it is just a tad bit ridiculous, isn't it? The empty space in the room we were in (on the second floor) could have housed a few more rows of tables, thus freeing up more elbow room for everyone. Also, the chairs became quite uncomfortable after sitting in them for eight hours a day. --If you use their express check-in kiosk, it will ask for you to swipe your credit card so it can identify you. One problem with this is that if your employer booked the room and placed instructions that the charges should be billed to your employer's credit card, checking in at the kiosk will automatically put your personal card as the card that will be charged. It was a hassle getting it switched back, but the hotel employee I dealt with was very professional about it. If you arrive to check in, and your employer is paying for the room, just decline their offer to use the kiosk and wait in line to check in at the desk. --Eagle's Nest restaurant. Possibly one of the worst breakfasts I have ever had. Definitely the worst breakfast buffet that I have ever tasted. The eggs were bland, the \"roasted fingerling potatoes\" were just plain awful, and the bacon & link sausage each had an odd taste to them. And all for only $15, too! You're essentially paying for the view, which IS amazing--you're at the top of the hotel, and the restaurant is round, and it slowly rotates, so you end up getting a full 360 degree view of the city. The service was pretty good, and the view was great, but nothing could overcome how awful the food was. It was a complete waste of money. You're better off eating at the McDonald's in the lobby--it would be less money AND the food would be better. Things Not Affiliated With the Hotel: --Carey Indiana limousine service is THE way to get where you need to go from the Indianapolis airport. You can reserve a car online (or via phone) and when you arrive at the airport, all you have to do is go to the Ground Transportation Center, check in at the Carey booth, and they'll take care of the rest. It was $12 each way, and the first time I was in a limo and the second in a private town car. The drivers were very professional and took their jobs seriously. --Do not, I repeat, do NOT eat at Mikado Japanese Restaurant (located downtown, two blocks from the hotel). It was, by far, the worst Japanese food I've ever had. --The Colts Team Store in the mall sells a three foot high Peyton Manning bobblehead for $200. That doesn't really pertain to the Hyatt, but I just had to throw that in for shock value. All in all, I had a good trip and the hotel was more than adequate for a weeklong stay.

Construction- The hotel is part of a bigger office building and adjacent to the convention center. There is construction going on, but this caused me no problems. OK, with that out of the way, downtown Indianapolis is thriving, and the Hyatt is across the street or within minutes from a large mall (With Nordstrom's and Carson, Prairie, Scott as anchor stores), a bunch of very good restaurants, retail shopping (including a Border's and a TJ Maxx) and plenty of attractions. So, you can park the car and be assured that you are not \"stuck\" at the Hyatt- there's plenty to do. The facilities are very nice. The exercise room is well-appointed and includes treadmills with TVs located on the display of each treadmill, so you can select whatever TV program you want to watch while you run, walk, whatever. The pool is very nice as well. Best of all, the rooms are excellent. The beds are comfortable with great pillows and comforters; the closet, bathroom and desk areas are also very good. The bottom line is that this is a great place, and if you need to go to Indianapolis, you likely cannot do better.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cincy", "Title": "\u201cLoved The Hyatt Regency\u201d", "Author": "cincodes", "ReviewID": "UR7597742", "Content": "I traveled to Indianapolis on May 12 & 13th for Mother's Day weekend with my 2 children.

The worst problem here is the bed linens. Have you ever had a cheap sweater that develops little balls of fabric across the surface? The term for this is pilling and that is exactly what the bottom bed sheet was doing. Can you imagine trying to sleep on hundreds, maybe thousands of these little fabric balls?

When he finally found the \"right\" person to check in with, he found them to be condescending and not that helpful. Then, when we tried to take the luggage cart up to the room, we were literally stopped by an employee (he put his arm out to stop us), who told us that we couldn't take the cart up to the room due to the hotel's insurance policy. After 10 minutes of waiting for a bellman to show up, the employee decides to LOCK our luggage in a room. When we demanded that the door be unlocked so that we could take our luggage off the cart and carry it up to our room ourselves, another employee unlocked the door and brought out someone else's luggage, looked at us like we were bothering her and then said \"Did you need something?\". THE ROOM: On the first night of our stay, we got a room with two doubles instead of the King bed that we had asked for. One of the beds had small tufts of black hair in the sheets, which to me meant that they weren't changed from the previous person. We were able to change to a King room the second night, and the room was much better, only the bed itself was quite hard and mildly comfortable.

Overall, a pretty decent stay. My wife and I were in town for a wedding and were able to snag a government rate. Here is a breakdown of the visit - CHECK-IN: Quite efficient. A front desk representative met us as we walked in. She was very warm and welcoming. She assisted us as we used the electronic kiosk to check into our rooms. This is an efficient method, however, it adds a bit of sterility to the experience. Perhaps I am old fasion, but I prefer going to the front desk and speaking with a representative. It seems more personal. LOBBY/BUILDING APPERANCE: The hotel seems to fall in line with the building spree Hyatt hotels had in the 80's and early 90's. While it was clean and asthetically pleasing, it did convey a sense of that era. I found it to be overall comfortable. ROOM: My wife and I reserved a King room. Overall, the room was very clean and utilitarian. I believe this hotel underwent a recent renovation and the rooms reflected such. Very warm and modern style. The bed would be my only complaint. While large, it was not as comfortable as I would expect. I had difficulty sleeping both nights of my stay. It seemed overly hard and non-form fitting. SERVICE: Service was very professional. If I or my wife had a request, we simply called the \"perfect stay\" hotline and the issue/need was attended to. They answer the phone by addressing you as Mr. \"LASTNAME.\" It might not seem like a lot, but to me was a nice touch. The only complaint I would have was a less-than-stellar room service experience. I ordered a cobb salad for a late-night meal. There seemed to be a bit of a delay in providing the meal (40-50 meal). My wife ordered a piece of pie (which was \"intoxicating\" apparently). My salad was decent with the exception that the chicken was very undercooked. Saving myself to have to deal with calling the kitchen again, I simply ate around and attempted to salvage what was left. OTHER: I have to make a special note about the gym. FANTASTIC. I was really impressed with this amenity; all the equipment was new and very user friendly. Hyatt really made a great effort with this property and this guest very much enjoyed it. OVERALL: I would return to the Hyatt Indianapolis.

The hotel lobby is beautiful. Especially at night when the luminaries are on in the upper part of the lobby. The elevators are very quick with hardly any waiting. A beautiful waterfall right next to the elevator is part of the view as you go up because they are all glass. There is a revolving restaurant on the very top, although we did not go there while we stayed. It is business casual attire and we only brought jeans with us because we attended the RibAmerica Fest and the drag races over Labor Day weekend. RibAmerica fest was about a 8-10 minute walk. There's a TJ Maxx next door as well as other shopping. Lots of good restaurants near by. The rooms were very spacious, the bed was awesome (king size with 6 of the fluffiest pillows I've ever laid my head on). They also wrap the blankets in sheets so you don't have the \"ick\" factor from the people who stayed there before. A lot of hotels don't do that. We also had ordered a smoking room, but they didn't have any available. So to compensate for that, we were brought up 4 beers and a tray full of fruits, cheeses, and crackers as complimentary. The lady at the desk acted genuinely sorry that she could not accomodate the smoking room. We were delivered a newspaper the next morning also. The only complaint that I had during the entire stay was in the Champs lounge. The waitress knew we wanted to order from the menu and then she never came back to our table. After sitting there for about 1/2 hour, we just went to the bar, paid for our drinks that she had brought, and went to a restaurant down the street called \"Rock Bottom\" which had excellent food and service.

We booked the night before on Priceline, we put in an offer of $99. and it was immediately accepted. Laura checked us in on Saturday. She was friendly and helpful. The entire hotel was booked except for seven other rooms she said. There was a gaming convention going on and delegates were buying games, playing games near the banquet room in their sci-fi costumes. The last time we stayed at this hotel they had a different convention so I guess this is a good site for such business. Our room was reasonably clean. The beds were clean, room vacuumed, plenty of pillows. The bathroom was somewhat clean. It seemed that the floors had been swept but not washed since they were sticky. They upgraded the countertop to granite and matching granite baseboards. The bath products were a larger size than comes with most hotels. It was enough for two adults and two children to use once and had a lemon-lavender scent. Our room had a refrigerator and a medium-size closet. There was enough storage in the room for our clothes, but only because we were staying one night. Note: there are four elevators. We stayed on the sixteenth floor (I think there are 18 floors) and we waited 1-3 minutes each time we used the elevator. We did not eat at the sports bar, CHAMPS or the restaurant EAGLES NEST but they are conveniently located inside the hotel. The best part of this hotel is that it is connected to Circle Center Mall. Technically, it is faster to just run down a block into the mall entrance, but in case of incliment weather it is convenient to go through the hallway which leads to another hallway which leads to another (that is well-marked) and the maze ends inside the mall. The hotel pool is 4-feet all the way across. It is clean, with plenty room to swim and plenty of clean towels and seating. The jacuzzi fits about 8-10 people. A nice feature is that there are two skylights, one above the pool and one above the jacuzzi. Anyone waiting for an elevator can see into the pool so I guess it gives them something to do while they wait, but I felt a bit like a goldfish at times. The pool is conveniently next to the fitness room. Both share restrooms (which need to be remodeled.) The restrooms have around 30 lockers, a couple showers, too. I used the restroom facilites while I was there and the first stall I went into had no lock on the door. I didn't see anyone else use the womens room and after seeing the site, would prefer to shower in my own room. I think this hotel would be good for business travelers, convention delegates, families or couples that are there to visit the mall, the RCA dome or other nearby attractions. Overall, I would give this hotel a solid three stars. To reach the four star status, I think the bathroom floor should have been washed, and attention paid to decorative detail such as replacing the wallpaper. Nicer lighting in the bathroom, instead of florescent lighting. Larger rooms. That is a four star. The staff were friendly and helpful.

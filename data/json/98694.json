After parking at the hotel (which is free by the way) and entering, we loved the marble and spacious lobby of the hotel. There is a also a very large hotel lobby bar/restaurant area with plenty of tables and comfy lounge chairs. At check-in, the lady at front desk saw that I had elite status with Club Carlson and told us she had upgraded our room. After entering the room, it did not seem like it was upgraded; I was thinking we'd be upgraded to a suite, but it was still a standard room on a high floor with two queen size beds that we'd originally booked (maybe a high floor is an upgrade? She didn't exactly specify). Either way, I was very impressed with the room. As you can see from the pictures below, the decor is more exquisite than a standard hotel room, garnished with a warm, rich, color palette and topped with some elegant touches (I loved the desk chairs). After spending a few hours exploring downtown Dallas with a good friend of mine that recently moved from NJ to Dallas for work, we decided to call it an early night because we were exhausted from all of the driving. We had a good night's sleep and were happy that the our room was very quiet and comfortable. We had two queen sized Sleep Number beds with super fluffy pillows and a soft duvet. The bathroom and sink area were very spacious. I loved that they had a magnifying mirror, which was perfect for applying makeup! The shower was basic, but clean, with plenty of hot water. The bath toiletries in the room were Radisson's signature Asira line of products. The coffee machine was located on a separate nook (with a refrigerator underneath). I really liked the pizazz decor of the room. This corner desk was big enough to comfortably work.

We stayed as part of Radisson's \"Big Night Giveaway\" in order to earn 50,000 bonus Club Carlson points. Since we joined Club Carlson through a special online page, we also earned 2,000 bonus points, and we earned 1,000 bonus points for making the reservation online through the Radisson booking site. Check-in was prompt, friendly, and efficient. As a Club Carlson Gold Elite member, I had requested early check-in and was granted a 1:30 PM check-in time. We were given keys to room 825. Many previous reviewers have indicated that this property is older and in need of refurbishment, and several have gone so far as to indicate that it is a lower-quality hotel not worth the cost of the room. While they are entitled to their opinions, I am going on the record to state that the property, while long-established in the heart of University Park, is glowing with modern conveniences and warm, inviting staff who spring at the opportunity to ensure that your stay is nothing but excellent. Radisson has a \"you will be satisfied with your stay or you won't pay\" guarantee, so please mention any perceived shortcomings to the staff and let them assist in making your stay comfortable. Our room was spacious and quite clean. The Select Comfort beds were comfortable and the sheets were crisp and pristine. Our view was of the very busy Central Expressway / Highway 75 and of the SMU campus; however, despite being practically adjacent to Central Expressway, we heard very little of the traffic noise. We also were able to watch the DART light rail on its approach to and departure from the nearby Mockingbird station, a transit point for the DART blue and red lines and access to downtown Dallas and Fort Worth (via the TRE). There were also other room amenities, including a super-comfortable easy chair and ottoman, a large work desk and desk chair, and free WiFi. The hotel is doing its part to protect the environment, and fluorescent fixtures are prevalent throughout the room and building. The bathroom was stocked with Radisson's own Asira brand of bath products; the towels were thick, fluffy, and spotlessly white. Gloriously hot water was instantly available throughout the day and evening. Additional room amenities include a large flat-screen TV, a by-the-cup Cuisinart coffee maker, and a clock radio that will also play CD's. We were offered the nightly turn down service, and were given a large envelope of sweets as a goodnight gift. The Radisson has a large bar that offers happy hour specials and a restaurant that has a renowned breakfast buffet for $11.95 per person. There are various large meeting rooms to accommodate conferences or other meetings, and a business center offering free computer access, faxing out, and printing is present in the hotel lobby. The pool was one of the things that drew us to this property, and I am happy to report that we did not have any negative issues at all with it. The water was clean and clear and, most importantly, warm. The pool has an interesting indoor/outdoor feature, but since the outdoor temperatures were only in the mid 60's during the day and down to the low 40's at night, it was a bit of a reverse polar bear plunge experience to drift outside amidst the steam rising from the water into the cool nighttime air. There are a couple of indoor trees that are growing in large planters by the pool, and a small leaf will occasionally fall into the pool. This did not detract from my family's fun experience at all, as it is an easy matter to remove the leaf. Our son had hours of fun in the pool, and we had no reservations with it at all. There is also a fitness center with modern fitness equipment. A $50.00 incidentals fee was authorized against our credit card upon check-in, but it was refunded in full when we checked out. We were blessed to have a parking space practically at the front door of the property, although there is abundant parking to the side and rear of the property. There is no charge for the on-site parking, and a free shuttle service will ferry hotel guests to local attractions including Northpark Mall, the SMU campus, and other sites. All in all, we will definitely stay at this property again in the future if we need another family get-away vacation, and we eagerly recommend the Radisson Hotel Dallas Central - University Park to each of you who read this review. Gerry Szczepanski, the general manager, and Alisha Ryder, the front office supervisor, have done a magnificent job with the property, making it warm and inviting. Each member of the hotel staff was smiling when we encountered him or her in the hallways, at the front desk, or throughout the hotel, and each person seemed genuinely interested in having us as their guests and making our stay wonderful. You will be pleased with your stay at the Radisson.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lookout Mountain, GA", "Title": "\u201cNeeds updating\u201d", "Author": "speaker55", "ReviewID": "UR121437836", "Content": "The heating unit by the window had a sticker reading \"thermostat located on the wall\".

I conducted a seminar there the next morning and had to ask several times to have the coffee and continental breakfast set up. Earnesto on the catering staff tried his hardest to make the morning go well asking several times if there was any thing I needed.

The airport shuttle was not available when I arrived the night before from the airport so I had to take a taxi costing around $17.

I have never stayed at a Radisson and probably won't again based on this stay. I had an appt at the spine institute a few miles up and instead of fighting through 40 miles of early morning Dallas rush hour traffic I decided to get this hotel room. I chose this hotel based on the website saying that they had the sleep # bed. We checked in around 9:30 and had a first floor room. Upon turning the corner to our room it had a nasty smell. I opened the door to our room and all I can say was it was Brown, dark brown wall paper everywhere. It had the 1980's quilted polyester bed spread, polyester blanket and ink stains on my bleach smelled sheets and the headboard was chipped everywhere. The drawer to the nightstand was broke and the dresser the tv was on was all chipped up. The only thing updated was the tv. It looked like a picture was missing in the room because there was a huge empty space with hardware sticking out of the wall. Creepier was going to the \"window\" to find the bar area! Nice, good thing I checked before I opened the curtains while in my pj's. Needless to say loud and could explain the smell. The beds- not sleep #, apparently not all of the beds are sleep #- failed to mention on the site as this was the #1 reason I choose to stay here. Instead I got to wear in the last few springs left in the bed that complete sloped me to the middle- Uncomfortable as could be. All I could say is Thank God this was for one night, it was convenient to what I needed but it looked nothing like the pictures on their website. I would be horrified if we stayed here for a vacation, couldn't imagine a business trip or a romantic trip either. It reminded me of a Super 8 or Motel 6 I would have stayed at 20 years ago as a kid when there wasn't another hotel in sight and we had to pull over to sleep.

However, it's location is fantastic (if this is the part of town you need to be in) and it has some practical advantages like ample free self parking, free internet and free shuttle. The main problems to its age are the dated decor, small bathrooms, and window unit HVAC units. The HVAC unit in my room is very loud and when it starts up it's very annoying, that's probably the biggest problem and probably why I wouldn't recommend staying here if you're a light sleeper (unless it's during the spring/fall and you don't need it). The carpet is dark so it's hard to know if it's clean or not, but overall the room seems perfectly clean for its age, the daily housekeeping service did a good job keeping the bathroom clean and plenty of fresh towels. The bathroom is very small but it has some recent upgrades such as a granite countertop and a curved shower curtain (the curtain looked brand new). The room has a tube TV, I haven't seen one of those in at least 5 years (not even a flat front tube, it's curved). For what I was looking for, good price, this location, free internet, free parking, this was a good choice. If the AC wasn't so loud it would have been a 4 rating for me, but the loud AC is pretty bad so I have to bump it down to a 3. It may be becuase of my room location but the internet is crazy fast. The other reviews are pretty harsh, you get what you pay for, I wouldn't pay over $130 for it though.

When we arrived we were given two rooms with one double bed each, due to 'high traffic'. They were also out of cots for the same reason, leaving three members without a place to sleep. They had to find alternate accommodations. We were told that since we did not book directly with the hotel, we were given lowest priority, even though we prepaid and booked well in advance. The rooms were average, but very outdated. The TVs especially are very old, and ours exploded while we were trying to change the channel. Literally. Three members decided to have breakfast at the hotel the next morning and paid a whopping $40 for a sub-par breakfast buffet. I was told to come back at noon to try and book another room for the next night, so I left the other members in the Arts District and came back, only to be turned away for another two and a half hours. I was constantly having to leave the group throughout the day because the Radisson said I had to book in person and could not conduct any of this over the phone. I was distracted the whole day and couldn't lead the group like I had planned. When we did get a new room the bedding was dirty, we were missing towels and the sleep number beds they gave us as a 'courtesy' did not work.

From my past experiences and current observations, I believe this hotel has changed ownership and the service and facility will continue to go downhill.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey", "Title": "\u201cI was pleasantly surprised...Great hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "TravelGurl80", "ReviewID": "UR78007911", "Content": "I was a little nervous about staying at this hotel after reading some of the iffy reviews. But I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful from the time that I checked in, to the time that I checked out. The hotel is in a great location in downtown Dallas. Very close to plenty of shopping and dining. They have a really nice restaurant set-up there as well. I also loved the complimentary copies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FD\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (fashion) magazine that the hotel offered. The room was a very nice size with great decor. I had a room with a king size bed, a good size desk, as well as a cozy chair with a foot stool. The room was very clean and comfortable. My only complaints would be that the window air conditioner unit was very loud. Also, I could tell that the bathroom had been remodeled (very nicely) but it looked like the shower and bathtub was refurbished instead of replaced, still, they were both very clean. All in all, the Radisson is a great place to stay\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially for the price! I will be staying there again on my next trip to Dallas.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFull of false promises\u201d", "Author": "STEMIAN", "ReviewID": "UR74333178", "Content": "A group of 15 teachers from all over Texas stayed last week at this hotel due to their partnership with SMU, host of a week long training. We were assigned homework on a daily basis to be completed online. One of the sale points of this hotel is free wi-fi in the room, which was not provided at all, not even in any part of the hotel. Their business center consisted of two computers and a printer, at first one computer was working (no internet) , but after the first day none worked. Needless to say were not able to accomplish assignments and have to work either from a Starbucks or other business who would provide the service. I called the front desk to inquire about the status of the service Wednesday (midway of my stay) and Veronica in the front desk transferred my call to a brokerage firm, who in turn were extremely upset as I was not the only call she had transferred in error to them. I later called the corporate office and a manager offered to shuttle us to another hotel to use their lobby for their wi-fi connection or if it was to check email to use the front desk computer. Which obviously was something unacceptable for the purpose of our stay. A transfer to another hotel with the service would have worked wonders... The university provided us with breakfast vouchers for their restaurant, the first day they served buffet breakfast which was right on the dot with the voucher value. The next four days we were given a menu, with pricing that was near impossible to keep below voucher value. For sure, this is not the hotel to stay in Dallas!", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Radisson Hotel Central Dallas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98694-Reviews-Radisson_Hotel_Central_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$101 - $165*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6070 North Central Expressway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75206</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "98694", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/be/a5/bea5e1cf78fc9ec2f12110e4e95d23f07large.jpg"}}

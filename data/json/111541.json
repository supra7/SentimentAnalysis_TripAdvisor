The hotel staff was obviously frustrated with the management and, at one point, had a server in the Legends Sports Bar tell us how awful the management was... I ordered food to be delivered to our room at check-in...no food (but THEY CHARGED ME FOR IT), we waited forty minutes for our food in Legends AND WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE, I ordered room service Coffee for 7 AM the next morning...they never brought the coffee (but THEY CHARGED ME FOR IT). We waited THREE HOURS for towels at the pool and eventually just gave up. The price you pay when you book your room is just the beginning of this odyssey...Parking $20..did you want a fridge $10...microwave? $10 and both PER DAY. Breakfast at Docs? $20 a HEAD (breakfast buffet includes a total of 12 items which included stale pastry's and sausage that sat in a chafing dish so long you couldn't cut the skin). Dinner at Docs (Seafood buffet...lol) $42. a HEAD... the shrimp was BROWN, crab legs were old..the Prime Rib was good but this was a ridiculous price...did you want to get a umbrella and chairs on the beach? $30. and ONLY UNTIL 5PM...Before our trip I emailed the Concierge FOUR times using the link they sent me with my reservation confirmation and no one responded... the front desk personnel were disconnected and uninterested.. The Oceanfront King Room we stayed in was barely adequate...the shower and bathroom floor was dirty... it has clearly NOT been mopped by housekeeping after the previous guest left...we found clothing tags and food on the carpet and GARBAGE in one of the cans underneath the desk. I called housekeeping and a man showed up with extra pillows and towels and \"wiped down the bathroom\" he also ran the vacuum over the carpet and stood around for a several minutes (no joke) until we TIPPED him to leave.

The hotel is very nice (and large) with two towers. The rooms are very nice with a large bathroom and a second sink in the bedroom - perfect for a family of 4. Our room was on the 8th floor, overlooking the ocean/boardwalk - Beautiful! The elevators are FAST so staying at a high floor is not inconvenient. We also discovered rooms located outside on the ground floor with their own patios. Perfect if you would like to walk right out your door to the beach. The hotel also allows dogs (bonus) and they are allowed on the beach with a leash. They offer valet parking for $19/night or you can self park in the garage across the street for $12. We never used our car the entire 3 1/2 days we were there. You can walk everywhere. On one end of the hotel is a 3 story plaza with shops, restaurants and a theater. There is also an outdoor amphitheater that had concerts going all weekend (Labor Day) but only until 10:00, which was nice for guests to be able to sleep. At the other end of the hotel is the park with a few rides. The wrist bands are the best deal if you plan to ride more than 2. Then there are tourist shops and restaurants and the pier. If you turn the corner on that street, there are lots of other restaurants and shops that we didn't discover until the second day. Zeno's taffy and fudge is awesome! Sicily Pizza is the best ever! The hotel has several good restaurants as well. The beach is awesome! We rented reclining bikes (best at low tide). The hotel has two pools. Since we stayed in the north tower, that is the pool we used. It is located on the 5th floor and has a kids pool and hot tub with pool table, foosball and snack bar. There is also a kids room with toys, games and movies. Be sure to get towels from the pool area before you head to the beach. We loved this hotel and look forward to going back next year. The only negative is when you are ready to come back in from the beach all sandy. They only have a foot wash that barely works and leaves you standing in a pile of sand.

The beds were comfy as we're the pillows. I didn't like that the pool on the fifth floor was small and for a hotel of this size the main pool was small as well and what a trek it is to get to the pool and the beach for that matter! We were in the north tower and we had to walk all the way thru the hotel lugging beach chairs, coolers etc. just a pain to get to the beach.

From the staff to the location to the rooms! We had a cabana suite oceanfront and it was amazing and so convenient when we wanted to go down to the beach or walk over to the restaurants and shops....we didn't have to take an elevator, walk through the lobby then down the stairs, all we had to do was open our door and go! I highly recommend getting one of these rooms if the price is right for you! We were also traveling with our two dogs and sometimes you never know how pet friendly a hotel is especially with this being one of the more upscale hotels on Daytona Beach. When we opened the door to our room there were two huge fluffy dog beds and stainless steel water and dog food bowls waiting for our little guy and girl and they LOVED it! The $50 non-refundable fee is 100% worth it considering we would pay so much more if we left them at a kennel. Just outside our suite was a huge long grassy area where we took the dogs to do their business and walk down the sidewalk to get some exercise. Housekeeping was GREAT also. We didn't want them coming in our room when we weren't there because of the dogs so they were gracious enough to leave us new towels, coffee and toiletry products for us as well as bringing us two HUGE bags of ice to fill up our ice chest! I also read in a previous comment that the televisions were outdated at this hotel, but we had two flat screen tv's in our room, i believe they were about 27\" tv's....not really a big deal to me, but I know some people can't live without a tv. Again, this hotel is awesome.....we ate at Bubba Gump, Sloppy Joe's, Winghouse and got some dessert at Coldstone which was all within minutes walking distance from our cabana!

Our overall experience was not a bad one but I have to say I was disappointed in the Hilton at this location. We chose to vallet park and had no problems getting our car or returning it any of the times we went out. We arrived in the late in the afternoon and the kids wanted to go down to the beach/ pool. When we arrived at the pool area there was no attendant and large pile of towels on the floor in front of the desk. This was frustrating and not a great first impression of the hotel service. Then we couldn't get a straight answer out of any employee we asked about other options. When the attendant arrived (about 10 minutes) he was not overly concerned about the lack of towels and stated it would be awhile before there were any new ones since he had just arrived. We stayed from Tuesday to Saturday and I only saw a person at the pool desk one other time so I can only assume that this is common practice at this facility. The area you walk through just before you get to the pool was disgusting and I cannot believe that the hotel would let such a well traveled area be left in this condition. From the smell and the wet carpet, the water leaking from the ceiling into a bucket on the floor had been left unrepaired for quite some time. There were many options for dining in the hotel and in the surrounding area. We had breakfast at the hotel most mornings and the buffet was very good. We enjoyed the food and staff at Legends sports bar several times during our stay. The food at the steak house was not bad but for the price it was nothing to rave about either. We are from the midwest and it was almost an insult to have the waiter correct us on how we should have our steaks cooked. I am sure he was doing his job by making the recommendations but he could have taken a less condescending tone. Our rooms were clean but small. We stayed in the North tower and I would recommend an ocean view. I was suprised that there were no microwaves or fridges in the rooms, but it was not a problem for us.

I myself used to Manage a Casino in one of the most populated tourist towns in the world, you learn you don't get if you do not ask. (Vegas) And for a busy on the beach Resort, I got one of the best deals and was not even part of their Club Member discounts. I was asked if I was when I checked in, but never asked if I wanted to sign up with an answer of no. Now for our actual stay. Alma in the Gift shop was such a lovely lady. Only concerns was, Vending Drinks $1.50, Gift Shops $3.20 a piece. They did not fill the machines all weekend long. Guess they figure your at the Hilton, your willing to pay twice as much. Should take out the machines if your not going to fill them. I walked every floor every Machine for Dr. Pepper. (none) I even seen a machine down by the Band Ampi-theater and two other machines on the boardwalk, both sold out. I was told that an employee had the responsibility to fill them. Well he must of been on vacation. Then while searching the floors I seen on the Fifth North Tower floor someones dog decided to relieve himself of prior dinner all over the carpet, and nobody cleaned it up! I say this, because I seen prior review comments to old carpet or sand in carpet. Out dated carpet. Its a seaside Resort. Carpet comes and goes and can look tattered if people do these things in a matter of Months. Yes, furniture was dinged up on edges. But your there for the beach. Not taking up residence like Charlie Sheen on a Binge for three months. And then you still overlook the little things. Room was clean, and house keeping was always willing to change out towels as we needed them. I have learned to keep my own room neat and clean during stays and leave the do not disturb sign on the door at all times. So I know, only we are the ones in and out and no chance of doors ever being left open by others. There was plenty of activities along the boardwalk, and different venue eateries around the resort. We suggest take a drive down to the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse in the evening and then eat at the Inlet Harbor Rest. Great place on the water and more reasonable prices for food. We go somewhere every year for our Anniversary. Now this being first year back on east coast, we will be back when we can stay longer. This is a nice family resort, and the property reflects that. If your a relative of the Hotel's namesake or think you should be, go stay at an adult only or very High Dollar place Resort where you don't have to spend your time worrying about the little things. But if your a family on a budget but want to make sure the place has everything for your family or Adult weekend get-away like my wife and I; this is the place to stay. Oh, last thing; Everyday the regular staff in passing always said hello...goodmorning...hi, I passed several Managers or mid-mangement in passing. Only two ever said one word to us. Being a Manager of such a larger facility, Management should lead by example the 10 & 2 rule. Smile 10 feet away, and greet by the 2 feet away.

Honestly speaking, from the quality and service that we've come to expect from the Hilton name we were slightly disappointed. The property itself as well as the prime location right on Daytona Beach was great. But that's where the greatness stopped. We decided to valet park as self parking was indicated as off site which we didn't want to deal with. Arrival and valet was easy enough. Our check-in experience at the front desk not that great. We waited for approximately 5 minutes. When the lady (Preeti) finally looked up and waved us over we got the impression that we were interrupting her busy day. She was about the business. No pleasantries. No real greetings. The hotel is clearly a very busy one so maybe she was burnt out from the day. However as someone who has been very loyal to Hilton this is not interaction I've grown to expect. We were upgraded to an ocean view room (as Hilton Honors Gold Members). The view was excellent. The room was subpar and out of date. The only modern looking item in the room itself was the television. The furniture was rather old and dingy looking. The carpeting (both in the room and in the hallway) is ready to be updated. The bathroom was clean enough. Water pressure was great. However the tub and shower head need to be updated in the worst way. All in all, compared to the rooms we've experienced at other Hilton properties, this room was one of the most in need of work. Oh and there is no wi-fi available in the hotel rooms themselves. Apparently it is available in the hotel common areas. But this is 2012 right? No wi-fi? We ordered room service for dessert. It was your standard room service. Decent food. Expensive. Convenient. Now lets talk about the vending machines. I'm sure I'm not the only hotel visitor who's been thirsty in the night and has attempted to visit a vending machine for a beverage. My experience attempting to get a simple bottle of water sealed this visit a definitely below expecations. My room was on the 5th floor. I walk to the vending machine to get 2 bottles of water. Everything Sold Out. No problem. I walked up the stairs to the 6th floor vending machine. Everything Sold Out. Up To the 7th floor. Sold Out. I then took the Elevator up to the 12th floor of the hotel and started with that vending machine. Every single vending machine from the 12th floor down was sold out. I eventually had to go down to the ground floor gift shop to purchase water. The title of this review indicated that the Details were lacking. It is completely unacceptable that every single vending machine from the 12th floor down at the Hilton of all places is empty on a Saturday night! I suppose I could have continued up to the 16th floor to give it a try, but wasn't I staying on the 5th floor? Should I have to hit every floor of the hotel to get a bottle of water? On Sunday morning before leaving we visited Doc Bale's on the lobby level for breakfast. It was very busy and took about 15 minutes to get seated. The buffet itself was good and extensive. While valet was good on the way in, valet out was not so good. After checking out from the room, we called down to the valet to ask for our vehicle. The attendant who answered the phone (Nick) advised me that they were very busy and that it would be about a 30 minute wait to get my car from the South Tower entrance where we initially arrived in. He told me it would be less of a wait if we walked over the the North Tower entrance valet. When we got over to the North Tower entrance, it was chaos. A lot of people were waiting for vehicles and the valet gentlemen were running around like crazy. It was either exceptionally hectic, or the valet was short staffed. It took about 20 minutes before we saw our vehicle. We were glad the visit was over and that we'd only done a one night stay. The Hilton Daytona Beach is located in one of the best spots on the beach. However from my extremely brief experience, I feel that a strong focus is needed on the customer experience. All it takes is one bad experience. This hotel would DEFINITELY not be my first choice if I were to stay in the Daytona Beach area again. I start reviewing a hotel property in my head as soon as I pull into the front. I do this so I can share my positive and negative experiences with others aiming to stay at the property.

The website said beach towels were available. Upon arrival, I was given the run around (about 35 minutes) to try to find ANY beach towels provided by the hotel. I finally got a hold of the housekeeping supervisor who explained to me that the prior week's group took most of their towel inventory. I asked how that had become OUR group's problem? She had no answers other than \"they are on order, just use the room towels.\" The front desk told me that they would SELL me towels in the hotel gift shop. I ultimately DID purchase a beach towel....from a shop across the street. I have traveled all over the world to beach resorts and have NEVER encountered anything like this. One of the days, I ate lunch at the pool bar. The pool bar attendant tried to actually talk me out?!? of eating lunch there since, \"I am the only one here and it would be tough for me to serve you.\"?!?! I assured her that I had only 1 hour for lunch and to TRY to serve me. She did...with attitude. I was also told on my first night by a front desk employee that the Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse would NOT accept me with my \"casual attire\" and that it was \"fine dining.\" I was somewhat taken aback by this snippy remark as I am a person who always dresses nicely. Throughout the week I noticed people dressed far more \"casually\" than I and ventured into the restaurant/bar.

We check in on the 3rd, wanting the perfect location to watch the 4th of July fireworks from the pier. This is the location to be thick in the middle of all of the action. I scoured this forum fretting on the room for the perfect view - north or south, etc. Then the King Terrace Suite came available. Lots of $$, but I wanted that \"private\" terrace to watch, away from the crowds I anticipated. When we checked in (sorry about the others who are impatient on the check-in process - it's hit or miss - we checked-in at 5:15 and only waited a few minutes) The valet showed us to our room, and like the reviewer below, we were totally underwhelmed. Suite had a bar area with microwave and refrig, sitting area with couch, etc, and separate bedroom. Not great, but adequate. The real problem was with the terrace. Stepped out to loose tiles that wobbled as we walked on it The tiles were sticky from beer/drinks (the night before??) all around disgusting. No beach view, except distant ocean - felt like we were in a dungeon. The worst part was it was shared by all of the other \"lucky\" terrace rooms, and we assumed anybody else who wanted to venture out on \"our\" terrace. Kind of scary. Management needs to get rid of these suite/rooms on the 3rd floor South. If there are any others in another part of the hotel, we couldn't locate them from the outside (we looked). But we didn't settle for this. Luckily, we checked in on the July 3rd and there were still some other regular rooms available. Brittney at the front desk listened to my complaints and gave me some options and we agreed to downgrade. Moved to a regular King oceanfront room with a regular rate. Not the suite we wanted, but, we were there for the holiday and are learning to not stress. The Hilton is still a great hotel - all of the amenities that one could want. The outside bars, inside bars, swimming pools, gift shop, restaurants, bike rental, etc. all were being utilized by the crowd. We ate breakfast and dinner on the 4th (Gloria was super nice) at the buffets, too lazy to go elsewhere. Elevators were functional and quick, except on check-out Thursday. Just avoid the 10:30 - 11:00 rush. We ended up watching the fireworks from the boardwalk - we loved the crowd, at least until the show was over. Then we retreated back to our room and watched the rest of the action through our windows. It is a shame there are no balconies, but we moved the couch in front of the window and enjoyed the view just the same, but in the comfortable a/c. All in all, we enjoyed our short trip so much we'll be back next year, but we will remember to avoid that terrace room. -", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beardsley, MN", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Kathleen B", "ReviewID": "UR133553218", "Content": "Staff very friendly.

We continued to the desk to check into our oceanfront room, only to be taken to a side view room, with a great view of the pier.

The rooms have a big window that opens with bars in front of it... No Balcony!! Being it was to late to leave, we cut our loss. The room itself, needs to be closed!! They have old beds, one of ours broke halfway thru the night, old TV sets, which we could not use for some time because they could not get us a controler that worked, but finally fixed some hours later, and the bathrooms are very small with old showers with low water pressure. The musty smell in the room was very strong, and takes some getting use too. Upon check out, we could not call the valets, like we were told to do, in order to get our auto. We go down to leave, and stand outside and wait 20 minutes for our auto. When we ask about it, they tell us that the deck in our building was full, and they had taken our auto somewhere else to park it, and we payed for this service, what a shock!! In closing, I would like to say... Soliders beware!! I was not told, but I will tell you... There are fireworks outside your room at night if you are oceanfront!!

And, we've stayed at this Hilton before and really loved it... but this time.... First off we got there and had to wait almost an hour, so a good 45 minute wait to check in. There was no method for this as there were like 4 areas that led up to the huge check in desk and people just kept popping in from different sides. Aggravating to say the least. Sometimes clerks would just stand next to someone else while everyone was backed up waiting waiting. Sometimes they would call someone at the head of a rogue, newly formed line, argggh. Finally we were told by the desk clerk our room wasn't ready? Hey, check in is at 4:00, we got there after calling with a confirmed reservation at a little before 5 and at 6 something, no room at the inn? No mention of sorry, comping this or that, just give me your cell # and we'll call you when it's ready, sit out in the lobby? No thank you, said to the clerk, umm, let me see your manager. Was then given a room pretty quickly but not the room we had originally reserved altho both were ocean front. Small room. No balcony on any of these we have had or could see btw, just sliding glass doors and a lean over, you get the picture. Hubby works in housing biz, bad caulking, low low pressure on shower at all hours, shower head height for very short people, carpet in room semi-dirty, rip in bedspread? C'mon, we are paying for a premium room here, guys! Will say some staff very nice, spa ladies who gave us massages, room service lady, valet guys, etc. However, what is up with housekeeping? Left at 11 one day, back around almost 3, cart had advanced a few rooms down hall and our room still not done (no, no sign of do not disturb on room door). Nice lady though and we vacated while she cleaned and we went to read downstairs. Here's another thing we were told by someone there as we waited on something else downstairs at one point in our trip ~ there's a staff cafeteria downstairs and at around 11 ish all the housekeepers jam the cafeteria and the rooms sometimes don't get done even during peak times when rooms are in demand. Ok.... We were told this by a person from a downstairs dept, and they were telling us this freely and unsolicited, that they got minimum wage and that they did get one free meal from the hotel, one of their few perks. They complained about housekeeping being so slow. Their words, not ours. Day of check out we called down front and to the bell captain a total of 6 times letting it ring 30 times each time at least. No answer. Finally we shlepped all our luggage downstairs, no cart, no help, and saw an almost empty front desk and staff just talking with each other up front? We went out and were scolded a bit, although a nice person again, but we asked why we didn't call the number on our 19 dollar a night valet parking ticket? It wasn't explained though that way to us, it was just a 4 digit number on our ticket. I had tried to ring the bell captain and front desk repeatedly I explained. So even though this guy WAS working, surprisingly at this hotel, we were put off a bit as he kept harping on how come we didn't call. By this time, we had fumes coming out of our ears. BTW, there was some kind of church camp group there who roamed freely at all hours. The pool (probably not this group) had a couple pretty openly copulating on the steps of the pool one afternoon (they thought they were unnoticed though and glared at anyone trying to use the steps to actually go swim in the pool). Anywho, the church group banged on our connecting door at one point in the afternoon and tried the door, and then howled outside downstairs by the clock tower way after 11 or more that night. Did I mention fun yet? No goodbyes really as the desk staff never acknowledged us on our way out and after charging us quite a pretty penny for quite a few nights. Just the scolding over our expensively housed car and us leaving and not looking back really. So a true good bye wasn't necessary until now.

They had it all! Bikes, boogie boards, chairs, umbrellas... Spoke with a guy named Derek who was super helpful and also the rest of his staff very friendly. ( message me for contact info). They had our chairs and umbrella set up and reserved both days for us right where we requested them. Great job guys. I would definitely recommend using them to take the hassle put of having to lug your own chairs and stuff back and forth every day..... Well worth the money and affordable!!!!

Pros: *The hotel was not busy while we were there and we appreciated the fact that the front desk granted us an early check-in and a late check-out. That said, it felt like we were there during the off season. The ice cream shop was closed. The kitchen facilities at the outdoor pool area were closed. The carpet was being replaced in parts of the lobby level. *We liked the swimming pool area which is both an indoor and outdoor pool, although the visual obstruction between those two areas made it difficult to watch our children. That would not be a problem for people with older kids. The bar was very convenient to the pool which is always nice. :) *The valet parking attendants were very helpful with suggestions for places to eat, etc. *This was our first trip to Daytona Beach. My impressions are that the sand was incredibly soft and not too hot to walk on. There was a beach equipment rental service right behind the hotel. We spent $30 to rent 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for the day and another $20 on two boogie boards for the kids. *The hotel is right next to a shopping center that has restaurants and a movie theater. Our kids loved Bubba Gump's. *The kids also enjoyed the casual dining at the hotel's sports bar. Cons: *We were surprised not to have WiFi in our room. *Our room felt dated. The closet door was missing a piece of hardware and would not open and close properly. The plate around the shower handle was cracked. *From the photos, we thought that we would have a balcony. The room does have sliding doors and a railing but there is no balcony. *The rooms are not equipped with refrigerators although they were available for rental.

It took four separate phone calls to finally find a reservationist that cared enough to take the time to determine why the AAU Gymnastics code would not work online or even pull up through the reservation line. After about a 30 minute phone call the reservation was finally set. When we arrived about 6 PM there were so many cars waiting to pull into valet that we would line up down N. Atlantic Blvd about a block. If the hotel is sold out, then they should expect a large crowd for valet and provided the necessary staff to handle the arriving guest. Our room was a city view room, which is what we paid for and expected. The furnishings were dated and the room had a very musty smell. Food options are plentiful on site, but unless you want to pay $20+ per person for breakfast or lunch, just walk across the street or down the block for several reasonable opitons. The staff in the coffee shop was rude and even waited on customers while listening to music on ipods (with earphones in). If I am paying $60 for 4 sandwiches at lunch, at least give me your undivided attention! This lack of attention/customer focus played out throughout our stay and was experienced by nearly ever family in our group. As a Platinum Member of two other hotel chains, I will not stay at this resort in the future.

We (3 adults, 2 teenagers) chose a cabana, which is on the beach level. 2 queen beds in one room, a pull-out sofa in the \"living room\". This is by far my favorite set-up, and we will definitely choose the cabanas from now on; they are so easily accessible from the ocean, and it's great not to have to traipse through a lobby wet & sandy, carrying all your wet towels. There are 3 types of patio areas on the cabanas: uncovered, 1/2 covered, and fully covered. There are only 4 fully covered patios (120-124), and had we known that when I called in the reservation (perhaps the reservation agents should mention the choices, because I reserved months in advance), I would have picked one of them. We got an uncovered patio, but since Tropical Storm Beryl decided to visit for the last 1/2 of our vacation, we would have enjoyed a larger covered patio. Pros: I've read previous reviews saying this Hilton was awful...I'll just say I don't know how pretentious those folks were, but I've stayed in many 4-5 star hotels, and this DB Hilton was really very nice. It IS a beach hotel...therefore, the floors are sometimes wet & sandy. The bell hops were fabulous (Chase moved us in & out, he was fast & courteous!), the valet attendants were quick (every time you get your vehicle, they ask if you need directions), and the bartenders at the poolside bar were friendly. In cabana rooms, you have to call housekeeping for ice; they deliver as many bags as you request, free of charge, which is awesome for your coolers...and they are FAST. We had to call housekeeping for extra towels & blankets, and they were fast too. Cons: * The light & ceiling fans in both rooms operate off a wall switch. The light cord is super short, so if you want to turn the light off & leave the ceiling fan run, you have to pull a chair over to stand on, to pull the light cord. * An in-room safe would be great, as well as a mini-fridge/microwave combo, at least in the suites, since they are already set up with the dining area. * This is a beach hotel, and the weather is important when you're planning your day. It would be nice if the tv satellite package included The Weather Channel (probably more sensitive to this because of the TS). * Daily housekeeping is a bit slow. Our room was done late in the afternoon, when we were coming in from the beach, and trying to shower for dinner. The last day, we actually went & found her to ask for clean towels; we told her to skip our room altogether, because it was too late. * I guess it's nice that the DB Hilton allows you to bring pets, but there seemed to be lots of dogs in the cabanas. There is a large grassy area in-between the hotel & the boardwalk, and lots of kids (including our youngest son) wanted to play frisbee, etc., in the area, but that also happens to be where all the hotel guests walk their dogs. It would be nice to have a specific designated \"Pet Walk\" area for people who choose to vacation with animals. In all, it was a great Memorial Day weekend, and I will be making reservations for a cabana room for the Labor Day weekend as well. Of course things are pricey: it's a tourist destination, and it's a Hilton. Occasionally, the floors are damp or sandy: it's at the beach. Yes, our room had tube televisions instead of flat-screens: they still carried the same channels.

The hotel is a modern facility, significantly more upscale than the Cocoa Beach Hilton from which I had just come. The lobby is bright and glamorous, with valet parking and helpful bellhops. Check-in was fast, the elevators worked well and are surprisingly large (big groups, I guess). Our upgraded room ($179 with ocean view) overlooked the boardwalk and amusement rides, which was interesting, and also faced the Kennedy Space Center where we watched a launch at 3am about 80 miles to the south-east. Very cool. The rooms were a little smaller than I expected, and the bathroom definitely was on the cramped side. But everything was clean, worked well, no mold in the showers, luggage rack in the closet and -- surprise -- windows that opened, onto a tiny balcony. A real treat to listen to the ocean waves all night. The town of Daytona Beach is a bit of a jumble, with souvenir shops and tacky restaurants all mixed in with nicer establishments. The beach is QUITE nice, better than Cocoa Beach in my mind. And there's a scattering of amusement park rides that at a busier time of year probably would have been a lot of fun for people-watching. The most interesting aspect of this hotel is what they don't tell you. For example, there are numerous bars and lounges in the lobby, but you have to go hunting for them. There's a Starbucks in the front of the hotel, at street level, but no signs to point you there. And there's a fabulous steak house at the north end of the hotel where we would have very much enjoyed dining, but didn't learn about it until after our dinner. So they need to do a better job publicizing their amenities -- they're probably are more which I never uncovered before check-out.

I was excited to be in Florida with warm and beautiful weather during my week stay! A few years ago I was invited to Daytona Beach to explore the possibility of bringing meetings to the area. At the time, the hotel was flagged as an Adam\u2019s Mark. Several years ago it was rebranded to a Hilton. This is a very large hotel, located directly across Atlantic Avenue from the Ocean Center (convention center and arena), and Peabody Auditorium. The hotel itself can accommodate various size meetings. The hotel does not have shuttle service to/from the airport but there are private companies and taxis that offer airport to hotel service for approximately $18. The airport is just minutes to the hotel. I was greeted by very professional and friendly staff at the HiltonHhonors line (no waiting in the other long lines) and was off to my room in the south tower in just a few minutes. I had breakfast coupons and everything I needed for my week in Florida. My room was two double beds as no king bedrooms were available, even with my gold Honors status. There was a large group at the hotel which no doubt used many of the rooms. My guest room was showing a need for a refresh, and a bit cramped with two beds. However, the spectacular and most incredible view of the beach and ocean quickly made up for any room needs. I enjoyed the mornings rising to beautiful sunrises, and the beach. The beds were very comfortable and typical Hilton beds. The bathroom was a bit small and compact but adequate. The one problem I encountered a few days was the terrible water pressure. Later in the week it seemed to improve. I must say the staff at this hotel is superb! They greet you in the public areas and ask if they can help you with anything, or will direct you to where you need to go. One afternoon I arrived back at my room and noticed it had not been cleaned. A quick call to the hotel guest services promptly resolved the issue. I was very impressed with the hotel staff; they are some of the best in the industry. I was very impressed with the front desk/check-in staff and how helpful and friendly they were! Great people!! The breakfast coupons entitle one to the full buffet or you may order from the menu. The buffet was very good and offered the typical morning breakfast fare. Knowing I did not want or need to eat so much for breakfast each morning I opted for the menu selections on several days. The restaurant staff at \u201cDoc Bale\u2019s Grill\u201d were top notch and very attentive! This venue is only open for breakfast from what I could tell. I must say the breakfast buffet seemed a bit on the high-price side at $19.95 per person. However, it does come with beverage choices and all-you-can-eat. Over all my stay was incredibly great! In fact, I had a hard time leaving! The weather, paired with being on the beach is just a bit of paradise! Other related comments about the Daytona Beach area. The Ocean Walk Village is located directly next to the Hilton, and is a complex of two hotels (including the Hilton and Wyndham) and shops. I must say this \u201cshopping\u201d complex is nothing more than a collection of fast-food style restaurants, with a couple retail shops. I was disappointed in what it had to offer. The shops along Atlantic Avenue are your typical beach/surfing shops that cater to the tourists. If you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all as each offers the same basic line of \u201ctourist trinkets\u201d and clothing. If you are searching for anything in the line of local art/craft/photography, you are not going to find it along the beach area shops. Overall, my experience in Daytona Beach and at the Hilton was great! For a destination to relax and kickback, and enjoy the weather and beach, this is it!

The Bad Like many \"beach front resorts\" my room was in rough shape. The room was aged and wasn't up to the standards that i've come to expect from a Hilton property.

This was my first trip to Daytona and my wife\u2019s 3rd and both of our first times at this Hotel. The hotel is located conveniently close to the convention center and Ocean Walk (an area with restaurants and shops). The beach is beautiful and we had a decent view from our room (recommend an ocean front room). It is a very large hotel with two separate towers, a few restaurants, and a relatively large pool. The fitness room is above average for what I have seen at other properties (it looks like it has been updated within the past couple years). Now the down sides: The hotel is in some major need for renovations. Our room was \u201cok\u201d however there was a pretty foul odor in the bathroom when we first got there (kind of like a musty basement) and everything in the room was very damp due to the humidity in the air. You have to pay for parking every night of your stay. Which I can understand during \u201cpeak\u201d seasons, but we traveled there in February during a non-busy week. The card that they provided us for the parking lot never worked when we wanted to swipe out of the lot. We constantly needed to call the hotel and have them open the gate for us. We received 3 replacement cards while we were there and each of them gave us problems. The swimming pool area needs some updating and the pool was pretty dirty with lots of stuff floating around (there did not seem to be anyone maintaining it properly). The area that the hotel is located in seems to be pretty safe, but a few blocks away from the hotel seems to be a little shady. Overall, we have to say the hotel itself is very average and in need for renovations. The beach itself is beautiful. Given that there are very few \u201cname brand\u201d hotels in the Daytona Beach area, this is probably your best choice, but only because of the selection of other hotels in the area.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay on the beach\u201d", "Author": "robcoppock", "ReviewID": "UR128584246", "Content": "Great stay at the beach.

Checked in late at night in ocean view room, but had pre-picked the opportunity to upgrade to an ocean front room if available. Got to our room and found the biggest ferris wheel ever just outside our window, allong with some other ride that required two very tall, red, lit up steel somethings. We chose to go with the upgrade, but ended up moving just down the hall and had the same view in a little bit of a larger room. Stayed in that room for the night but requested a room change the next morning as we were told we could do that. We were finally moved to the 11th floor, dead center, ocean front which made us very happy. This is a very busy area, near the boardwalk end of DB. Its great for people that like the night life and noise late at night that comes with it. Evidently the fair setting is a new attraction, which happened to be next to the Hilton. Unfortunately it detracts from the hotel itself. The rooms were great, although the second room seemed as though it had fleas according to my partner. They were cleaned daily and all amenities restocked. We had breakfast there the first morning. It was rather unorganized, cold, etc, and very pricey. It was the last meal we ate there. The hotel itself must do a great business. There were people checking in/out constantly at all hours of the day and night. The folks at the front desk were eager to please and very nice. The bell hops and cleaning staff were all very nice. The outside help was ok. We didn't like that they made you unload your car and get it out of the area to a parking lot down and across the street before you could check in. Not necessarily their fault, more like company policy. I thought $12 and $19 per day to park your car at an already overpriced hotel was a bit much, along with another $9/day for wifi in your room. I'm not sure how families can stay there given the high prices of everything there. In their store a small coffee was over $3. I thought it odd they did not have free coffee in the hotel lobby as most hotels do. They do have coffee pots in the rooms, which was ok but not great. Luckily there was a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks nearby. The view was great, the walks on the beach were wonderful, and listening to the ocean waves at night were priceless.

We stayed in a cabana suite on the ground level. One of our biggest issues was there was NO cell service in the room. You had to walk outside to make calls. Two out of the three phones in the room didn\u2019t work and the one that did work, the people said they could barely hear us. There was no safe deposit box which is standard in almost all hotels. The ice machines were not close and were either not working or nearly empty. The bathroom didn\u2019t have a vent so the bathroom was always stuffy and hot after taking a shower. Hardly ever had pool towels out. I think the grounds are way too big for the hotel to take care of. There were abandoned store fronts attached to the hotel that haven\u2019t been washed in years. They had inappropriate things written on them. We had a patio outside of our room. We would sit out there every night to relax and enjoy the weather. This area is open to the public that walk past on their way to and from the carnival area. We witnessed an argument and then a guy get sucker punched. He ran away yelling call the cops with several people chasing after him (one included a guy with a baby in a stroller)! Another night we saw a mother yelling at the top of her lungs to her child, then proceeded to smack him in the face two different times (with multiple people and maids within steps from her).

We had a problem with our cc being charged, stopped by the front desk and talked to a manager that said they would take care of it and call us to confirm it had been cleared up. Two days later I still hadn\u2019t heard from her and called again to say she was in a managers meeting and would call when she got out. Never received a call! And the kicker is in the book it says if you have any comments or concerns to hit the menu button on the tv to submit your feedback, it didn\u2019t work on either TV! Never again will I stay here! Also don't waste your money on the carnival thing next door.

I took a hand towel and ran it across the night stand, it was disgusting. I called the front desk asking for a room change, they would not accomidate, so I went there in person. We finally were assigned room 1076 in the north tower. The room was a bit cleaner, at least we felt like we could take our shoes off and set belonging out. The bathroom was disgusting. Mold on the floor and shower grout, stains on the counter and a shower head from 1982 that sprayed the walls more than it did me. The drain was so slow that no matter how fast you showered you were standing ankle deep in dirty water. There was no mini fridge, They wanted to charge $10 per night, I informed them I am a HiltonHonors member, they relented and gave us one. There is no WiFi on the rooms. I cannot believe a Hilton does not have WiFi. Stupid, stupid, stupid. The TV's chanels were half out. We called down three times over two days to get it working. Upon check in I was offered breakfast certtificates or HiltonHonor points. I chose the certificates. Theye were to be slid under the door the first morning. No show. Called Guest Services 'we are so sorry, first I have heard it it' she said. Second morning, same thing. I asked for a manager. The front desk manager called. First she had heard of it too. I asked if they have a log book. Sure she said. I suggested she take a look. hird morning same issue. I will say eveeryone is nice, not attitudes. But it appears these folks have received no training from management. Or if they did a refresher course needs to be given. There are many maintenance issues in this hotel. The revolving door in the north tower valet is broken. Sand and dirt are every where in this hotel. It would help if they had a foot shower coming in from the beach to the north tower, that may help. The carpets in the halls are stained really bad. The tile on the main floor look like they have not be polished in months. One day we came back from tjhe beach to our room at three. It had not been serviced, the do not disturd sign was not on the door. We tiook showers and called the front desk when we left at five. They said someone knocked and we told them not to clean the room or leave fresh towels. On the second day I left a message for the manager, he was not in the building, with the front desk manager. We never heard from him. I will bet he responds to this post. I would suggest you contact me direct, as you have my contact info. Want to see my photos of the room and disgusting house keeping? Let me know. Now, you may ask why did I stay there and not check out and go to the Hampton Inn up the street? I prepaid for the rooms, they would not refund them to me. We booked this hotel thinking they would be better than the Hampton, boy were we wrong. Folks, don't bother staying at this Hilton. We were really disapointed due to having just left the Hilton in Orlando earlier that same week. There is no compairison.

We found the Hilton to fit out needs. When we first arrived we were greeted with smiles. We got our stuff from the car and checked in. We had around a 10 minute wait which wasnt so bad because we could watch the waves behind the desk through the windows. We were checked in by a nice man who fulfilled all our requests! We had 2 rooms. One on the 11th floor and one on the 7th floor in the south tower. The south tower is closer to everything except ocean walk village. The south tower has the resturaunts, the check-in desk, and the gift shop. The north tower just had the steakhouse. Now let's go to the basic stuff. ROOM: We had two rooms that were the same. They were both ocean front rooms. The view was absolutely amazing!!! I spent about 30 minutes each day on the balcony. About the balcony, it's a small, one foot from the room balcony. So all you could do was stand on it. The beds were very confortable!!! They had like a cabana like backboard and a palmtree Florida designed comforter. I loved the bathroom design! There is a sink on the outside and a sink on the inside! The bath products were great too! The shower head had adjustable pressure and that was great! But the shower head was really old!!!! Talking about something old, THE TV!!!!!! This is 2012 Hilton! Not 2006!!! Haha but we didn't really use it anyway! But the old tv was kind of an eye sore. Anyway, we were very happy with our rooms!(1122 and 714) SERVICE: One word. OUTSTANDING!!!!!! The staff was so kind! The housekeepers were very polite and would say hi in tr hallways if they saw you. The check-in desk was so kind!!! And the resturaunt waiters were great! The staff was probobly the best I have ever seen! FOOD: We ate at Doc Bales, Hyde Park, and the sports bar. Doc Bales made the best omelet in the morning! For being a silver HH member we got free breakfast each morning! We ate at the sports bar fr lunch one time and it was good! Hyde park I don't think is owned by the hotel but it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Everything there tasted great! I recommend the early bird special! Soup or salad, entree, and a side for only 19.99!!!! My soup and side would have cost that much usually! Get there before 6:30 and your good. Every other meal we had at ocean walk village. (Bubba Gump, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, Cold Stone, ect.) LOCATION: AMAZING!!!! It's right on the beach!!!!! There is a beach volleyball court, boardwalk, clock tower, and even a Piet with rides close by! This hotel is prime real estate! Location wise at least! It's great!!!! They even have security on th boardwalk! They even asked us if they could see our room keys! That's something I like! Makes me feel much safer!!!!! CLEANLINESS: This is why it's 4 stars. The elevators really need to be cleaned! Thats the only thing!!!!!!! OVERALL: Would I stay again? Yes!!! I loved it! Everything was great!!!!

Both times were with my family (wife and two boys below age of 5). The first visit in March of 2011 was a well below average experience, so we were debating staying here again. However, I couldn't deny the hotel's location, its vicinity to everything else, and onsite activities. My wife needed to be able to entertain the boys onsite because I had to leave for work with the car for the day. So, we thought we'd give it another try as I believe EVERYONE deserves a second-chance. I'm glad we did. The valet and bell services were fabulous and the staff more than exceptional in their attitude and greetings. The front desk was equally pleasant (much improved upon from our first visit). Check-in was a little delayed, but they had a lot of folks checking in and were fully staffed at the desk. It seemed that they were doing the best they could. Since my first visit, I became a Hilton Honors Gold Member, which may have influenced their attitude towards me, but that would be speculating. Whatever the case, I requested an upgrade and they more than graciously obliged. I received a full king suite (great for the kids and family) on the 14th floor with a private balcony. Housekeeping was very friendly and courteous and helped us ensure a clean stay which can be difficult with two boys at the beach. As part of the Gold Member status, I received complimentary breakfast at Doc Bales. The wait staff was outstanding, even when we had two loud boys in the mix of a lot of business travelers. Believe it or not, our loud boys seemed to be a relief to the business atmosphere for the staff! Regarding the staffing overall, the hotel was superb. I've read a LOT of the reviews by other travelers on here and I do agree with the condition of the hotel. It is certainly \"dated.\" However, you must remember that this is a beach hotel at Daytona Beach. This isn't Palm Beach; this isn't Boca Raton. It probably is NOT in the best condition in Daytona, but it is certainly top 5 or top 3. Just remember how much the salt and sand will degrade ANYTHING. The first time we stayed in March 2011, we were in the North Tower and this time in the South Tower. I concur with others and highly recommend staying in the South tower as it seems it was in better condition than the North. There are certainly little things that I noticed, like in the bathroom that need to be repaired (shower faucet nob fell off) and the door key reader didn't function correctly. The hotel needs to upgrade the TV service. I didn't count, but at most, there were 15 channels (one appropriate for kids). They claim that the pool is heated, but maybe that's a relative term. We were able to get in with the kids, but I wouldn't say it was warm. The pool certainly needed to be cleaned; I would say that the pool is NOT a selling point. As I said earlier, we ate breakfast at Doc Bales each morning and was pleasantly surprised. They had a wonderful spread buffet for breakfast, including a omlet bar. However, for a family, I'm not sure I'd pay over $10 per person for it (I had complimentary passes). In summary, I would return to the hotel again if I was wanting to be on the beach and only in the hotel to sleep/eat. They have to upgrade the tv service before I'd stay for business, as I like to watch tv in my hotel when I'm on business. Not much to watch here. I can't say enough how pleasant all the staff members were and how wonderful the location is. Maybe this is a hit or miss...certainly could use some improvement.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburndale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Abrndale", "ReviewID": "UR124697195", "Content": "I am a Hiliton Diamond guest and stayed at this hotel in August 2011. During my stay in August I experienced several service issues. My closet door kept falling off the track. I requested it be fixed and left several notes on the door that it was not working. After 4 times of requesting it be fixed I finally left a firm note expressing my displeasure and again requested it be fixed. They still did not get it fixed. I finally had to go to the front desk and escalate this to a manager to get it fixed. Then there was the problems with valet delays in getting my car. Then one day of my stay I had a live Palmetto Bug in the room . I killed the bug myself and purposefully left the carcass to see if the housekeeper would remove it. It was never touched. Finally I took a picture of it and emailed it to the general manager, with copies to the assistant manager and front desk manager. Again I expressed my displeasure. I had no response from anyone. On check out I again requested to speak with the manager and expressed my displeasure of the lack of service at the Hilton. I got through to the Front Desk Director who expressed apologies for the stay. As a good faith gesture since I was a Diamond guest and to assure my return business he offered a complimentary return stay. I took the manager up on this offer and the return visit was no better. There were more service issues. On check in the desk clerk advised that the valet parking was covered by the manager as well as the room charges. She asked if I planned to charge anything to the room. I told her \"No\" and she said OK and did not request a credit card. Well two days into my stay I requested my car from the valet and was informed that they could not give me my car. I asked them why and was loudly told for \"non payment of my bill\". This was in the presence of other guests. I then went to the front desk and was told that they would not release my car to me until I paid my valet bill and placed a credit card on the account for charges. I told the clerk on check in they advised valet parking was being covered by the manager and that a credit card was not needed. Again, the clerk told me they would not release my car until I paid the valet bill. I asked to speak with the manager and after a period of time the manager that originally approved my stay came out from the back. I advised that it was his desk clerk that said parking was part of the complimentary stay. He said sorry, I was hoping this would not come to this. He never requested a credit card and finally had my car brought to me. Why was my car held hostage for non payment or a credit card when the manager never requested on either? While walking in the hall I noticed clean towels and bed sheets placed on the dirty stained carpet. My question is would the manager like to sleep on linen that had been on a dirty floor or use towels from the floor? Probably not. One day our room was not cleaned. Service in the restaurant for breakfast was poor on three days. Servers were noted complaining about their jobs and how overworked they were rather than serving customers Television reception is not very good in the hotel. Old TV's with limited channels and fuzzy pictures. No blankets on the beds. The only consistently good thing going for this hotel is the location on the beach. I was hoping my return experience would have been better, since the manager assured the issues on the first stay were not normal for this hotel.

Let's start with the good parts of this Hilton first: - check in was easy and smooth We had our room pretty quick. - location is admirable There are many shops and restaurants within half a mile. - pleasing sight of the ocean Our room was on the 9th floor and we had clear view of the beach. We'd leave the sliding door open at night to hear the ocean waves sing us a soothing lullaby. Precious! - the staff is polite and helpful that includes the servers in the restaurants within the hotel, bellhop, housekeeping personnel, but not the front desk and the rest of the management team Now the unpleasant side: - billing troubles Five days into our stay, the hotel gave us an invoice with charges for daily parking when in fact, we only parked our rental car overnight since we drove from MCO to Hilton. We returned the car to Budget at DAB after 24 hours of renting it. Hilton took a few days before they finally cleared us of the unnecessary parking fees. I won't write a lengthy story about all the other holds that they have done in my card and my best friend's card but it's enough for everyone to know that my best friend had to seek the management everyday for three days to lift the hold that they repeatedly put on his card. Even after checking out and paying the full amount, it took another one full week until the hold that they put in the middle of our stay in my credit card has been lifted completely. The business center doesn't seem to be a part of this Hilton either. The hotel directs all packages to the business center and it charges a \u201clittle amount\u201d to a package, the fee varies on the weight and size of the box. I had a 1.5-pound pair of shoes shipped from Amazon and the business center charged me $3 when I picked it up from them after an hour of its delivery. Also, my best friend and I informed Hilton that instead of checking out on February 5, we would check out on February 4. We gave them that notice on January 29 and in response, they told us that they would charge us $50 for early check-out. After a few days of negotiation, they finally agreed to waive the $50 on the very day of our check-out. I understand the fees for state tax and county occupancy tax but the Hilton itself adds so many other charges on top of things. It's not like their rooms look very good. - insufferable restaurants within the hotel Restaurants in Daytona Beach are generally not good at all but Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse, Legends Sports Bar, Doc Bales' Grill just make things worse. In life, there's food that looks appetizing but tastes terrible and there's food that has unlikely presentation that tastes delicious. Yet, those three restaurants in the Hilton serve food that neither look appetizing nor taste well. I don't mind paying for food as long as it's very much worth my money. I live in CA and I know what good food really is. The servers in Doc Bales' are a friendly bunch though. - pool for display only If the main pool wouldn't be heated, why not drain it? It's pretty useless. - old gym equipment Our local YMCA does so much better than their gym. - room is substandard No blanket ever, just a thin sheet and very old comforter. Same size pillows, very tiny and uncomfy. Cleaning lady comes to clean but sometimes puts stained towels. Really gross linen. The tub has some sort of stain which looks like rust but cannot be removed. Trash bins are too tiny. No fridge or microwave. Summary I don't mind paying well as long as I receive what my money is worth for. Clearly, this Hilton is a waste of everything, except for its location. I've never stayed in a hotel as terrible as this one and obviously, I have no wish to come back, nor do I recommend this to anybody. Just do your homework and check out other places to stay if you really have to be in Daytona Beach for an important reason. Otherwise, just avoid Daytona Beach all together if you are thinking of vacation.

Across the street requires you use the hotels room card to go in and out of the parking lot (it's pretty simple to use). Valet has you parked in a parking garage filled with pigeons (lots of fecal matter). Valet is $17 a day and across the street $10.55 (tax included) a day. I strongly suggest going across the street as it's not too far away and there are always plenty of parking spaces. Priceline fraudulent listing: they have on their site that this hotel is a 3 and a half star hotel even though the hotel confirms to be a 3 star hotel only. In fact Priceline had this hotel as a 4 star hotel until claims were filed against Priceline because of the false hotel star rating giving on their website for this hotel. I got this room at $50 (after Priceline taxes $61 a night). The Priceline website has this hotel listed at $159.00 and up a night. I was given a room looking over the city, on the top floor. I was able to see the inlet, bridges and the city view from my view. The ocean was not seen or heard from my room. No fridge or microwave in the room. Hotel charges about $10 a night for WI fi use; unless you want to go to lobby area to roam WI fi for free (this area was inundated with people using their laptops and other similar devices all day long. This hotel does allow pets ($50) a night. Neither of the pools was heated even though I was told otherwise. Three hot tubs (one was down/out of service), suggest using the outside one as the indoor one feels way too hot due to no fresh air or breezes blowing on you (Hotel: at least get some fans around the indoor hot tub). Plenty of different places to eat at inside the hotel, however the prices were so overpriced, I didn't bother with any of them; there were plenty of nearby restaurants to choose from outside of the hotel. What is near by: Two comedy clubs, one was really close not sure of the name and the other Bonkers was about two miles away, both on same rd. as hotel. A water park (closed during offseason). Science Museum (was closed when I attempted to go on Sat). Tons of rentals places for motorcycles, bikes, boats, etc. And of course the speedway where they have the Daytona 500 is about 4-5 miles away. More about the hotel; the room was fine, beds were good, nothing special. The TV was huge, about 46 inches. Next to no balcony, in fact I strongly suggest you don't lay a foot outside your room because your feet won't fit beyond the sliding glass door section. I was aware of this hotels cheapskate ways so I wasn't shocked at their 'extras' and what more they cost you, however I will make it my business to find a hotel that cares about the customer and includes what you need with the hotel night bill, even if the bill is more.

I've stayed at this hotel numerous times over the years and have seen it change over those years also. The property claims to be a three diamond resort but struggles to meet those requirements. They have several outlet restaurants and bars on the property but they are seasonal and don't all ever seem to be open at the same time (other than the summer time season) Nice pool area for guests with a pool bar that may or may not be open when your there. The rooms are standard and the beds are nice and comfortable. The big draw to this hotel is it's location. Right on the Beach and Boardwalk in the center of the beachside community. You can walk to anything you might want to do. Shopping, movies, arcades and restaurants are all right there. There is a convention center and a water-park right across the street. The amount of money you spend will depend on the time of year you stay. You need to check the Daytona Chamber website for event dates in Daytona. That standard room that they charge $89 for during the slow periods will cost you $350 a night during any of their Bike or Car Racing events. The property is nice but the employees are the drain. Turnover is a big issue with only a few employees staying for more than a year. This puts a drain on the type of service you get. The wait in the outlet restaurants is VERY long and if they are busy you better be prepared for a hour and a half - two hour meal period. Legends (their sports bar) is the nicest spot for a drink and is open everyday. Prices are steep and it's really kind of silly to pay the Hilton prices when there is a Sloppy Joe's, Kerr's Wing House and Bubba Gumps 50 yards away with much cheaper prices.

I rarely post to websites but I will start by saying the negative reviews on this site are completely accurate. Back in November we booked a king size oceanfront with terrace for New Year's Eve. Upon check in the lady informed me they \"upgraded\" my room to a Junior Suite because they are a \"full service\" hotel and \"they thought it would be better for me\". I explained that if I thought it would be better, I would have booked that particular room in the first place. The new \"upgraded\" room did not have a balcony or terrace, which is my reason for staying oceanfront in the first place. After going back and forth she checked with her manager and explained there were no other rooms available...how convenient. After finally accepting that the all-knowing Hilton knows what's best for me, I proceeded to the front area where I parked the car. After loading the bellhop cart, they were nice enough to let me know they had to wait for a bellman to take my bags up. I told them it wasn't necessary that I can unload the bags myself. Another guy explained that they are a \"full service\" hotel and company policy would not allow me to take my own bags up. Somehow this \"full service\" seemed like nothing more than a hassle. After 10 minutes I was gracious enough to finally have a bellman take the cart up. (There were 4 carts ahead of me and if I didn't talk the guy into taking my cart next the wait easily would have been 1/2 hour). The parking was just as horrible in this \"full service\" hotel. If you choose to self-park, prepare to make 2 lefts out of the hotel just to get back onto Atlantic Ave. then drive to an outside, unmanned, unsecure parking lot behind a rib shack. Verrrrrrry classy parking for a Hilton. Oh yeah, prepare to walk over 2 blocks just to get back to the Hilton. Very convenient for a \"full service\" hotel. By this time we were just exhausted and angry so we decided to order a pizza. How pleasantly surprised we were when the front desk called and told us to come to the lobby to pick up our delivery order. Company policy at this \"full service\" hotel does not allow delivery drivers to the room. Doesn't seem too convenient to go down 7 flights then walk across the lobby to pick up food in this \"full service\" hotel. The walls are very thin in this place. I have never been to a \"full service\" hotel that allows wild packs of black teenagers running the halls at 4 in the morning. It must be a new policy. Checking out was just as bad. The walk back to the car is just a pain after a long weekend and waiting for a bellman again. When he finally did come up I told him to wait for one minute and he left. He never came back so we didn't even ask for another bellhop cart and hauled all of our luggage (with stroller) out of this \"full service\" hotel. To be fair, they did give us free breakfast and $10 off each day for the inconvenience, but I have had better service and way less hassle at the Days Inn, which is most definitely not billed as a \"full service\" hotel.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olean, New York", "Title": "\u201cAnother great Daytona Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Patrick L", "ReviewID": "UR122342392", "Content": "So i will start off saying this is a comparison review, Hilton vs. Holiday Inn.Hilton is a fantastically opulent atmosphere rite from the start, when u pull up into the turnaround to check in they have so many bright lights tastefully done u feel like u should be in a limo for this \"Hollywood Premiere\" feel it gives you. Absolutely 1st rate. I also stayed at the Holiday Inn LPGA Blvd. This place also exudes class from the beginning with its marble floors and granite counter tops. Now comes the big differences....The Hilton has rooms on the beachfront, so fantastic views. Holiday Inn is \"inland\", to use the local parlance.This means that you are surrounded by pines,no real views, but close to all the shopping(it's across the street from an automall...im in heaven!!!!! The Hilton is on A1A, but in an area that I imagine would b prone to heavy traffic during the events(races, bike week,spring break).Excellent spot to be at if you don't plan to drive much...I do, so Holiday in would be my choice during peak events.Off season, Hilton for sure!!! tHE Holiday Inn is relatively new im told...not yet 3 yrs. However, you would think such a beautiful place would be on its A game 24/7. While i was in the lobby on the second or third day of my stay, they were actually turning guests away because the manager had been on the check in desk that day and forgot to send the cleaning orders for the empty rooms to housekeeping, so they had 75 uncleaned rooms at 3 pm(official ckeck in time), and they had to turn away 75 would-be patrons. So if you are in the Daytona area, two great places to stay, but do a check to be sure your room will be ready on arrival. That will be a new routine for me.

We chose to stay overnight in this hotel on our way to a conference just to get that late season look at the sea. As a Hilton Diamond I paid for a standard King, and was upgraded on arrival to a Ocean View room. The cost of the room was $99 for the night, but could have been almost $300 if we had paid the full price for the room we received. Neither room is worth the price, but you are paying for location, but location is not always everything despite the saying! You have to remember that this hotel is in Daytona, and is a tourist class resort hotel, and not what you are going to get staying in a Hilton in say Bali. The rooms are way smaller than some hotels on the side of an Interstate, and ours was no exception. Remember also that this hotel is in a typical seaside entertainment complex, complete with a funfair, cinema, and low quality dining. This is were I\u2019d expect to see working class families running wild come the summer months, and is not the place for those of us who expect luxury and top service when on holiday. If you want that level of hotel look elsewhere, and probably don\u2019t even stay in Daytona. The hotel is tired, and in great need of a facelift. The corridors are old, worn, and although generally clean, are off putting. The buildings windows and window frames are filthy and salt marked and heavily weathered as well as corroded in places, and have not been cleaned in an age. Maybe this is out of season and they\u2019ll wash them in time for summer, who knows. For some unknown reason the corridors had their air blasting 24hrs a day and set at 60 deg which made for a chilly walk back to your room. The room we stayed in has a good view, and the large sliding patio door enable us to lay on the bed and watch the waves. We were close to the funfair, and I\u2019d probably want to me much father away in summer once the pumping bass is going, and it\u2019s got a 1000 screaming kids running a mock until midnight! The bathroom was almost too small to move in, and a second sink was located opposite the closet in the main bedroom to give you somewhere extra to wash. The bathroom is of the type you\u2019d expect to find in a 1 star motel. The shower head was ancient, and barely wheezed into action when coaxed to supply water, and was more like standing under the garden hose. No raindrop shower here! I had requested extra towels in advanced, and these were delivered to the room after we arrived after the request was noticed at check in. The biggest problem was where to put them with the bathroom being so small! The TV is an old 4:3 CRT type, and 50% of the advertised TV channels were not working, and we often saw the \u2018contact Direct TV\u2019 message as the subscription was not valid. Hmmm... Internet is chargeable and a wired affair, and inline with other reviewers this is way past due for an upgrade. Free wifi is the standard for today, and not 10 bucks a day for a wired connection. Not much use for your iPad etc. You can get free wifi in the lobby. The bed was comfortable, as most Hilton beds are, but the duvet has seen better days. You know when you get big bits of cover without any padding when you try and change your duvet cover, well that\u2019s how old the duvet in the cover was, except it had just lost it\u2019s padding with age. It was unusually cool for Florida so we could have done with the extra. Something I laughed about, but that also shows the tourist class nature of the hotel, was the large boot marks I found on the curtain pelmet. I was leaning out of the window admiring the view, and turned back to look into the room. I glanced upwards, and the board that hid the curtain rail etc had great big boot marks on its unpainted backside surface. Obviously when this was installed it was not painted on the side that faces outwards, and was not even wiped down. I guess they assumed no one would see it. Parking is pay per night, and you can choose $10 park it yourself, or $17 valet. The breakfast is free to a Diamond Honors member, but chargeable to non status members. The breakfast is a buffet affair, and offers a range of hot and cold fayre. The hot selections were not great, suffering as most do from drying out and over cooking in the heat that keeps them warm. They also offer a table service menu at extra cost. I won\u2019t dwell on the food in itself other than to say you\u2019ll get better food eating out and save money into the bargain. I get free breakfast so we decided to eat in. I opted for cereals and toast (another useless bargain basement toaster that takes an eternity to make the bread luke warm!) but my wife chose the \u2018pastries and bread route\u2019. She had all but finished a piece of banana cake when she stopped, looked at me in horror, and said look at this! Large green spots of hairy mould were staring at us, on the cake she had almost finished eating. I immediately stood up and in shouted over at the restaurant manager. He was naturally very embarrassed and extremely apologetic. We even heard him as he stormed into the kitchen and threw the remains of the cake at the chef. Needless to say this cut our breakfast short. In fairness to the manager he immediately went to see the hotel manager, and they zero\u2019d the bill for the entire stay, wiping out a $130 charge. I\u2019m sure that this is not typical of Hilton, and I\u2019m sure after this incident staff will improve or be replaced in the kitchen, but it was a very distressing incident. Perhaps being out of season they were trying to stretch the food out! Uneaten food should always be disposed of daily, or better still donated to a homeless shelter, and not constantly recycled for guest consumption to save a few dollars. So overall this is a fair standard tourist class hotel, that caters for holidays for the less demanding traveller, and has much lower class accommodations than a big city Hilton hotel. However the cost of a stay is still in the luxury price range, and way overpriced for what you\u2019ll receive. Stay away from the beach and pay less for a lot more. Location is great for the summer as long as you accept it will be noisy and rowdy throughout your stay. Parking is expensive with few other options, and the dining costs in the hotel are cost prohibitive, especially given the food is far short of gourmet. The price of a glass of coke, and a can of Redbull was $9! So bring your own drinks.

The price for valet service at the hotel is 18.11 per night tax included.(not a surprise because we read it in the reviews). Most Hotels on the beach charge to park. You could save a few bucks if you park in their lot across the street for $10. a night.(who wants to walk in the heat to your truck) Upon checkin we were greeted by a greeter and waited about 5 min for checkin. Grace at the front desk checked us in. We asked for a room in the south tower(reviews said that the north tower is not as nice as the south), She said that wouldnt be a problem. We also asked for a oceanfront room after she said no problem to stay in the south tower. She upgraded us to a king oceanfront room on the 8th floor overlooking the beach, ferris wheel, boardwalk, and bungi slingshot. What a Great view and nice room. The room was clean, the linens were clean, and it smelled clean. The only downside was the decor was a little dated as well as the TV. Overall we were very happy with the room. We ate on property at Legends one night. the food and staff were great! We also ate at Hyde Park on Sunday night and had the $19.90 special(Best Deal) and an additional $6. for the filet. Food was great as well as the service. We ate at Bubba Gumps and a few local places. Food everywhere was great. The only thing I didnt like was that they charge $10. a night additional for wired internet. I have a smartphone so we didnt use that service. There is however free wireless in the lobby if you need it. The housekeeping service did a good job except one day when I requested extra towels on a note next to my $5. tip, they didnt leave the extra towels but did take the tip anyway. So on checkout day I only left $2. I dont mind tipping hotel staff for good service. $12. for our stay with housekeeping $22 with Valet, and $4. for the bellhop who helped us when we checked out. We went to a few local places for drinks on and off the boardwalk. Be fair warned to be careful at night on the side streets. We saw quite a few homeless and thugs. We had no problems except for beggers. The police in Daytona are on the ball. They were everywhere, on the beach in trucks, on bikes and on foot on the boardwalk. We also saw a few zip by on segways. They do control the area and the trash does not. We felt secure at all times when near the hotel and beach. Keep up the good work DPD. I wish I could book directly with the hotel at this rate but they said they dont offer rooms at that price. I'm sure we will be back.(through name your price on priceline) We are very happy we stayed at the Daytona Hilton. It was Great! Thank you Hilton!

We were also disappointed that there wasnt a fridge in the room. From our room in this hotel, we had sooo much walking to get anywhere. Having to haul beach toys back and forth was such a hassle. The pools in this hotel were also extremenly bad. Having only 2 pools for such a big hotel shocks me. The 2 pools they do have are very disappointed. They were so dirty and looked like the sand hadnt been cleaned out of them in weeks. We found that the pool on the 5th floor was almost always out of clean towels and we saw dirty towels sit there for days. Also, the hot tub had broken jets and so much sand in it. Overall, these pools are horrible. The resturant inside this hotel is good however extremenly pricey. The food at the resturant was defintly the best thing about this hotel. The parking situation is horrible. Having an unattented lot across the street simply made us way too nervous so we opted for valet parking. However, every time we called to get our car we would show up when they said it would be there and we would have to wait another 5-10 minutes for it to get there.

Among the areas visited was Daytona Beach where we stayed at the Hilton Oceanwalk. Of all the hotels on Daytona Beach, the Hilton was likely one of the best if not the best, as there is still activity around the boardwalk, which is nearby. A new mall that includes some eating places is also on that end of the beach. It was nice to have some food options as there are few along the Daytona Beach strip. Our stay at the Hilton Oceanwalk was nice. Staff \"upgraded\" us to the north tower of this HUGE hotel, but I'm not really sure it was an upgrade. Our room, while spacious, was just an ordinary hotel room and quite tired looking at that. Definitely needs a remodel, but it was comfortable. The hotel did a nice job of combining two hotels together but there are still two lobbies, two pools, and a lot of walking. That was not really a downside to us though. We spent our time on the beach instead of at the pool and the beach is as nice as ever. The pools looked very inviting too. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was phenomenal. Well worth the price--lots of fresh fruit! The staff we met were very hospitable and friendly. Overall we were very satisfied at this hotel. By the way, it is close to the convention center too, if you have an event there. I rated the hotel average, but considering how old many Daytona Beach businesses have become, it was probably one of the best places to stay. For the area it was perhaps above average. Daytona Beach overall looked tired and impoverished. While the beach is as beautiful as ever, the whole area needs a big infusion of TLC. It was sad to see how one of our favorite areas had deteriorated. We hope once the economy picks up that it becomes a thriving, lively place once again.

The rooms is spacious (that's a plus) .. accustomed to larger, flat planel tvs now - it was discouraging to see a 19inch (or something like that) regular tv. For the size of the room, the tv was too small. We had a city view. But, be warned if you pay for oceanview, the balcony area is very small. You can stand but can not sit there. I didn't have problems with loud noise from the boardwalk or anything. In fact, I thought the room/hall noise was very minimal. We slept well.

PARKING: Very inconvenient. You either pay $17 for Valet, or you park yourself across the street in an open-spaced parking lot.

The check-in was a nice and easy process. We all noticed when we first pulled up that the Valet check-in was running quite behind. They took about 20 minutes to get our luggage and our car, but since we were already driving for about 12 hours, it was not even a thought in our mind. Once we checked in, we were offered an upgrade for $40 a night for an oceanfront room, we accepted the offer and gladly checked in. Once in the room, we noticed the non-upgraded rooms that still had old tv's, no refrigerators, and not a Hilton type look in the room. I, along with the rest of my travelers, have stayed at multiple Hilton hotels each year and have always had better accommodations than what we were staying in. We honestly didn't have great expectations since it was on the beach, but with a Hilton name, we expected a lot better quality than what we received. We had no washcloths for 3 days in a row. When we called down each day, they asked if we had them to return....the housekeeping took them everyday but never put new ones back in place of the used. Each time we called down for washcloths or any other request, they took over an hour to respond. Along with the housekeeping, the shower had the same areas of mold after asking the housekeeping staff to try to remove it. They never removed in throughout our stay. The valet would tell you that the car would be ready in 10 minutes, but when we walked down over 20 minutes later, they hadn't even retrieved the car after we had called 20 minutes beforehand. If you want a hotel with a name, stay here, but don't expect anything over a Holiday Inn quality. There are a lot more hotels on the strip next to the Ocean Walk area that would offer better service than this hotel. We all hope that the Hilton bought this hotel for its location and not for its service.

The vast majority of the oceanview rooms are empty. Wouldn't it make good business sense to put customers in those rooms when they're available so that it increases the likelihood that they would stay at the hotel again in the future? If the hotel was even half way full, I could see the need to hold the good rooms for last minute reservations. But the hotel is dead empty, and the front desk attendant wants to nickel and dime for a room above the third floor. It's unfortunate that they don't take advantage of the opportunity by spoiling the customers they're lucky enough to have. Also, one other pet peeve of my stay so far, we valeted our car overnight. We dropped the car off at the south tower and are staying in the south tower but have to walk a city block to the north tower to pick up the car when we need it. Once again, if the hotel was busy, I could see the need to force the flow of traffic in that direction, but there is nobody here. The hotel and location are good for daytona beach, but the lack of customer service etiquette is ruining this hotel's chances of thriving. Trust me, look around for other hotels.

The hotel's location is excellent. It is right on the beach, near main street and many attractions you come for in Daytona Beach. However, my overall experience with this hotel was not a good one. First, there are two towers, the \"newer\" and \"older\" tower. You have no idea where you check in. I stood in line to check in for what seemed like an eternity. There was only one person behind the desk while there were a couple of othjer employees just milling around behind the desk. Finally after a while, one relictantly took the next person in line. If you have the misfortune of staying in the other tower, you must get back ionto your car and drive up half a block in order to gop to your room. The room was clean and had some of the amenities you would expect from a Hilton. The bed was comfy abd them place was clean. I do have a big issue with this hotel. For what they charge a night, all you get is a room and the ability tio say you stayed at a fancy place. Quite frankly, I though that they gouger you for everything else. If you drive to the hotel, your choice of parking is to either park at an unsecure public lot across a very busy street for about $9 a day or valet your car wuith the hotel for $19!! a day. If you think that by valeting you will have quick access to your car, you can forget it. the wait was pretty bad. the other thing that I think they gouge you on is that you have to pay for Internet. Most hotels these days offer free high speed Internet, not this one when I stayed. For the price they charge you to stay a night, you would think that something as basic as Internet woul;d be included. Both the parking situation and the Internet situation really turned me off to this place. The staff seemed indifferent, the place was pretty empty the weekend I stayed there and it sometimes felt like I was walking through a ghosttown becazeu the palce is so large. Overall the place is okay, buit fior what you pay, you can get a better deal elsewhere. If you like to travel and stay at places where the most important thing is status, then I guess this place is oh, but if you want some value for your money, go elsewhere.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThis is a Hilton Hotel right?\u201d", "Author": "Eaglepack", "ReviewID": "UR74973769", "Content": "We stayed at the Ocean Front Hilton in Daytona Beach over the first weekend in August and we were disappointed with a number of issues we had during our stay. First off when we arrived we were early but we expected to drop our bags and walk around the area and have some lunch. The front desk, and valets couldn't handle the volume of people checking in. Cars were parked in the street just waiting to get to the valets, and the bell hops stacked everyone's luggage into a corner of the lobby which didn't seem too safe to us. We were told the front desk would call us when our room was ready, but after eating lunch and walking around for hours with no call from the Hilton we decided to check with them, and were told our room was ready for some time. We then got stuck in an evelator, and later we noticed a different elevator was broken. Later that evening at midnight there was a fight on the boardwalk below, which happened to be 10 floors below, but it sounded like it was right outside our window. We were so uncomfortable that we checked out early the next morning even though we had prepaid for the entire weekend. On a positive note the hotel has a number of different dining options, and an attached area with a half dozen other restaurants, shopping, amusement parks, and a movie theater.The pools were beautiful, but too small to handle the amount of guests that can stay at the hotel.

Towels were provided at both pools, eliminating the need to bring our own, including full length beach towel size, if you got there early enough. Location is one of the main advantages to the Hilton. It is adjacent on one side to the Main Street pier and on the other to the Ocean Walk Shoppes, including the historic band shell. Some of the North Tower rooms are great seats for the band shell concerts. Across the street is the auditorium, and most of the beach rentals of bicycles, pedal carts, wave boards, and chairs are done right in front of the hotel. There were several restaurants in the hotel and a spa. It is an all non-smoking hotel but animals are allowed, so you may want to check if you have allergies. Our Priceline ($50 per night...thanks biddingfortravel.com) room is on the 3rd floor & is ocean front, overlooking the pool. No complaints. The room is average size & the walls are thin. We heard the alarm next door go off at 6:00 am & the tv next door...just turned ours up louder. Valet parking is $17 per day while Hilton self parking across the street behind the bar-b-que restaurant is $10. There really is no where else to park. The public parking garage across the street does not allow over night parking & while there is metered street parking, it is 25 cents for 15 minutes from 9 am to 11 pm. There is no other parking option. The restaurant (Hyde Park) here has a great happy hour (4:30-6:30PM) deal with 15+ drink/martini choices for $4 & appetizers for $5. There is also a dinner for $19.99 which includes soup or salad, entree, side which was a great deal. We plan on going back tonight & trying the cucumber martini. The folks we talked to at the bar last night had eaten there two nights in a row. We had the crab cakes & steak & they were great!

Check in did take a bit longer than expected, but it wasn't anything to complain about. The rooms and look was overall very nice. It would probably be nicer if it was a different city, but the location makes up for that. We didn't really do anything in Daytona Beach, other than actually going to the beach. The rooms were very nice and clean. We enjoyed the 2 sinks (one was outside of the bathroom). Whenever we needed something, they would get it for us but they always expected a tip. I kind of expected this, but they did seem like they wouldn't like you very much if you didn't give them a tip. I think the $10 internet rate is also pretty expensive, but we used it for one day. The food court was just okay and was kind of expensive, but it was really convenient. There was some convention thing going on and there were a bunch of teenagers there. Most of them were loud, obnoxious, and annoying, but a few of them were nicer and tried not to be bothersome. Being so close to be beach is very convenient. The South Tower Pool was very nice as well. The hotel can't really do anything about it though. I do like that the hotel management responds to reviews.

My wife and I are Diamond Level Hilton Honors members. We have stayed at Hilton properties all across the U.S. as well as internationally - Barbados, Paris, Barcelona, New York, Atlanta, Orlando, etc in the last 6 months alone and the Daytona Hilton was disappointing overall. I grew up in Daytona and actually worked at this hotel back in the early 90's as a valet during the summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college when it was a Marriott and before the addition of the North Tower and the Ocean Walk. My father and his family still live in the area, Port Orange, and was looking forward to coming \"home\" to visit and revisit my old stomping grounds. We stayed in a Cabana Suite in the North Tower which I recommend. The rooms were clean and adequate on the ground level, allowing you to walk out your door and literally be 100 feet from the beach. Unfortunately, the cabana rooms seem to be largely ignored. During our 4 day stay in the room, our room was only cleaned once and we had to go to the front desk to request it. As far as the service, it is largely inconsistent. The front desk was basically incompetent. When we checked in we were told they didn't have a reservation for us even though we had a reservation number, confirmation, and print out from Hilton.com. We were then informed that this Hilton is owned by a \"Pyramid LLC\" and not Hilton, which gave us the impression that they didn't feel obligated to provide the usual Hilton level of service, which proved to be accurate. As part of our package, we were provided with 3 free breakfast buffet coupns every morning, and out 3 year old was free. Some mornings they accepted the coupons, other monrings we had to go to the front deck to have the charges removed, some mornings they charged for the 3 year old, some mornings they didn't. One morning they charged my wife the full $20 breakfast buffet even though she only had a single cup of coffee and didn't eat anything. The breakfast buffet food quality was nice, with fresh fruit, omelete/egg station, and the usual assortment of breakfast meats, pastries, waffles/pancakes, cereals, cheeses, smoked salmon, etc. The service (friendly and attentive) and food quality was great, it was just the inconsistency with the bill every morning. We decided to stay an extra day as we were all really enjoying the beach, but again, dealing with the front desk to lengthen our stay was an exercise in futility. Basically, we had to go back to our room, make a reservation online, then go back to the front desk and re-register. Unfortunately, it was Friday and there were several large groups checking in so no cabana's were available for that night and we had to move to a deluxe room. No problem, we understood, but when we went to check out, they charged us the cababa room rate for the last night when we stayed in a deluxe room which was less than half the price. On checkout, we ended up with over $400 of erroneous charges that had to be backed out due to being overcharged for the room and for the breakfasts which we were supposed to get for free. A couple of other points: the valet deck hardly ever answers the phone if you want to call for you car ahead, so you're stuck with going down there and waiting 15 minutes for them to bring it out. Also, there are 2 valet stands, one in the South Tower, one in the North Tower, since we were staying in the North Tower we used that valet, yet half the time we had to go to the South Tower to get our car even though we dropped it off at the North Tower. Watch at for the security nazi's at the pool. My family and I were at the pool one day and I was practically berated by some pseudocop security guard who questioned me if I was a guest the hotel. He asked my for my name and room number, even after I showed him my room key card and wanted to call it in on his walkie-talkie. Sorry, but I'm not giving my room number out to a stranger because for all I know he's calling his buddies to ransack my room since he knows I'm at the pool. They don't have any problem letting you charge food and drink at the pool to your room but they give you the Guantanamo treatment to verify if you're a guest? After it was all said and done, no apology, just attitude. After that, we avoided the pool and stuck to the beach. Also, the drinks at the pool bar are ridculously overpriced and weak/watered down. A beer, a Hurricane, and 2 kiddie cocktails (7-UP with cherries and cherry juice) cost us $38, and the Hurricane was watered down. My wife asked for a rum floater to give it some flavor, an additional $6.35 for 1 ounce of rum. Speaking of the beach, that's the best thing about the Hilton. There are no cars on the beach around the Pier and Ocena Walk area (except the beach patrol) so it's a nice wide beach with pleanty of room for the kids to run around without worries of traffic. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't really support your beach activities.

The person at the front desk put us in a great oceanfront room, which we had hoped for but did not expect! The room itself was pretty nice. Unlike some reviewers, we liked the in-room coffeemaker. We also liked the fact that there were two sinks, one situated outside the bathroom. The beds were really comfortable too. The room could use a minor cosmetic refresh and a flat-screen TV to make it look more modern. A microwave and mini refrigerator would have been nice to have. Other than those minor issues, we liked the room a lot. Housekeeping did a really good job keeping things clean throughout our stay. However, we were at the very end of the hall and they always ran out of coffee cups and shampoo/conditioner before they got to us. This wasn't a huge problem. I just called for more and they brought them quickly and cheerfully. I don't think guests should have to call and beg for stuff that is supposed to be included though. The hotel is located right in the middle of the action. It is adjacent to the Ocean Walk Shoppes, as well as the boardwalk. Some reviewers mentioned that the area is trashy/seedy. The area isn't seedy, but I guess you could say it's a little bit rough around the edges. I kind of enjoy that myself, but to each their own. If you tend to walk around with something up your butt, you may want to consider vacationing at a different beach. While the location and room were great, the parking situation was not. Choices were self-parking for $10 a day or valet parking for $17 a day. We used the self-parking, which was located across the street. It was a real pain to get our luggage and cooler to the room. To make matters worse, as were checking in, a huge high school graduation was going on in the convention center across the street. This turned a short, simple drive from the hotel entrance to the parking lot into a nightmare situation, as lots of the streets were blocked off for the graduates. Without the graduation going on, parking and unloading our stuff would have been a lot easier. On a positive note, once we unpacked our luggage, we didn't mind the walk. We only had to get into the car once. Like I said, there's plenty to do right around the hotel. Also, I felt like my car was safe in their parking lot. There were a few generic looking restaurants in the hotel. We didn't try any of them. The only one that looked intriguing was Hyde Park, but we never got around to going there. The hotel food court was cheesy/outdated and completely empty. Nearby restaurants we enjoyed included Bubba Gump and Tailgater's. On past trips, I have also enjoyed the Mai Tai bar, which is also adjacent to the Ocean Walk movie theater next door. All in all, we were very happy with the Hilton Ocean Walk Village.

However, the majority of the property is a bit dated, and the karaoke bar that resonates through the lobby lends an unfortunate cheesy factor. Breakfast is not included. The in room internet is not complimentary. There is no airport shuttle. The in room coffee is of poor quality. There are no dedicated beach towels. The oceanfront rooms do have beautiful views, but they also look over the scruffy rooftops of lower structures and spotty landscaping. Whether these rooms are worth $200+ a night is a personal decision. This property does offer city view rooms for less. We did not use the workout facility or the spa. I agree with others that this is not a premier Hilton resort. The association of the Hilton name with luxury accommodations is sometimes a misnomer. While not one of their premium hotels, Ocean Walk is an adequate place to stay. Except for the sandy tub from the previous guest, our room seemed clean enough. Because this property exists in a constant saline environment, wear and tear happens very quickly. Management should keep on top of maintenance. Today, it is commonplace in the Hospitality Industry to extend a good cup of coffee, complimentary internet, and/or a small breakfast.

She decided she wanted to have a sleepover with 2 of her best friends, so I got two oceanfront rooms (connecting). We arrived around 2:30PM, which is earlier than the 4PM checkin. Despite that, I zipped through the HHonors line and we were checked in quickly. The bell captain helped us with our luggage and we were soon walking the long walk to the North tower (near Hydes). Upon arriving on our floor in the north tower (quite a walk), we noticed that we had only been given one key for one of the rooms, despite me asking for 2 room keys for each room. Fine - I marched back down to the front desk, and after being interrogated, I proved that I had just been down minutes earlier and was missing a room key. No big deal - security is important, but this could have been prevented had the front desk attendant been paying attention versus chatting with his coworkers. As I came to find out during my entire stay, the little details will get you at the Hilton Daytona. Getting back to the room, the first thing I noticed was that I did not have the in-room mini fridge I ordered via phone when I made the reservation. I called the front desk and was told there was a $10/night equipment rental fee. Fine, but this should have been disclosed up front when I asked for it...not to mention that nearly every other hotel I have stayed in offers this for free. I also noted that there was no mini-bar int he room, not that I would have used it, but the small touches you take for granted at other hotel chains are missing at Hilton - Daytona. The hotel itself was OK but seemed somewhat dated based on other hotels I have stayed at recently. The artwork was fantastic, but the overall look and feel was 1980's. The bed seemed comfortable, but the linens were dated - one bed had a heavy comforter on it and a sheet while the other one had a lightweight duvet cover and a sheet. The bathroom was somewhat dirty (floor) and the toilet in one of our rooms was difficult/impossible to flush. There was no hair dryer in one of the rooms. The room itself was small for the price point, but the view was spectacular. The room was also very quiet - I did not hear the other guests coming or going and the ocean noise was blocked unless you open the sliding glass door (with no balcony). The hotel doesn\u2019t really have any grounds. The hotel is situated right on the street, and then you have the beach, separated by a venue area. Externally, the hotel is not attractive compared to some of the others along the shore. The pool, situated about 1 floor up from the beach, was clean and of a sufficient size. There is a pool-bar nearby and accessible restrooms nearby as well. There is an indoor spa / whirlpool and the area is tastefully decorated, though like most of the hotel, the appearance is about 20 years dated. We did not use the spa, but it did look fairly decent. As I said before, the little details really add up. For example, there is no (working) foot wash, so when you make the long trek from the beach to the hotel, your feet will have to remain sandy. The hotel seems to be focused more on business travelers than being a beach resort. There are no (free) lounge chairs or any chairs outside the hotel for that matter, except for some City of Daytona style cement benches. Umbrellas and chairs will need to be rented at a fee. The pool is difficult to access, at least from the north tower - and the beach itself is rather inconvenient to access without a lot of twisting and turning to walk down various walkways. Accessing the pool area during lunch or dinner service hours is awkward as you sometimes find yourself walking amongst diners to reach the pool gate, unless you are approaching from inside the hotel...at which point you will have to wind past guests checking in. Could they make this place any less friendly for beach-goers? Room service is lacking at the Daytona Hilton. First, as an aside, there are many good dining options within walking distance, so room service should not be necessary in most cases. But in my case, I called the front desk to ask if they offered a birthday cake (and some milk) for the birthday girl and her friends in the adjacent room. I was told no at first, even though I had seen one being delivered to another guest earlier. Several hours later, I got a call back saying that it had been taken care of (a nice, surprising touch). However, the cake arrived 1.5 hours later than the time I specified...it's the small details that get to you. We had actually given up on getting the cake after calling room service to verify it a couple of times. One big minus was that there was no wireless internet access in the hotel. In addition, the wires internet access did not work for us in either of the rooms. As for other hotel services, I found the concierge lacking - we called down to get restaurant advice on the concierge line and were told \"I don't know...\" After asking if there was anyone who did know, we were transferred back to the front desk, where we were given some absolutely wrong advice about Rossellini's Italian. Valet parking is very expensive and very, very slow. It took them 20 minutes to retrieve my car, making us late for a dinner reservation once, and this was after I had called down 10 minutes before to get the car. So in total, it took them 30 minutes to get our car one time and about 20 minutes each subsequent time. Self parking is highly recommended, though parking anywhere in this area will cost you in both distance and money. One good thing about our stay was the Hilton Breakfast Buffet. I wisely opted for the Bed & Breakfast plan, which includes breakfast; otherwise, the bountiful breakfast spread would have been $20 each. However, the breakfast was quite good. Quite honestly, after staying at some West coast beach resorts, Daytona is sorely lacking in both amenities and service. There are some things to do with the kids at this hotel, such as a water park / arcade nearby, but the whole place seemed to be populated by business travelers dressed in business formal attire. I actually felt out of place wearing my beach attire on several occasions. It most certainly did not feel like a beach resort, despite the waves crashing within eyesight distance. It almost seems like Hilton has gone out of their way to discourage beach access! My advice is to choose another location. Perhaps the hotel chain next door is more suitable...it certainly looked nicer. But given the choice, I will not even go to Daytona again. I'm sure Daytona is excellent for Bike Week, Spring Break and NASCAR events, but I would not tag it as a vacation destination unless you expect to participate in the three things I just mentioned. Florida west coast beaches (or Amelia Island on the East Coast) and resorts are far superior if you are looking for that beach resort look and feel, as well as a quiet getaway.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cJust Super!\u201d", "Author": "TravelerOhiosk", "ReviewID": "UR60675294", "Content": "We moved over to the Hilton after one night at a run down hotel on the strip - And, let me tell you, it was the best move - we got a room at 9:30 a.m. (didn't have to wait until 4:00 p.m. normal check in time) The staff was wonderful - the valet, check-in, porter,the gift store, the beach towel guy - you name it, they where all super nice.

I differ quite emphatically with a previous reviewer's negative comments. I often lurk on this website but review rarely and feel compelled to give my very opposite impression of the cabana suite at Hilton Ocean Walk village. I agree with one item only from the previous reviewer. In the cabana suite, you must walk through the sleeping area to the toilet/shower room. So possibly three adults would be uncomfortable. But the bath and toilet room is entirely separated by a solid door. (The sink/vanity area is not separated by a door and is in a far alcove adjacent to the beds.) The pull-out couch in our suite was also in a separate room and divided by curtained french doors allowing for privacy. I differ strongly in all other aspects. The staff was utterly helpful to us at this hotel. From everybody's attitude, I would not hesitate to ask for a refrigerator had it been needed. Furthermore, I am confident it would have been provided gratis. Who cares if the ice machine is on the 3rd floor? I had staff tripping over themselves providing us ice in our bucket and taking our picnic cooler to be filled. Did I mention the service was wonderful? The car valets and concierge could not have been more helpful in locating nearby destinations. A previous reviewer cited a 1/4 mile hike to the lobby from the cabana suites. An impossible exaggeration, shame on that fib! There is a short walk up the stairs to the lobby or immediate access through the gift shop to the elevator or the next doorway south of the gift shop. We stayed in the cabana suite in 2009 also and it rained heavily for two days. There is maybe a 25 to 50-feet section of uncovered area to traverse and we simply used an umbrella. That very slight inconvenience was more than worth it considering other charms. The suite includes a covered porch where we enjoyed the rain and watching the drama of heavy seas during inclement weather. This brings me to the most delightful aspect of a cabana suite. Enjoying a glass of wine at your own private porch and table with friends at your ring-side seat to the ocean and a bandstand is incomparable.

April tends to still be a little chilly and cold but I'm a sucker for the beach so it didn't matter to me. We got a room with an ocean view right in front of the clock tower. The water was like sparkling jewels this weekend and the sky was absolutely clear and beautiful. I recommend leaving your sliding glass door open through out the night because the breeze and the sound of waves made it almost like heaven. Very relaxing!! One night we ordered in wings from a restaurant from the Ocean Walk and watched a great movie. Other nights you could dine at Bubba Gump which we've already done in past visits or enjoy nearby seafood restaurants or barbecue! Sometimes they have live bands outside in the courtyard where the clock tower locates.

The Cabana suite was nothing more than a room with a double bed and a pullout couch. I was under the impression that there were seperate sleeping quarters from the bathroom. You had to walk thru the area with the double beds to get to the bathroom. Absolutely no privacy for three adults. The price was $505 per night, we stayed 2 nights and the total was almost $1,200.00 with the additional fees. I shouldn't have assumed that the highest price would offer us the best. The room was outside the hotel, below all the rooms in the hotel and no access into the hotel except to walk a 1/4 of a mile into the main lobby. Had we had rain, we would have been soaked going anywhere out of the room. Upon arrival, seeing the room and smelling the room, I immediately asked to get a regular room. This was a non smoking room and smelled like a dirty ashtray. I was told they were full for the night and asked to be changed for the next night and pay for a regular room. I was told absolutely no refunds would be given to my c/c. The customer service was completely unacceptable. The room also had a continuous noise the entire stay. Similar to a boiler room and impossible to sleep. To get ice you had to deal with the walk to the main entrance and go to the 3rd floor. The vending machines on the 1st and 2nd were broken also. The in room coffee maker didn't work, the room offers no safe and we also expected a small fridge but they didn't provide that either! After 2 nights of this, we couldn't wait to check out!

The food and the service were first class. In fact we found staff bent over backwards to be of assistance. I had some issues at breakfast with being seated too far from the buffet table (walk with a cane) and my on-going battle to get Hilton to put decent toasters on their breakfast buffet. By our third breakfast the manager had saved a table for us next to the buffet and staff produced toast for me from the kitchen. There are some things that the hotel could improve. We would like a refrigerator in the room. We object to paying for WIFI, especially when it doesn't work all that well. Skype transmission was intermittent and we couldn't send e-mails out. The spa is only open for limited hours: 12 to 4 Tuesday to Friday and 11 to 5 on Saturday. I wanted a pedicure first thing in the morning so I could spend the rest of the day being a tourist, but it was not to be.

Overall, I'd rate the stay as a 3 (on a scale of 5 with 5 being \"Perfect\" and 1 being \"Never Again\"). The Room - I found the room somewhat small but acceptable considering the price (the group received a discounted rate of $69 per room/day. The shower never seemed to have any hot water before 8am. I spoke to the front desk about this but I still had to take a cold shower the morning I checked out. Showers in the evening and afternoon were fine. I believe that they must use timers on their hot water heaters and anything before 8 a.m. must not be considered an acceptable time for guests to shower. The room did not have any windows that opened. So, if you wanted to enjoy the smell of the ocean and a gentle breeze, you couldn\u2019t do so from your room. The Amenities \u2013 I found the amenities to be a little expensive for what you received. For example, if you wanted to have Internet access in your room it was $9 a day extra while most other places I've stayed offer internet access for free. The Valet Parking is $17 a day. The alternative is to park about 1.5 blocks away and then you can do so at $9 a day. I went ahead and used the Valet Parking but because it was so expensive, the tips were much smaller and less frequent than they would have been had the price been more reasonable. If you decide to eat breakfast during your stay, I\u2019d suggest the IHOP which is about a quarter of a mile down the street. Also, there is a nice smaller restaurant across the street from the hotel that is decent. I just couldn\u2019t get myself to pay the $18 per breakfast that the hotel\u2019s restaurant was offering. The Service - On the 1st full day there, the housekeepers never showed up to clean the room. The engineer didn't fix the hot water (or lack of) issue in the shower. Other than those two items, the service was decent. The staff was friendly, and helpful. Overall, I found my stay acceptable. The location is great and had it been a little bit warmer, we would have taken advantage of the beach. I would stay there again but not at their normal prices.

I usually steer clear of buffets (almost never nearly as good as you think they will be) I decided to try the Friday night Prime rib and Seafood buffet for $35.00.

Cocktail shrimp were great but $ 35.00 for 8 cocktail shrimp and a cup of decaf was as hard to swallow as the fishy fish of the day on the buffet. What made the experience completely unbearable were the families surrounding my table hauling piled plate after plate of Alaskan crab legs as if the were storing them for the winter and joyfully exclaiming how good the food was. I guess it was just me. The rooms would be fine if you are there when the weather is great and you never want to be inside. They are just tired so they may not really be dirty - just in need of renovation. The Adams Mark tackiness has not been eliminated yet and they are sorely lacking in updated amenities.( 20 inch tube tvs, the usual worthless $3.00 iron and hideous in room coffee pellets.Cool little Cuisinart machine that deserves to pour somethng that you wont spit into the sink) There was a weight scale in the bathroom.

First, the hotel is nowhere near a 3.5 stars. The lobby is okay, but the rooms are dated and old. The beds, pillows, and bedspread should have been retired years ago. The towels were old and scratchy. The 20\u201d tube television was terrible. There was no WiFi access whatsoever \u2013 free or otherwise. The crib they provided for my toddler looked like it was 30+ years old. I could have looked past all that had I all the other stuff not happened\u2026. First, the parking there is a joke. You will have your choice between paying $17 a night for valet parking or paying $9 a night to park nearly across A1A at a lot nearly 1.5 block away from the hotel. Since the lot wasn\u2019t guarded and we have luggage, I opted for the valet. In others words, with a tip, I was paying more than $20 a night to park my car in Daytona Beach. Are you kidding me? Next, the weekend we stayed the hotel was hosting some sort of middle-school football tournament. As a result there were hundreds of unsupervised 13 to 14 years running amuck throughout the hotel. It was like Spring Break for the prepubescent. I can understand that the hotels need to make their revenue and were going to turn away the heard of unruly kids. However, what irks me and all the other guests is the hotel apparently made no efforts to control the kids (and neither did their chaperones). My kids were repeatedly awoken by teenagers yelling in the halls and slamming doors. My calls to the front desk did nothing to lessen the noise. When I was checking out, there were at half a dozen guest complaining about the young football players. Clearly, we were the only ones unhappy with the situation. It was a nightmare for anyone not affiliated with the football tournament. But, it gets worse. Someone (presumably housing keeping) stole my kids toy trains. My collects Thomas diecast toy trains. These trains retail for between $6.99 and $7.99. Unfortunately, while we were gone during the day, six of the seven trains we brought with us disappeared. I complained to the front desk who seemed completely disinterested in the theft. I actually had to threaten to report the theft to police (I asked the front desk to dial police) before they would even notify hotel security. While the front desk crews seem disinterested, at least the hotel security manager seemed to take the theft seriously. Still, I was offered no reimbursement whatsoever. So, my advice is to stay far away from this hotel. Disregard the star rating \u2013 it\u2019s nowhere near a 3.5 star.

I would rate it a 3.5. It was a very nice hotel but not luxurious in any sense - EXCEPT FOR THE DELICIOUS restaurant Hyde Park within the north tower.

I hoped I could get a free oceanview upgrade but unfortunately, the 3rd question out of the front desks' mouth was, \"Would you like to upgrade to oceanview for $20 a night?\". I said yes, instead of trying to cop a free upgrade. Anyway, all the reviews did say that parking is far and a hassle. Yes it is a hassle. AND we were assigned to the north tower which is not on the same side as the check-in, parking lot. So we walked all the way around to the north tower (before we figured out there was a corridor that would take us to the other side THROUGH the hotel. We had already parked our car across the street. So we dragged our 2 suitcases and cooler up the steep valet parking hill to the front of the north tower. Sigh - I'm tired thinking about it. Anyway, we had room 996. The lobby was very nice. We walked down the hall to our room and did notice stains on the carpet but I think most hotels will eventually have stains, regular people have stains in their homes (not me... tee hee hee). Anyway, it didn't bother me. It was a clean hotel. We went into the room and it was an average room - the pictures are accurate. The bathroom was clean. The room was dated but not grossly old. It was just an older room/hotel. Average. Not a 4 star though. The balcony view was AWESOME. We were right near the band shell and could hear/see the bands perform all weekend. Had superb views of the fireworks off the pier. Could hear the band play near the Hilton's Pelican bar. It was definitely all about location here. And they get 5 stars for that. The beds were comfy, the water was hot. There were 2 sinks. The bathroom sink and also a wetbar sink (that was stopped up). The Hyde Park restaurant downstairs was top notch. Ambience was great. We both had the petit filet mignons and jumbo shrimp with sides of garlic mashed potatoes and spinach w/mushrooms and it was delicious.

First was their parking deception......they do not have any free parking. They have valet parking for $17 a night or parking across the street and behind a BBQ restaurant, for $9 a night. Don't think you can find parking for free because it's not possible unless you want to possibly have your car towed. Checking into the hotel took about 2 hours friday afternoon. The parking attendants (kids) who parked the cars were all a bunch of wise guys. My wife checked in and I waited in the car and I had about four or five different attendants ask me for Valet parking and when I said no they all had some wise guy answer back to me. I wanted to carry my own luggage but could not get a luggage carry even though I asked one of the parking attendants for one....he said no I could not use it even though he was just standing there and not using it at the time. Second, the room was way too small and did not have either a microwave($10/night extra) or a refrigerator($10/night extra) unless you paid the extra charge for it. You also have to pay extra if you want to use the internet in the room.($10/night). Third, we were put on the 11th floor of the North tower so we were just that much further away from the parking and from the main pool which was at the end of the south lobby. My advice to anybody with a family on a budget who stays in Daytona more than one night is to go to an extended stay hotel such as The Residence Inn Daytona Beach or a similar hotel not on the beach. These hotels come with fully equipped kitchens including refrigerator and microwave and you're only a couple minutes away from the beach.

I have had vastly different experiences depending on whether I am in the North or South tower rooms. Other recent reviews detail the pool situation so I will not revisit that. North Tower - in my opinion the quieter of the 2 towers. The room I was in did not have an adjoining door to the next room and was much quieter. The rooms are average, but I have never experienced major problems. South tower - If you are in the extreme south end, the part that angles AWAY from the beach, be aware, there is an adventure area and night club that gets loud screams (a slingshot ball that sends you up 200 feet) and lots of music until after midnight. I am not a light sleeper and usually put in earplugs and add a pillow over my head, the noise actually reverberated through the mattress! I asked for, and got, a room still in the south tower but much further north. Room was fine but the adjoining room door is NOT good at keeping out conversations on the other side. Luckily the people were in the room infrequently. Restaurants are okay, the Ocean Walk shops have been decimated by the economic problems and multiple store fronts are empty. Lots of good little places a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The staff can tell you what is decent or not. A walgreens is about 10 minute walk north for any thing you forgot but the hotel shop is open late as well. Overall I like the hotel, like the staff, free business center access and printing is nice for checking into your airline and printing boarding passes, and enjoy coming here each summer. Parking is $9 a day caddy corner from the hotel across A1A. $17 for valet a day. Internet in the room is 10, wifi is free in the hotel lobby areas. I actually was able to get free-wi fi from my room on the 5th floor. **Summer Bonus - Every Friday and Saturday night there is entertainment at the clam shell (historic icon of Daytona Beach) until about 9:45. On Saturday nights there are fireworks off the Daytona Beach Pier - I have seen this 3 years in a row now and it is a pretty good show for a tourist town.

Beautiful lobbies and ballrooms. Comfortable beds and pillows. Sheets were always clean. Unfortunately this is the end of what I believe to be the good aspects of this property. Upon arrival we were assigned a room on the 11 th floor. It was an handicapped accessible room that we had not requested. It had a small sink and no bathtub. It was dirty beyond measure. The photos I attached speak for themselves. The external glass door didn't lock. We have two children and we were extremely concerned for their safety.We requested to move to another room, the standard room we had booked. After an initial resistance by the reception staff we were offered a new room the folowing morning.The new room was slightly better as far as cleanliness goes but the furnitures were worn. The sliding door of the closet didn't slide anymore. To open the closet we had to move it manually. The drain of the bathtub didn't work properly. The water drained very slowly. We addressed the issues but the problems were never fixed. One day we didn't even had the housekeeping service. We did not leave the do not disturb sign on the door so we did not understand how it could have happened. The hotel has a kids club called D- Dog. It is a large room on the pool floor. Our older daughter attended the daily camp and I was surprised to find out that all the activities were done indoors. All she did was watching movies, playing w/ table games and made a small craft. The caregiver didn't even give her the ice-cream she was supposed to have at the end of the day and that she has been looking forward to the whole day. I tought that some of the activities organized for the kids took place in the pool floor since there is a kids pool with toys. The hotel has several pools. One in the grounds of south tower ,a portion of which is outdoors and the other indoors. It is a beautiful pool but it was always extremely crowded. At times it was impossible to find any deck chairs available. There were no rules as far as safety goes. People were drinking beers at the edge of the pool and left the bottles there. I never seen a cleaning crew taking care of the place. On the ground of the south tower there is at least a jacuzzi and a kids pool too. A food kiosk and a bar are located by the pool. The other pools are located on the fifth floor at the north tower. The pool grounds here are quite shabby but there is plenty of room to move around and it is much quiter than the other at the south tower. A kids pool and a jacuzzi are also available. The beach is right in front of the hotel. You can rent chairs and umbrella. We never had problems to find one available. Restaurants at the hotel are ok. Having kids we found especially convenient to stop at the caffe to buy salads and sandwiches to take away for the day at the beach. The food was always fresh and reasonably priced. Guest have two parking oprtions. A self parking a quarter mile from the hotel for a small daily amount and a valet service. We tried both options. The valet service was very slow and he area in front of the hotel was always as crowded as the one of an airport. The self parking was in a lot that did't make us feel safe after dark. The reception staff was very casual. Really not the kind of environment that you might expect if you are used to the Hilton' standards.

I quickly called the front desk and complained to the supervisor on duty of my findings.

We decided midway through our drive that we wanted to spend a night on a beachside hotel, so we called the Hilton 1-800 number and booked two nights in this hotel. We agreed that although we had not seen the hotel, we knew we could depend upon the Hilton name and quality. We could not have been more wrong. When we arrived at the hotel, the entrance to the hotel was crammed with cars and people. It took about 3 minutes to be noticed by the valet because there were so many people trying to leave the tightly packed driveway. When we were able to speak to someone from the valet, they informed us that we were at the wrong tower to check in and that we had to travel further down the road to the other tower. An understandable request, although the entrance was hardly noticeable when traveling down the busy road that was filled with cars and pedestrians that would jaywalk whenever they pleased. After finally getting to the correct tower, we went to the check-in counter and were given our keys and told that we had to go back to the other tower. When we asked about parking, we were told that we could either park across the highway or we could use their valet for a fee. We decided that valet was the safer choice, even though the valet driveways were a confusing disaster. When we reached our room, my mother and I were disgusted, to say the least. The room looked dirty and very worn. The bathroom looked dirty, the windows were covered with fingerprints, and our blankets had gum all over them. When you opened the door to the \"balcony\" (which is really just a concrete step with railing), there were cigarette ashes covering the rails. The room looked as though it had not been truly cleaned in a decade. My mother and I decided that we were not going to feel clean sleeping in the rooms, so we called the lobby and complained that the room was just not up to par with Hilton's standards. The lady who answered asked us if our view was bad, and we replied that the view was fine (Oceanfront, 11th floor). She told us that she would move us to another room on 7th floor. When we asked her if the room was better than the one we were in, she replied that the hallways were better. She said she would send someone up to trade keys for our new room. When the lady arrived with our new keys she said with a laugh \"Here are your keys for your new room. I guess the room's view is more...southerly.\" We were not sure what she meant, but the sarcasm in her voice was very noticeable and we gave her a nervous laugh and traded our keys. When we got to the new room, it was almost exactly the same. The only difference was that there were no ashes on the balcony, no gum on the bed, and hairs littered throughout the bathroom. The hairs (which were definitely not from anyone's head) were stuck on the toilet and in the soap holder, and my mother and I decided that we would not be taking our shoes off when walking in the hotel. In the middle of our inspection of the new room, a maid, without knocking, entered the room and quickly apologized that she didn't think anyone was in there. We explained that we had just been switched here, so it was no problem. She asked if there was anything that we needed and we explained that we didn't have a room service menu. She said that she would be back with one right away. While my mother and I waited, we decided we would stay in the hotel for the night, but cancel the next day's stay there. We called the front desk and cancelled, and also requested that someone bring up a room service menu. The person who answered did not seem to believe that we had not been supplied a menu and kept asking if we were SURE there was not one there. We had searched the entire room by this point, and had discovered previous guests' trash in the drawers, but had found no menu. The lady said she would ask the Room Service Department to send someone up right away. After 40 minutes from when we had asked the maid to bring a menu, and about 30 minutes from when we had called the front desk, we decided to directly call Room Service for a menu. Perhaps the best service of the entire hotel, we got the menu in 10 minutes. We decided that we would not risk the room service, as it was obvious that the hotel was not exactly clean and the choices were not what we had wanted. We decided that we would try the hotel's restaurant, Hyde Park. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Usually I am a very good tipper and I do not require very much attention when I dine out. But NEVER I have been completely ignored before. Our waiter would only talk to my mother. He would never look at me, nor did he ever talk to me unless I asked him something directly. For example, when my mother ordered a glass of wine, I had to stop him from leaving in order to order my drink. Not only was the service terrible, but also my food was not edible. One of my favorite things to eat is seafood, so I ordered a dish that had scallops and shrimp served in a lemon sauce. When I received my food, the scallops were so overcooked that they were rubbery and inedible. The shrimp were also overcooked, but the sauce saved them and I ate them. The mashed potatoes that I ordered as a side were delicious and the only thing that I would recommend to anyone. All in all, my experiences at the Hilton at Daytona Beach and the Hyde Park restaurant were HORRIBLE. I would recommend the Hilton to Spring Breakers had the prices not been so insanely high.

After 45 minutes I realized the problem was due to Daffy Duck being in charge of the parking operations. I know this hotel is near Disney but having cartoon character running the hotel is not good for business. This hotel since it is across the street from the convention center has elected to make parking a profit center. Hence parking at this hotel is not free. But worse than that is that the parking lot if full then requires that if you want your car near to the hotel to park in the valet parking for $17.00 a night. Over thanksgiving I stayed at a Comfort Inn in Brooklyn, whereat there was no charge for parking, but there is a charge for parking at the luxury hotel in Daytona Beach. This however was not the worse event. After being told that I had to pay for parking I was also told that I could not leave the bags (no bell captain)but would need to trudge across the street after parking. Upon going outside after checking in I was informed by a memeber of the valet staff that the parking lot was full and that I would have to pay for Valet parking. I proceeded to the parking lot only to find from the attendant that indeed the parking lot was full but that the valet parking service at the north tower could validate my ticket for regular parking.(Shouldn't the registration clerk have informed me of this?) I then proceeded to the North Tower where due to the fact that Daffy and Donald and children were running the show and I waited inline for 30 minute to give the car to a valet. So from check in to the time I actually took the bags out of the car 45 minutes. As to the room the layout was fine but no better or worse than a Comfort Inn. I did find that the two dead roaches in the bathroom, the cracked lap shade and the apparent caramel smudged on the room door were less than what should be expected at any hotel. Also I used a cup to brew tea the first evening. I guess this was a problem since the next day I found only one cup remaining in the room. Also with regard to check out I found on the bill that I was charged for both valet and self parking. (I guess I brought two cars) As to the hotel facilities I enjoyed the Legends bar. For breakfast since I thought $3.00 for toast was ridiculous I walked down the street to the Starlite Diner where you can have an excellent breakfast for less than $10.00. I utilized the exercise room which was superior to most that I have encountered at a hotel. However having the machines face the east presents a problem for early risers who have to stare into the sun. Also the TV in the exercise room is located catty corner to the rear which makes it difficult to watch. Unfortunately I believe this hotel caters to the convention crowd and the rest of its guests are treated as second cousins. I believe Conrad Hilton would not be pleased with the hotel and it current operation. The hotel should concentrate on making its profit from its accommodations and not trying to nickel and dime its guest. There should be no charge for the internet(try going wireless)nor for regular parking and a guest should be guaranteed a parking place. Also, as a Hilton rewards member my information should be readily accessible a the front desk. I should not be the person who has to have that information on my person.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent beachside hotel\u201d", "Author": "Neil&Sue", "ReviewID": "UR22691929", "Content": "Stayed with our family (party of 8) for 2 nights (had 3 high floor beachfront rooms).

If you have kids, try to stay in the North Tower on or near the 5th floor. The pool on the 5th floor is not as crowded as the one on the South Tower side. The South Tower has the poolside bar, so it was not as kid friendly. Also, Friday night they played a movie outside by the pool and the D Dawg Kid's Zone is there as well. They even had free popcorn and soda for the kids! The most confusing thing was checking in-you have to go to the South Tower to check in, and if you are staying in the North Tower, you have to drive to another entrance.

But really, we were not in the room except to change or sleep! Also, if you don't get valet, you have to park a block away. But we only left once the whole weekend. Everything is within walking distance. We also had a problem with the A/C in the room not cooling all the way-I alerted the front desk and it was taken care of quickly. They even left a chocolate hammer from the maintenance department and left us a voicemail about the repair. Overall, I would reccommend this hotel to anyone.

This strikingly designed hotel is nestled between the boardwalk and the newly built \"Ocean Walk\" center, which is a hub of restaurants, shops, bars, and a movie theater. Go-karts and family-friendly games are found just across the street, along with the Ocean Center conference center. Most of Daytona's most famed restaurants and attractions are within minutes of the hotel. The lobby and public space of this hotel are about as swank as you will get in Daytona Beach. You'll see your share of marble, brass, mirrors, and art as you roam around the hotel. The atmosphere is relaxed, but somewhat refined. All the staples of a fine hotel can be found: spa, fitness center, pools and whirlpools, a variety of restaurants and bars, gift shop, business center, and activity center for children. The guest rooms are located in one of two towers: the south and the north. Request a room in the north tower; they are newer and better appointed than those in the older south tower. The north tower bathrooms are especially better and more spacious than those in the south tower. Note: Not all rooms in the north tower are oceanfront, unlike the south tower. All guest rooms feature Florida-tropic decor with themed Daytona art prints in the bathroom. French balconies afford breathtaking views of the ocean (or Ocean center). Cable television offers a limited selection of mostly news-related programming (this is primarily a conference hotel) and also offers two channels specifically dedicated to Daytona Beach tourism and the hotel amenities. In-room coffee and tea-makers, irons and ironing boards, hairdryers and bottled waters are available (the water is NOT free). The toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower cap, mouthwash, body soap, and hand soap) are some of the finest I've seen. And for the health conscious, there is actually a scale in the bathroom! In the south tower, you have easy access to most of the hotel's recreational amenities. However, you also have to contend with older bathrooms (funny odors, running toilets), and worn furnishings (closet door kept coming unhinged, painting was faded, etc.) In the north tower, you are closer to the Ocean Walk Village, but further from the rest of the hotel amenities (spa, outdoor pool area, gift shops, business center, etc.). However, you will most likely have a better, newer room. I stayed in this hotel for a conference, and my room was paid for. However, I asked for the rate of my oceanfront king bed room and was quoted a rate of $185 plus tax per night. Not that bad for a Hilton experience at the beach. I'll add to the other posters comments when I stress that its a good idea to do most of your dining and entertaining away from this place: they nickel and dime you to death. And you can NEVER be too cautious about the rough characters on Daytona Beach. I wouldn't venture past the boardwalk or Ocean Walk village alone, ever. The Hilton does a fine job about safeguarding the activities and amentiies on their own property, so you can feel safe when lounging around the hotel.

This hotel is huge. 2 Towers total, one South (the older of the 2), and the North Tower (the newer of the 2). In my opinion the rooms could use some attention to the details and maybe they could clean the huge sliding glass windows once in awhile. The main dining room, Doc Bale's, is centrally located and is where the \"all you can eat buffets are\". Breakfast is about $19 (includes coffee, juices, omlettes, fruits and meats etc).

I had an oceanfront room , which did have a very lovely view of the ocean and beach. On Saturday nights, fireworks are launched from the pier that is located to the south of the Hilton.

We had two rooms and paid $209 per night for each of them. We chose this hotel due to its proximity to the airport and to relatives. It also seemed the best choice among the other properties we studied in this geography. The view of the ocean from the room was very nice and I was impressed with how much the closed door muffled the sound of the waves. When you open the balcony door the AC cuts off so we did not leave the door open much. Unfortunately, as others have noted it is impossible to step outside to hear and see the ocean and close the door. The balconies really are little more than a narrow stoop making it impossible to comfortably stand outside the room with the door closed. The door did not muffle the sound of the concert that took place in the bandshell next door on Saturday night. And many times during our visit I heard noises from the rooms next door and from people walking in the hallway. The hotel was very busy with a wedding and graduation parties on top of a holiday weekend, but we experienced a similar experience with the waitstaff as that described by a previous reviewer. There were long waits and overworked staff. One waiter did come back and apologize to us multiple times for his inability to properly wait on us. He said he already had more customers than he could handle. While he seemed distressed and I appreciated his honesty, I also was annoyed with the hotel that they were not prepared to handle the crowds and by the time we left the excuses rang hollow. The lady who waited on me at the gift shop was very friendly and efficient. Likewise, the valet staff delivered our car promptly, so my staff problems mainly centered on the staff in the eating establishments. It was not uncommon to be told that we would have a 30 minute wait to be seated, but it was more frustrating when we were told a wait time and then it not to be accurate--as happened to us at restaurant and with room service. We did not eat at the Hyde Park restaurant. It has a clubby look to it and we were looking primarily for casual beachwear welcoming places for our meals so we frequented the other places. I don;t know if that experience would have been the same or different. The hotel is huge with multiple restaurants. The food court on the beach side isn't exactly a court at this time of year and I can only assume that it is more active at other times of the year with more selections--we did not eat there, but we tried the others. On top of the waits and the lack of customer service, we were greatly disappointed in the quality of the food we had at the hotel. The lunch we had at the Pelican Bar mostly went uneaten. I was the last to be served and the waitress said it was because she had sent my sandwich back as it was \"too small\". It wasn't the size of the sandwich I found disappointing--it was the taste. My daughter and her husband had what they described as an awful breakfast at Doc's Grill at an overpriced fee. I ordered two meals from room service--one that was passable and a breakfast that was swimming in grease and not very warm. All in all, this hotel did not live up to our expectations. The rooms were okay--tastefully decorated and clean. The television was an old-style television with HBO. The bathroom was fine but nothing special--it could have passed for any chain hotel I have frequented in the past year--not very large room. When I compare this to other resort hotels it lacks the feel of what I usually think of as a resort with extra perks and amenities. And when I compare what I paid per night with other hotels not claiming to be resorts I find this property lacking. Part of it comes from the setting. Daytona is just a crowded, busy beach town with more than its share of tattoo parlors, bikers, and party-goers. It isn't exactly a serene setting. I did not visit the spa. We walked several blocks to the North of the hotel. We made purchases at a Starbucks and an ice cream store but did not find much of interest in the immediate area. My daughter and son-in-law had a dismal meal at a nearby Mexican Restaurant. We saw a lot of younger people who were quite inebriated and my overall impression was that this was a prime party area, but not the best place for a family vacation. I doubt that we will choose this destination again and as we drove away we all agreed that we were quite happy to be leaving. I can understand that this hotel might be among the best of the choices as some of the hotels in the area did not look very good--some with individual AC units in the windows, etc. Just be prepared for mediocre food and service with a high price tag.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cJust OK\u201d", "Author": "vg411973", "ReviewID": "UR16414610", "Content": "This hotel has the absolute best location if you are looking to stay on the boardwalk, right near Ocean Walk and a very quick ride from the airport.

It's not the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at, but for the area it was one of the best.

The same pool went indoor as well as outdoor (through a transparent plastic curtain). - There were multiple hot tubs (one inside on outside). - The outside restaurant by the pool was very good. - It was easy to get a chair at the pool - at least during our stay. - The staff was courteous, caring and efficient. I requested extra towels and they were there within minutes. Within another minute or two we received a call making sure we got them and then being asked if we needed anything else. Some of the things we thought were average were: - The condition of the grounds and hotel exterior. Daytona is an older area so the age of the property shows just a bit. Could use some paint and the roof of the lower level showed some age when looking down on it. - The hot tub inside was strangely shallow (maybe for kids). It barely covered your mid drift. I did not try the one outside. - The price was a little more than I would have expected to pay for the area but it was oceanfront. There are others in the area that are quite a bit cheaper but they looked pretty run down. - There really is no patio. Just a small ledge when you slide open the doors facing the ocean.

We chose the Hilton because of all the excellent reviews here, as well as the fact that I'd stayed in Hiltons elsewhere and found them to be very pleasant. We stayed on Easter weekend, Friday and Saturday night. Perhaps our experience is not typical, but I feel I must share it so that others who are considering staying at this hotel have an idea of what could happen to them as well. Check-in was fine. Everyone was very friendly during the day. Our room was ocean-view, and we were happy. Around 10 PM, the air conditioner made a funny noise, then a strange smell filled the room and it quit working. We called maintenance, who came up and told us that they couldn't fix it that evening. They did not offer to move us, so we asked. They said they WOULD NOT (not \"could not\" but \"would not\") move us to another room that night. The night desk clerk even laughed and suggested we \"open the windows, it's a nice night.\" I let the young man know this was unacceptable; he just shrugged. I couldn't believe it. Spring Break being what it is in Daytona, we had a restless night due to the noise of drunken revelers setting off firecrackers at 3 AM. The maintenance crew came by early to fix the a/c. They couldn't. The daytime desk clerk came up and was just lovely. They offered to move us to a new room; they said they would get us set up in the computer and we could move whenever we liked. We asked if we could move around 6 PM, when we got back from our daytime activities and we were told that was no problem. The desk clerk also said we'd get free breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. When we got back around 6:30 PM, the desk staff had, regrettably, changed. Someone on the evening staff had *given away our room*. They got us into a new room, but it was much smaller than our last one. Again, we said this was unacceptable - they didn't care. We didn't check the a/c - we didn't know we needed to. The a/c in this room NEVER worked. We checked with a few neighbors on the floor and found that this problem was going on in other rooms on our floor. Around 10 PM, we went to get our free breakfast vouchers for the next morning. There was a new desk staff who, while friendly, said they had no knowledge of our free breakfasts and refused to do anything about it. Upon checkout, we relayed our problems to the manager. We got an apology, and that was it. I truly could not believe our experience. After all the reviews on this site and the reputation of Hilton hotels in general, I expected better. I realize that many of you had good experiences, and I am sure they were busy that weekend what with Spring Break, Easter, and a large wedding that was taking place as well, but my business is just as valuable as everyone else's was. I will never be staying in a Hilton anywhere ever again.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "maclikestraveling", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and nice staff\u201d", "Author": "maclikestraveling", "ReviewID": "UR14634615", "Content": "I booked a two night weekend stay in March with my hilton points.

Being a quick get away for the weekend my wife and I were overall pleased with our experience at this hotel. The only concerns I would want to make other travelers aware of is the south tower is right next to the Daytona sling shot and the possiblity of noisy neighbors. The daytona sling shot is two large radio towers with a cage that thrill seekers pay to be strapped into and launched several hundred feet into the air. Because our room was right next to this we would occassionally hear people screaming if the door was open but could not hear them with the air conditioner on and the door to the very small (less than 2 feet) balcony closed. As for the noisy neighbors. It was spring break and the children in the room next to us were a bit unruly waking me up several times during the night. Because the rooms have miniature balconies- if you open the balcony door and then shut your rooms door it will slam due to the draft shaking the whole wall and definatly will wake you up. This happend several times as well.

The bellman went and got us keys to a new room and took us there. After moving our items into the room I went down to the desk to straighten everything out. The front desk agent I went to was supposed to know exactly what had happened and would be able to correct the problem. When I tried to explain to her, they could not find my son or the groom in the system as having a reservation. After about 15 mins. of trying to work with this person, she was totally confused and so was I. She then passed me on to another clerk, who as luck would have it had checked in my son and the groom earlier, so she knew who they were.

We had wanted an effeciency room and had booked one at the other hotel, but the Hilton staff made up for the mistakes of the other hotel (no affiliation) by giving us a microwave and small fridge at no additional cost (reg. $10 per night each) and they gave us a great special rate.

The hotel is large, but the attentiveness of the staff prevent it from becoming too impersonal. The rooms are spacious, clean and well-kept. Everything throughout the hotel has the feel of quality about it. It is situated right on the beach and has two swimming pools and several restaurants/bars/cafes. There are plenty of ballrooms/conference halls, smaller seminar rooms, etc, and together with the lecture halls over the road in Atlantic Avenue this makes it a natural conference venue. Unlike at some other conference venues, the hotel staff were very attentive with respect to business needs as well as personal needs of guests. You only had to ask and it happened immediately. Everything ran like clockwork. If there were one complaint, it would be that the airconditioning was over the top. It was strange to look out of the window at people having fun on the beach in what was so obviously sweltering heat, while we were shivering inside even with jackets on. This was more of a problem in the conference hall areas; in the guest room it was OK if you set it at an ambient 22 deg C (any lower and it got cold, any higher and it started heating!) In terms of provisions, a safe in the room would have been good, but otherwise there was everything I needed. Wireless Internet access was available for free in the \"public\" lobby areas, etc. The fast connection in the room also worked well, although it cost $10 per day.

The hotel that hosted the conference \"accidentally\" canceled the reservation I'd made 3 months ago...and had NO rooms available to make up for this shameful error! So at 10 PM , there I was stuck...in Daytona trying to find a place to stay. The host hotel put me up in another one of their properties - La Playa Resort - but after reading the sad reviews of this property here on TripAdvisor, I decided to find my own hotel. I immediately called Hilton Hotels and they found me a great room that met my needs. I asked for a smoking room, and the confirmation said that's what I got -- but the room I ended up in (Room 997 in the North Tower) -- turned out to be non-smoking, after all. Not a huge deal, I was too tired at this point and just wanted to go to sleep. When you walk into this hotel lobby, you KNOW you've arrived at a quality establishment immediately. It's immaculate, stylishly decorated (unlike so many of Daytona's cheesy \"tropical\" attempts at decor), and the employees look and conduct themselves as professionals. I asked not to have my car valet parked because I realized I'd forgotten to get cash before arriving. I explained this to one of the valets and he told me not to worry about it --- and meant it --- and helped me with my bags, knowing fully well that he wasn't getting a tip (at least not that night). AMAZING, eh? My room was a standard \"city-view\" room. The view actually would have been pretty nice, except that you see the rooftop of the hotel's lower level. But it didn't matter -- my room was spotless, stylish, and more than comfortable. The bedding in Hilton family hotels is to DIE for! They certainly don't skimp when it comes to quality bedding, and you will feel the difference the minute you slip into bed. In fact, you'll never want to get out of it, it's so dreamy! The only downside is that my room was NOT smoking, after all. I really wasn't upset, because I did not spend much time in it to begin with...but when I mentioned this in passing during check-out, they immediately apologized for the mistake and discounted my stay by about 15%, even though I wasn't complaining! Overall, this is the nicest hotel Daytona has to offer. It's modern, beautiful, and sparkling clean -- with a staff who put the SERVICE in Customer Service! Whether you're a couple looking for a nice, quiet getaway, a businessperson in need of comfortable accommodations that allow you to get some rest while you work -- or a family in search of a beach hotel that you can feel good about bringing the kids to ...The Hilton Oceanwalk Village of Daytona Beach is the ONLY place to consider!", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville", "Title": "\u201cNice Junior Suite but beware of the Shark Lounge!\u201d", "Author": "gatorgurl4", "ReviewID": "UR7289231", "Content": "I stayed here with my husband for a getaway and we thought it was still going to be spring break but upon arriving the area looked pretty dead and the other reviewers were 100% accurate when they said the surrounding area left a lot to be desired. There are many homeless persons and vagrants wandering around all over Daytona it seems. The valet/bellhops were all friendly to us as well as the check in girl. She first put us in a cabana suite which were supposed to be the nicest rooms that lead directly onto the ocean. But when your in it you only have an eye level view of the ocean which is partially obscured by all the things outside the room. I prefer a high up view of the whole ocean. I wasn't impressed with it at all, it looked more like a glorified motel room and I didn't like having the noise and nonprivacy of people walking by your room on the main sidewalk. So I asked to move to the junior suite she had also offered to get a better higher view of the ocean. When I walked into that my reaction was now your talking! It was like night and day with the difference between rooms. It was room 926 and it had a separate little sink area with refrigerator when you first walked in, separate living room, nice size table, and very nice plasma flat screen tv. It had french doors that led into a separate bedroom area which had two different granite sinks/separate bathroom area which was nice in case both wanted to use the sinks. It felt like a nice little luxury apartment. We had a full oceanfront view overlooking the tower and bandshell so we could see all the happenings. They say their balconies but the balcony consists of a tiny ledge with a railing so hopefully your skinny enough to squeeze out onto it. You aren't able to sit out there just stand up on it and look out. The water in Daytona was grey which was strange, not exactly what I pictured for a nice Florida beach. I also recommend the valet parking because otherwise you have to park in a lot a couple blocks away behind this bar-b-q joint which doesn't seem that safe to me. Plus it was very quick each time we left for the bellman to get our car for us. I think they wanted a tip but at $14 to valet park I don't feel it was warranted. We also went to this strip club called the Shark lounge. If you want a good laugh you have to go there. I have never seen such an unattractive bunch of women in my life. There were two that were over 50 years old and the rest I thought were pregnant or were more flat chested then my husband, and the others looked like someone hit them with the ugly stick or they'd had one too many cigarettes. We got two drinks and it came to $14. When I went to pay up and didn't leave a tip the bartender just said thats all? I almost told her yes thats all after what I just saw and what you just charged. I felt bad for the little shark they had swimming in the tank that the women paraded out on it looked like they were trying to find a way out! All in all I was not impressed by Daytona Beach at all and it seems very run down. If it weren't for the beautiful room we got it wouldn't have been much of a trip. If I could get the same room upgrade again I'd go back otherwise probably not because the area isn't very nice and there's not a whole lot to do.", "Date": "April 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swanzey, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful stay...as always\u201d", "Author": "From Swanzey", "ReviewID": "UR7185157", "Content": "We stay at the Hilton every year when we go for Bike week and this year as it is every year was wonderful.

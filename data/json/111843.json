We really enjoyed our stay. Very nice setting, quiet and relaxing with enough entertainment and wonderful amenities to make your days very pleasant. What we liked the most about this hotel is that its beach and overall the whole Kapalua area is not crowded like other hotels in Kannapali (hotel zone) or even the Four Seasons in Wailea. The pool, the grounds and all the amenities are amazing. The restaurants offer nice options, from casual burgers and fries at the pool/beach cafe to sushi and sophisticated sea food at the Banyan Tree restaurant. Many people complain about the bad location of this hotel and I would say that they are right about that (weather wise). Kapalua is windy and a few degrees cooler than all the other resort areas in Maui; however, you can drive a few minutes and you'll find yourself enjoying sunny Maui. Personally, I don't like windy weather (who does?) but I didn't mind it too much because Kapalua is simply beautiful, even when it's raining. Honestly, this is the only place in West Maui that, for my taste, feels upscale. I definitely don't have any complaints about this hotel, the only minus in our trip was that it rained for three days during our stay, but of course that's something that the Ritz-Carlton's can't control.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "fort worth, tx", "Title": "\u201cThis is NOT a true Ritz\u201d", "Author": "rhuckabee5", "ReviewID": "UR126054283", "Content": "My family has stayed at many Ritz Carlton's and this one has been so disappointing that we have spent most our time looking for a house to stay in.

However you should note that this is on the windward side of the island, so it can get windy. That being said during the 4 days we were there the wind was totally manageable by the pool, and the staff did a great job of telling us where to sit to minimize wind exposure. Once you get past the potential wind everything about this was great. We stayed in a garden suite (I think it was called garden). While it wasn't looking directly at the ocean you could easily see it from our lanai, and I personally preferred the view because you looked directly up at the lush hilltops. It was a very large room, big living room with a pullout couch which was unbelievably comfortable. Had a kitchen with a dishwasher, microwave etc. Large bedroom, large bathroom with separate rub and shower and 2 lanais. We started most of our days at the gym which is a great hotel gym, tons of treadmills and ellipticals as well as a full range of machines and free weights. When we didn't hit the gym we went for a run, and the concierge provided us with a map where we could get 5-6 miles easily. After working out we hit The Terrace for breakfast. Talk about a breakfast buffet! Great selection, omelet station, and macadamia nut banana pancakes?! After stuffing our faces at breakfast we hung out by the pool where the staff directed us to the optimal areas depending upon what we wanted and put down our chair covers for us, and gave us sunscreen. Throughout the day we were waited on constantly (try the 'mike tai') and they kept our water bottles filled. Sure 2 mai tais cost $25, but you are sitting by a pool at a 5 start hotel, what do you expect? We hit the spa one day. I was a huge fan of the whirlpool. There is also a eucalyptus steam, sauna and a relaxation room. If you book a treatment they let you use the facilities all day at no charge, otherwise it is $25. There were 3 dinner options at the hotel and all were good. Nothing fantastic, but we didn't leave disappointed at the food we ate either. There are a few restaurants in Kapalua as well as Nepali which you can walk to (about 25 mins) or take the shuttle or a taxi or drive if you have a car. We went to Merriman's one night which was great. As far as the beach goes, it is about a 4-5 min walk down the path where they have towel service and a restaurant. We didn't go to the beach while we were there because the surf was a bit rough, but it was beautiful. Last but not least if you a golfer you cannot beat the course. I am a novice and even I appreciated it. I will note that the hotel is a bit isolated. If you want to get away from it all this is the place to be. If you want to be able to walk to shops and restaurants you'll want to head south to Kannappali. I personally love the quiet. If you want to be in the middle of it all, just take a taxi elsewhere for the evening.

We had a fantastic time and would go back in an instant. I don't oftern write reviews but reading some of the reviews before we left and after we returned, I was compelled to write. First, the beach is a short 2 minute stroll from the pool, nothing really. Never saw ANYONE take the shuttle in 2 weeks, the walk is that short. Never noticed any airplanes, that's just silly. The beach at the hotel was good, some days were a little rough but when we wanted calmer waters we went to Kapalua Bay, (short drive or shuttle) or we drove to Slaughterhouse Beach about 5 minutes away. This beach is just west of the Plantation Golf course and is very secluded, you have to walk down a bunch of steps to get there. Food at the hotel was all excellent, never had even an average meal. Service was what you expect from the Ritz-Carlton, from the time we arrived until the time we left. We ate at the Honolua store a few times and this was a great alternative, fast and cheaper, and the food is very good. It was windy at times around the hotel but it wasn't that bad. We used the Cousteau facility four times for my 7 yr old son and he loved it, kept asking to go back. He did the pizza making, night creatures, snorkelling, and the survivor class. That is an exceptional program and allowed us to have time (3 hrs each) on our own for dinner. The concierge group was also exceptional. We asked for dinner reservations in Lahaina four times on short notice and each time they were great recommendations and EACH time we were sat at the best tables in the place, right on the water. We sat at the pool for maybe 1 hour per day, service was always attentive and they setup your lounge for you. We have now been to all of the islands and this was the best hotel so far. Had a convertible Mustang and used it every day, lots to see and do around the island. An great example of the service... we had some leftovers, cheese, couple of other things in the fridge and I noticed one day the fridge had shut down. Called the desk, serviceman was literally there in 2 minutes, did his thing and got it working again. He noticed the food and without us asking or saying anything said that the hotel would make it up to us. It was about $20 worth of food, (old pizza), and they sent us a bottle of wine, and a platter with meats, cheese and some snacks, about $75 worth of food. Great service. Overall, even the average reviews are undeserved. Some of them are ridiculous... (airplanes?).

Pool area was windy most of our stay. Beach is nice but current is very strong. red/orange flag was up all the time. Acitivies: Went to different beaches per club staff recommendations. Loved Kapalua bay beach (snorkeling of beach- saw green turtles, walking distance from Ritz) and Lahaina beach. Wailea beach (Fours Seasons) is also beautiful. Mala and Honu restaurants were excellent (food, location, and service) The road to Hana trip is a full day adventure. pack snacks. I learned that Ritz prepares a picnic basket upon request.. Did not go to crater as mountain top was foggy and cloudy most of the time. Winery and Lavender farm can be done in a 4 hour trip from Hotel.

If you're a beach bum and just want to soak up the sun by the pool or beach all day, then perhaps you'd find the sunnier side of the island preferable.

I spoke with a couple during the walking workout who had been relocated to a nearby condo because the hotel was oversold (they were allowed to use Ritz-Carlton access and amenities). Plenty of chairs around the pool, even with the expected chair grabbers who drop there towel on chair at 7 am and rarely return. The Great: Breakfast- buffet was awesome, only wish you could eat outside. You are given a different flavored smoothie sample every morning. The service at breakfast was so pleasant. Great way to start the day. Monica - Yoga instructor extraordinaire. This isn't your run of the mill stretching and call it a yoga class. Monica is incredibly knowledgeable and her assists were so helpful. She gave us an intense workout every class. I also went on the workout walk on the beach path - Can't miss it. $20 per class. I wish they had outdoor classes. Nearby Restaurants- Awesome location for dining- Merriman's - best sunset location on the island with outstanding food. Sansei - best sushi I have ever experienced. Weather- phenomenal sunshine entire trip. We were told by our driver Maui is experiencing drought conditions and unseasonably high temps (mid-80's). The terrain resembled Mexico. Lush greenery on the hillsides and center of island was brown. Issues: 1. Poolside service just OK. No water spritzing or melon samples. One instance, lemonade was offered, out of five days at the pool. You set up your chair with towels retrieved from the towel stand. Food was a disappointment to say the least. The fish tacos should have been amazing but only the fries were edible. My friend liked her california rolls, but they ran out. 2. My company had several dinners at the resort and the food was depressing. Really not good and the desserts did not stand out either. Better to hit Sansei at 10:30 pm for half price sushi. 3. We could barely see the ocean from our deck even though we had an upgraded room near the beach. Very few rooms have a direct view of the ocean if that is important to you. 4. No turn down service.

My girlfriend & I just spent 8 days at the Ritz in Kapalua, Maui. I did a lot of homework before choosing this hotel. We have been to Hawaii almost a dozen times, and have stayed everywhere between Waialea to Kapalua. First off, it's the Ritz Carlton. The expectation is high & they delivered on every front! Classic Aloha Spirit seems to be lost nowadays at hotels in Hawaii, but the Ritz delivers. From the classic lei greeting getting out of the rental car, to passed pineapple at noon everyday poolside. Everyone seems to know your name...everywhere! It's Aloha top to bottom. It was our anniversary during the week spent there & they deliver champagne, gift basket & personal welcome notes to the room. C'mon...it's not cheap to stay here, but the service & thoughtfulness is what makes this hotel stand out! The pools are great, the food great & the staff is even better! As far as the location? Yes, it's ten minutes from Kaanapalli, (the hotel district), and another ten minutes to Lahaina. But the location is really in it's own world. After staying in Kaanapalli for so many times, you figure that's the only place to stay, but really, aside from walking the beach everyday, checking out all of the other hotels & drinks at the Hula Grill almost always, you're going to get in your car & drive to Lahaina anyway, so really the extra ten minutes is not even an issue, so it's not the deal breaker by any means. You've got three places to stay in Maui, assuming you're not ruffing it. Waialea, Kaanapalli or Kapalua. For us, Walalea is beautiful, but too too far removed from Kaanapalli or Lahaina. It's a 40 minute drive & if you're having a few maitais later in the evening at Cheeseburger in Paradise, that doesn't work well. So you're down to Kaanapalli or Kapalua. Yes, there's more action on Kaanapalli beach, and the weather is a bit more predictable, but you do have to like one hotel after another, on top of each other. Don't get me wrong. It's a beautiful beach & view, but it's the hotel zone and it's all hotels. Aside from hotel restaurants and of course the Hula Grill, (personal fav), there's not much to choose from for great dining. Roy's is moving from Kahana to the Kaanapalli golf course, so that will add some destination dining to Kaanapalli. So with that being said, you have to drive anyway, so Kapalua is really not a big deal, like some say. As far as the weather? Depending on the day, the winds can and do get a bit much. It didn't chase us away from the pool, it just made it a bit challenging to read a newspaper, etc. But out of eight days, 3 days were windy and the rest were absolutely perfect! So don't get your undies too much in a bunch over this. The Kapalua area is quiet, serene & absolutely georgous! It's quiet, but you have Kaanapalli & Lahaina for everything else. We did see some families there but not that much. They keep the shorties in kids pools & maintain one pool for adults, which is really nice. Kaanapalli is full of families which is fine. If you're paying $500 a day at the Ritz, frankly.....keep those kids away! Sorry Mom & Dad, this is Maui, leave those kids with the inlaws & enjoy your vacation! You can always load up the station wagon and drive to Disney World with those things. There should be an age restriction, like 21 or older to come to Maui. Just a thought.... Anyway, after being cautious from reading the reviews of the Ritz and the Kapalua area and staying at the hotel, I can tell you, that if you want service, attentiveness, peace, tranquility, beauty and the overall experience, do stay at the Ritz. You always have Lahaina for restaurants and a little partying and the beach at Kaanapalli for that and all those shorties who should have stayed at home!

It takes about an hour to drive to the hotel from the airport (you go south from airport and then follow the west coast north to Kapalua). We stopped at the Safeway in Lahaina to pick up some food and drinks to keep in the room. No problems with checkin. We had a mandatory porterage fee which paid for them to take our luggage to the room and then to pick it up at the end of the visit---not sure if this is for all of the rooms or just my particular package. Our room was lovely! The bedding was heavenly, and the bathroom was big. We had a mini-fridge and a coffee service area. The room attendants were always friendly, saying \"aloha\" every time you passed them in the hall. We laid out by the pool several times: always available chairs and once again, pool attendants were always ready to assist you in setting up your chair. My husband did not care for the Hawaiian music that they played through the speakers around the pool, but we managed to find chairs away from them and just used our ipods. The beach is a 5 minute walk and is downhill getting there. There is a golf cart that will take guests back up to the hotel if you're not inclined to walk it. Now, on to restaurants: The Terrace---breakfast buffet or menu, but items are so expensive that you might as well pay full price and get the whole buffet ($30 per person). We splurged on the first day and the last day but then either went to the Honolua store or just ate food we had bought at the Safeway for the other days. If you do eat the buffet, you will be so full that you don't need to lunch anyway, which makes the cost even out a little. Kai: my husband and I had the California Roll and the Tuna Roll there one night and thought that it was very good. Pool bar: decent lunch menu if you don't want to leave the general pool area, but it IS the Ritz in Maui so it's going to be pricey. These were the only restaurants I visited while on property. Please see my separate reviews on Sansei, Lahaina Grill, Honolua Store, Lahaina pizza, Maui Brewing Co., and Old Lahaina Luau. Other aspects of our stay: the shopping at the Ritz was way out of my price range but they had lovely things. We all bought a Ritz Carlton hat at the Souvenir Shop. Checkout: we got a late checkout because our flight wasn't until 9pm. And by late, I mean 4pm! They were super-nice about it and probably would have let us stay later but we needed to go anyway. Also, when our server at the pool bar found out we were going to be leaving, she brought us a free dessert. Also, we printed out our boarding passes at the business center...easy as pie! In summary, this is an expensive property that normally I could not have afforded, but we got a discounted rate due to the conference I was attending.

To be fair to readers as well as the hotel, I am going to review the hotel and location separately. The hotel: The hotel itself was incredible. The rooms were spacious and clean and the hotel grounds were gorgeous. We had no complaints regarding service here as it was exceptional. Our bellman, Ken, was especially attentive. While showing us our room he inquired as to what brought us to Hawaii. When we told him it was our anniversary he casually asked what day we got married - we obviously thought nothing of it. A few days later on our anniversary, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were delivered to our room courtesy of Ken. It was so kind of him to make a point to remember our anniversary and to make such a beautiful gesture. It was these small touches that made our stay at the Ritz a pleasure. We ate the breakfast buffet every morning, which was delicious albeit a bit expensive. We were prepared for this, though - we were staying at the Ritz after all. The only complaint was sometimes the services was a bit slow. We enjoyed dinner on the property twice. The sushi restaurant was good, but nothing spectacular so I would pass on it. The Banyan Tree, however, was probably the best meal we had the entire trip. It was delicious and worth every penny - do not miss out on eating here. A few final notes on the hotel. Don't bother with valet parking. The parking lot is so close and its worth saving a few extra dollars to park your car yourself. Also, I read a lot of reviews where people were complaining about the far walk to the beach. Its not that bad and a little walking could do everyone some good. If it bothers you, though, you can grab one of the golf carts to take you back to the main hotel. I always saw them around. The location: Unfortunately for the Ritz, my husband and I had a huge problem with where the hotel was located. The weather is incredibly unpredictable and windy. Sitting by the pool in the afternoon was often chilly and it didn't make it pleasant to sit on the beach. Plus, rain showers happened quite often. My husband and I decided to buy cheap beach chairs at the Wal-Mart and drove 15 minutes down the road to Ka'anapali beach. Although it was only a few miles away, it was always beautiful weather despite the rain and wind we had just left behind at the Ritz. This beach was amazing and it was worth the effort to drive down and find parking. I would also recommend renting snorkeling gear if you go to Ka'anapali beach since there is snorkeling right off the beach and you'll often see amazing things like huge sea turtles. Because of the crazy weather in Kapalua, we never spent any time at the Ritz recreationally. It really is unfortunate that such a beautiful hotel has such a significant downside that they can't fix. I'm not sure if I would recommend this hotel to friends because of this. If you rather a nice hotel and you don't mind having to drive, park and walk to the beach everyday then you should stay here. If location is more important to you then I would look into one of the resorts on Ka'anapali beach knowing that the hotel is probably not the 5 star experience you'd receive at the Ritz.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service!

From the valet to the maids and everyone in between, the genuinely friendly service and attention to your needs caught me by surprise. I truly felt welcomed and attended to every moment I was on the property. It really made me feel at home and welcome. At the end of the day, the property was probably similar to many of the nicer Hawaiian hotels but it was the service and personnel that set them apart. I felt the company really fostered a culture of sincerity and service among their employees. If I were to run a hospitality based company, I would model it after the Ritz Kapalua. I think if you have the budget and want a truly memorable experience for a special occasion, this would be the place you need to visit. A few other recommendations. Fly into Kapalua airport which is 3 miles away as opposed to the main airport on Maui which is about an hours drive. Really saves you time and money. Also be sure to check out Kapalua Golf School and the golf courses.

We had originally booked a Marriott property, but after discovering renovations were underway, we cancelled our reservation and chose the Ritz instead. We arrived after midnight and had a quiet drive from the airport to the hotel. Although the bellmen were gone for the night, the self-parking lot was close enough it was little inconvenience. In fact, we continued to self-park for the entire trip. The front desk staff was very welcoming and an employee even walked us to our beautiful ocean-view room. The furnishings were very comfortable and I loved the decor, dark wood with subtle island touches. The mini fridge was a plus and we had plenty of room to relax while listening to the waves. We found the entire property to be very well maintained, beautiful, and quiet. This was a trip for relaxation and the Ritz delivered. Every employee we encountered was friendly and professional. I have Celiac disease and must eat gluten free and the Ritz was beyond accommodating of my dietary restriction. I had inquired about food offerings before making a reservation and was assured my needs could be met. Upon check-in I found I had been flagged for needing gluten-free food and every dining experience was exceptional. We enjoyed daily breakfast at the hotel and the chef came out each time to tell me which items would be safe for me to eat. They even provided gluten-free waffles. Room service and pool-side dining was equally accommodating and delicious. I was treated so well and having been able to enjoy so many meals on-property means more than I can say. The pool area was relaxing with the beach a short walk away. There was often an employee driving up and down the hill to the beach in a golf cart offering rides as well. The hotel is in a very private area without any other hotels nearby. We liked the seclusion. We had a car and ate dinner at various places on the island throughout our stay. Each time we returned we were so glad to be coming back to the Ritz. The only downside to our trip was the wind, which was obviously beyond the control of the hotel staff. Several times at the pool we had to literally hold on to our towels and drinks so they wouldn't fly across the deck. We thought it was probably seasonal, but as we drove further south down the coastline the wind became noticeably calmer to non-existent. Several people told us it was due to the location of the hotel in terms of weather patterns. That being said, the privacy, beauty and exceptional service we found at the Ritz far outweighed any discomfort we experienced from the weather.

It was a wonderful trip! I shared a room with a friend and the beds were wonderfully comfortable. The bathroom is nice and large, and clearly well maintained. We never had issue with water in the shower running cold, even at peak times, and the toiletries stocked in the bathroom were absolutely amazing. I had to use lots of conditioner during my stay due to the salt water, and just left a note and a tip for the maid and was left with plenty to use and even take a bit home. Our room was the closest to the elevator on our floor, and we still rarely heard a peep out of anyone the entire time. Most of our room time was spent in blissful silence! The hotel looks and feels luxurious without being over the top. During our stay we got the \"cabanas\" by the ocean instead of by the pool and it was well worth it. Covered and very comfortable chairs, plus half a pineapple and a cooler with water and sodas were provided each day. The wait staff was absolutely wonderful, they were polite and courteous, and wouldn't bother you if you were napping or engrossed in a good book. All of the food at the hotel was lovely. We had the breakfast buffet a couple of times but after going to Longhi's in Lahaina we decided to make that trip each morning for breakfast instead. It was half the price of the buffet, and the crab cakes benedict should not be missed. There was also a Christmas Eve prix fixe dinner arranged that was fairly good. Our derver seemed to be new, he brought out completely wrong bottles of wine twice. (Ordered a red, he brough two different bottles of white before he realized his error). There was a power outage during our meal, but the employees managed it quite well. A five mile stretch of the island was without power for around 45 minutes, so my friend and I fled to our room to soak up the stars on our balcony. It was absolutely amazing with no light pollution. The beach has lovely, soft sand and wonderful views. It is a bit of a walk down to the beach but is worth it to take in the fresh air, enjoy the breeze, and walk off some of the calories from all the great food! They also have a golf cart that runs up and down hill all day. My only complaint is the bar and food service on the beach stops VERY early.

Take them or leave them! First the good, or rather a \"I'm not sure how your experience could be so different\" response to some of the posts I've read. Perhaps that'll even the field for those looking at recent reviews to make their decision on whether to stay. First the staff, were very attentive, helpful, capable, and in the case of the pool staff, waitstaff and bar staff really good humored. As for their age I'm sure some of them were in their twenties but none of them had any sort of 'better than thou' attitude, at all (can't say the same for our waiter at Merriman's though, which is not part of the Ritz). Listen I don't know whether they were all Hawaiian, because I didn't ask, I have friends (more than four!) I know from growing up who were Hawaiian, two were red headed and less than five feet four, pale enough to burn on a cloudy day, so I think it's just plain silly to just say the staff isn't Hawaiian. If you want something really Hollywood \"Hawaiian\" go hang out at the Hawaiian cultural center on Oahu and make orchid leis all week, I mean really... Secondly, \"how much is this vacation going to cost?\" (incredulously). It's the Ritz Carlton so, over and above your room cost, well...a lot. It's not Sandals. If you want all inclusive don't stay here. Conservatively, it's going to cost about 300.00 more a day without all meals on property, obviously. Thirdly, if you want to vacation somewhere that absolutely guarantees no wind and unchanging weather, try the moon. That said it was 'breezy' at the beach and one day out of seven at the pool. It sprinkled (that's even too strong of a word for it) once for ten minutes while we were there. It made me frown for a minute or two, not enough to ruin my vacation, but then again I'm not too sensitive. Wind factor - never enough that a half full paper cup would have been knocked over. Lastly, the beach. Is less than a quarter mile in 'paradise' too long or you to walk? Then the beach is too far for you. No serious mobility issues and able to walk for more than 4.5 minutes at a leisurely pace? Good, you're cool. As for the roughness of the water I will say this, the waves break really close to shore, so for wading up to your knees whilst drunk and with poor balance to begin with I wouldn't recommend. But as the waves break really close to the shore it's super easy to get past the break and swim around happily. If you aren't cool with a small wave break in Hawaii - find a place with a lagoon. People were snorkeling on the beach, does that give you a better idea as to how rough the water was? That's right, it wasn't. Oh yes, and every single night in the lobby there was a different entertainer. Ukulele, guitar, Jazz trio etc. Ok and here's my whiny part. The PGA tournament of champions was occurring at the hotel the first three days of our stay, and it actually was kind of an inconvenience. I really do think that hotels should have a policy, just as with construction, for when something like this is happening that they notify guests beforehand because it really does feel like you are crashing someone else's party. Not only that there was a back up consistently at valet and the shuttles were running about fifteen minutes late. Was relieved when they finally left. What else? Fabulous week! I would stay again, though would never pay the rack rate (or more than 450 for that matter). I especially liked the fact that there were less families though the resort was perfectly family friendly, very quiet, very relaxing. Though I hear over Christmas and School breaks it gets a little nuts, but that's to be expected. Oh and a final word of advice, fly into Kapalua if you can! 8 minute shuttle ride to the airport - and you only have to be there 30 minutes prior to departure on the way out.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon Stay\u201d", "Author": "Trent C", "ReviewID": "UR122932606", "Content": "My wife and I wanted to stay at a luxury resort as it was our Honeymoon.

I had previously worked for 12 years at a 5 Diamond property in Scottsdale, AZ so I knew the expectations that we would experience.

Our package included the daily breakfast which was absolutely amazing. We were very happy with the availability of everything. They have pretty much anything you would ever want and if they don't have it, they'll get it for you.

Great Golf course and great neighborhood and the Hawaiian burialground nearby provides a nice cultural experience.Our server swam out to bring us drinks in the middle of pool numerous times.

If you wanted fancy drinks like Pina Colada's, etc. you had to get those at the bar downstairs or by the pool. Also, you can't take the alcoholic drinks out of the club (Hawaii law, I guess). The service in the club was amazing! The pool area only has a minimal number of chairs with umbrellas that you can use for free. You can pay extra for a cabana or mini-cabana but we didn't think it was worth it. The free locations are generally the first to go so be prepared to get up early to reserve them if you need to have shade. Just know that whatever you leave on the chair will probably get wet due to the early morning showers. Also, the middle section of the pool area is reserved for adults. We did see several kiddies get asked to leave by the pool attendants so it appears the rule is enforced. The other thing we loved was the shuttle to the surrounding restaurants. We used this many times and found it to be great. We never waited longer than 10 minutes for a shuttle and when you get close to finishing your meal, let your server know and they will arrange for the shuttle to pick you up. Another great thing to do was the zipline tour. Hubby and daughter thought it was a blast. You are able to walk from the hotel to the tour operator in less than 5 minutes and they even provided rain jackets for the tour so you didn't have to haul your own stuff. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing, upscale trip. Anyone who wants a lot of activities and night life should probably go somewhere else.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, relaxing, but not over the top\u201d", "Author": "AbiLP", "ReviewID": "UR122588390", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for the first half of our honeymoon. We chose to visit Maui because we wanted to end our honeymoon in Napa and we wanted to have the option of adventure if we got bored with laying by the pool. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The bedroom and bathroom were well-maintained and very clean (which is, of course, to be expected at a Ritz). The style is very simple though, so if you're looking for a modern and trendy room, or something over the top with luxury, this is not the hotel for you. While planning our trip, we struggled with staying here or at the Four Seasons in Wailea. We thought the Four Seasons would be a little more decadent and \"at-your-service.\" But when we learned that the Four Seasons shares their beach with the #1 family resort in Maui, we opted for the Ritz to have a more romantic honeymoon. While in Maui, we checked out the Four Seasons, and we were glad with our decision. The Four Seasons is in a \"hotel row,\" and right next to a huge mall (even if it is high-end shopping, I don't want to vacation next to a mall.) We've heard the Four Season's has an adult pool and staff come around with frozen grapes, mist you water, etc etc. The Ritz did not have these services. We were certainly bummed, but it didn't ruin our vacation. We had a wonderful experience at the Ritz spa, that made up for the simplicity of the pool service. We did a couples package and we enjoyed every minute of it. Everything was very clean and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. But, the real shining star was the concierge. We stayed on the club level and had our own concierge- they booked everything for us, gave us tips, maps, and even a CD to play on the Road to Hana that tells you when to stop and explains what you're looking at. They weren't too much help when we wanted to know where to get the best local food, but when we found out from our instructor at Maui Paddle Sports, they were extremely interested in getting a copy of our restaurant list in case anyone else inquired (apparently most people staying at the Ritz don't ask about the best food trucks for a mix plate).

This resort is beautiful and well-manicured, as you would expect. The room was exquisite, although it was on the 3rd floor, it was actually ground level with the golf course. I found room service food to be over-rated and not worth the expense; ended up going to the bar for great coffee and light breakfast for less than $20. The waitstaff at breakfast at the bar were fantastic. The pool is nice, although there doesn't seem to be any enforcement of the \"adult\" pool despite posted signs. One of the reasons I'm giving the hotel 4 stars was that the service at the pool for drinks/lunch was very iffy, and generally not attentive. We did lunch at the beachside cafe several days and found the food there to be awesome. There is a beach that you can walk to that is nice; it does have public access so it can become quite crowded. I did not find the \"walk\" that others allude to here to be challenging, but there is about a 2-3 minute walk from the pool to the beach, or a 2-3 minute walk from the pool to the lobby. There are golf carts now that will transport guests up and down the trails. I thought the gym was amazing, particularly for a hotel; multiple cardio machines, weight machines, and free weights available. There were also yoga and pilates classes available that I did not take but were well attended. The shops were a bit snooty, particularly the art gallery/store and the women's boutique next to it-staff barely said hello let alone seek to assist, which is a stark contrast to the general warmth and welcome seen throughout most other parts of the hotel. We ate at Merrimans, which we loved; great food, ambience,etc. Outdoor seating right on the beach, highly recommend. We also went to Pineapple Grill one night, good food, very traditional, on the golf course/tennis courts. The trails around the resort (Kapalua) are great; some great ocean/wave views if you head along the boardwalk just outside of the hotel grounds. The most discouraging part of the stay was our experience at the bar in the evening; we had 3 people come over to tell us they would be back to take our drink order; then didn't. We had to basically stop the 3rd person and ask for an order; a 4th waitstaff actually brought the drinks and was not exactly nice.

Amazing Service\u201d", "Author": "drosen85", "ReviewID": "UR122339546", "Content": "We just landed back in San Francisco after an amazing stay at the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua. We stayed the week between Christmas and New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The most popular week of the year, obviously more expensive given the demand and 100% occupancy. Now for the review\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Unquestionably a five star review. Room quality, public spaces, pool, dining options. All top tier. Beyond that, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get to the highlights and things that might excite you about staying at this property. 1. Since we last stayed here, the resort has gone back to Hawaii \u00e2\u20ac\u201c years ago, it was frankly too Ritz Carlton. The public spaces might well have been in Buckhead. The new d\u00c3\u00a9cor is casual, light, Hawaiian and comfortably elegant. 2. The latest addition added what are called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential suites.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These rooms are large two-room suites with nicely functioning kitchens (note: stop at Safeway or Whole Foods on your way from the airport for beer, Cokes, Maui potato chips and milk & cookies). For our family of two parents and two teen-agers, absolutely perfect size for comfort and privacy. 3. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it to get the breakfast package. The buffet at the Terrace is amazing, filling, and delicious. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll actually save money because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll eat so much for breakfast that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll skip lunch. (Always worth asking for a club upgrade in lieu of breakfast as it will add the afternoon cocktail snack as well.) 4. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be wary about asking for advice from the bellmen, pool team and concierges. They are knowledgeable and truly enjoy helping guests enjoy their stay more. In fact for those guests who are more independent, they seem to relish in their advice of secret snorkel spots and off-beat poke markets. Just because you are staying at a five star resort, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to go native. 5. Special shout out to Clint at the bell stand. Awesome Dude. You are the best. I hope that you are rewarded a hundred times over for your amazing service. 6. OK, Kapalua is windy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the clouds that the trade winds bring in are a bit harsher on the property than elsewhere on the island. Bottom line.

There is plenty to do for couples and adults. Not the best choice for families, however. If we were with our children we would choose a different location due to lack of creative pool areas and kid centered activities. We were greeted in the usual Ritz way-classy and attentive.

Our room was clean and comfortable yet smaller in size for an upgraded club level room, with a chaise lounge and table w/ chairs. Not over the top like some Ritz rooms. The bed was dream like-I actually slept well it was so comfy. The granite/slate bathroom was very spacious and elegant with a separate shower, bath tub, and toilet area. The bath ammenities were generous and smelled heavenly. I actually purchased the lotion to take home! The housekeeping of our rooms was a little tardy-often it wasn't cleaned until 3 or so in the afternoon. The pools were clean and always had a lounge chairs available with plenty of towels and bar service by accomodating and friendly college aged staff.

So much so that everyday you see tons of guest leaving with towels being given out at valet. Get 10 min from hotel and it's sunny. Go figure. It's like a black cloud is always over the property. 2. The food is bad. We've eaten allover the property including room service and it's just not good. Not to mention very over priced even for a Ritz I.e a waffle with butter $25. 3.

Even hard-to-please people would have a difficult time complaining about this place, though the location means people who like being in the center of activity should avoid it. Location: The Ritz is located on Kapalua beach, which is about 20 minutes north of Lahaina and 15 minutes north of Kaanapali. It's a touch remote, but is worth it for me as this meant a much quieter vacation. If this are were Las Vegas, Kaanapali would be the strip with reams of people while Kapalua would be a beautiful ranch just outside the city. Service: The only complaint I had in this area was rectified. We had some really slow pool service one day, but when I stood up to flag down the waiter a managerial-type person ran up to me and took care of my order and then attended to those around me who also may have been neglected. Everything else was outstanding. Any questions were asked, and the staff gave me lots of local, inside tips for exploring West Maui. Room: Room was good, but probably if I had to pick a 'low spot' of the trip this would be it. It wasn't very soundproofed as I could hear people chattering in the hall and moving above me. The room had a great patio, but it unfortunately didn't have a light! When the sun goes down at 5:45 this is a must in my opinion. Otherwise the room was great. Nice big TV, great maid service, two free bottles of water everyday. Amenities: The pool here is fantastic. The middle pool is 'adults only', and I did see an attendant kick two kids out of it one day. The beach is extremely close....people who complain about the 'hike' to the beach are absolutely out of their mind. 3 minutes from the Ritz, tops. And it's a beautiful walk over perfectly manicured lawns. The beach itself (DT Fleming) is considered one of the best in Hawaii. It's sheltered so the wind isn't crazy, is nice and calm during low tide for swimming, but perfect during high tide for boogey boarding or surfing. The hotel is also serviced by a Kapalua shuttle, which will take you anywhere in the immediate area for free. This service is also on-demand, which is awesome. Whenever you want it, just speak to a nearby attendant and it will come scoop you up. Ditto for returning, as most of Kapalua seems to service the Ritz. Nearby Services: These were great. Staying at the Ritz is obviously expensive, and eating there only exascrbates this issue. There is a Kapalua 'General Store' about a 5 minute walk away that has a deli, grocery store, and liquor. Given the mini-fridge in the room, you can really make use of this. There's also an excellent Japanese restaurant near the General Store (Sansei), which has quality on-par with the Ritz but prices are about 50% cheaper. Overall this place won me over.

We drove up and there was a greeter who immediately opened my door and said hello, then the actual bellman came over and assisted with our luggage. As we walked into the lobby we were greeted again this time with polished nut shell lays. We tried to check in but the room was not ready yet. The Front Desk (my specialty) hit all of the service standards perfectly! They then provided a map to head to the pool and relax. When our room is ready they will call our cell. From there we went right to the pool, walked over to the towel desk and they escorted us over to pool chairs and laid out our towels for us. Most of the pool servers were great throughout our stay! We had one who was a little bit snobby, no smiles or thank you can from her but I do want to throw a shout out to Dustin, he did an amazing job during our week stay! We walked into our room (the walk from the lobby to our room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no joke was a 5-7 minute walk down one hallway. Luckily we still have young legs but if this might be an issue be sure to ask for a room near the lobby) which was tastefully done with dark woods and beach themed furniture. The bathrooms were very nice with a full tub and separate shower. All of the amenities were of great quality and placed well throughout the room. When our luggage came the bellman hit all of his service standards of explain how things worked and were things were located. He provided us extra hangers and ice on the spot. We also requested to have the daily paper delivered which was there every morning.

Prior to booking this trip, I had done some research, and the reviews were very up and down and I now understand why. I will begin with the positives. The grounds and the rooms are beautiful. The issues are the location, which makes seeing the attractions on Maui difficult. This would not be an issue if there were more to do on the resort itself, but there are very few activities within walking distance of the property. The pools are nice, and they are open 24 hours, but the area is very windy. While there, I was unimpressed with the level of service. The house keeping service was not very thorough, the front desk personnel were not very helpful, especially during the check-in process, and the overall level of service was not what I expected from a Ritz-Carlton property. One particular example is that I left my vehicle keys in the room after checking out, and did not realize my mistake until reaching the Maui airport from which I was scheduled to fly to Oahu. I spoke with a representative in the loss prevention department, who took my name and information after locating the keys, and the gentlemen informed me that he would send my keys back to me. After waiting 18 days, I called the loss prevention department on the 26th and was put on hold while someone tried to figure out the location of my keys. After 30 minutes on hold, I was told that I would be given a call back. I did not receive a call back, so I called again the following day and was told that my keys had been sent to the mainland by mistake, and I would have them sent to me as soon as they were returned. I am not upset that the keys were sent to the wrong address. What I am upset about is that nobody bothered to inform me of this, and that I was not even given a call back as promised.

It was definitely a nice hotel, we were greeted with leis and assisted with our bags right away after check-in. They also call to your room soon after to make sure you are pleased with everything and can request anything else you may need. Rooms were pretty nice and plenty of room. Beds were very comfortable and I love hotels give you a variety of soft and hard pillows! ;) Housekeeping came two times per day unless you hang up your do not disturb sign, which was nice for towels and water bottles. They also gave me new amenties every time which was awesome--shampoo, conditioner, body wash, mouthwash, lotion, etc. The service everywhere was always excellent, but honestly, I did not think the hotel itself was up to Ritz standards. It looked more like a Marriot or some other hotel chain that is nice but not quite luxurious. The pool was the only area of the hotel where I felt like I was at a Ritz-Carlton with upscale feel of it, and the Cabanas and waitresses bringing your drinks right to you. Also the spa was amazing! Quite expensive but it's the best in West Maui by far. Free use of the whirlpool, relaxation room/hot tea, steam room & sauna the whole day of your spa treatment. Definitely worth every penny. Staff was excellent. The downside is it's quite a walk to get to your room and the beach. It's a huge resort and since there are burial grounds between the ritz and the beach, they had to build a little further back. But minor inconvenience when you're in Maui it's enjoyable to walk around anyways. Another thing is Kapalua is super windy and sprinkles a few times every day usually. Also, the restaurants are all very pricy even compared to the already pricy Maui, so renting a car is a must. I've seen people on here complain about how far it is to get to Lahaina...but I'm thinking that's just laziness? We rented a Jeep wrangler so with the top down it was nice to cruise around and it's beautiful scenery everywhere, i can't see how anyone would complain about that! It only took us about 10 minutes to get to Kaanapali, and 15 to Lahaina where all the action is. The Gazebo, located 2 min from the resort, is an excellent place for breakfast. Also make sure you go to the Lahaina Grill. Don't be fooled by the name--best restaurant...steak, seafood, you name it! Overall, Four Seasons is way better if you are looking for luxury, but I love West Maui so if you're staying on this side of the island the Ritz is the way to go!

It was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. My wife and I frequently stay at 4 and 5 star hotels, and the Ritz met and exceeded our expectations. I seriously do not get how fussy people can be on tripadvisor sometimes. The Ritz was everything I could have dreamed about for my honeymoon. Room: We had a partial ocean view room (which was pretty much a complete ocean view room in actuality). The partial part would be that we could view part of the grounds/pool area in the corner. The bed....ohhhh the bed. The bed in this room was the most amazing, comfortable bed ever. No joke, my wife and I have tried to 'recreate the Ritz bed' in our apartment. It is a giant fluffy cloud and it is heaven. As we are NY'ers and took a while to adjust to Hawaii time, I was up at 645 or 7am every day and really enjoyed sitting on the balcony, having my Kona coffee (which was so great) and staring at the ocean. Ahhh. Food: Yes, the food is expensive...its the Ritz, what do you expect. But I must say that every meal we ate there was so good! I still think about the Grand Marnier French Toast and Banana Pancakes for breakfast, the burger at the Beach cafe is so good, and i loved the maui onion dip and chips by the pool. After the first morning we ate breakfast at the Honalua General Store, which is literally on the other side of parking lot. It was a good way to save some money and the food there was actually really good. Same with Sensei Sushi down the road. Pool and Beach. The pool(s) are awesome and there is staff constantly attending to you asking if you would like drinks, fresh fruit, food, etc. The beach is absolutely beautiful and private. Every time I was there, I was one of about 4 people on the beach. It's cove-like...but still gets decent waves. You can see straight to Molokai and the water is crystal clear. Everyone is complaining about wind, which I never experienced once. It was not windy at all when I was there. Location: Yes, it is a long, hour drive to the airport. But, what I loved about Kapalua was that it was not on \"the strip\" of Kanapali or Wailea. I liked its semi-secluded location. It was a tad annoying as far as driving to Haleakula, or driving the Road to Hana....but we had rented a Mustang...and with the top down, I could have driven for 8 hours and not cared. If you want a sense of seculsion, the Ritz is the way to go (over Kanapali or Wailea hotels). The Ritz was pretty accomodating about our treatment for our honeymoon. We got free drinks and appetizers at the bar and, had we not booked the partial ocean view, we would have gotten an upgrade to that level. The concierge was great about booking tours/activities and making reservations for us. They had great recommendations. The spa was also incredible. We had a couples massage, and it was heaven. The rest of the spa is beautiful and the various pools, hot tubs and facilities are fantastic. Plus, i liked the pre-massage champagne they served us. Good touch Ritz! All in all, the Ritz was incredible. The room, the food, the pool, the beach, the service was all top notch. Do not listen to the fussy babies who complain about this hotel.

I will never never never book with this ritz again. For 5k I felt cheated and I would have been happier to stay at a HOLIDAY INN!!!!!!!! I am so unsatisfied with this stay that I will be writing The Ritz and other companies as well. I recommend you DO not stay at this resort. EVER! I am sorry that this was MY one and ONLY honeymoon and I spent a week at this crap resort. This is no 5 star resort, its at best a 1 or a 2.

We stayed 8 nights with one of those being free and we had a $500 resort credit as part of our package. We entered our room to find a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries. A good first impression. The room, and king size bed, were phenomenal. Very clean, quiet and roomy. I've read mixed reviews of the club level, but my wife and I loved it. From a value perspective, you can't beat it. We had breakfast there every morning and lunch on most days. Free drinks are a big plus. At the pool, two Mai Tai's cost $25, so having a few drinks with lunch or at any time (e.g. Bloody Mary's for breakfast) can easily justify the additional cost. The place is windy. My wife and I found this to be a plus. It keeps you cool while under the hot sun. It does cause some sandblasting while on the beach so my wife and I opted for the cushioned chairs around the beach restaurant. Still had the wind but also had shade, no sandblasting and a waitress. Service was excellent all the way around. Everyone we met was polite and knowledgeable. Many of them knew us by name. Especially the concierge in the club lounge. Leslie was superb. I went for a run one afternoon around the property. I finished at the lobby and was surprised to be greeted by a staff member with a large glass of ice cold lemon water. It's the little touches that make a big difference. Along with everyone else, I too did not appreciate the \"resort fee\". If you don't use the wifi or the gym or park a car, you are essentially paying for nothing. Considering the price of the room, these services should be included. We liked the fact that the hotel is isolated as we visited \"Hotel Row\" in Lahaina and didn't like it one bit. We did visit the Four Seasons hotel for dinner one evening at Ferraro's. Terribly disappointing. My wife's risotto was like soup and you couldn't see anything as the lighting was terrible. Everyone around us was using flashlights so they could see their food.

We've been pampered by 5 star hotels before but felt like royalty here. SERVICE - Excellent! As soon as you walk near the front doors, you were greeted, offered a shell necklace, your luggage was transported on a trolley, and there was lemon-flavoured water. Everything was seamless! We were next in line at the check-in but there was only one staff (during peak check-in hours..4pm). Not a major problem, though we did have to wait a bit. We told them it was our honeymoon and they immediately upgraded us to a room with a better view. The staff were very friendly and provided us with restaurant/activity recommendations when we asked. CLEANLINESS - Excellent! Cleanliness is very important to me and the Ritz room and grounds were immaculate. The rooms were cleaned twice a day! ROOMS - Excellent! The room and washroom were quite spacious and the washroom had a large shower, bathtub, and two sinks. The floors were hardwood, which were mopped every day! The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Our room had a lanai which was very nice. LOCATION - Average. If I were with family/friends, I may not choose this hotel only because of the location. The reviews are true - it was a little windy in the area, making the water cooler (too cold for us to swim in). It is also an hour drive from the airport and 15 mins from another beach. There is a beautiful beach on the resort but to see the rest of Maui, you had to drive quite a bit. The location is great if you plan to stay on the resort property and it is very private/secluded (not rows of hotels). FOOD - Very good! Our first meal was at the pool bar. It was decent, but not worth the price. Every Tuesday night, they have a fixed price dinner by the beach. The cost was $35 per person and included a trio appetizer, trio entree, and a trio dessert. The food was very good and the view was amazing. Very reasonable price for a hotel dinner by the beach - would definitely recommend it! The breakfast buffet is a MUST - it's only $10/person more if you book in advance (with your room rate) but the cost is $30/person. It was the best breakfast I've ever had - they have an omelet station, pancakes/waffles/French toast, eggs, muffins, croissants, cereals, juice station, fresh fruit - pretty much anything you can think of for breakfast and it was so delicious! VALUE - It was not cheap to stay here but we booked the hotel with a \"stay 4 nights, get one night free\" promotion.

We stayed here for 6 nights and loved every minute of it. The location was just perfect for us, away from all the big resorts, but close enough to travel anywhere. The wind was a welcome addition for us, it kept us cool during the hot august temperature. We ended up getting the club level room upgrade based on some reviews here and had some input to add. For $100 a night you get to use the concierge room which includes: 1. free drinks 2. dedicated concierge staff to talk to at any time about anything you need. 3. Food: snacks throughout the day(breakfast, lunch, midday snack, pre dinner snacks, desserts). My wife and I found that all of these things were nice but were not sure if they were worth the money. One thing that is not advertised is that you cannot take drinks out of the concierge room. We found that this was pretty inconvenient since we would have preferred to sip our fruity drinks in the privacy of our own balcony or by the pool. (there is a balcony in the concierge room, but with only a couple of tables so you have to be lucky to snag one) All of the food tasted great, but we decided that breakfast was pretty similar every day (we get tired of the same thing every morning 7 mornings in a row). Also, I like a little protein in the morning and the selection includes mostly carbs with some fruit. The concierge people were great, they were genuinely interested in what we were doing for the day and made great recommendations(make sure to ask where to stop on the road to hana). In our opinion we would not do the club level again. We would rather get a very nice breakfast somewhere and have a couple drinks on the resort for less than $100 a day. One thing we definitely would recommend is the Casabella - beach-side covered chairs that include water and a pineapple plate for $50 a day. You will want to make reservations prior to your arrival at the Ritz. It's nice to have your own space and shade right near the beach. As for restaurant recommendations: Pineapple grill- fantastic place walkable from the ritz, overlooks the golf course on one side and the ocean on the other. The food is outstanding. Roy's - one of our favorites- make sure to try the souffle and the warm tomato and onion salad Spago at the Four Seasons - a little bit of a drive, but well worth it Plantation House - really close to the ritz, lets you pick your fish and you preparation.

Ok, not part of the $700/night fee.... The suite was better than expected and capped off when room service brought up a complimentary bottle of champagne and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries as my wife and I were celebrating out 20th wedding anniversary.

Ok, I can still see the ocean, so be it, not like I'm going to spend my days staring off my balcony, even though I paid for it. After settling in we headed down to the pool, pretty small pools for a hotel this big. Maybe the beach is where it's at... where's the beach???? Just follow the path all the way around there for about 1/4 and it's right there!?!?!?!? WHAT??? beach front hotel and the beach is 1/4mi away? Yep, ancient burial ground between you and the beach!!! Ok, so the ritz provides a golf cart shuttle back and forth. word of advice, it's faster to walk then to wait for the golf cart which is never to be seen. Down on the beach chairs are not laid out, you can ask the towel person to bring the beach chairs down for you. nice service. Once on the beach the first thing you will notice aside from the fantastic view is the wind. The wind is non stop and I'm not talking a cool maui breeze, it's so strong that when someone walks by the sand that they walked on gets lifted by the wind and you get pelted by a mini sand storm. I was told it's not the weather and it is the norm for the northern coast of maui. The food was average at best, nothing to write about other than it was expensive, to be expected as you are staying at the ritz. The hotel charges a $25 daily service fee that includes wifi, pool towels, gym usage parking?? etc... which I'm ok with... but wait! parking i was told I had to pay for parking? sir that is valet parking you have to pay for, the service fee gives you the right to park your own car\" raised eyebrow is now shaking my head. I then asked if they could print out my boarding passes for me, to which I was told I can do so myself in the business center... for a fee. Can someone remind me why I'm staying at a 5star hotel and paying $700/nite? If you want a true 5 star hotel in Maui, stay at the 4 seasons, too many negatives here. When we stayed at the 4seasons my last stay, I was greeted by name and a warm greeting by each staff member everyday. Here I was lucky to get a head nod.

The pool and jacuzzi were open all night and it was very family friendly. There were basketball courts, tennis courts, bocci ball, shuffleboard, a jungle gym, and tons of great golf. The only negatives to this resort is that it is a little difficult to get to any of the other areas in Maui. So, if you plan on seeing Lahaina or going to the other side of the island; you will need to rent a car and valet at the hotel is quite expensive. However, the good news is that you really don't really need to leave the resort area and they do provide a shuttle to take you places in Kapalua (there are some fantastic restaurants off the resort) The only other negative is that things close relatively early.

This was a fantastic resort and we absolutely loved it - we were extremely sorry to leave! The Kapalua area is breathtakingly beautiful, and the resort is stunning. We stayed at the Westin Kaanapali Villas the first week of our trip, and both of us agreed that arriving at the Ritz felt like we were on a different (and far more luxurious!) vacation, even though it was just 10 minutes up the road. With the exception of the poolside cabanas (more details below), we were extremely pleased with the service at this resort. The staff was super friendly and helpful, and really went above and beyond. This began with the wonderful front desk staff at check-in. We had booked an ocean view, one-bedroom suite, and upon arrival we were upgraded to an ocean view residential suite (one bedroom with kitchen), which was wonderful. The suite was spotless, beautiful, and well-appointed, and we loved the two lanais. Our luggage was delivered to our room within minutes of our arrival, and the bellman was very friendly and gave us lots of great tips for our stay. We were celebrating our anniversary on this trip, and they treated us to a bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries in our room, which was a nice touch. The spa was incredible - possibly the best massage I've ever had. Now for the cabana service. We had booked a full day cabana rental for $100, and our initial contact with our server was when he asked us early on if we wanted to look at a lunch menu. We had just finished breakfast, so we declined at that point. He then completely ignored us for the rest of the morning, though he spent lots of time catering to the couple in the cabana next to ours. We got the impression that they had been at the resort for awhile and \"knew\" this server, which is fine, but there was really no excuse for him to go to them on multiple occasions and then walk right by us without even a glance in our direction. I had to flag him down to order a daquiri. Service markedly improved after I told him (again after flagging him down) that we would be ordering lunch. We concluded that because we had initially declined the lunch menu (remember, it was not yet lunch time) he had decided that he was not going to get a big tip from us, so we were not worth bothering with. By the way, we have always been very good tippers, and we did indeed tip him the full amount at the end of the day. However, when we were already staying in a very expensive suite and shelling out $100 more for a cabana, I expected better service.

I do wish the pools were a tad bigger. There are three separate pools, with one designated only for adults, which I loved; however, it was always crowded so we had to hang out at the kids' pool every so often. One thing I love the most about the Ritz is that it basically has its own private beach and is not shared with any other properties -- like those of the Grant Wailea and Four Seasons in Wailea, so it doesn't get too crowded. The walk is easy but they offer shuttle service if you don't feel like walking that day. We ventured over to the Grand Wailea to see what it was all about and boy, was that place crazy packed! We loved how the Ritz was a bit isolated from the other resorts. The Grand Wailea looked a bit outdated. We also ate at the Plantation house (eh) and Sansei (great!), which are practically next door.

Or, do 15 min walk over coast trail to kapalua bay -snorkeling there so easy and fun and it does seem to be sunny even when clouds over the ritz. you can rent chairs and snorkels at kapalua bay by the hour, just bring couple towels from the ritz. merryman's restaurant there on that cove - gorgeous setting, highly recommend you reserve for a sunset table there for dinner one night. our favorite spot was the ritz beach bar in late afternoon. friendly bartender and a few chill patrons, good musicians playing on terrace, great cushioned lounge chairs & sofas under the palms, overlooking spectacular cove (fleming beach i think), fun drinks and tasty burger type snacks. can't beat this spot for prolonging a day in paradise. the ritz concierges are very good at setting you up for a snorkel trip (we loved 1/2 day on allie nui (?)), really enjoyed the luau even though it is kind of a corny tourista thing to do. concierge is best resource for restaurant menus and reservations. also - buy \"Maui Revealed\" - guidebook with great suggestions for exploring. if you have car (we recommend one for the duration of stay) get out and explore esp close-by spots. (dont bother driving all the way to wailea, its more of the same and lot of driving on featureless highway). check out short drive north of ritz -the honolua bay (i think) is very cool snorkeling spot you access though a short hike. and the blowhole another couple miles north of that is cool to check out. definitely take the hike right from the grounds of hotel along the coast, & cliffs between ritz and rest of kapalua. as for hana - it is spectacular. the road there is gorgeous and its only a little taste of what's ahead. however, would not recommend doing it if you just drive to hana & back in same day -too much car time and not enough fun time. only suggest doing the drive to hana if you stay a couple or more days there. off the grid and sights that are off the charts. we rented a cottage based on tripadvisor recommendation and it was lovely. spent 2+ days exploring the area and fell in love with it. wished we did another 1-2 days in hana. no nightlife, eat at roadside foodstands (suggest cafe romantica, buddah bbq just across from romantica). diiner at hana hotel very expensive and very forgettable. hana is not about the establishments or meals, its about the place. eat well at lunch at roadside places or burger at hana ranch and have low expectations for dinner. spend your time in hana exploring - its really not to be missed. and if you do make trip to hana from ritz, time it so you stop for early lunch at mama's fish house in pai'a on the way to hana.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cOne amazing experience!\u201d", "Author": "WorldTravelerZV", "ReviewID": "UR117217932", "Content": "We stayed at Ritz Carlton Kapalua in year 2006 and loved everything about it.

The food there was good and they are always stocked with delicious goodies. The concierge desk in the club room was also very helpful. They were able to help us book some excursions and they gave us some places to go check out (a local rib shop and a local park that isn't well known to visitors).

The hotel was very easy to find and it feels like a secluded paradise once you enter the premises. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful but also laid back, which contributes to the relaxed atmosphere. We had a complimentary goodies waiting for us in our room because it was our honeymoon. They go out of their way to make you feel at home. The room itself was enormous, with first rate amenities. There was a WALK IN CLOSET, and a balcony that ran the entire length of the room. The view was spectacular, overlooking the 5 pools and the ocean! My only complaint was that the soaking tub was a bit small. Otherwise, perfect accommodations. The food and service were both lovely at the Banyan Tree restaurant, particularly the steak. The best meal we had was room service for breakfast, placed out on the lanai. We had chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes, omlette with goat cheese and pesto and fresh POG (pineapple orange guava juice) and kona coffee. It was $$ but the experience was well worth it.

Perfected.\u201d", "Author": "R A", "ReviewID": "UR116487844", "Content": "First I should probably say that I've never felt the urge to write a review for any hotel I've stayed at before. Most of my hotel stays in the past have been monotonous- as if there were standards across the hotel industry in five star hotels of which most hotels simply meet and choose to not overachieve. After checking out of this hotel, I must say that the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua refines the five star hotel experience. Seriously, I've stayed in properties of the same echelon all over the world, and none of them match the service here. ARRIVAL AND CHECK-IN Upon driving up to the hotel, you feel a sense of comfort and hospitality. We arrived at 11 AM, and no sooner had the car come to a full stop were everyone's doors opened and luggage placed on a bell cart. Then, we proceeded to check in. Our receptionist Johnny handled everything absolutely smoothly. We had arrived five hours before check-in time, but he was quick to accommodate us. We were originally booked in a One-Bedroom Ocean View Residential Suite, but he kindly upgraded us to the Ocean Front Suite. Our room wasn't ready, so we waited a while, and ended up going off-property for lunch. When we returned, Johnny apologized for our suite not being ready, and offered us drinks at the Alaloa Bar (a must-do on arrival!). Within thirty minutes, a manager located a suite and assigned us keys, having our luggage escorted to the room. An upgrade and free drinks... they sure know how to keep me happy :). THE ROOM I think the name describes it all... the suite was spectacular. Despite the fact that it was a long hike to the room, it was worth it at the end. Upon walking in, a foyer with a golf-course view was waiting. Exotic hardwood floors filled the bedroom and living room, and both bathrooms were cladded in mosaic tile and limestone. You could tell that no expense was spared here. The views from the bedroom overlooked the entire golf course, and the living room had an expansive corner balcony with sweeping views of the ocean. Best. Hotel. Room. Ever. THE SERVICE Like I said before, service is unparalleled. My only qualm is regarding pool service. I arrived at the hotel after checking-out of the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort and Spa, where the staff meticulously looked after every guest at the pool. There seemed to be a lack of staff at the pool in the evenings, and the fact that towel service stops at 5 PM is a little ridiculous. The Grand Hyatt has 24 hour service. DINING We only ate breakfast on one day at The Terrace Restaurant, which was absolutely delicious. The belgian waffles had fresh fruit, and the mediterranean omelet with pesto sauce was a unique twist on traditional breakfast. Very good indeed! THE GROUNDS After staying at the Grand Hyatt (which has the BEST hotel grounds), the simple three tier pool and single hot tub seemed pathetic. Granted, had I come to Maui first, I would've fallen in love with the grounds. No matter how simple, they were meticulously kept. THE LOCATION Kapalua is at the end of the island... meaning that not much is close (sightseeing wise). The area is very exclusive and gorgeous, though. ADVICE Dine on Front Street in Lahaina. All the restaurants were good, and most had live music. Most people advise not to drive past Kapalua on Highway 30... don't listen to them. The sights were amazing... more breath-taking than the Hana Highway (waste of a day, that was...). Also, whether you're just coming to Maui or to multiple islands, book using a vacation package on Expedia. I saved approximately $2600, which means that I paid the standard room price for a suite!!!!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPros & Cons\u201d", "Author": "MIOL2", "ReviewID": "UR116436519", "Content": "This was our second visit to the resort but the first since the renovations.

Attention to detail - they sent up a bottle of champagne and strawberries for my birthday - nice gesture! Cons: Food quality slipped. I have always said they had the best burgers beach side than anywhere else I have been....not anymore. Looks like they stopped doing there own. They also had a golf cart shuttle service up and down the hill for the beach, we only saw that on one day. Front desk - Gentlemen at check in was personable but not accommodating at all and had absolutely no followup to my questions at check in. Servers seem to work on tips pool side because they asked us every 20 minutes if we needed something...maybe they should add those flags to the side of the lounge chairs as not to disturb you all the time. And finally for my biggest pet peeve and why I may think twice about returning....on 2 separate occasions at breakfast in the Terrance Restaurant I was completely ignored by 2 different female servers. They addressed my husband by name and removed his plate and offered him more but NEVER served me or addressed me. My plate was only removed once we put it in front of him.

Last year had a wonderful time staying at the Four Seasons in Wailea, but found ourselves driving up to Kapalua for dinner a few times, quite a trek esp at night. We found both hotels are high quality in terms of service and amenities. Pros: 1. Location-close to everything! Lahaina, Fleming beach, snorkeling, shopping. Not to mention Merriman's, Sansei, Lahaina Grill, and Gerard's. 2. Snorkeling/Beach-love the complimentary shuttle from the hotel to Kapalua Beach. Don't forget to grab some hotel beach towels from the valet. There is some shade but you can rent the gear, chairs and umbrellas there. You call the shuttle when you're done for pick up. We paid $75 for 4 adults to snorkel for 3-4 hrs. While there is a bit of a walk down from the hotel to the public beach, they will set up chairs for you and there is a small grassy section the left and right of the beach restaurant (owned by the Ritz) where you can lounge in the shade and still walk to the water for swimming. It's not as fabulous as the beach service as FS but good enough. The waves are a bit rougher and it's at times windy but for the most part, still lots of fun! 3. General Store-this place is great! both as a cheap alternative for a homestyle lunch/afternoon snack and for souvenir shopping, they are now an affiliate of ABC stores. Within 3 min walking out of the hotel lobby, stroller friendly. Cons: 1. Hotel Restaurants: We ate at both the bar, the beach, and Banyan Tree. While the food was pretty good, you are definitely paying a premium for convenience rather than fine cuisine. 2. Spa: We were pretty disappointed with our lomi lomi couples massage. The spa itself has renovated facilities so it's very plush and luxurious, esp the women's quiet room/ jacuzzi area. However, the couples mssg takes place in a small hut that is right near the pool area, not totally secluded and you don't even hear the ocean, instead there's a mechanic hum from the hotel fans/machinery or kids playing. The lomi lomi felt a bit gimicky, esp for the price. 3. Weather-this part of maui is known for being windy and rainy. We were there for 5 days and it did rain on/off either early am or late at night. It didn't really affect any of our planned activities but it wasn't as warm and constant compared to Wailea. Of note for traveling with an infant, we had a pack and play set up in the room and we did fine! The kitchenette has a microwave for sterilizing and a nice big fridge/freezer for storage. They even included dishwasher detergent, sponges, coffee maker, toaster.

As for our room: immaculate. Wonderfully comfortable beds/pillows with down comforters. Daily cleaning and replenishing of anything needed. Staff was superb. We loved Cynthia, our concierge; she helped us map out our 6 days perfectly so that we did fun local things (biked down the volcano; surf lessons, and a luau;) but had plenty of time for just exploring and relaxing at the gorgeous pool or down at the beach. There is also a fabulous spa. The Honolua Store is a short, beautiful walk on property and has everything you might need, including extremely reasonable souvenirs, grocery items, a coffee shop, and cafe. We bought snacks, drinks, and cereal/milk for the room (we had a mini-fridge and also a room safe, which we didn't find until we left. :) There are two airports on the island and I booked my flight before realizing there is an airport much closer than Kahalui (sp?;) which is a 50-minute drive.

While we were assured at check in we had adjoining rooms but we actually did not. I felt like this was a minor request that should have been honored. We were on the same floor but not that close. We had a view of the golf course and again I felt like given the lack of guests that a pool view would have been nice. The resort was pretty empty (based on the few number of guests that we saw.. or didn't see). I can't comment on the staff since we really didn't see any of them. Rooms are nice with balconies. The beds weren't as comfortable as I expected and they way they made the bed with extra sheets underneath you was strange. The extra sheets got twisted up during the night and were uncomfortable to sleep on. The fitness center is awesome and immaculate. The buffet breakfast (I had 2 complimentary breakfasts included in my package) was extremely expensive... $30.00.... so for the 13 yr. old in our group big waste of money.

We decided to stay here because it is right near some very nice beaches, Kapalua and Naipili Bay and we got to use my husbands point from work travel. So I will start with the good, there is good food all around and the beaches are a shuttle ride away, 5-7 min. The Valet and bell guys could not be nicer or more helpful....in fact if it were not for them this hotel would get 1 star from me. They should be promoted to management! They definitely balanced out the fact that we ran into so many women ( i hate to say it because I am one) who were anything but nice. I felt like most the time they had a distinct flavor of us not wanting to bother them. That is a nice seq-way into the bad---the women who is the \"head valet\" was not nice at all. In fact she was rude. We stayed five nights, after several attempts on out part to try to be nice she just could not be bothered. Asking her for towels for the shuttle to go to the beach was super uncomfortable, it was almost as if she was so irritated that she barely would give any eye contact. I actually felt sorry for her, I know that customer service is hard, but come on!! I find this really annoying, considering the amount of money we shelled out for this hotel. Not only that I live in a very touristy place (San Diego) so I know about tourists, yet I never give people attitude just for being a \"tourist\" super LAME!!! There are other instances but I wont make this any longer. Another thing about this hotel was not a favorite of mine was the pool or the lack of it. It was probably the lamest pool I have been to at this level of hotel. I feel like this hotel is for older people who like to golf? It is super windy so there were barely any people at the pool ever. I mean windy, like grab your hat and any book you might be reading. Along with that, the attempt to have a kids area is lame as well... We planned our vacay for half up in West Maui and the rest in south Maui at Grand Walilea. (which you should do!) So we left and I realized we left our camera. Our 1000 dollar HD sony camera, I call the hotel when we got back yesterday and the security officer grills me about my room number and then tells me well it doesn't matter anyway no on has turned that camera in. OK> well as of now I have a call in to the manager and I am hoping to receive a call saying they have my camera. I will let you know. I think at this level stealing from guest should be highly unlikely, that's what I am hoping for. My advice, if you are older and you like very windy pools and dont mind attitude for the thousands of dollars you are spending stay here, if not stay somewhere else, but dont miss those beaches!!! Its too bad too, I really wanna like this place, but the people make the difference. Once we got to the Grand Walilea we got no attitude, in fact everyone was so nice.

Location: First and foremost the location is amazing. It's a little isolated from the more developed part of the island and that adds to it's exclusivity. Being surrounded by 4-5 beautiful beaches adds to it's aura. DT Fleming is right on the property and is heavenly. I highly recommend doing the Kapalua trail which is a little beyond the hotel. Service: The concierge service was excellent and prompt. We had one service mishap when on the very first night our room service order had to be given twice and it finally arrived 2 hours after we ordered it. But the food was good and they took it off our bill. Apart from this the service everywhere was superb. Property and Room: We had a partial sea and golf course view and it was beautiful! We could see the island of Molokai across the sea. I even caught a rainbow one morning after the daily morning shower, which is like a regular feature in Kapalua. The room was spacious, clean, well decorated and comfortable. Overall the property is very well developed with a sprawling golf course, spacious pool (though we didn't spend much time there - world class beaches were close by, remember?), tennis courts etc. Food and dining: On site there were quite a few options food. We only sampled the fare at The Terrace - good, solid breakfast/brunch and Banyan Tree - classy and loved the pea soup but not my entr\u00c3\u00a9e so much. But the location and feel at night is very relaxing. Spa: This is probably one of the best spa experiences I've ever had. Good enough for me to forget the 25 minute delay in the beginning. I appreciated the emphasis on relaxing, no rush to throw you out and the facilities available. My favorite - the exclusive, clothing optional hot tub for women which looked as if the room had been cut out of lava rocks. I had an excellent masseuse who was very careful since mine was a prenatal massage. Snorkeling: I wanted to mention my husband'd experience with the City under the Sea snorkelling excursion available by Ritz Carlton. Since this was his first time and he's not the best swimmer around so we wanted a guided service. The excursion was memorable for him. He was the only person taking the excursion that day so it was like a one on one experience. Kevin - the instructor was very knowledgeable and he took us through a presentation about reefs, how they are formed and the dangers facing them along with the wildlife there. He was an excellent guide and took some great pictures for us too. I would like to add that though I didn't go snorkelling I had gone along with them to the beach. He was very attentive especially after knowing that I was pregnant and included me in all the other activities. Environmental Consciousness: We appreciated the hotels efforts towards environmental consciousness and preservation. This was reflected everywhere. From their Ambassadors program to the room service. IMPORTANT WARNING: Please don't follow your GPS while driving from the airport to the hotel. It will take you through the unrecommended, dangerous and very narrow route through 340 via Honokohau. You should take 380 and come via Lahaina. Though the former route is beautiful it gets really treacherous at times and it's okay if you're prepared for it, but not after a 13 hour flight when you think you're in the middle of nowhere.

We were there to celebrate the 50th birthdays for me and my husband. When we first got there, we decided to upgrade from 1 guest room with 2 queen size beds. At first we had asked about getting a second room but Davison, the young man at the Reception Desk that was helping us suggested we consider the one bedroom suite with a pull out sofa. The upgrade was less expensive than getting 2 separate rooms. Talk about customer service, he was terrific and he really took his time with us. We asked him to add a roll away bed which was no problem and no additional charge. Housekeeping took care of setting it up later that night. The suite was unbelievable. We had a beautiful ocean view from the balcony off of the living room and a view overlooking the golf course from our second balcony in our bedroom. Both views were great and the suite could accommodate me and my husband and our 2 teenagers. The roll away bed worked for our teenage daughter. The sleep sofa was not as comfortable for our teenage son so we set up the chaise lounge in our room for him to sleep. It was a comfortable option. And there were 2 bathrooms in the suite which definitely worked well for our family. By the way, the moisturizer they provide is the best I have ever received while staying at a hotel. My husband even liked it. Prior to leaving for our trip, I had sent a request through the hotel's website mentioning we were coming for our 50th birthdays and were interested in getting reservations to see a luau. Cynthia in Concierge took care of the luau request and then some. When we got back to our room one night after dinner, we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine, chilled glasses and a plate covered with shredded coconut and topped with chocolate covered strawberries with a note written in chocolate on the plate wishing both of us Happy 50th Birthdays with a birthday card from the ladies and gentlemen of The Ritz Carlton Kapalua. What a surprise! The other people working the Concierge Desk were also terrific. Mary was very informative. We also were given excellent dessert recommendations from one of the gentleman. They all want to help make your stay memorable. Housekeeping was wonderful the entire stay. I hope everyone tips them well while they are there. They keep the rooms looking lovely and stocked with bottled waters, coffees, etc. The condiment packs provided for the coffees and teas do not include a lot of Sweet & Low and my husband had mentioned it to one of the sweet housekeeping ladies. She loaded up the tray with more than enough Sweet & Low packets so my husband was set for the week. The valets were friendly and quick. They were very pleasant and helpful when they would offer suggestions to us as we would head out for the day. And would greet us with smiles and questions about how our day had been on our return. The grounds are beautiful. My son and I went running a few mornings. Sometimes we took the Coastal Trail which has an amazing view and had a great breeze and our last morning we also ran over to the Plantation Course about a mile away. I can see why the PGA has played there. The entire family used the fitness center during our stay. They have a lot of equipment and machines. It is open around the clock. At 7:00 am most of the elliptical machines and treadmills are being used so you may want to time your visit. There is also a restroom/locker room area which is convenient and nice. There are numerous restaurants. We ate breakfast a couple of mornings in The Terrace Restaurant. They have a wonderful brunch. The fruit is fresh and sweet. The gentleman making the omelettes does a terrific job. We also ate dinner at The Pineapple Grill over by the Bay Course around the corner and at The Plantation House over by the Plantation Course up the road a bit. Both experiences were delicious. And Aaron at The Plantation House brought us out Brownie Sundaes with candles at our birthday dinner with a signed card from the staff at the restaurant. Nice touch! For those times where you do not want to spend a lot on a meal, the Honolua Store within walking distance of the resort has meals available. We went for breakfast and lunch a number of days. It is very good and very reasonable. You can also buy sunscreen and other goodies. It is definitely less expensive than the shop in the hotel for those types of items. The pool area is nice. There are 3 pool levels. The middle pool is the adult pool. There is a kiddie pool and 2 spas available too. As others have mentioned, there are cabanas available to rent and some shaded chairs available. The first day at the pool we had Dustin helping us with towels and food. He was very attentive. Other days, however, some of the pool staff had been more involved helping the cabana people since the people renting cabanas are paying money for the use of them. Oh well. The food and drinks at the pool area are tasty. Try the homemade chips and salsa - delicious! The D.T. Fleming Beach is right there. It had been voted Best Beach in America in 2006. Yes, you have to walk to get there. If you want to get a cart ride, they will provide it for you. The walk was very nice. My son enjoyed the beach more than the pool. It is probably the cleanest beach I have ever seen. We had an oceanview suite so we had quite a walk from the lobby to our hotel room. The walk was good exercise and after some of our filling meals we really needed the extra steps to work off our food. And more importantly, the view was worth it. Our room also overlooked the area that they hold their wedding ceremonies at so we watched a number of weddings during the week. This is the resort to come to if you want to relax and be pampered. If you are trying to come to Maui on a low budget, you may want to check out other hotel options. Yes, this is a five star resort and yes they should provide excellent service. The people that work here are all pleasant and actually seem to like what they are doing and where they are doing it. It definitely seemed more apparent at this resort than others I have stayed at over the years. When I was first planning this trip I had hoped for a relaxing vacation. My family and I definitely had a wonderful experience while staying at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua and would like to thank the ladies and gentlemen that work there for making it possible.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cReally gorgeous\u201d", "Author": "cpapa84", "ReviewID": "UR115186471", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel back in April for the second time. It is GORGEOUS!! I mean, really gorgeous. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you get hit with this feeling of calmness, serenity and cool air.. and the watermelon infused water doesn't hurt :) I'll go with the positives and negatives: Positives: -Like I said.. totally gorgeous -You get the unique benefit of being at a secluded resort while also having other food options available nearby, because it's part of the Kapalua resort. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the Village Cafe and Sweet Shoppe, which was not in existence during our first stay. It had gorgeous views and was a perfect place to go for breakfast - delicious food, great atmosphere at a fraction of the cost of the Ritz Carlton. We also got takeout for dinner from there one night and brought it back to our lanai, which was great. The sushi place in Kapalua was also very good, and I probably had the best meal of my life (no joke) at Merriman's. All of this stuff is either in walking distance or you can hop on the Kapalua shuttle, which runs very regularly- so you don't have to worry about drinking and driving. I really liked being able to come and go from the resort like this. -Staff was great. There was an early 30s-ish (I think?) man who worked at the pool who was just the nicest person and was coming around and talking to everyone to see how he could make their stay better, etc. I remember seeing him talk to some of the other people around us and thinking that he must know them personally because everyone was clearly enjoying their conversation, but then he kept moving on to each group and came to talk to us. He gave us all of these great tips for the island and probably provided the best customer service of any hotel employee I've ever encountered, anywhere. I really wish I remembered his name because he was so fantastic and honestly would make a great manager.. if management is reading this, I believe that he is married with a young son and his wife is part Persian. Not sure if that narrows it down at all. He really should be recognized. -This kind of goes along with #2, but you are also really close to Lahaina without being at a tourist trap. We went down to Lahaina a few times and it was super easy. -The wind: you would not think this would be a positive, but it created a great breeze in the hot sun. Kapalua is a very windy area. Negatives: -The pool situation is a problem, but, they are definitely making it better. When we stayed there the first time, we were not super happy with the fact that there were no umbrellas (I have very fair skin, and will fry in the hot sun despite SPF one million). I guess because of the wind, they couldn't put traditional umbrellas up and your only option was to rent a cabana for $$$. By this visit two years later, they had installed a couple of metal hut type umbrellas (sounds weird but they were great). It was still an issue trying to secure one in the morning and we saw people fighting. However, according to the pool staff, they are putting more of them in this year. They are also FINALLY designating one of the pools as an adult's pool, which should have been done a long time ago. There was no adult's pool during either of our visits, which was such a pain! -If you come during school break, beware. I don't know exactly what the deal is, but there is some relationship between the Ritz and some (all?) of the Kapalua resort, meaning that people staying at the resort can come use the Ritz amenities like the pool. This was not such a big deal when we came in April but our first trip was in July and it was just out of control. SO many kids everywhere. -Major lack of water pressure in the showers. Not sure what the deal was with this but it was hard to wash your hair. Tips: -I don't think you need to rent a car for your entire stay, but you definitely are going to get bored if you go more than a couple days without a car. All you can really do is eat, swim, and golf if you don't have a car. Self parking is free. -FLY IN TO WEST MAUI. We did this for our second trip and wow, what a difference. Otherwise, it's a pretty long ride from the airport. I recommend Island Air. -Don't stay here if you are going to stay in the cheapest class of room. There are plenty of hotels where you can do that and still wind up with a perfectly fine view. Here, you are literally facing a wall. It is well worth the price of an upgrade. You don't necessarily need a pool or ocean view, but the view of the wall really ruins the experience. We had a pool view our second time around and it was so much better.

We literally just got back from our honeymoon last night after 6 nights. POSITIVES: Service: From the Bellhops to the valets to housekeeping, the entire staff was always welcoming, bright-eyed, and willing to serve. Accommodations: 5-star. The room was beautiful. It was an ocean view and we spent many an evening on the balcony sipping on a tasty beverage. The bathroom had a separate tub from the shower which was nice. It was exactly like something you see out of a movie. Grounds: The grounds are GORGEOUS! The ocean is a little walk to get to but really nice. There are tennis and basketball courts which was awesome and the pools and hot tubs were perfect! LOCATION: Away from the hustle and bustle of the other resort towns which we loved. Everything is within driving distance and we drove up to other areas on a daily basis. NEGATIVES: #1. Unless you are lucky enough to have a room close to the lobby there is quite a hike to get to your room. In general this won't be an issue unless you are traveling with somebody who is elderly or has trouble physically exerting themselves. #2. The beach is a little bit of a walk from the main property. There is a well lit path and they do offer a nice cart back and forth but I didn't mind the walk in the least. #3. THE FOOD IS REALLY EXPENSIVE AND SO IS THE SPA. We didn't eat at the hotel one time. We bought groceries and ate at some great places around town like, Round Table Pizza, Mai Tai Cafe, there are tons of options so before you drop a couple hundred dollars on a meal check out your options. THINGS WE DID THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU: Golfed at the Bay Course: If you are staying at the ritz you can golf this world famous course for under $200. WORTH IT! Parasailed: You can do this as a pair for $130 total. We did it through West Maui Parasailing and would recommend them. Nice because it only takes an hour of your time. Attend a Luau: We went to the Feast at Lele which was $213 total for the couple. Great experience! Fantastic 5 course meal, great entertainment, and alcohol is all included in the price! We would do this again. Road to Hana: Look it up and do it! MAKE SURE TO BUY the CD that guys you through the trip. It's only $19.99 and you can get it at a bunch of different places, just ask. I know that we looked on Travel Advisor and used alot of the comments we found to make our decision to stay here. This is a great atmosphere for both couples and families in our opinion.

There are only two free shady umbrellas that accommodate 4-5 people per pool and they leave most of the guests roasting by the pool with absolutely no shade unless they pay. It is OK to spend a little more in Hawaii. But Ritz rips you off in an outrageous way. They have only one dinner restaurant and every entree is at least 40 and up. We ended up taking most of our meals at Sansei Japanese restaurant, which is at a walking distance to Ritz. This is a very good restaurant and food is worth the price (appx 150 per a very good dinner). The next two outrageous things are; 1. the resort does not have a self operated laundry; you would be paying 10 bucks to get your panty washed. 2. We wanted to print some routs and internet access in the business center is 0.78 cents a minute and I don't know how much a print out is (this was not like five star to me). So if I really think without any clutter, all what we got is a very mediocre room for 600 dollars a day. Do not be deceived by the picture of the pool or how pompous the name Ritz Carlton sounds like. In my opinion that is all what they have. Again, that is just my view (but many of what I have mentioned above are facts). There is no direct beach access from the resort. You can walk down in the property to the beach but the sea in this area are too rough to enjoy (even there is a public warning next to the public parking lot to the beach). Remember every beach in Hawaii has to have public access by law. So you can access any good beach regardless of you stay The breakfast buffet is nice (30 bucks per person).

We were extremely tired from a very long flight. The woman at check in was busy with another customer and it took her at least 20 minutes to check them in. After that she stepped into the back room for about 10 minutes. We couldn't believe there wasn't anyone else at this enormous hotel available to help us and that this woman couldn't try to get to us sooner. When she finally did check us in, there was no porters to help us to our room. The woman gave us directions which involved many turns and there were a few different elevator banks. It took us 20 minutes to find our room. By this time, we were exhausted and frustrated. Things got better quickly: The room was extremely nice. It was a one bedroom suite overlooking the ocean. It was very dark with the black out curtains and very quiet. It was easy to fall asleep and stay asleep. The room was clean and nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The only negative was some of the lamps in the room did not work, which made it a little dark. We also had two bathrooms which was a huge plus. Service lacking: We didn't find the concierge desk to be overly helpful. We asked them about various activities and the response was not overly helpful. It is good that we were with a group and didn't have to rely on the hotel for our activities. Pools, Ocean: The hotel is very large, but was only half occupied. This was the weekend after the Tsunami and many people had cancelled. I imagine it would have been much more crowded otherwise. It was not hard to get a seat by the pool. We never sat by the ocean. It was a long walk to get to the beach. The pools are very large and nice. There is adequate shade. The attendants are helpful, but not annoying at all. It is very pleasant to sit by the pools. Food: We only ate at the restaurants for breakfast and lunch, which were all very good. There are a number of nice restaurants nearby too. Hiking trails: From the hotel there are a number of marked trails for hiking. These are very nice and worth doing. Also very worth doing is the coastal walk over to the next beach which has a bay with incredible snorkeling. This is a must do. They rent equipment at the beach and you can charge it to your room. Boat excursions highly recommended: We also took a snorkeling trip and a whale watch. These trips were through the \"Hula Girl\" company and I can highly recommend them.

It's just too bad about the windy conditions, the 'sock you for everything' mentality--$25 daily resort fee. For what? The privilege of parking your own car and carrying your own beach chair--if you can get one? Maui has gotten too built up, so we won't visit again.

The property is nice, well maintained, the grounds are perfectly manicured, and the pool area looks beautiful. The view of the ocean through the lobby when you first walk into the hotel makes you feel instantly relaxed. But the hotel is massive. It really doesn't seem it when you drive up, but our room was towards the lower end of one of the wings of the hotel (which is sort of a horse-shoe shape, with the lobby area in the middle) and we were amazed how far we had to walk when we first checked in. Our deluxe room was on the small side for the price paid and we only had a partial ocean view - the view was mainly of the pool area. But despite the fact it was quite close to the pool, the planting around the lanai made it feel secluded. I must admit I personally loved the chez longue (or day bed) in the room, and wished I could move it outside so I could spend a few hours relaxing on it, whilst reading, especially as the chairs on the lanai weren't great for that. But generally the room was comfortable, well decorated and was actually fairly quiet considering the size of the hotel. Our main problem with the property is the size; and therefore the sheer numbers of guests. There were queues to check-in, and queues to check-out, and there were several corporate events taking place at the hotel - including one that required the closing off of the majority of the pool area for most of one of the days whilst we were staying. The staff didn't seem particularly well prepared to deal with the numbers, or perhaps there just wasn't enough staff. This was particularly noticeable by the pool where the loungers which had any shade went very quickly, and so most people were left with a choice of lying in the full sun, renting a cabana or doing something other than relaxing by the pool. Noticeably the cabanas were largely empty. We also found that getting pool-side drinks service seemed to be very hit and miss. The other place where the numbers of guests caused problems was at breakfast. Our rate included breakfast, and so it seemed did a lot of other guests. There was frequently queues to be seated for breakfast, sometimes stretching back 30-40 guests, and snaking up the stairs towards the lobby area. This meant a wait most mornings, and some mornings we simply gave up waiting. The number of guests also made personal service very difficult for the staff. Even the staff who we did regularly have interactions with would not be able to remember us one day to the next. Our expectations of a luxury resort are not just for top class amenities or a comfortable room, but also for the service to match, and this is where the Ritz-Carlton fell down badly for us. The one major exception to this was at the Banyan Tree - the on-site restaurant where we ate dinner on one evening. That was excellent, and should be used as an example by the hotel management as to how to do it right. If you are considering this property as a honeymoon destination then we would issue a note of caution. The hotel seems more suited to families, than it does to couples. Perhaps use the facilities such as the spa, and eat at the Banyan Tree; but for romantic couples time stay somewhere else.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenwood Village, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe only Ritz in Hawaii\u201d", "Author": "mciordan", "ReviewID": "UR110017198", "Content": "We stayed in a 1BR suite, which was very spacious, with 2 large balconies, a refrigerator, toaster, plates and a microwave oven.

We spent a day at the spa, and had a couples massage.... it was amazing! came out feeling so relaxed! Restaurants on the resort- we ate at most of them (apart from The Terrace) our favourite being The Banyan tree, this is there signature restaurant and also the most expensive! but I think worth the money... we saved that experience for the last night of our stay, and had the best steak I think i've ever had (The Snake River Kobe Beef). The Pool cafe and beach house are great places to go for lunch, my favourite being the beach house because of the view! I would NOT recommend the Kai sushi restaurant, over priced and the food was not good at all. I found the sushi was nothing special and the tempura to be very very greasy! If you have a craving for sushi I'd recommend the Sansei Restaurant which is about 5 mins walk from the hotel, some of the best sushi i've ever had! Another restaurant near the hotel it Merrimans, this is also a great experience, a bit on the pricey side but worth it! There is a store right next to the hotel called the Honolulu store, this was really handy, we stocked up our room fridge with plenty of snacks and drinks! and they have a deli counter so you can get breakfast or lunch there, at a lower price than the hotel.

It was a bit of a remote location, but that was exactly what we wanted (about 15 minutes north of the much more crowded and active Ka'anapali Resort area). The rooms were excellent with beautiful decorations and a super comfortable bed, with great bath amenities (first hotel I've ever been to that even provided little bags of Woolite so you could wash your swimsuits :) ). The hotel is set up on a hill a bit from the beach, but that was perfectly fine with us because it made for even better views of the water from the rooms. The walk down to the beach is about 5 minutes, and it is a very nice walk on the way down in the morning. It was a bit hot and a little steep in some areas on the way back up in the afternoons, but they do offer a golf cart shuttle if you're willing to wait for it. We usually walked it because the shuttle was inexplicably absent a majority of the time. It is nice and breezy (if not all out windy) most days because of the trade winds that hit this side of the island, so even though it hit the low 90's often, it never really felt too incredibly hot. The beach itself was a very nice, secluded beach area. It is a public beach, but most of the people on the beach were from the Ritz. They do offer lounge chairs and towels (no umbrellas) that you can take down to the beach at the Ritz property beach entrance (or the staff will carry them down for you if they're there, which they usually are not). You cannot, however, have the chairs on the beach when the \"High Surf Advisory\" flags were out. We were there 6 days, and the flags were up for 4 of the 6 days. The waves were very strong those days, but that made the beach a lot more fun for us. I would recommend stopping by one of the surf shops on the way to the hotel and renting some boogie boards if you plan to go in the water. The waves could be extremely dangerous and suck you under in a flash if you don't have something to hold on to. This is definitely not a good wading beach for small children. As far as drinks go, the beach is public, so you can bring your own instead of paying $12 for a mixed drink or $7 for a beer at the pool. We stopped by a Super Kmart right by the airport and picked up a $15 soft tote-bag style cooler bag, beer, rum, diet coke, snacks, and water for the week (yes, they actually do sell liquor at Kmart, which was news to us). The bag also came in handy for the Road to Hana. We just donated it and the rest of the beer to another couple by the pool on our last day. We also often walked up the street from the hotel to the Honolua General Store for meals since it was much cheaper if you just wanted a quick bite. They have a coffee shop small deli restaurant near the back of the store that offers breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, and pizza. They have a coffee shop, a small grocery area, and small deli restaurant near the back of the store that offers breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, and pizza. The staff at the general store was extremely friendly (with the exception of the lady at the coffee shop who was downright surly for some reason). We also ate at the great Sansei Sushi restaurant by the General Store for dinner one night (definitely get reservations in advance for this one as the wait can get very long). The only hotel restaurant we ate at was the Beach House restaurant that is right above the beach. It was pricey, $50+ for 2 for lunch without drinks, but the setting was worth it. It is completely open air, covered by palm trees, and has an awesome view. Overall, our stay was incredible. The only things I think they could do better would be to offer better coffee and coffee-makers in the room, and please, please please put some kind of weather stripping or something under the room doors to prevent so much noise from getting into the rooms (the patio doors were thick and did a good job of keeping out noise from that direction). We ended up stuffing a towel under the door, which helped somewhat. The coffee makers were truly awful. It's been a long time since we stayed in a less-than-premium hotel, so I don't know what's the norm for other hotels, but these were the worst by far. The one-cup coffee bags make an extremely weak cup of coffee if you fill the coffee maker with enough water for 1 cup of coffee (it also spews steam and water everywhere). I finally started running the maker once with one bag and half filled with water, and then repeating the process for the second half of the cup with the other bag. It seemed to spew less mess everywhere too when there was less water in it. It's a good thing my husband doesn't drink coffee! The rooms were very loud...thin walls, huge gap under the door to the hallway. We also specifically requested a quiet room, and were given a room right above the playground and kiddie pool, and a hammock that parents very rudely allowed their children to use as a playground at 8 am. We just kept the same room and dealt with it because the view of the ocean from that location was great. I figured there wouldn't be that many kids making a lot of noise, but I was wrong. There were A LOT of small kids for some reason, which I really didn't expect at such an expensive hotel. I love kids and really wouldn't have minded them so much if their parents hadn't allowed them to run shrieking through the halls and on the playground before most people had even woken up. That was very inconsiderate of the parents, but that is hardly the hotel's fault!", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Taste of Paradise\u201d", "Author": "sumort", "ReviewID": "UR106124276", "Content": "OMG We have just returned from paradise! This hotel is really very beautiful, its huge but not impersonal. We loved the room, although we had only booked a terrace room, it didnt matter as the room was huge, and very well proportioned, loved the extras, like having a bath and a walk in shower in the room. The floor was of dark wood and this was very beautiful against the crisp white sheets...which were changed every day!.. I loved the day bed, and relaxed on there frequently. The balcony was large and overlooked the golf course. However there are no lights on any of the balconys so it is impossible to sit out there in the evening, which is a shame This was a very relaxing holiday, food and drinks were expensive...but we expected that, from a 5 star hotel. We had a lovely meal at the Sweete Shop up the hill, and the village store was good for drinks and a hearty lunch. We didnt have a car, so found the trek to get anywhere a little long winded, a trip to Lahaina took over 90 minutes each way, but that didnt really matter as it was nice to go somewhere different, as the resort is so large its difficult to get off it if you want to. The resort fee covered a hi speed internet connection and the resort bus, I was glad I took my laptop or I think I might have been a bit miffed to pay for things I didnt use, and as for it covering the self parking...where else were you going to park?? The only real problem I had with the hotel is that the poolside loungers (very clean, well attended, nice towels and sun lotion, water always available) there are 2 yes thats right 2 umbrellas! The first day I sat out in the sun early in the morning and got burned after an hour, and I was wearing factor 20...much higher than I usually wear. Because there was no shade around the pools we had to go back inside. Its a good job the room was so beautiful we didnt mind spending a lot of time in it. You could BUY a cabana if you wanted to, but after spending so much on the holiday itself, we couldnt afford to do this, neither could many people. In these days of skin cancer and sun protection I would have thought that they would be more proactive about this. All the staff were helpful, friendly and attentive, always taking the time to say aloha to us, and the concierge couldnt have been more helpful and chatty. All in all this was a fantastic week away, as part of a longer holiday in other parts of Hawaii and San Fransisco.

They even helped me dress since we didn't have anyone with us and gave us great gifts and treats - We were truly touched. And Lava Point is the best place to get married if you have a small party. The backdrop of the sunset and the ocean... breathtaking We got to stay in a gorgeous club level room with a good view of the ocean. Spacious, very comfy. Housekeeping was immaculate! The In-room dining staff are also amazing. They took care of all our little requests including fresh coconut delivered to the room every day. They also organized our private dinner on the beach - complete with decorations and music and the most amazing butler service. It was the perfect way to end our wedding day (and i think these folk also decorated our room while we were at dinner with flowers! What a nice touch!) The beach was awesome as well and I have to say anyone that says this is a gruelling walk could probably do with a bit more exercise. It was 5 minutes at the most and a lovely stroll. We also rented out the pool luxury cabanas for 2 days. GREAT service from the attendants (also catered to all our special requests like a special order of ahi poke!). These people know how to make you feel special and they seem to really enjoy their jobs too. We also ate at ALL the restaurants and loved every single one of them. The Terrace Breakfast Buffet is to die for and the Banyan Tree Kona Lobster and Kobe steak are the best we've ever had. And Oh My God - the SPA is to die for everyone! Have Kyra do your nails and Eva do your hair and makeup. This is the best spa I've ever been to.

We had a group rate as part of my conference so we were lucky to not have to pay the listed prices which are steep to say the least. A couple of things to point out that I had read and found misleading in travel books or other reviews - much is said about the beach not being right in back of the hotel - that due to burial grounds, the resort had to build up higher and there is a shuttle you need to take to the beach - that is inaccurate in our opinion - honestly, we laughed when we got there - there is a charming pathway down to the beach from the pool area with stunning views that only takes a few minutes by foot. For those who don't wish to walk it, they offer a golf cart-like shuttle to bring you down and back up again. The beach is gorgeous and easily accessible. One other stand-out for us - we started our vacation earlier in the week at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel about 10 - 15 minutes away. We had taken a cab to the Ritz (cabs are extremely expensive) - when we arrived, I realized I forgot some clothing in one of the drawers. When I asked the Ritz the easiest way to get down there, they told me they could go down and pick up the items from the hotel and have them delivered to my room at no charge! This type of attention to detail and service is what one would hope for from this type of high-end resort and they certainly did not disappoint. And the hotel has a cultural specialist named Clifford who was awesome! He spoke at our meeting about the Hawaiian culture etc. and his words were truly inspiring - the hotel has him on their channel on the tv as well so you can hear more about where you are and the history of the Hawaiian people. In addition, from the housekeeping staff to the receptionist to the bartenders, we found the people working there very warm and positive - they went out of their way to make you feel special. One day it started to pour outside by the pool and lots of guests ran for cover under some of the covered areas - the hotel staff came around offering drinks, towels etc. the entire time. Just top notch. The only critique (if we can call it a critique - really more a personal choice) of the hotel is its location - to some, they love the remote feel - it's at the northwest corner of Maui in Kapalua with truly spectacular views etc. - for those who want to stay at the resort the whole time, it's lovely. But if you want to be closer to other options for dinner and nightlife, restaurant choices you could walk to etc., you may want to consider a different location. Or, definitely rent a car to help you get around. If you have a car, it's no problem at all. But without one, you are pretty much stuck with very expensive food at the Ritz (e.g., $20 hamburgers - insane delivery charges for room service on top of that), very expensive cabs ($25-$30 cab to Ka'anapali Beach area - $30-$35 to Lahaina) etc. There are a few nearby choices that the Ritz will shuttle you to for no charge (Plantation House being one of them - FANTASTIC views and meal). And right next to the resort entrance is a charming little general store with all sorts of items to buy to keep in your room (fruits, snacks, cheeses, wines, breakfast, lunch) - we didn't find it til the last day - wish we had known. Definitely take advantage of it to save a bit of money. One other thing we were disappointed in is that the pool/beach is gorgeous and we wanted to have drinks one night in the hot tub while watching the sun go down - but because of your location, you can't see it from the entire pool area. It's on the other side of the resort. Just an odd thing - coming from Ka'anapali Beach/Lahaina where the sunsets were all easily viewed from all of those resorts - just bummed we couldn't watch from where we were. Again, not a real negative - just disappointing.

We started our vacation on Kauai at a very small boutique hotel, so I have to admit that at first I was a bit overwhelmed by the large size of this hotel and by how many people were there. My husband on the other hand was drooling over the gorgeous and luxurious property from the first instant, but it really only took me a matter of hours to feel the same way. We booked online using AmEx points for part of our stay and had nabbed a deal on one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential suites,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but I would advise going for a regular room or suite as opposed to residential\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho needs a kitchen when you are staying at the Ritz?? One other recommendation I would make when booking is to note the fine print on the website that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms are partial ocean view, and very partial at that, meaning that many rooms (depending on which side of the hotel you are on) only have a view of the ocean if you poke your head off your lanai and crane to the right or left. Make note of this and request a room on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sunset view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd side of the hotel, or at least in the inner horseshoe rather than the mountain/hilltop view. I say all this because I did not notice this disclaimer, so when we arrived and checked into our ocean view residential suite, I was initially disappointed by the darkness of the room and when I looked out our windows to a hilltop covered in mostly dead grass. While the room was stunning and immaculate, I just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get over the contrast from the spectacular ocean view/sunset view room we had just come from at a hotel on Kauai! After a few minutes of observing my trying not to pout, my husband marched us back down to the front desk to inquire about other available rooms, where a very friendly employee described a couple other options to us and gave us a key to go check out another (non-residential) suite, which incidentally was GORGEOUS! Ten times more light, absolutely massive, and completely stunning. We were in love with it and so happy that they had been so accommodating to switch us over at the same rate. From this moment on, our stay was fantastic! We sampled pretty much all of the resort dining, and loved it all! We had amazing sushi at Kai our first night, and even though it seems everyone there is on their honeymoon, our waitress made a big deal about us being on our honeymoon and brought us free desserts after our incredible sushi binge. We also had a pretty good lunch at the Beach House Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (that spot was more about the view than the food), and even the food we ordered poolside for lunch a couple times was really tasty. We are very thankful that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discover the Terrace breakfast buffet until our last day, simply because it was so amazingly delicious that we probably would have left 10 pounds heavier had we discovered it earlier. The General Store on the hotel property was extremely convenient, and we ended up eating affordable breakfast sandwiches there a few mornings, and also stocked up the fridge in our room with alcohol, sodas, and snacks. But all of the dining experiences paled in comparison to the Banyan Tree. We went for a splurge dinner and not only was the setting spectacular, but our waiter gave us the best service of any server we encountered our entire time in Hawaii. We decided to spring for a 4-course wine pairing menu and every bite was perfection. A truly great highlight of the trip! In addition to all of the on-site dining, there were other fabulous restaurants nearby, including Merriman's on the Kapalua property (ongoing shuttle from the hotel) which you definitely need to try, and make a sunset reservation! The staff was incredibly friendly and professional, true to the RC reputation, and the concierge we worked with was very helpful. We booked a snorkel day cruise and a luau based on her recommendations and loved them both.

Thanks, for the Kama'aina love. Kai was the stage of our first dinner. It's a quaint little restaurant on property; not noisy and crowded like the \"chain\" sushi places. It was just the right atmosphere to get our weekend off right. A little live jazz circulated in the background as we enjoyed our meal. On Saturday, we participated in the one hour (complimentary) walk around the property, with Monica. It was a great way to get the juices going and work up an appetite. Also, you see a lot of nice views from around the Bay (bring a camera). Afterward, we decided to order some room service for breakfast, as it was only 9:00 am. You want excellent room service? Ask for Daniel. This gentleman knows what 6-Star Customer Services means. Thank you, my friend, for the delicious treats throughout our stay! Next, we indulged in a wonderful 80 minute couples massage at the Spa (why does the time always seem to fly by?). Amy, thanks for the deep Lomi Lomi. I needed that. Hope you've recovered. Dinner on property, at the Banyan Tree, was very romantic. We had a picture window all to ourselves and saw a faint glimpse of pink (sunset) within the ominous clouds; encouraging positive thoughts for our last day.

The next morning at 6:30 am, Daniel knocked at our door. Low-and-behold, he had my corned beef hash for me! He made it happen because he wanted to take care of us on our special weekend!

Our party of four had rented the two bedroom residential suite. The grounds and rooms were nicely done. I'd rate these areas 4.5 stars. What we were a little surprised with was the lack of amenities. In our room we had no books or manuals describing the services offered- we were expecting night life info, maybe daily or weekend offerings, snorkeling info, tennis, golf or any special dinner options. Nothing. We were surprised they didn't have a luau, fire dancers .... They had a stage by the beach but it was never used. I'd rate amenities a 1.5 Staff overall seemed nice. We had a nice waitress Nohelani she was very nice. I'd give her a 5 rating. However I personally had a poor review on pool staff. It costs to have a lounge chair under an umbrella or very basic cabana? At $900 a night? It also took 15+ minutes to get a beverage. Seems they could be quicker with my cocktail. And let us under an umbrella because maybe 1 out of the 10 cabanas were rented. At the pool I also had a pool server come up to me and ask me to put my bottle of Corona in a plastic cup. No problem. He then stated only cocktails purchased at poolside can be brought to the pool. He finally states\" do I make myself clear?\". I nodded. In retrospect I should of seen the general manager, and made myself clear that my party spent over $1500 on beverages during our visit and I want to make them clear on this point. I'd rate that a 1.

If you're accustomed to luxury hotels and resorts that pay careful attention to detail and provide outstanding service, I strongly suggest that you consider the Fairmont or perhaps the Four Seasons. The bottom line is that there is nothing particularly exceptional about the level of service, quality of accommodations, or the range of amenities offered at the Ritz Carlton. To be fair, the hotel is relatively pleasant and the staff is helpful, but not any more so than what you would expect from a Westin, Sheraton, or Hyatt (which don't have the reputation of Ritz Carlton, and are usually a lot less expensive). Overall, I was disappointed with the upkeep of the hotel. The 2008 remodel touted on the hotel's website was selective at best. Beyond the main entrance to the hotel (which is modern and comfortable, and provides a favorable impression), one will quickly notice years of wear and tear (shabby, worn out carpet, and doors and trim in serious need of repainting). The rooms have definitely been remodeled, but I thought the furnishings were on the cheap side. For example, the laminate floors (!) in our room were already severely scratched, and a couple of the planks were lifting from the subfloor. The cleanliness of our room also left something to be desired: lots of scary looking mold in the shower, and inconsistent vacuuming and dusting by the cleaning staff. I was also a bit surprised that I had to leave a note for the cleaning staff asking for replacement soap and shampoo. If someone had bothered to clean the shower during my 7-night stay, I suspect that it would have been obvious that our supply needed to be replenished. For a three or perhaps even a four-star hotel, these sorts of things might have been easily overlooked.

No one cared to get towels for you at the pool; garbage, food and dirty towels from the previous day at the pool were still lying on tables and chairs the following morning; the beach requires a golf cart to get to, and chairs are only on a grassy knoll overlooking the beach. It's not really an ocean to swim in just admire from a distance, I guess. The food and wait staff were awful. The breakfast would have been ok if we were at a low level Disney World resort, but alas, we were not. And it took 3 waitresses at the bar about 20 minutes to figure out we needed water and menus.

Scallops and dungeress crab appetizers and grilled Ahi with foie gras on top were to die for! Service was impeccable. Now, to be perfectly honest, since I personally do not like to swim in the pools in general (I prefer ocean), I was surprised that the Ritz Kapalua did not offer a swimable beach on premises. There is a beach for surfers with a part of it supposedly open for swimmers, but the currents are too strong and seemed to be rather dangerous to swim there. However, were were offered a free shuttle to a nearby (5 minutes drive) Kapalua resort that had four wonderful beaches where we spent most of the day swimming, snorkeling and sunbathing.

Treatments are expensive and there is a $20 day charge for the spa if you do not get a treatment but it is well worth it. The spa is spacious with gender specific spa essentials (hot tub, sauna, relaxation room, teas, etc.) and includes a uni-sex jacuzzi in the common relaxation area. The lounge/bar area is clean/modern and staffed with friendly/eager hospitality employees. The restaurants are outstanding if you are willing to pay for it. We had a 2 bedroom residential suite which comes with three balconies, kitchen, furnished family room, and 2 well appointed rooms. Spacious, clean, modern! The AREA KAPALUA: This property is isolated and quiet which is perfect. Ka'anapali and weilea are crowded and busy where Kapalua is quiet and comfortable. It sits just 10 minutes from Lahaina so you are not far from the action. There is a scenic 3.5 mile round trip coastal trail that heads south from the RC property and is excellent for walking/running. The weather was amazing. It was warm, barely a breeze, and NEVER a rain drop throughout our stay. There is a general store a few steps up from the front entrance that has tasty local favorites for lunch and breakfast along with a coffee house and groceries. A few steps up from the general store is the areas best ethnic restaurant - Sansai. From 5:30-6:00 every night (reservations recommended) they serve up all food items for 25% off. After 10:00pm there is half off bar menu. If you are a sushi fan, do NOT miss this. All in all an excellent stay and we WILL be back. Isolated, quiet, 5 star hospitality in a 5 star setting. You most likely will see celebrities as we had quite a few while we were there yet the hotel does an excellent job treating everyone as equals. For the price point and overall value, this is the BEST PROPERTY ON MAUI!!!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay with adult children\u201d", "Author": "f00lme0nce", "ReviewID": "UR90118629", "Content": "We stayed in a two bedroom suite for four nights arriving Thanksgiving day.

Service was spotty - the few bright stars were outshined by issues such as taking over 45 minutes to get a burger at pool side restaurant, waiting over 1.5 hrs to receive entree at in house restaurant (to which I was told they would have to check with the manager when I informed them that I would not pay for the meal - he never came by the table and we left), receiving very warm $150 bottle of wine at hotel bar (come on, if your serving premium wine, don't serve it at warmer than room temperature and then offer to chill it once you recognize that it is too warm...), taking over 20 minutes to get a pool side beer... All in all, I felt as if the staff really didn't care about the guest experience, and service was on their time, not ours - not what I would expect from this tier of property (and they were only at 60% occupancy, so it wasn't as if there were extreme demands on the staff...) The property is beautiful and relaxing with nice amenities - food decent (nothing to write home about) - we didn't mind the wind - towels are provided for the beach, but you cannot bring the chairs onto the beach. If you're someone that demands service, I would probably look elsewhere. If you're someone that wants quiet and doesn't mind chasing down your food/drink after waiting a bit, then this will probably work for you. For the cost, I would temper my recommendations to my friends. This is my first stay on Maui, so I can't say if you would receive better elsewhere.

When we arrived we were greeted with beaded leis. Our travel agent informed them that it was our 35th wedding anniversary. Despite arriving before check in time, we were promptly escorted to our room, which overlooked the golf course. To me this hotel is \"a golf country club\". We had to call an hour later for our luggage to be brought to our room. Guest services then gave us a complimentary chilled bottle of champagne in honor of our anniversary. The empty overturned bottle in the ice bucket stayed in our room for 4 days. The room ice bucket which I thought was a fixture in the room was always taken by maid service and never replaced, so in order to get ice we had to call housekeeping on a few occasions to bring an ice bucket. The grounds of the hotel are impeccably maintained. The pool area is lovely, however the cushions on the chairs are stained and gross. A few chairs are broken too. The private beach is within walking distance from the hotel although it isn't that close. An employee in a golf cart asked us if we needed a ride to the hotel from the beach. We declined. There aren't any beach chairs to sit on at the beach. The only ones I saw were lined up on the grass overlooking the beach. If I wanted to sit on the grass, I would sit in my backyard! I never asked if I could bring the chair to the beach, as my husband and I decided to venture to other beaches. I must say that the restaurants in and around the hotel are all decent and there is a shuttle that takes you to a few outside the hotel area, that are maybe 5 minutes away. Cabs outside of the area to other hotels 15 minutes away are $20-$25 one way. There are no large hotels around the Ritz that you can have dinner or experience any type of nightlife. The hotel is secluded. The staff at the hotel: front desk, concierage and valet attendants are friendly and helpful. The hotel is quiet. There is no nightlife at all, aside from a guitar/singer a few nights in the bar area.In fact at 945 one night my husband and I were the only 2 at the bar. The bartender informed us that \"it's always this way here.\" It is quite windy at the Ritz, I guess because it is higher in the mountains. If you are looking for a quiet place to stay and just relax, \"away from it all\" the Ritz is the place for you.

Then the club lounge, wow, that was fantastic, a lady named Athena greeted us and we felt like royalty. She went above and beyond. the club was great, free breakfast, free drinks, tons of goodies for lunch, appetizers before dinner, it was practically an all inclusive.

The day we arrived on Maui, the highway to the west end of the island was closed off due to a forest fire, so the R-C put us up for a complimentary night at the Grand Wailea - it can pay to book with a 5 star hotel! Some main features about the Ritz: Location - it is located at a relatively remote part of the island, in the northwest section. Pretty much the only way to get anywhere is by going directly south, then east toward central Maui. The highway to the north is pretty rough, and only for the (very) adventurous. It's also on the windiest part of the island. However, there are no other hotels nearby, so it's relatively secluded, if you like that sort of thing (which we do). Grounds - elegant and beautifully maintained, and not so over the top or touristy as the Grand Wailea. The property also has a lot of acreage - there are several tennis courts, a nature center, a huge pool, small trails, several restaurants and eating areas. One of the executive chefs has started a very ambitious garden on the grounds with the goal of growing enough to supply the restaurants without needing to rely on food flown in from the mainland. He happened to be there while we were poking around and gave us a quick tour of the place himself. Rooms - we had the partial sea view with king bed. The room and bathroom were fairly spacious, and we had our own lanai (balcony) that overlooked the pool, but you could also see the ocean and mountains very clearly. The view was gorgeous, especially when breakfasting on room service on the balcony! (Which had great selection and was absolutely delicious by the way). Beach scene - the closest beach is the DT Fleming. This is a pebbly/coarse sand beach with vigorous crashing waves, due to the wind. Still swim-able, but not without some signs indicating what swimmers might be at risk for. Not the greatest for peaceful sunbathing - save that for the pool. Restaurants - We really wanted to try Banyan Tree, but all the R-C's restaurants are open only on certain days of the week. We didn't realize this and never got a chance to eat there. But we did try Kai Sushi, which was pretty good, classic sushi. Service - excellent, couldn't ask for better service. Keep in mind though, we are pretty independent folks and like to strike out on our own, so we don't depend on concierge service at all. Overall, we would probably come back to the Ritz. My spouse definitely would, but I would consider staying on Southern Maui just for a different experience (calmer, sunnier beaches).

As well as Marimans (think thats how you spell it) My favourite food was a place called Pinapple Grill...actually one of the cheapest of the resturants but i found the food amazing! the spring rolls were exceptional!! One other place worth trying is Roys which is a 10 min drive from the hotel. Great food, great service and well worth a visit. We didnt hire a car whilst we was staying here and looking back i think we would if we ever returned. We only done 2 day trips whilst we stayed here and both we travelled by taxi which was $30 each way. The Hula Girl boat trip is one we would reccomend to everybody, the boat is STUNNING, staff go out of their way for us and we really didnt want the day to end....great trip!! The staff at the Ritz went out of the way to help us and make our honeymoon perfect.....if we could go back we would in a flash! I would reccomend this hotel to couples, honeymooners, or anyone who wants a pure relaxation holiday full of amazing memories", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middletown, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201c5 star hell\u201d", "Author": "metalmaiden", "ReviewID": "UR82369822", "Content": "After seeing the Hawaii golf tournament at the Plantation and having a wonderful experience at the Ritz Carlton in Boston MA we decide to spurge on a couple days stay at this 5 star Maui hotel. We even went with their club level service. Our arrival was nice with a lei greeting, a cool towel and valet parking. It stopped there. At the desk we were told we had to play a resort fee---which included free self parking and use of the pool. The valet parking we had just gotten was another charge. If we wanted to use the gym and spa amenities that would be another charge. If we wanted to take any classes (yoga, etc.) that would be another charge. And the list went on....Our room at the club level was nice with a view of the golf course but the air system was musty and mildewy and cause an allergic reaction from my husband. The toiletries had a very unpleasant smell. The club lounge was lovely! The food there was out of this world! We spoke with the chef. It seems that they have hired a chef just for the club level food. I can't say enough about how wonderful the food was! With appetizers and a cocktail in our bellies we went to down to the pool area. It was 5:30ish and there were no attendants around. There was not a towel to be found except wet, used ones strewn an chairs all over the pool area. We hopped in the whirlpool which felt very nice but looked like it could use a bit of cleaning. We had scrumptious desserts and nightcaps in the club lounge and retired where something in our room bite me and on rising the next morning I had numerous welts on my body. That morning when we returned to the pool area at 9am the same used towels were still on chairs all around the pool. We also noticed in the light that the chairs were absolutely filthy! Dirt spots and oil spots. There was only one single stand open to get towels. There were no chair covers just an extra towel (too small) to use on the chair. No suntan lotion. No water. No poolside attendants. There was no life here. All the other vacationers seemed to be gloomy and sad. No friendly hellos or smiles here. We decided to check out a day early and I must say the front desk was very accommodating to our request.

Our only complaints related to the number of service staff, the fact that poolside service didn't start until 11:00 AM, and that the location of the hotel is pretty remote.

Went with husband and our two boys 9 and 7. It is a beautiful hotel with beautifully appointed rooms. Staff seemed very friendly and we appreciated the sm. fridge in the room. Some great perks: If you are a runner/walker - great private grounds, gorgeous views and paths to stretch your legs! Also, the hotel shuttle can take you quickly to one of the best bays on the island to snorkel - Kapalua Bay. Walk in the water about 10 feet, float in about 3 -4 feet of water and you see beautiful fish. Safe and enjoyable. Can rent some sand chairs there too. Where to eat for daily survival: Everyone walked over the the golf store/restaurant (Kapalua Store?), just a minute walk ...you'll see it on the way into the Ritz...sits on the right and has red siding with a big deck...situated next to the cute chapel. This store/cafe is your lifeline! Prices are normal!!!! Food is great for bkfst/lunch...coffee, latte's..! DO NOT DRINK RITZ COFFEE...5.00 a cup and it really sucks. Trust me. Nice dinner out: Then you must have dinner at Marimums (this is how you pronounce it, but I can't remember the correct spelling). It is situated on Kapalua bay and you will have the dinner of a lifetime. We took our children and the kids menu was amazingly affordable!!! The rest of the menu, was higher but worth it! Downside if you have kids above 2 years old. The pools were a bore. 4 feet deep and...well....not much else to say. We would be out and about snorkeling, boogie boarding all day and I was looking forward to a cocktail and my book by the pool. The wind (every single day, every single hour of the day) was blowing so hard, I had to struggle to keep the book open. My boys, after about an hour, were a bit bored of the 4 feet pool. Pool side service was always humerous. We could see lots of people working the grounds, but never anyone around to provide anything. Towels? Better wait until 10:00 AM and bring your own after 4:30 PM - EVERYTHING remotely linked to the outside pool area (food, drinks, towels) are over at that time. It's wierd. So, as much as I'd hate to say it, we will stay somewhere more family oriented despite the rumor that the Ritz is family friendly now. It's really not. Honeymooners - enjoy!

Before booking a trip with this hotel, I was debating between Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons and Grand Wailea. I chose Ritz because of its overall value and my familiarity with the Ritz Carlton tradition of elegance and opulence. I was never wrong in choosing this hotel. I booked an ocean view Residential Suite and it was fantastic! I strongly recommend this hotel OVER Four Seasons and Grand Wailea, especially if you are a couple with no kids travelling. I visited Four Seasons and Grand Wailea but was never impressed! The pool in Ritz Carlton is way better than Four Seasons and even the beach in Ritz is great. Ritz Carlton is close to other beaches, among others is the Kapalua beach which is a great snorkeling site. Forget booking a trip to molokini or lanai, try this beach instead and you will save money and motion sickness (it was a bit wavy when we went there). The hotel offers free shuttle to Kapalua beach which is great for snorkeling. You could rent snorkel gear right there and charge it to your room account at Ritz (bring your room key). The Ritz Carlton is also next to a Catholic church with a shortcut right from the hotel free parking area, making it appear that the church belongs to the resort. In front of the resort is a store offering breakfast and lunch and this is very cheap place with great food, if you don't want to pay the $30/person buffet breakfast at the hotel. Other reviews mentioned the hotel location being windy; well, it was a breeze, not too windy which was actually good because it refreshes you; not sticky or humid. I visited the four seasons beach and it was more wavy for my taste than the beach in front of Ritz Carlton! It also didn't rain much when I was there. Kapalua area, where the hotel is, is secluded and ideal for honeymooners, lovers and those who want privacy. I saw some couple with kids, but not much. Overall, I love Ritz Carlton!

This means it is a bad idea to stay here if you are coming from Kauai and loved the peacefulness (and romance) of this island. It is not peaceful at the Ritz unless you go to the spa.

This resort is hands down amazing! I've stayed at a couple of other Ritz Carlton properties and I was very impressed but this property takes it to a whole other level. Let's get the obvious out of the way- yes, it's expensive but Maui is expensive in general. Location: Kapalua- yes, it's a little further out on the W-NW side of the island but it's by no means in the middle of nowhere. Distance-wise it's not at all far but when you factor in the traffic and road construction it may seem like a bit of a haul- it really isn't. If you have to sit in any traffic, this is the traffic you want to sit in! There are several dining options on the property and in the Kapalua vicinity. Two phenomenal golf courses, spa, various little shopping boutiques, etc... the sort of stuff one would expect at a resort. Because of it's location, you get some weird weather anomalies like brief rain showers, some cloudiness- but don't despair it clears up in a few minutes. It's also a little windier. None of it bothered me or seemingly anyone else I came across while there. The Property: This place is spectacular from the moment you walk into the semi-open air lobby. It's wide open to the back terrace which overlooks their pools and beautifully landscaped grounds which seem to flow into the ocean. It is literally a window to heaven. The service is impeccable and the lobby staff is very approachable and service oriented. We were fortunate enough to get an upgraded suite although we had to wait 20-30 minutes for the room to be ready. While we were waiting, we wandered onto the terrace to get a closer look of the aforementioned views, got a couple of drinks and an appetizer. The drinks and food were good and honestly, I could have been drinking water and eating SPAM and I would have been happy. Sitting out on that terrace is an experience in and of itself. Once we got to the room I was floored- I knew it was an upgraded suite but I didn't expect to be staying in suite that had to be almost 1000 sq ft with two balconies... after booking a regular room. It was very nice appointed with nice furnishings and even had a mini Sub-Zero fridge/freezer! I've stayed at some very nice properties but have never come across a SubZero in the freakin' room. Everything else in the room was in-line with the high standards that one would expect from a Ritz property. The room was clean and everything smelled fresh. No musty, \"hotel\" smell or nauseating flowery air fresheners here folks. I am very particular with the cleanliness of my hotel rooms and I had no qualms with the room. The staff there is extremely friendly, accommodating, and very open to offering suggestions as well as guidance to the property as well as the island itself. The bell hop gave us some awesome local dining suggestions and the concierge service will get you anything you want and get you to wherever you want to go. Equally as important- they are adequately staffed- no waiting for anything. Instant gratification is GOOD. Surprisingly, this property is very kid friendly. Normally, properties of this caliber are very stuffy and treat kids like a virus. Not here. They have a keiki check-in before you get to the actual check in desk! They have a full on kids activity program and facilities for the kids. We did not have a kid with us but would not hesitate to bring one. Okay- if you have to find fault with the supermodel, here it is- it's a little pricey even relative to Maui standards. The aforementioned drinks and appetizer (2 fruity cocktails and an order of pot stickers) albeit VERY tasty was like $55 w/ a nice tip. And yes... the breakfast buffet is $30 and as much as I love breakfast and theirs in particular- $30 gets you a lot of eggs and fruit! I also requested items that were not on the buffet but was not charged for them. As others have mentioned, there are some additional costs in addition to the room such as a $20 daily resort fee (towel service, sun block by the pool, WiFi, shuttle service to nearby beaches, etc...) , $18 nightly valet (free self parking is avail). If you wanted to do this place on a budget you could but why?!? All in all- I would do it again in a heartbeat and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. Factoring everything in, it's definitely the best hotel/resort accommodations I have encountered. The fact that it's in Maui only further adds to this property's appeal.

They were all great. *Beach was nice and clean. *Shuttle to other beaches and locations on the property. *Gym was great, lots of equipment and amenities. *\"Dive In\" movie was fun and a unique experience.

This was our second trip to Maui; the first was 6 years ago and we stayed at the Fairmont in Wailea. The Ritz and all of Kapalua were beautiful. The lobby welcomes you with wonderful Hawaiian decor and a magnificent Pacific view. We had a one room suite which was perfect - our kids (13 and 11) slept in the hideaway; we had a luxurious king bed. The rooms were new and well appointed. The beach is lovely (I don't get people who complain about the size - this is Hawaii, not Hilton Head). It is a hike, though! The pools are also very nice, but the wind was strong every day. The grounds are pure Maui - green and gorgeous. We have stayed in several five star hotels, including the Ritz in Cozumel, and we didn't feel like this one came close to matching others in service. At check-in, we asked for the hideaway to be made up for the kids and came back from dinner to find our bed turned down, but not even sheets for the hideaway. We had four or five instances where we asked for something and it never came or we had to call again (nearly every time we made a request). Whereas other Ritz Carltons have luxurous terry sheets that the pool staff make up for you on lounge chairs, cool cloths for a hot day and pitchers of ice water, these amenities don't exist at the Ritz Maui. We found the personnel polite and kind, but just not what we expect for the kind of money one spends at a Ritz Carlton. While we haven't stayed at the Fairmont since 2004, there was simply no comparison - the service there was truly 5 stars. On a side note, we had a dinner at the Pineapple Grill in the Kapalua resort and the service was absolutely atrocious. They made several errors during our dinner and not once apologized or acknowledged the problem. Our entrees took over an hour to arrive. The food was good, but our blood was boiling by the time it came, so the whole meal was ruined.

He has been working long hours and a restful week at a Ritz beach resort seemed like the perfect vacation. Most summmers we spend our vacation out of the country and do lots of sightseeing. The location is beautiful. The golf course, pool and beach are lovely as well. Unfortunately, the pool and beach are not very welcoming. The wind blows relentlessly at the pool. So much so that they do not have umbrellas. The strong wind can blow your drink or book away and the sun is hard to escape. If you have stayed at other Ritz beach resorts you will miss the pool and beach services also. At the pool, an unhappy staff member may bring you a drink. At the beach, no drinks or towels will be brought to you. Chairs and umbrellas are not allowed on the Ritz beach. Chairs but no umbrellas are allowed on the grassy area above the beach. There is a bay close by where you can rent chairs and an umbrella. We stayed on the club level. The food options were quite nice. Worth the extra price. The staff was very nice. The strange thing was how dirty the hallways were. The carpets on the club level looked like there had been some kind of flooding. It made you feel like they sure were not worried about your impression. Based on some other comments about this, it has been this way quite awhile. Mowing the greens at 5:30 am was cruel also. Overall, I would say this is not acceptable for a 5 star Ritz. It felt like a large nice Marriot or Hyatt. That would have been ok for $200.00 a night but for over $700.00 no excuse.

My Department was one of the \"sponsors\" of the conference. First the good: - Great meeting rooms and meeting staff - Very nice ( but not Great) hotel rooms. Extremely clean with great service at least twice a day. - We hosted a cabana by the pool one afternoon with Mango Ice tea, soda, water and Hawaiian Shave Ice. Other conference sponsors had Cabanas with specialty tropical cocktails. Excellent service by the staff - event was a big success. - Grounds are fantastic: multi-pool complex or walk (or ride) down a gently sloping hill to a well kept ocean beach with decent (but not huge) waves and a picturesque sandy beach. Excellent golf courses very nearby. - Fitness center was also good - free weights, weight machines and many treadmills, and several bikes, although 5 of the 6 elliptical/cross-trainers were not 100% functional at any given time ( no music or TV, no elevation, etc.). Now the bad: - We hosted a diner for about 35 people at the 5 star Banyan Tree restaurant on-site. We had selected a pre-set menu with the restaurant staff ahead of time. During the function, the waitstaff, on their own, decided to add an item (surf & turf) that was not agreed to and was priced above anything we agreed to. Additionally we ordered the \" wine by the bottle as it is used\" option. We witnessed the waitstaff filling wine glasses in front of children, empty seats,etc. We had three tables of about 12 people at each in one room. Service timing was weird: table 1 got their appetizers , then 15 minutes later table 2, then 15 minutes later table three - and the same for salads and the entrees. At the end of the night after their unecessary, continuous wine-pouring, we probably left 3 bottles of expensive wine in glasses on the table. Finally the bill got messed up. The amounts the restaurant charged on our receipts were lower than the amounts they had put on my Mastercard ( I had to call Mastercard several times). We did finally get everything resolved satisfactorily over the next two days with the help of the Ritz Accounting Dept. If I had to do this again, I would make it very clear that only the items on the pre-set menu were to be offered; let the guests order wine or drinks by the glass; and make sure I had an extra $10,000 in my credit-line to pay for the meal. Or better still go somewhere else ( i.e. Merriman's).

We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua. Since we rely heavily on Trip Advisor Reviews, I hope the following info will be helpful to you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOK THE BEST DEAL Before you book your trip, shop around on-line. We found lots of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through honeymoon travel agencies, but we opted to book direct with The Ritz once we determined the same offer was available. We figured this would give us a greater chance of scoring upgrades if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re available. We considered doing an island hop (Maui and Kauai), but we opted to stay the full 8 days in Maui. Spending an entire day relocating just seemed like a waste. Next time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll focus on a new and different island. Unless you have 2 full weeks, I recommend staying in one place. There is plenty to do and see in Maui. COST We wanted this trip to be really special without breaking the bank. Ritz-Carlton service is top notch with resort amenities to match. I did a cost comparison analysis of another hotel with a rate of around $300 per night. When you consider that a dining budget of $100 pp each day is conservative for Hawaii, it was more than worth it for us to go with the $595 per night Club Level rate. After all, breakfast, lunch, appetizers, snacks, desserts, and drinks (cocktails, bottled water, soda in Club Room only) were included \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no way we could have bought all of that we had for under $100 pp. The $500 resort credit kind of made it feel like we were on an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all inclusive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package, but without sacrificing quality service. For an 8 night stay, we paid about $4500 (that includes resort fees, taxes, and $500 resort credit). Bargain! Car rental costs average at $50 per day + tax \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so figure about $500 for a mid-size sedan. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to factor in food, drinks, activity costs, gas, and souvenirs. Outside the resort, we spent about $500. We could have reduced that by splurging a little less on the non-essentials. The Zip Line activity cost about $100 pp, but was so worth it! We bought the $20 Road to Hana driving tour CD from the Shell Gas Station (very popular). Snorkeling is free if you have your own gear. Actually, there is a lot to do in Maui for little to no cost. That said, dining and tax rates are higher than we expected. A few of our favorite activities happen to be free\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 lounging in the hotel hammock, observing sea turtles and whales from cliffs near our resort, driving along the coast line, live music in the lobby, snorkeling, etc. For the two of us, we spent a grand total of just under $5500. That includes: King Club Level accommodation at Ritz-Carlton Kapalua, all food/drinks, activities (couples massage/spa day, snorkeling, zip line, Road to Hana), gas, souvenirs (a painting, tiki statue, t-shirt, post cards, 2 state park fees, etc.). Additionally, we paid about $650 pp for round-trip airfare from Virginia to Hawaii. We booked this trip 5 weeks in advance. PACKING FOR MAUI We packed our own snorkel gear, water shoes, and shorties (wet suits). I highly recommend you plan your trip with the help of the travel book \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Maui Revealed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must have! Study it in advance and take it with you. Other than the obvious, pack your sneakers, backpack, fleece jacket, and GPS for your day trips. There will be plenty of free maps and brochures to collect upon your arrival. PLAY IT SAFE Generally speaking, my impression of Maui is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty safe. The people are very friendly and welcoming. That said, you should be aware that parked cars at overlook points are common targets. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave valuables inside. Either lock them in your hotel room safe, or carry them on you. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem, but the broken glass in parking areas acted as a constant reminder. If you plan to snorkel or swim, consider the risk of leaving your expensive camera (and digital memories) on some random public beach. We left our digital camera at the hotel on snorkel days. Next time, I plan to buy a disposable water camera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheap and no one wants to steal it. Three additional quick words of caution\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 1) Swimming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ocean currents can be surprisingly strong. When in doubt, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out. 2) Hitchhiking is actually illegal in Hawaii. 3) Female Solo travelers must exercise good common sense. Google \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Missing in Maui\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - Sure bad things happen everywhere but the relaxed, friendly culture of Maui makes it easier to dismiss common rules of safety. TRANSPORTATION You will definitely need a car. Reserve ahead via phone or internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I recommend Enterprise. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to provide your credit card for reservation. You also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay extra for the 2nd driver (for married &/or co-habituating couples). Other companies often charge and extra $10 per day for 2nd driver. Regardless of your choice rental car company, you will need to exit baggage claims and turn right, left around the kiosk station. Hop on your designated shuttle. The shuttle to Enterprise took less than 20 minutes. When we arrived, they offered us complimentary bottled water. We ended up getting the only mid-size car left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Chevy Malibu. Not bad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a good rate and decent size. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like the guy was overly pushy with the up-sale. Very efficient, professional, and friendly. LATE NIGHT ARRIVAL We took a direct flight from LAX to OGG (Maui). It was late. We were tired and hungry. In case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wondering, you will find a few fast food restaurants just off of Hwy 30 closer to Lahaina (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pass this town on your way to Kapalua). Drive time from airport to Kapalua is about 45 minutes. Look for a Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Panda (on your right). Lahaina Mall (also on left) has a small food court (Orange Julius, pizza, Chinese, etc), but closes around 9pm. There is a grocery store and ABC store on street side. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it. Drive a few miles, and you will see Mc D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (left side). LATE NIGHT CHECK-IN When we arrived at the hotel, the valet helped us unload our bags. My husband parked the car. Staff greeted us with Kukui Nut Leis. Bellman delivered bags to the room. Our reservation was for King Garden View Club Level. We were delighted to find that we had balcony overlooking the golf course w/ a partial ocean view. I must admit, our room initially seemed sort of small. It was nice, but not as spacious as I thought it would be. A mini-fridge was a pleasant surprise. Bathroom was nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soaking tub, separate shower, 2 sinks, and private toilet closet. King bed was very comfortable. We requested extra pillows the next night. The room was very immaculate and clean. CLUB LEVEL PERKS The Club level is the only way to go. Room key access required. There are two computer stations w/ free Internet (you can check your email, print boarding pass, and look up area attraction info). A full spread is offered for breakfast and lunch. Heavy hors d'oeuvres are plentiful each evening. Chef Corey is AMAZING. Since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m vegetarian, the concierge manager always made sure I had plenty of food to choose from. We actually ended up canceling our dinner reservations on several evenings because the appetizers were so deliciously filling (at least for me). On those evenings, we hopped over to Aloha Mix Plate for my husband to grab an extra bite for dinner. I enjoyed dessert. Cocktails, soft drinks, cookies, fruit available almost all day (closed for a couple hours each afternoon). Try the Kapalua Punch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s festive and refreshing! The club level concierge manager is there to answer questions, offer suggestions and she will even make dinner/activity reservations for you. This is a perk of the club level, so take advantage! The staff was so friendly and accommodating. I did notice one guest couple that seemed rather persnickety, demanding and somewhat rude to the staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that couple didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to experience the same warm, over-and-above service that we did. Polite manners and genuine appreciation go a long way in earning you extra perks. One staff member even offered to pack us a complimentary picnic cooler for our day trip to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Road to Hana.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DINING Dining can be pricey, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parts of the vacation experience, right?! Ask the concierge or check out the reviews in Maui Revealed book. My favorite dining experience was Chef Corey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creations in the club lounge. Other than that, I loved Lahaina Pizza (upper level) which is a deep dish style pizza. Yum! Tons of restaurants in that area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very historic. On the other side of the Lahaina Cannery Mall (drive around the block) you will find Aloha Mix Plate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a casual restaurant on the water. My husband became a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during our week long stay (Note: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not vegetarian-friendly, but the staff is Very Friendly). I ordered dessert and a drink from the bar. Take-out is a great option if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like lingering. OTHER RESORT AMENITIES Our package deal included a $500 resort credit. We dined at Banyon Tree the first night (ambiance was nice, but the food just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appealing to us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not bad, just not a place we would try again). The remainder of our credit was spent at the day spa (couples massage) and resort gift shop (sun screen & aloe vera). Somehow we totally missed the art gallery shop on the first floor until the last day. A little pricey, but nice to look at. A walking trail goes from the resort to Kapalua Bay. You can also take advantage of the hotel shuttle. The resort offers a bunch of other activities, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t participate in those. MUST SEE ATTRACTIONS Haleakala Crater, Iao Needle, Lahaina historic village (see the famous Banyon Tree), drive the Road to Hana (full day driving tour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c self guided; buy CD), Pools of Oheo (aka: 7 Sacred Pools).

I'm afraid I've been spoiled for any future vacations because I'll always compare any hotel to the Ritz and come up short. It is certainly the gold standard for service and amenities. Twice a day room housekeeping, feather bed mattresses, huge bathrooms. I was surprised by how quiet the place was. We never heard anyone in surrounding rooms and when we sat on our lanai (next to the third fairway of the Bay Golf Course), we never once heard any other hotel guests. The pools (3) and spas (2) were not crowded. The ocean views from the pool areas are fantastic. It never got too hot (84 degrees all week) because of the constant breezes off the ocean. The Terrace Restaurant (in the hotel) served delicious dinners and the Pineapple Grill Restaurant (on the Kapalua Resort property) served the best meal I've had in years (I work as a Director of Food Services, so I have high standards for meal preparation). My only complaint is the $20 per day \"resort fee\" that is added on to the daily hotel rate (not mentioned in the Expedia web-site price) . Why not just include it in the daily rate? The good news is that there is no parking fee and the parking lots are very close by the front of the hotel. If you are looking for a quiet, low-key, luxurious resort/hotel, this place can't be beat. If you want a place where the kids can run and scream (i.e., Disneyland type), I'd recommend the Maui Hyatt in Lahaina. My husband learned to scuba in the Ritz-Carlton pool and then went with the instructor to the beach and spent about an hour looking at the giant turtles and tropical fish.

The room was so spacious and our lanai was just beautiful, overlooking the pool, ocean and some very pretty foliage. I have very high expectations when I travel and expect to be catered to at the Ritz, and we were not disappointed. We stayed at one for our honeymoon and we were blown away, so I can say I definitely was looking for the same here. I was definitely a little nervous due to some of the negative reviews I had read before we arrived. None of the things that I was worried about ever happened to us and we stayed for 8 nights. The spa was great, I only used it the first day for one small treatment. The young lady that did my treatment was so professional and also wrote down some great recommendations for us while we visited. The pools were uncrowded and we never had one problem finding a lounge chair to reside in, or had a problem with getting towel service. Service was a little longer than normal but it is MAUI! They move slow! The beach is about a five minute walk down but for us it was not a problem. We are outdoor type people and those things never bother us, so if you are the type that does not like walking this may bother you. I personally found the fact that there was a running trail all the way over to Kapalua beach pretty awesome. Some amazing views all along the trail including another pristine beach. We loved it and it got us up in the morning to exercise, which is something I hardly ever seem to do! This was such a plus! The weather is slightly more windy, and cloudy but I quite enjoyed the cool breeze and a couple days the clouds were much needed for my sunburned skin! The Kapalua area is more secluded and pretty far away from Lahaina or Whaler's village but again for us, this was a relaxing, peaceful get away. I loved being so far north and let me tell you that we are usually the life of any party. We loved Maui so much we actually extended our stay by 4 days and stayed on the north side of Ka'anapali for that part of the stay and while the beach is very pretty there I still much preferred Kapalua for the seclusion and peacefulness vs the overcrowded shopping mall area. I didn't travel that far for a tourist type vacation. I can go to a lot of places on the mainland for that. We never had one issue with our room, towels, or cleaniness. Our room was meticulous and we always had more towels than we could have ever used. Even when we tried to conserve and hang all of them up, they always removed them and replaced them with clean towels. We had a small fridge in our room that we took full advantage of the whole time by stocking up on beer, alcohol, mixers and snacks from across the street at the Honolua store. We made all our own drinks in the room by filling 16 oz empty water bottles up and then packed them in a beach bag and took them down to the beach or pool. We would go to the bar or grab a waiter and get glasses of ice and just throw them a couple of dollars for tip. It saved us a fortune!!! We never had dinner on property because there were so many other options available to us, but we did have breakfast one morning in room and that was 40 dollars for a kid's menu breakfast and ate lunch twice at the pool. The food we did have was all good but pricey. We split burgers and that was enough food for us. I suggest eating breakfast and lunch at the Honolua store. Have the crab cake, eggs benedict! OMG delish and it was 6.95!! Also try the happy hour sushi at Sansei! Best tuna carpaccio in the world! We also ate at the Pineapple grill for our anniversary, this was the only place I was disappointed in unfortunately, mainly because I wanted al fresco dining and this felt more like a country club all inclosed. It wasn't all that romantic. They did have an amazing lobster bisque and great pineapple upside down cake. Merriman's is ASTOUNDING!!! We ended up celebrating our anniversary again another evening because of the view of Molokai and Kapalua beach. They have what's called the point and we spent several evenings here watching sunsets and drinking wine. The food was wonderful and so was the service. One last note on our checkout I called down the day before and asked for a late checkout as our flight didn't leave until 9:00. She had set us up for another room to check into in the morning since we had the free upgraded suite but to our surprise she called us in the morning and told us we could stay in our suite until 6:00 in the evening. It really made our trip special since we did not want to leave, in fact I should probably credit her with the reason my hubby and I decided to extend our stay 4 more days and the only reason we did not stay at the Ritz for that extension was to check out Lahaina and Whaler's village for a comparison for our next visit. It truly was a trip of a lifetime here and I cannot for the life of me see how anyone could ever say a bad word about the Ritz! It is a beautiful place with beautiful people that if you are willing, will bend over backwards to take the ultimate care of you!

We paid for club level and were upgraded without asking to a club-level suite (I was planning to ask, but didn't have to). The room was wonderful. There were 2 or 3 small things wrong with the room, but a quick phone call to the desk set it right, and fast. Housekeeping was terrific. Everybody seemed to know our name without being told. I came down to the desk to get change the day after I checked in, and the clerk, who had checked us in the day before, addressed my by name without being prompted - and this place has about 450 rooms! One evening I went to the gift shop to buy sunburn cream. The shop had just closed, but I knocked on the door and the clerk immediately let me in to buy what I needed. I can't say that we used many of the hotel services other than the club lounge - which was wonderful. As others have stated, dining at this hotel is very pricey, but if you have the club lounge, you basically get great food included in your room rate - they don't call it lunch and supper but trust me, it's plenty and it's good. Grounds were beautifully maintained. You can valet park for a fairly steep charge ($18/day) or self-park for free, which we did, but it can be a 5-minute walk to the car. Also, as others have mentioned, the beach is a 5-10 on-property walk away, and it's downhill, which of course means uphill on the way home. (Hint: from the beach, walk into level 1 in the #1 wing, and take the elevator to your room. If you're in the #2 wing, take the #1 wing elevator to floor 7 and walk across to wing #2 - much less climbing!) I highly recommend a car if you're staying here, since distances are quite long. However one day I went to do laundry a few miles away and the hotel courtesy van happened to be there dropping a guest off and later returned to pick her up. They're big on service. In a humorous moment, I was carrying a somewhat heavy ice chest down the hall and the housekeeper (a lady about half my size) asked if I needed help carrying it. Honeymoon or not, I'm not going to saddle her with that weight to carry. :) It's beautiful, it's luxurious, it's expensive, and of course it's Maui.

The staff at the restaurants were great and made dining with our son an easy experience. Overall the trip was a relaxing one, which was exactly what we wanted.

They complain about the wind. OK it is windy, but there was only ONE day when it was really gusting and beach had a red flag warning. So it's windy, find something else to do. The beach is too far....waaaah! It's probably about 5-6 city blocks from the lobby. Forgive my non-PC self for saying it, but most Americans could stand to walk that far and back and lose a little weight. Also, the beach (D.T. Fleming) was perfect. Only rivalled by our experience in Hana of Hamoa beach. As for lounge chairs, they are at the beach in a small grassy area. You are asked not to bring them down to the beach. Big deal. If you want a beach littered with things/people, then stay at one of the Ka'anapali beaches. The main reason for staying here was to AVOID that. We didn't eat at any hotel restaurants, but I would highly recommend Pineapple Grill (though I was disappointed and slighlty confused they had no al fresco dining) and Merriman's. Definitely go to Merriman's, if for nothing but sitting out on the \"Point\" and enjoying Happy Hour (which is actually 2 hours from 3-5). Service at the hotel was impeccable. We were upgraded to a 1 BR residential suite uopn arrival. Room was nice and housekeeping very good. All-in-all a wonderful property in a beautiful, secluded (read: away from the masses in Ka'anapali) spot in Maui. Would return in a heartbeat. P.S.

The resort is very big but the beach is just a 5 minute walk from the main pool area. The beach is very private as you only see guests of the Ritz. The concierge was so helpful and booked all of our events that were first class, all we had to do was show up. I do have to advise you that the ocean view was a side view but it was still beautiful. I believe they also have ocean front rooms available. They played live soothing music in the lounge area. Tips: Grab your breakfast and lunch at the store on the resort and save your money for a nice dinner. Dinner on the resort can be pricey but it's expected when staying at the Ritz.

The beach is far from the rest of the resort, and there are no lounge chairs or umbrellas offered for the beach. The pool is very boring compared to the other hotels' pools and the children's pool is tiny with small waterfalls being the only feature.

We think that for the other rooms down the hall they didn't even bother to advise the guests of what had happened and just tried to clean it up before they returned.

There is a marine sanctuary approx 5 miles from the resort (Honolua) that has incredible snorkeling once you hike through a few minutes of rain forest - an experience on its own. A bit further down the road is a popular ocean \"geyser\" which shouldn't be missed. So yes, as others have mentioned, the resort is a bit off-piste, but that was precisely what we were looking for. Also highly recommend Air Maui's heli tour of the volcano/waterfalls - and our pilot Capt. Kirk, who provided excellent commentary. In terms of luaus we enjoyed the Feast at Lele.

A four minute walk from the lobby to the local General Store fed our family of four for less than $25.

I chose this location because it was away from the other hotels (which may be a negative to some people). It is peaceful, serene, and tranquil, exactly what I needed. There is a gorgeous beach just a walk down the property, and i watched the sunrise each day at this spot. There are also chairs in this area to escape the pool atmosphere if you'd like. The concierge and valets were very helpful with all of my questions about activities. You can book most activities on the island directly through the hotel. Keep in mind these are \"a la carte\" as far as pricing, and none are free. This is the case no matter where you stay on Maui, though, so go for the best! The rooms were beautiful, clean, modern and spacious. Service was impeccable from the restaurants to the cleaning staff. There are several restaurants on the property. You cannot expect to stay at a Ritz Carlton and have cheap food. In the hotel, the breakfast was excellent, and the bar had delicious food at a lower price than the other choices. The cocktails were the best I had on Maui. Again, Maui is expensive in general so go for the best! There are several other choices within walking or free shuttle distance from the hotel. We especially enjoyed Sansei and Pineapple Grill. There is also a general store type place with a deli for breakfast and lunch. Make sure you take the shuttle to Kapalua Bay, as the snorkeling is wonderful. I would recommend renting a car, as there is no free shuttle service to Kanaapali or Lahaina, and taxis are expensive.

Most of the reviews we read on trip advisor are very accurate. Upon check in they upgraded us to an ocean view room even though we only paid for the basic room. Most of the rooms their have only a limited ocean view due to the layout of the hotel. The service at the hotel was very good from the Valet, Front Desk, and most Servers. The grounds are very nice and the Ocean view from the pools are unbelievable. The hotel is about a 3 minute walk to the beach so do not expect to be right on the beach like some other places but the walk is quick and they even provide a golf cart ride free of charge for you if you prefer. The rooms were very nice and the maid service was up to parr. Like other reviews stated the pool deck can be very windy but in Hawaii even a strong wind is not that cold. There was a few times where we had to wait longer than expected to get drinks in the outside pool bar area and they were not even that busy but other than that all of our service experiences were great. Kevin at the Terrace was great! The hotel is for the most part by itself so there are only a few places to walk to but if you do decide to stay here you should definitely go to \"The Gazebo\" for breakfast and get the macadamia and banana nut pancakes. Also even better than that is \"The PIneapple Grill\" Best restaurant I have ever been to. The pineapple upside down cake is a great desert and the fish and steaks there are great. Overall I really enjoyed this hotel. The only negative I have is that even though we got a good rate I forgot that the food ($20 omelet) drinks ($12 Pina Colada) and activities (my girlfriend paid $15 for a yoga class) would still be pricey but I guess that is what you should expect at the Ritz or any other five star resort.

I twice made phone calls to confirm that the course would be suitable for my days of travel & stay at the Ritz. Upon arrival I was informed that the Plantation Course was being aerated and the greens fees were $235. I had to play because I flew 5000 miles to experience it. I've played all over the world and do yourself a favor: buy tickets for whale watching if you want great views of water and whales breaching. Wailea is a much better exchange of value for the golf experience. I am a true golf junky ,trust me. My mouth waters every year in January when they play the SBS tournament. When I got to the course for my tee time, they informed me that there was also a slight construction project going on that day. They dug up the back 9 for irrigation. I was playing in between tractors and workers who were clueless I just paid good money to play this course. When leaving the property, be sure to review your bill carefully. I had purchased a package that included all the breakfasts and they somehow double charged me along with other charges that I charged to another card. The attention to detail at this property is very poor and probably due to the \"relaxed nature\" of the locals who seem to be sleep walking. I just can't recommend this place ever. To go further, the coffee was cold 3 of the 5 days and tasted like it was sitting in a metal pot all day long. Seriously, how do you mess up coffee? Resort fee of $20 per day. Why? Everything on this trip was prepaid and I find this fee a nickel and dime fee. Just add it to the room charge or whatever. There is only one Ritz that I will ever revisit and that is in Ireland.

First the good news: The setting at Kapalua couldn't be much more stunning. D.T. Fleming beach and the other easily accessible beaches at the Ritz are rugged and beautiful. The hotel's grounds, lobby and rooms are also attractive. The Beach House restaurant has a wonderful setting and slightly better than average food and service. The bad news: Service was mediocre at best. Granted, we were coming from the Four Seasons, where service was warm, outgoing, and generally flawless, but we expected service to at least be at a four-star level at Kapalua. No such luck. The front desk attendant, whose English was difficult to understand, immediately pulled out a rate sheet when I voiced my displeasure about our room, which was in an unfortunate location and had no view. Despite the availability of better rooms (FS Maui automatically upgraded us to an executive suite), the front desk decided to play Let's Make a Deal and brought out the rate sheet to try to extract more $ for a slightly better room. We did eventually agree to pay more for what they called an Ocean View Suite, but there was hardly any view of the ocean. Whereas every staff member you pass at FS Maui greets you warmly, we were greeted with indifference at every turn at the Ritz. Maid service was laughably inept, with dirty dishes left in the room and no shampoo or soap in one of the bathrooms. Servers and hosts at the restaurants were generally glum, with one hostess greeting us with an extended yawn. The level of warmth and sophistication in the food and service at FS Maui is miles ahead of the Ritz's. Other assorted miscues: The dressing room at the gift shop is an office with no mirror; We ordered the same movie twice and had technical difficulties both times (the charges were removed); Concierges were poorly informed (the timeshare salesperson knew the property better); no water was available from the bell desk upon leaving the property. When we made our reservation, the reservation agent asked the name and age of our son and whether we would need a crib (we did). But on arrival, a crib was nowhere to be found. At the Four Seasons, not only was the crib in place, but so was a free stuffed animal, free bath toys, infant bath supplies, and sponges that spelled out our baby's name. What a difference! While the Four Seasons is not without flaws (the location isn't particularly beautiful), we looked back at our four days there fondly and look forward to returning.

We arrived (about hour taxi ride from airport by the way) after a really rubbish American Airlines flight from LAX. word of warning for everyone its a 5 1/2 hour flight and its really a budget airline its like easyjet which is fine for short trips but it was so cramped on this plane, no food served or drink or anything unless obviously you pay and the trolley is a rare sight!! There no TV apart from those really old ones on the ceiling which showed elf!! Anyway just wanted to let people know Back to the hotel. It really is bliss. We decided to stay in a club room which is more exp but does have this amazing club room you go to. It serves great food all day. Breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, snacks all day and little canap\u00c3\u00a9s in the evening. It also serves wine, cocktails, spirits, champagne, beer soft drinks anything all for free. So basically we ate in one of the restaurants about twice on the whole trip because this club room is so good. We were having champagne at breakfast, wine at lunch, afternoon cocktails so on and so really got our moneys worth out of it. I highly recommend. Oh also the staff in there are so so friendly. There are also free papers and internet access on x2 computers which was handy the wireless also works on the iphone too. Hotel pools were beautiful; the guys would set you beds up for you. The beach was also amazing although the 15/ 20ft waves on Christmas day were fun until I almost drowned so watch out they are huge down at the beach. The room was massive, big TV, massive bathrooms, big balcony oh and they gave us free chocolates and champagne in our room on arrival. Staff v attentive, friendly.

We are completing a 5-day, 4 night stay. IMPORTANT NOTE - if you are renting a car from the airport, do NOT follow Google Maps' advice to take the highway on the north shore - it is an incredibly windy road that narrows to one lane multiple times (so you constantly have to look out for other cars and pull over to let them through), on which you can only crawl forward at about 15 mph. The twists and turns run along the coast, but go on for about 15 miles - and thus at 15 mph, you are winding back and forth for about an hour. My wife and I were both car sick about halfway through the drive and were just praying we would reach our destination soon. Google sends you on the shortest distance, but trust me, take the other route (the main highway) - you will get there about 20 minutes faster and much happier. LOCATION: As noted by numerous others, Kapalua is on the northwest end of Maui, about 15-20 minutes away from Kaanapali and Lahaina. The little village of Kapalua has a small grocery store and a few restaurants (which are a short walk or a free shuttle ride from the hotel), which provides a bit of diversity from the restaurants in the hotel. ROOM: We found a great deal through American Express Travel, and paid about $430/night for a one-bedroom ocean-view suite (normally about $995/night). The room is fantastic - two full bathrooms (the master bath is enormous), lots of closet and storage space, a very large balcony with a beautiful view of the ocean and a large living room. Big plus is that there are plasma TVs in both rooms and there is actually HD service (as opposed to just stretching out a normal definition picture) - which was great for watching the Winter Olympics (strange dichotomy watching skiing while in Hawaii). SERVICE: Here's where I thought the hotel was lacking a bit. Not that the service was bad - everyone is friendly - but there isn't that crackerjack attention to detail and immediate jumping out of their way to make your stay better in any way possible. We've visited a number of Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons properties, and this one is a bit more laid back when it comes to service. It isn't the end of the world, but to be honest, a significant amount of kissing up is kind of what we've come to expect when paying the premium for a Ritz-Carlton. FOOD: We dined at the Banyan Tree (very good!), the Pineapple Grill (solid, but not exceptional), Sansei (overrated sushi - tendency toward overpowering flavors), and the Terrace (breakfast buffet, which was average). SPA: I had a respectable hot stone massage. I do highly recommend the steam room - it is infused with eucalyptus, and was remarkably refreshing. I'm not usually a fan of steam rooms, but this one was a great experience. The spa staff was well-trained and friendly. GOLF: I played the Plantation Course. Imaginative course with some spectacular views. Wide fairways - ridiculously quick greens. I was annoyed that they don't allow you to walk the course. FITNESS CENTER - Well appointed, with a variety of cardio machines, free weights and weight machines. For whatever reason, this room isn't kept cool through air conditioning, so it's a bit of a sweat box. Also, there was no attendant stationed in the room - other Ritz properties have had an attendant who walks around passing around water, cold towels, etc. Again, not something you NEED at your gym, but it really is a nice touch. POOL - Large pools were nice, and have a great view of the ocean. The towel attendants don't set you up with a chair - you just grab a towel and claim your own seats. This becomes a hassle when the pool is crowded, because they don't have knowledge on whether someone has left for the day. Other Ritz properties have employees who will find you a location. Also, there are NO UMBRELLAS at the pool, so those who are sensitive to the sun or heat have to hope for the very few seats that are shaded by trees. Drink attendants are friendly, but difficult to track down. Last call for food/drink is at about 4:15PM - which seemed a bit early to us (the pool is open 24 hours). MISCELLANEOUS: $20 per day resort fee - in return, you get free self-parking (valet parking is $18/night) and free wi-fi. OVERALL: It's a great property, with all of the facilities you would want.

It has its own sand beach, a great pool, a golf course (though I don't golf) and a reasonably nice fitness gym. It is great for families. The poolside drinks were great. Another great feature was the concierge desk. They were extremely helpful in making reservations.

There is DT Fleming beach that you can walk to from the pool area down the hillside. It is secluded and not crowded at all. You can also take a longer walk (or the shuttle) to Kapalua Bay for a busier beach & great snorkeling. We did both snorkeling & scuba diving at Kapalua Bay & there were plenty of turtles & other sea creatures to entertain us. We ate at Kai in the hotel, but found Sansei right down the road to be much better for sushi. We had remarkable beach front dinners in Kaanapali & Lahaina at Leilani's & Pacific 'O. Great food at Roy's too, (although there is no view here), and of course, Mama's Fish House in Paia. Mama's has THE best views of anywhere on the island, it is really spectacular! It's a great place to go for lunch rather than dinner, as there isn't a sunset view. We went on our last day in Maui on our way to the airport. We also did some awesome scuba diving with Lahaina Divers & thought they were great. We dove Lanai & had an awesome experience.

My wife and I celebrated a wedding anniversary with a seven-night stay at this hotel. Simply put, this property is in a league of its own. For other couples weighing their hotel options in Maui, here are some quick observations that I hope you might find helpful: Location: The Ritz Kapulua is located in... you guessed it, Kapalua. For those unfamiliar with Maui, Kapalua is a village located in the northwest side of the island, about ten miles or so from Lahaina - one of the main activity areas in Maui. While Lahaina and the nearby hotel zones (e.g., Kaanapali) are somewhat crowded, Kapalua is decidedly not. It is a very well planned village with lots of open space. The hotel and the nearby private villas are surrounded by three top-notch golf courses and, of course, the ocean. With respect to the latter, there are essentially three distinct areas in the village (and readily accessible from the hotel): (1) a swimming beach located about a quarter-mile from the hotel, (2) a scenic rocky-shore area, and (3) a protected bay perfect for sunbathing and snorkeling. A walking path connects all three areas. I have seen the swimming beach described as small; this seems inaccurate to me. The beach struck me as plenty large and it was never remotely crowded during our stay. The bay area has a concession stand where you can rent snorkeling gear and other equipment, all at a reasonable price. Kapalua also has a number of great restaurants (apart from those in the hotel itself), including an excellence sushi joint (Sansei) and a steak/seafood place with an incredible view (Merriman's). The only downside is that Kapalua is a little removed from the nightlife scene in Lahaina and its surrounding environs. Though the Ritz provides a shuttle to anywhere within the village, the shuttle does not run to points outside of the same. If you plan on imbibing responsibly in Lahaina or elsewhere, plan to take a cab. The Ritz has a private cab service that is reliable though a little expensive (about $70 roundtrip from the hotel to downtown Lahaina). Grounds: Everything you would expect from a Ritz-Carlton. The lobby is open and spacious and has a great ocean view. The pool area is large with plenty of beach chairs. The crew in the pool area is very attentive as well. Rooms: The rooms are big and well-appointed, even by Ritz standards. But take note: the hotel does not sit directly on the ocean, so getting a room with a great view of the ocean will prove somewhat difficult. Food: The Banyan Tree is among the best restaurants on Maui. The pool cafe serves up pretty solid lunch offerings. And the Beach House, located right at the swimming beach, has a great menu with an unbeatable view. The breakfast buffet at the Terrace Room is fantastic. The complimentary breakfast smoothies served to each guest is a nice treat as well. Spa: I have been to a number of Ritz properties and this was the most well-appointed Ritz spa I have seen to date. Great relaxing areas and a wide range of Hawaiian-centric services (along with the basics). Service: Terrific in all respects. The concierge was very helpful in terms of activity planning. Tips: The pool towel service shuts down at around 5:30 pm, though the pool and the hot tubs are accessible 24 hours a day. If you plan on heading down to the pool area in the evening, you might want to grab a few towels during the day. Also, make reservations for the restaurants as soon as you have your plans in order, as the best times fill up quickly. I would highly recommend a sunset dinner at Merriman's. Finally, be sure to plan for a trip to the swimming beach. The Beach House restaurant has fairly limited hours; if you need snacks or drinks when the the Beach House is closed, you'll be in for a rather long, uphill walk to the pool area. And note that you cannot bring the Ritz lounge chairs onto the beach itself. If you strongly prefer a lounge chair while sunbathing, head over to the bay area, where you can rent a chair for the day.

Our drive from the airport to the Kapalua, Ritz Carlton Hotel was filled with many stops at look out points to watch the Humpback Whales. When we got to the Hotel we were met by a friendly helpful staff. Our suite was beautiful & had great views of the pool & ocean. We could hear the Pacific Ocean waves hitting the beach from our balcony. The Hotel had excellent resturaunts, with each having their own flavor & amboyance. It also had educational programs to teach you about the islands. The program, \"Embassadors to the Environment\" was very informative. We went on hikes, snorkeling, whale watching & star gazing. Each program started out with a class that was given by a friendly, well trained staff professional. You could tell that person loved their job but especially loved teaching others. We then went to the activity where the staff person coutinued the program with hands-on activities. We always felt safe & learned how, \"All things are connected.\" We went to a presentation called, \"Sense of Place.\" & later that evening went to a show called, \"Ulalena\", both activities were very moving.

The best part of the Ritz Carlton are the comfortable rooms. We were upgraded for free to a residential garden suite. It had a separate bedroom, a huge bathroom, a dressing area, and a kitchen living area. Both the bedroom and the living area had lanai/patios with very comfortable seating. The kitchen area had dinnerware and flatware and a large table to eat it which was nice if you just wanted to be indoors. The hotel is very secluded so if you're looking to get away it's a good location. It's a quick drive to Ka'anapali and Lahaina but VERY far from anything else on the island. The breakfast buffet was lousy, after the first day we decided to drive to the Sheraton Maui for their breakfast as we had stayed there a year earlier on our honeymoon and liked it. I wouldn't waste money on the breakfast here. The general store that you pass on the way into the property is fabulous. The name is misleading because it' s more like a small, gourmet grocery store. The food they prepare there is cheaper and much tastier than the Ritz so definitely try it out for breakfast or lunch. The pools at the Ritz were okay, but not fabulous. I would say the Sheraton, the Four Seasons, and the Mariott all had much better pool areas. Pros for the hotel are free self-parking which is not far, free internet access, and a really nice fitness room (unfortunately you have to pay $15 or more for classes at the fitness center such as yoga unlike the Four Seasons which offers classes for free).

We were greeted by welcome staff and given Kukui Nut Leis. We reserved a Garden View Residential Suite and it was amazing. Everything looked new and all the furniture and furniture/materials were high end. There is a large table in the kitchen, a small bar on the side wall where the refrigerator(hideaway, top access) is located and a long counter where the sink microwave and dishwasher are located. The living room has a comfortable couch, two sitting chairs and a big flat screen tv. The living room has a balcony connected to it. The bedroom has a big flat screen tv, ipod alarm clock radios and the king size bed is very comfortable and soft. I have problems sleeping in hotels if the bed isn't comfortable and I fell asleep each night with ease. There is a small hallway leading to the bathroom and closets and has a small dresser for clothes and to set items on top. The bathroom has all marble with a separate toilet area. Service to the room was great; clean up during the day and turn down service at night. Also, anytime I needed anything(kitchen items, towels) they sent someone to our room within a few minutes. The pool has tiered levels and the service there is outstanding. There was always an attendant around for service(drinks, towels, food). The wind actually made the pool more enjoyable since it was hot outside. Beware though, because the wind can make you so comfortable you don't realize you're getting burned. The beach is beautiful, however the wind makes it unbearable to lay out and relax. The wind whips up the sand and blows so hard that it actually stings any part of your bare body. Also, your towel and anything else on the sand will be covered in sand in seconds. The water is great for body surfing. If you want to reserve a cabana with a tv just make sure to do so ahead of time, especially for a Saturday or Sunday. We went during college football season so all the cabanas were reserved before we got to the Ritz. The hotel parking is located right next to the hotel. We self parked almost everyday and made the very short walk to the hotel. We ate at the Banyan Tree once and had a couple small meals at the Alaloa Lounge. The service and food at the Banyan Tree was very good. It was hard to get service at the Alaloa Lounge at night; waitress staff would disappear for several minutes at a time. There were acoustic performers some nights at the Alaloa Lounge . The food and appetizers were okay at the Alaloa Lounge and I believe it was made from The Terrace kitchen. We did not eat dinner at The Terrace, but breakfast was amazing(pricey). The hotel is located in a secluded area, however, Lahaina is a short drive away and has a lot of activites, shopping and dining. I was pleased to learn that Lahaina had a sports bar to watch some college football games. We went to the The Drums of The Pacific Luau. The food was okay, but the fire knife dancer was very cool. The show was fast paced. Our server was great and loaded us up with alcohol. We got a gift certificate for a wedding present to Mama's Fish House and it was THE BEST meal we had our entire stay in Hawaii. Everything is caught and served fresh. They even note on the menu who caught your dinner. I do not recommend making the complete trip past Hana if you have a passenger in the car. The roads are EXTREMELY bumpy and the trip is long. With that being said, I will say that the views are absolutely spectacular and the best on the island. I can't say the same for my wife(passenger). Hamoa Beach located just past Hana is the most beautiful beach I've ever seen. I believe it was listed #5 on Dr. Beach's list this past year. If you are looking for a place to relax with 5 star amenities, then the Ritz is your place. If you are looking for nightlife and a bunch of hotels right next to each other, then look to Ka'anapali.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201c8 days in heaven!\u201d", "Author": "SG425", "ReviewID": "UR53214910", "Content": "We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua for our honeymoon in November 2009.

We had reserved a Club Level room for our stay but were told about a month prior that the Club Level would be closed; were instead compensated with a suite and a daily resort credit. The popular Banyan Tree restaurant was closed for renovation during our stay, but the Terrace restaurant was a wonderful substitute. Breakfast every day was delicious, albeit pricey. We ate at the Ritz-Carlton's sushi restaurant Kai--but actually preferred its sister restaurant, Sansei, located on the resort grounds, as it was delicious as well as reasonably priced. We enjoyed a great lunch at The Beach House restaurant with a wonderful view of the beach and ocean. Our room was beautiful and the service excellent. We enjoyed a wonderful couple's massage at the Waiha spa--it was worth every penny! We enjoyed the pools, the bar, the beach--everything about our stay was wonderful. We loved that the pools and hot tubs were open late as well. The only complaint I have was one day when it was raining, there were really no options at the hotel for lunch, as the only lunch options are the pool cafe or the Beach House restaurant, which are both only accessible outdoors. The hotel bar was overwhelmed trying to accommodate hungry guests and service was slow and confused. Service at the bar was also not as friendly and accommodating on other occasions as it could have been. Otherwise, everything was wonderful. The Ritz-Carlton is the perfect honeymoon spot as it is in a secluded area with a private beach--far away from the \"resort strips\" that populate the other main areas of Maui, which are filled with families and kids. You will need a car to venture south to shopping and other desired areas, but the Ritz-Carlton does provide free parking just a short walk away. The beach is about a 5-minute walk from the hotel and is much smaller than in other resort areas, however it is only accessible through the Ritz-Carlton so it's as private as you will find in Maui.

My husband asked for an upgrade (it never hurts to ask, right?), as it was an anniversary trip-- and we were generously accommodated with a beautiful two room suite: Hard wood floors; kitchen; two balconies; great flat screen televisions (yes, there was more than one!); amazingly comfy king bed; nice shower, etc. All this at no extra cost, PLUS we also received complimentary daily breakfast and a daily $130 resort credit (which could be used for anything on site, including valet parking or those dreaded resort fees). Oh yes-- and we received two complimentary appetizers at dinner our first night in honor of our anniversary...... In short, the value at this unbelievably beautiful hotel was fabulous! And it is a beautiful hotel, located on a private cliffside area of the island. The grounds are impeccable; the pool is very nice, and everything was decorated so beautifully for an island Christmas. Other positives: The service was wonderful! Everyone was so friendly and accommodating, and every effort was made to make us feel at home. The food was also delicious. I cannot say enough about the breakfast buffet-- fresh omelets and waffles, delicious bacon, fabulous pastries and fresh fruit-- and they made a point of stressing that if there was anything else they could make us in the kitchen, then that would be considered part of the buffet. Indeed, we saw one gentlemen happily dining on fresh fish for breakfast. How much did we enjoy the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua? After two days at the Ritz-Carlton, we were scheduled to finish our trip at the Four Seasons, but after several days there, my husband and I decided to spend our last days on Maui back at the Ritz-Carlton. Not only did they welcome us back with the same package (and complimentary appetizers) we enjoyed before, but we got upgraded to a suite again-- this time with an ocean view!!!!

We were not disappointed with this hotel. The Ritz Carlton is located in Kapalua, in the north/northwest part of the island. The drive into the hotel from the main road, at night, is beautiful. Cook pines, tall and straight (whose trunks were used for sailing ship masts in the past, which we were later told) line the driveway and are lit up from below making for an . The architecture of the hotel itself is quite nice too, understated and elegant with a tropical feel. The chirping tree frogs, whose evening calls you will become familiar with during your stay, add to that tropical ambiance. Self-parking is free but the lot is a walk to the hotel so we opted to valet the car at a charge of $18/day. The valets were great - they became familiar with my name and car and were always upbeat and pleasant and quick to take or deliver your car. The common areas of the hotel are very nicely decorated. There is a feeling of quality in the furnishings and the the areas are kept up quite well. A huge balcony off the lobby overlooks a reflection pool below as well as the ocean in the background. We enjoyed the excellent view with drinks from the lobby bar as our bags were sent on to the room. It was a long day - a 12 hour flight to Oahu, a connecting flight to Maui, then a 45 minute drive to Kapalua, and those drinks were really needed to help us unwind. We opted for a mountain-view room, which was less expensive than an ocean view room, but were pleasantly surprised that we were able to see both the ocean and the island of Molokai from our lanai. (BTW, be sure to check the Ritz website for promotions and, if you have a AAA membership, ask about those rates since the savings can be substantial, more than enough to cover the cost of a 1-year AAA membership. Besides, you can use the AAA card to get discounts on your car rental (we got a Jeep Wrangler from Hertz at a nice discount) and for many attractions in Hawaii (Blue Hawaiian Helicopter tours, etc, and elsewhere). Our rate was a buy 4 get the 5th night free. The room itself was slightly above average in size (440 sq ft - think of a room that is 21x21) with a walk-in marble & stone bathroom that had 2 sinks, a tub, a shower stall, and a separate toilet enclosure. The decor is definitely tasteful Hawaiian in nature and featured wood floors throughout the room, quite a difference from the fully carpeted rooms that you normally find in hotels. We had a king bed that had a large, pillowy comforter with a mattress that was firm and comfortable - there were no divots in the mattress as is common in hotels that haven't updated in some time. I believe the Ritz underwent a full renovation fairly recently so you will be hard pressed to find old or out-of-date accessories to mar your stay there. The grounds at the Ritz are huge. The \"area\" itself is shared space, there are rental and owner-occupied villas further down from the hotel (the Kapalua Villas) as well as a small shopping center and private residences. The actual grounds of the hotel are well kept - lush plantings provide the desired tropical atmosphere, and towards the beach you will find an ancient Hawaiian burial ground. This area is sacred and are restricted from pedestrian traffic - a bit eerie but interesting in that the hotel made it a point to preserve these spaces as they built the hotel complex around it. It is a downhill walk to the beach area - not a short distance, to a beach that is fickle. The weather here is WINDY, very windy, it seemed to be windy/breezy almost all of the time we were there. As a result it is hit or miss regarding a suitable and safe day to enjoy the beach since the surf and undertows can be an issue. I have seen pictures where the surf is calm; perhaps it was the season we visited that contributed to the rough conditions. The north shore apparently experiences much more wind than the rest of the leeward part of the island (something about the eastern winds wrapping around a volcanic peak and hitting Kapalua) so it is just part of what to expect from the area. We didn't get to go in the water during our visit but the view is beautiful, and there is a restaurant (the Beach House) right down there that serves a great lunch menu and has an unbeatable view of the beach. Take the hotel's golf cart shuttle back up to the hotel as the walk uphill on a full stomach is not an easy one! As I mentioned, this area is windy and so your hair will be all over the place and the swimming may be affected. However, it certainly kept the mosquitoes away. A negative aspect of this hotel, while not against the property itself, is the location. It is at least a 30 minute drive to the main attractions that Maui has to offer - the luaus, the shopping in Lahaina, and much to my disappointment, a very long drive at 4:30AM to Wailea where we had to catch our boat for the ride out to the dive site at Molokini. We had dinner in Laihaina almost every night (we did eat one night at the hotel's signature restaurant, the Banyan Tree - good service, great food (the seafood dishes are excellent - very fresh), great view, very expensive though) and the drive back to the hotel, after a big meal, suffering from the jet lag/6-hour time difference, made for a tiresome ride back each and every night. I sometimes envied the people who were staying at the hotels in Lahaina - calm beaches, walking distance to everything, but in the end, if you can work through the drive back, you'll appreciate the seclusion and elegance of the Ritz. If you are a golfer you will love the courses that the Ritz has access to. I played the Plantation course where they play the PGA tour championship every year (Mercedes Championship I believe). It winds through the sides of an extinct volcano, has forced carries over gullies hundreds of feet deep, and offers a spectacular view of the ocean from many different holes. It's a challenging course but one that you will never forget. The pro shop is very helpful and can arrange for rental clubs (I didn't haul mine there for just one round) and anything else that you may need for an enjoyable round of play. In summary the Ritz Carlton Kapalua is an excellent hotel/resort that is deserving of its 5-star AAA rating. The people who work there are friendly and helpful, the common areas and room were very tastefully decorated, the upkeep of the entire hotel and grounds were excellent, and the atmosphere cannot be beat.

We got a great package from a travel agency which includes the breakfast packages highly recommened, if not, it's $71 including gratitute and tax. Pro: excellent concierage service, they were able to book us based on our requirements. Very knowledgable about the activities available on Maui. At the time of check in, the front desk staff is very friendly and enthustic. The water in the poor feels warmer than it looks, it's very comfortable for this time of the year. Also there two hot spa pools at either side of the pool. Very few people are using it. Business center: provides FREE boarding pass printing, highly recommened! Staff : are all very friendly and attentive. Breakfast buffet: the frenchtoast bread pudding is awesome. Too bad we only had it once during our stay. The valet Clint is very friendly and knowledgable about direction , make sure you ask him for beach towels. Room: the residential suite is large, with a living room/breakfast area, and a seperate bedroom. Very nicely decorated in Ritz fashion. Pool: It does have a beautiful three tiers pool, it's not extravegant. If you are looking for something spetaculr, go else where. Cons: Location: if you are first time in Maui, you probably will not want to stay here, unless you want to stay near or close to the hotel. It was our first time in Maui, so we like to explorer the island, and each time we have to drive 45 min from the Hotel to the airport area and on to other attractions. i.e. road to hana, sun rise on the mountain ( room of the sun) it gets tiring very soon, unless you enjoy the driving the same road over and over again. However the drive is nice, and scenic (during the day) There are very little street lights on Maui. Signs are also very minimal (local laws) Other thoughts: It is windy, but not cold. We enjoy a cool breeze from our lannai. The Breakfast area sometimes will have fruit bugs buzzing over the fruits, so it can be improve upon. Breakfast buffet changes daily, however, only about two dishes changes, all others remain the same. Breakfast buffest can have more Asian dishes, currently only have Miso soup, and Steam White Rice (which are very good) and some vegetabe dishes availble. Hardly enough.

We loved it, but I can see why some reviewers haven't been so keen. Here are my pros and cons: Pros: -Location: Kapalua is a beautiful, quiet, scenic resort community. It has a few great restaurants, and lots of beautiful nature trails. Merriman's is the Hawaiian restaurant of your dreams. Stunning oceanfront location, airy and tasteful decor, and delicious, locally sourced food. Sansei had great sushi and a fun vibe. The ocean trail that starts right next to the Ritz is really something - we spotted sea turtles and a seal in the water, and a family we met said that they always see whales during the winter. -Hotel: I really liked the decor - dark woods gave it a very classy feel. We had a standard room facing one side of the pool - it was large, comfortable, and spotless. The tiered pool is beautiful, and there are also a couple of jaccuzzis. The fitness center is very nice - I never made it to an exercise class, but they had quite a few (for a fee). We did self-park - only a couple of minutes walking. We also had the breakfast buffet every day (bc of Amex Platinum) - it was delicious and extensive. -Go to the \"And Then There Were None\" special presentation!!! It's a short lecture and film presentation (~1.5 hours total) by a wonderful woman who teaches at a local school. It's all about Hawaiian history - I learned so much, it was really a highlight of our vacation. The hotel doesn't advertise it much, but you can find out when it is on their website or by asking the concierge. Why did I love it so much? Because I got the distinct sense from our first few days in Maui that the locals weren't happy about the tourists - one of the first things I noticed was how many \"keep off - private property!\" and more aggressive signs there are when you're driving around. This presentation helps you see where that hostility is coming from - the grandeur and tragedy of the Hawaiian people's history. Back to the hotel! Cons: -Hotel: it is a little worn around the edges - for example, the elevators are really dark, and the wood in them is chipped. Kind of creepy. -Beach: there aren't any hotel loungers right on the sand - they're up on a little grassy hill instead. The beach itself is pretty nice, but with the wind it's not very comfortable to be on a blanket (sand in the eyes, etc) -Service: the pool and beachside servers were pretty indifferent, the breakfast buffet waitstaff varied in their quality daily, but everyone we spoke to at the front desk, concierge, and valet were really friendly and helpful. -Location: if you want hot-and-sunny, Kapalua is probably not the right choice for you. It's windier and more tempestuous than the southern coast of Maui. But it's gorgeous. So if you can get a good deal, I'd definitely go for it. We loved it. I'm happy to answer qustions about the hotel, or about Maui activities - diving, golfing, Haleakala, the Road to Hana - we did it all!", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cA little paradise\u201d", "Author": "tifa2276", "ReviewID": "UR49496141", "Content": "The Ritz Carlton Kapalua was where we spent the latter half of our week long stay in Maui to celebrate our anniversary. We wanted to immerse ourselves in total relaxation after jetting around Maui and doing a bunch of activities while staying in Kihei the first half of the week. It was wonderful and luxurious without being too over the top. A top notch Maui resort! The Ritz Carlton is located in the Kapalua resort complex which is an area north of Ka'anapali and houses luxury hotels & condos, golf courses, and restaurants. The grounds around the whole complex are beautifully maintained and lush. The ritz Carlton is one of the first complexes you see when you turn in on Office Rd into the Kapalua resort. We had booked our room through Amex Platinum to take advantage of a special room rate, which included an upgrade, breakfast buffet each day, and a 100 USD resort credit. Upon arrival, we were given necklaces made of polished kukui nuts, which are black and shiny. I liked them so much more than fresh flower leis as a) these last! and b) flower leis make me itch. Check-in was a breeze. They upgraded us from a standard king room to a pool view king room, and they gave us a coupon for free appetizers at their lounge for happy hour to celebrate our anniversary. Sadly we did not use these as were weren't really around during happy hour. The funny thing about this hotel is that the Lobby is located on the 6th floor since it's set against a cliff, and there are guest rooms on the floors above and below, so even though we were staying on the 5th floor, we would have to press the down arrow for the elevator. It could get confusing but you figure it out pretty quickly. The gym is on the lobby level, and the spa is on the 4th floor. The pools and ground/beach access is via the 1st floor, although you can technically walk down the stairs from the spa to the pool area pretty quickly. Our room, 2517, was nicely appointed, about slightly larger than a standard king hotel room, and it had hardwood floors which I loved. The bathroom is huge and has a soaking tub, separate toilet and shower stall. The shower was small though. The hotel recently underwent a renovation so you can tell that things were nice and new although the building itself is old. The renovationed decor was very modern but still kept a Hawaiian/Polynesian vibe to it, especially in the artwork used throughout the hotel and rooms. The room came with an empty fridge which was great, flat screen tv, dvd player, 2 robes, coffee maker, and regular toiletries you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. (they were all ritz carlton brand and smelled kinda like a spiced latte, I didn't care for it too much but we brought our own stuff anyways). The pool is nice and large, with 3 \"levels\", a kiddie pool, and 2 jacuzzis. The only drawback is that the main towel kiosk is located on one side of the pool and you'd have to walk around the 3 levels just to get to it if you happened to be on the opposite side. Sometimes they would leave clean towels on an empty stall on the other side but I only saw it in the mornings. There are covered cabanas you can rent for the day (not sure how much it was), and spa cabanas also line the pool area in case you'd like an outdoor massage. There was never any problem finding pool chairs at all. The beach at the Ritz is great for surfing and boogie boarding, the waves are very large. If you are not a good swimmer, I woudl think it's kind of scary. It was definitely not a \"snorkeling\" beach. It makes for great pictures though! If you walk down past the pool and swing left through the golf course, and go towards the water, you will find an area known as \"Dragon's Teeth\". It's a bunch of jagged lava rock formations that you can take a short hike on and the waves from the ocean create these neat, but very large splashes on these rocks. I am not sure what the specific geological name for these are, but it was a lot of fun seeing how large and how high each wave was going to be. I recommend walking in something sturdier than flipflops since the rocks can be jagged and slippery, but it was pretty cool. Nopt for the faint of heart though. If you like tame tame water, I recommend driving down to Black Rock in Ka'anapali in front of the Sheraton, as there are a ton of fish, sea turtles, etc over there. However there are a lot of tourists snorkeling so it can get annoying. The areas at the Ritz Carlton were never crowded. Breakfast buffet was good each day. Had a nice selection of stuff, and you can order eggs benedict or coconut mac nut pancakes to order. There was an omelet station, breads, cereals, fresh pastries, hot food stations that changed daily, and cheese, fruit, juice, etc. The hot foods would include portugese sausage, eggs, bacon, biscuits, and they would change it up each day. The papaya there was sooo good! Eat it with a twist of fresh lime! We didn't try other restaurants in the hotel, but we did drive a bit further down the road in the Kapalua resort to go to Merriman's, which is a restaurant by the water, food was very very good, although service was a little slow, but we didnt' mind. However, they thought it was too slow so they took the 2 entrees off our bill! that was 100 bucks off! It was super nice of them, and we were not expecting it at all. I highly recommened Merriman's! I went to the Wailua spa for a facial and massage since we had the 100 dollar credit. It was wonderful. They use eminence products which are divine and smell amazing. It's expensive, but the credit made it worth the money. If I didn't have a credit I might have just gotten 1 treatment. I got the berries and cheeries facial and the stuff smells sooo good. I have to buy me some of their products! The spa changing room has all the ameneties you need. They have an all-female steam, sauna and jacuzzi. There is also a shared jacuzzi in the waiting area but you need your bathing suit for that. Overall, an amazing stay at the Ritz. Service was amazing but not in your face. The only thing is that it's a bit secluded and far from other areas but I think people go there for that reason. It's only about 20 minutes from Lahaina though so we went there for dinner twice. It is pretty far from Haleakala Crater and Hana so if you plan on doing those sights, you might want to stay closer to Kihei or Paia for a few nights and then a few nights on West Maui, which is what we did. I'm glad we did this as we could just spend the few days we had in Kapalua relaxing! p.s. the Honolua Store across the street sells cheap breakfasts, tasty plate lunches, picnic supplies, groceries, and other sundries in case you wanted something lo-key and casual and not $$$.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel shame about the beds\u201d", "Author": "EmmCeeAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR48761736", "Content": "We spent 6 nights at The Ritz.

Prior to our trip, we were going back and forth between the Ritz, Four Seasons, and the Fairmont. We decided to settle on the Ritz since they were offering us \"Club Level\" access to their lounge for free drinks, snacks, etc throughout our trip. A few weeks before we left, the Ritz notified us that they were eliminating the club level since the resort goes through a slow period during the months of October and November. This almost caused us to change hotels but the Ritz came through by upgrading us to a 900 SF room with a kitchen (refrigerator, garbage disposal, microwave, sink, dishwasher), family room (Plasma tvs with DVD players), two balconies, full bedroom and bathroom (shower, tub, and seperate toilet). They also reduced our hotel rate by $1,500 and gave us a $500 resort credit. The hotel is located in Kapalua which is roughly 20 minutes away from Lahaina (main downtown area), 15 minutes from Ka'anapali (shopping, restaurants, hotels), and an hour from the Wailea and airport area. The location is somewhat a plus and a minus. You are nice and close to Lahaina and Ka'anapali which is where we spent a majority of our time. However, it is really far from Wailea (we never even made it there) and ways from the start of the road to Hana, Haleakala National Park, and airport. We had a car and managed to get place to place with no problem. What the hotel lacks in location, they pick up in being a beautiful secluded resort. The resort is absolutely huge! You enter by driving in through a private drive to the hotel and pass by their exclusive golf academy/training center, and one of their golf courses. The hotel is extremely clean and very modern. The hotel staff is great and the pool and restaurants are amazing. After reading the reviews, it appears most people complain about two things: the cost of Maui and the location of the beach at the Ritz. To be honest, my wife and I did not find Maui to be all that unreasonable. If you are from a major city (NYC, Chicago, LA) you will find the resort and dinner prices to be similar to a nice evening in the city. We stopped at a store and packed our room with some snacks, beer, and wine and that saved us a few bucks. You can also use the \"Corner Store\" which is located on the grounds to pick up some items. The store has a full grocery area, coffee bar and snack shop. The prices were the most reasonable of anything we encountered. As for the beach, it is set away from the pool and a short walk down a hill. However, once you arrive it is essentially private and remote from everything. It's not crowded and is almost like your own private beach. Overall, we loved the Ritz and would stay again. On a return visit we might visit Wailea since we never visited that area of the island and it is home to some nice resorts. As for Maui, the food is unbelievable on the entire island. We are from Chicago and were blown away by how good everything was. We loved the burgers, fish, and fresh vegetables. Must stops are as follows: - Mama's Fish House - Lahaina Grill ... and some other good places we hit included: - Basil Tomato - Hula Grill As for activities, the road to Hana is not as great as we envisioned. It's essentially a long drive on winding roads with some stops along the way. I highly suggest renting a Jeep Wrangler. Not the type of trip you want to do in a Mustang or rag top. We enjoyed the ride down the Volcano, surf lessons in Ka'anapali (I suggest a private lesson), and the Old Lahaina Luau. I didn't get to play any golf due to two stress fractures in my foot. P.S. If you choose to do the sunrise Volcano bike road I highly suggest bringing ample clothes to watch the sun come up. It was like a Chicago winter on top of the mountain.

I would suggest if you are on a budget going down to the Honolua Bay general store and stocking up on snacks and groceries. Breakfast for the two of us there in the hotel was about $65 a morning. Granted to can have just about anything your hearts desire for breakfast, but the general store made a mighty fine breakfast for us regular humans and it was under $10 ea.

We're not talking a light breeze, we're talking about winds that made it impossible to sit by the pool so if you are people that want to sit by the pool at your hotel you should not stay here. I found the restaurants to be pretty poor which isn't surprising for hotel restaurants but disappointing nonetheless. Kai was bland. The quality of the fish was only ok, and the menu was limited with no inventive rolls to speak of. The brunch at the Terrace restaurant was overall quite good, but there were little fruit flies over everything which shouldn't occur at a top line restaurant. Finally the service. This is what I was most disappointed with since this is what the Ritz is known for. No one went out of their way. We asked for good restaurant recommendations and their only suggestions were on property which is pretty frustrating. We got water the first day and then no water the rest of the time there, when we asked the front desk why they said the policy was to only provide it upon request.

Upon arrival we were given lei necklaces and upgraded to an ocean facing room on the ground floor which had a patio and looked out at the ocean and pool. The room was very nice and comfortable. Only downside was that we were on the ground floor so we could not leave our curtains open to the wonderful natural sunlight. Our package included the breakfast buffet and I highly recommend you getting this included in your package if possible. Without the deal, breakfast buffet at the hotel for 2 people was approximately $70 per day. We found the staff to be incredibly accomodating and kind. One thing is be sure to check your bill at the end of the stay. My husband had ordered a rose petal turn down service with champagne and strawberries, but unfortunately they forgot the roses! I saw that they had charged us for the roses anyway, and once we let the front desk know they were very apologetic and fixed the issue immediately. We did not really hold back on this trip given that it was our honeymoon so we ended up visiting the spa at the Ritz twice. The service and amenities were wonderful. We got a couples massage in a private cabana which was really relaxing - the blinds were opened so you could hear/smell the ocean. Once you book a service at the spa you have access to their steam room, sauna, hot tub and relaxation rooms. The spa staff was very friendly/knowledgable and the facilities were very clean. My husband got very burned the first day we were in Hawaii and he got an aloe wrap on our first visit, which really helped calm his skin. They also gave us a container of the aloe scrub for him to use the rest of the week. The beach by the Ritz is great because it was beautiful and was not crowded or dirty. My husband and I are pool people so we spent most of the time by the pool which was fantastic! The Ritz also offers programs for guests. For example they have the Jean-Michel Cousteau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ambassadors of the Environment program which allows guests to explore the natural beauties of Maui (snorkeling, hiking, etc.) with the guidance of experts. I think it also highlights the conservation efforts of the hotel which was an added bonus. We were able to to tour the vegetable gardens at the Ritz and see how many of the produce used in their restaurants are grown on site. The experience was education and it was very interesting to see how the Ritz was able to cultivate empty land and put it to good use. The only downside of the Ritz is that it is a little further away on the island, but we really enjoyed that it was a bit secluded and we had rented a car so we were not too concerned. Additionally, the Ritz is about a 10 minute drive from Lahaina which is a cute town with a ton of shops and great restaurants.

When we got to our room, were we treated to a nice surprise. We were upgraded from a Terrace Room to a Pool/Partial Ocean View room in the Residence Tower. It was basically a 1 bedroom suite!

It felt like something was missing. Nice Gym! For light meals, snacks ... I suggest you take a 2 min walk and visit the Honolua Store. Best Local Food we had on the Island. A lot better and fresher than Aloha Mixed Plate and a lot tastier than Okazuya & Deli Honokowai. Breakfast was around $5-$7, Lunch $6-$9. This is where the locals go.

The Ritz is set in the well manicured Kapalua resort development. The grounds are lush and beautiful. Many tropical plants and flowers. There are beautiful trees throughout the property. Here are some of my thoughts. 1. Many people have remarked on the wind on this part of the island. Kapalua is windy. It starts as a breeze in the morning and then really kicks up. I found the wind rather refreshing. It kept the humid, heat at bay. 2. Kapalua was wonderful. Lush, beautifully maintained, and peaceful. I didn't mind that it was a bit of drive from the other resort areas. We came to Maui to get away from it all. 3. Make use of the General Store. The food was good and well priced! Nothing like spam masubi in the morning. 4. The food is great but expensive. Eat at Kai. Try the macadamia pancakes at the Terrace. (Better than at the Gazebo, but more than twice the price!) Merriman's was also tasty and had a great location. 5. Service. Service was inconsistent. Great in some areas and not five star in others. For example, at the pool area, there were many occasions when we had to set up our own chairs. This never happens at the Four Seasons where they would bend over backwards for you. But, then again they did send up some complimentary chocolates to our room. The resort may be understaffed. You need to seek out the right staff and be sure to tip so that you are on the radar! 6. Rooms-We stayed in a residential suite. What can I say? Truly top notch-Sub-zero pull out fridge and freezer, Villeroy and Bock dinnerware, Henkels knives. Bed was very comfortable. No complaints whatsoever. 7. Spa- My wife had a spa treatment of a massage and body scrub. The spa itself is top notch-lots of special extras like heated spa robes, eucalyptus spa room. But the actual treatment itself was somewhat lacking. You would expect more from a $230 treatment. 8. Fitness center-Very nice with top of the line equipment and a gorgeous view of the pool area. 9. The Beach. There was a shore break surf warning everyday but if you swam out beyond the shore break, the ocean was lovely. All in all, this is a beautiful resort with many wonderful things to offer.

We also stayed at the Four Seasons for a longer duration, and as many people staying at this type of hotel are also looking at the Four Seasons, this might be a good review for you as a means of comparison. I'll start by reviewing the hotels on its on merits: 1) The price is pretty good. USE YOUR AAA CARD. Big discounts (enter AAA in the promo code). You can get a AAA card for about $20. The savings for our regular room were about $50 a night. We ended up paying $255 a night after taxes for their least expensive room. 2) The rooms are VERY well appointed. All marble/granite bathrooms, large flat panel TVs, nice hardwood floors, and very comfortable beds. We actually got upgraded to a garden view Residential Suite (seems to happen a lot at this hotel). REALLY NICE. 1000 sq foot room, with an extra flat panel, large table, drawer style dish washer and refrigerator. I saw the regular rooms and also thought we would have been very satusfied had we not been upgraded. The tub in our room was regular, with no jets. 3) Staff was very friendly. We made friends with one of the concierge's at the hotel that made our stay very enjoyable. I highly recommend calling the concierge before you arrive, get acquainted and be very nice to them, and they will make your stay much better. They should be the people you tip the largest of all when you leave. 4) The reason I gave this hotel four stars and not five really has a lot to do with the beach service. There really isnt any. You stop by a towel stand on your way to their nice but small beach, and thats about it. No chairs available, no umbrella. When you come to Hawaii you want to be able to spend some time watching the ocean, but most of us dont want to be cooked. Not having chairs and umbrellas available means a lot less time by the ocean. We also found out that they once offered snorkel equipment, but stopped when the economy got tough. A real bummer. They have a shuttle the the beach next to them that rents scuba gear, but I hate having to go off property for something like that. The pool is very nice, but again, lack of umbrellas unless you want to plow down $250 a day for a cabana is a big turn off. 5) Weather: I need to note that this location seems to be particularly windy. VERY windy. It takes some getting use to. The clouds that form around this hotel also seem to be threatening rain, but rarely do. For this reason, if you plan on wanting to sit by the pool and the beach to get tanned, the wind and sky conditions could prove challenging. 6) Location: There are some very cool things to do in this part of the island. If you keep driving up 30 past the hotel, there are some awesome snorkeling beaches, and this one place just before 30 turns into 340 (a glorified one lane road) at the top of a cliff that you can climb down the side of this cliff and jump in these awesome tide pools. The waves crash all around the volcanic rock and splash water into this pool area. Definitely worth going down. If you continue on 340 (tight road), you will get to a little village where they sell the best banana bread I've ever had. We were advised to stop when you get to the art gallary (15 mins past the village) and come back, and the road gets even worse, and the natives arent particularly nice. There is some golf in the area, a disc golf course, zip lining, and tons of other activities in the Kapaula Adventure Center just up the road from the hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. For our level of activity, this was the correct stay. The area has some very cool things to do in it, but we would have gotten bored if we would have stayed there anymore than 5 nights. Direct Comparison to the Four Seasons on Maui: 1) The Ritz is half the price of comparable rooms at the Four Seasons. We liked our room much better (furnishings and overall room feel) at the Ritz 2) We were not upgraded at the Four Seasons 3) The Ritz has a resort fee of $20 a day, and the Four Seasons has none 4) The Ritz has plenty of self parking. If the Four Seasons has self parking, I didnt see it, and we had to use their valet ($20 a night) 5) The availablity of inexpensive food doesnt really exist at either hotel. 6) The pools at the Four Seasons have free cabanas (very nice) where the Ritz has only cabanas that cost $250 a day. 7) The beach at the Four Seasons has complete service (minus alcohol) including free umbrella/chair/table setup where the Ritz only has a towel service 8) The Four Seasons has free snorkel gear (first hour) when the Ritz has none on site. The snorkel site at the Four Seasons is top notch when the site near the Ritz is not very good. 9) Both hotels had excellent concierge service 10) The Ritz has a much bigger pool than the Four Seasons, however the Four Seasons has a small exclusive pool available only to adults (called the Serenity pool) 11) The Ritz includes Wireless access when the Four Seasons charges another $10 a day for access (that really made me angry at over $500 a night). 12) The Ritz has much more abundant sporting courts (including a full sized basketball court and at least 4 tennis courts). The Four Seaons has two tennis courts (synthetic grass which is nice) and a ball machine you can rent. 13) Beach access is a walk with the Ritz, when it is close at the Four Seasons 14) More things to do within closer proximity of Four Seasons compared to Ritz 15) The Four Seasons has a cool game room with shuffleboard/ping pong/pool tables/xbox 360s. Super nice. And the gym they have is also very very nice equipment. I cant really compare this to the Ritz, as I didnt see any of this on the property. In summary, we spent 3 nights at the Ritz and 5 nights at the Four Seasons. I feel like we saw the entire island this way. If I were going to advise people on their stay, then I would recommend a similar configuration on their stay. The Ritz would have gotten 5 stars with better beach and pool side service. Otherwise, top notch.

When we first checked in, we kept comparing it to the Four Seasons Wailea which we had been to twice before. The rooms at the Four Seasons are more spacious and the beach is better and there is more access to shade (umbrellas) at the pool and beach there. However, once we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite and we mellowed out, we really came to love the area. It is more removed than staying at other areas of the island but you really feel like you are away from all the hustle bustle which we liked. If we wanted the action, we drove to Kaanapali which was only 10 mins. down the road. Definitely try Merriman's at sunset. Very pricy but worth the wonderful view at dinner. The views and landscape on this part of the island were so beautiful. Not typical because there are a lot of pine trees but the feeling was very rustic and green. We don't recommed DT Fleming beach because it was rough and windy. Try Kapalua Bay - the hotel provides a shuttle and you can rent chairs and umbrellas there. The lack of shade by the pool was likely due to the wind - umbrellas would surely be blown away. Although the wind kept things cool, my kids were sunburned and couldn't escape the sun so we had to go in from the pool early for a few days. We loved the General Store for morning coffee and breakfast. So quaint and reasonably priced. All in all, we came to love the resort - we felt away from it all, the service was great, room was clean and beautiful, and the scenery breathtaking!", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Van Nuys", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Stay\u201d", "Author": "sundance59", "ReviewID": "UR39410092", "Content": "This is a very good resort.

This is one of the lowest-rated Ritz Carlton properties in the world. As I have had many previous positive experiences with the Ritz, I will try to be as fair as possible when describing our stay at Kapalua to future travelers. I don't normally write reviews, however, I was so disappointed by our experience that I felt compelled to fill in others of what to expect from this property. From my personal experience, I agree with the low ratings for the following reasons: - When we arrived at the front desk, our first impression was disappointing at best. The staff was untrained to the point of absurdity. The front desk attendant took a personal phone call while checking us in. The manager, Vany, was dismissive to the point of being insulting. They gave us conflicting information on pricing of club level access, and in the end, they decided their club level access was booked until December, according to Vany. Right....we checked on our computer once we settled in, and surpise, surprise, club level access was available online....hmmm. - The ocean view suite that we booked was a room that faced a mountain with an ominous cloud hovering over it all day. About one quarter of the resort faces this mountain and you can only see the ocean by standing on the most outward corner of the lanai. If you do decide to book here, please avoid odd numbers in the residential wing, as it will look onto Mordor (please reference Lord of the Rings if unfamiliar.) We truly questioned how such a depressing view could exist on Maui. I went back to the front desk to ask for an ocean view suite with a view of AT LEAST the pool, and they said they were completely booked. Uggh...we suffered for a few more hours and went back to the front desk to speak with a new attendant. She must have liked us, because she was able to find an ocean view suite with a pool AND ocean view for us the next day. -Once we arrived in our new room, we were much happier with our view. No longer depressed, we made our way to the beach. It is a beautiful beach, however, there is no food or drink service available on or near the beach. (Please note: They do offer food and drink service at the pool.) - We eventually made our way to the bar and were again surprised by the lack of \"Ritz Carlton\" service. The bartender was stressed out and asked \"Can I help you?\" in a tone that implied anything but....The wait staff seemed stressed and not so friendly. And in response to another reviewer regarding tips improving service, we are generous tippers (20-35%) and this did not help... - At other Ritz properties, we have always been greeted by name, and that did not happen here EXCEPT for the Terrace Restaurant for breakfast. They provided GREAT service and reminded us of what \"Ritz\" service means...I know that sounds a bit ridiculous, however, when you spend money on a five star hotel, you expect five star service. - The location can be considered good or bad depending on what you like to do. If you plan to stay at the resort for the extent of your stay, then it will work well for you. The food at the resort is good, a bit over-priced, but reasonably so. If you like to go to different restaurants throughout your stay, it may not be the best location. Most restaurants are a 15 minute to 1 hour drive, and that can be really expensive if you plan to take a cab. If you drive, obviously, you cannot have more than a drink or two...We took a cab from Kapalua to Lahaina (about 15-20 minutes) and it was $45 each way. In essence, we paid $90 to have dinner outside of the resort. It can get very expensive.... Positives - The grounds are beautiful and well-maintained. The rooms are nicely appointed and clean. - There is a GREAT sushi bar called Sansei within walking distance of the Ritz. It is excellent!!! - The beach is amazing! - Nice fitness center.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA Class Act In Maui\u201d", "Author": "hdblue", "ReviewID": "UR39192983", "Content": "My wife and I recently spend four nights at the Ritz in Maui for our vacation. The hotel absolutely lived up to expectations. The service was first rate. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and not the fake smle type friendly, it is obvious that everyone enjoys what they do an they take care of the customers very well. Our room was fantastic. We booked a residential suite and its was comfortable, classy and functional. The room like the entire hotel has an authentic hawaian feel to it. The suite has a wonderful meeting table next to the living room that is perfect for gathering and meeting after a day at the beach. The living room and bedroom both have large screen flat screen tv's after your done outside. The living room has a couch and chair and there is a balcony off both the living room and balcony to relax on. I truely enjoyed the balcony off the living room with a wicker love seat where you can unwind while listening to the ocean. The bathroom is huge and the bed is fantastic. The climiate control works great, keeps everything cool. The three terrace pools are wonderful. There is never a fight for a chair, always plenty available. Most of the kids stay at the other resorts so the pool isn't packed with them. The attendants provide you towels and drink when you need them. I read other reviews about the walk to the beach, I really don't know what the big deal is. It is a five minute walk down the hill where you get to really enjoy the hotel landscape on the way to the beach. It is NOT a five mile hike. The beach is wonderful, clean and there is plenty of space for you to lay your claim on your own spot. We only ate breakfast at the hotel but it was wonderful and yes, it was very expensive. From what I found though, everything on Maui is very expensive so you just kind of plan on it. The breakfast buffet is awesome though and I LOVE the coffee (kona) so much that I brought a couple of bags back with me. Overall, this is one of the best vacations I have had in a long time.

We read many reviews on Trip Advisor for the top resorts in Maui, and I must say, not all of the reviews are accurate. From the moment we walked in, we absolutely enjoyed the pampering provided by our courteous and respectful staff. I called ahead to have some roses and champagne waiting for us on arrival, as it was our honeymoon, and I wanted my wife to feel like the princess that she is. The Ritz, knowing of our celebration, upgraded us to an amazing ocean view suite on the top floor. Amazing. They also decorated our room with a heart of local flowers with a box of chocolates placed in the center. Lovely and thoughtful. Every member of the Ritz staff, from Steve the valet, to Ryan the pool concierge, to Maria the housekeeper, treated my wife and I to the highest levels of customer service imaginable. Precisely what you expect from a Ritz property. As such, I must strongly disagree with any negative posts on this site, and give my highest recommendation to anyone who is considering this property and appreciates five-star service in paradise. (As a reminder, tipping goes a long way in properties such as this, and frankly, is par for the proverbial course. Perhaps the detractors do not understand this.) Our only critique of this property is that during our stay, there were way too many children in the pool, and it made for a bit of a distraction while trying to rest. Although uncharacteristic of the Ritz brand, we attribute that to the new residential properties for sale at the property. Perhaps a rule of no children in the upper tier pool should be considered by management. In summation, my wife and I are avid travelers who have experienced some of the greatest properties in the world, and we are considering purchasing a property at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua to visit annually.

Both this resort - and the Feast at LeLe - were absolutely perfect - a sentiment that seems to vary with some travellers met with misfortune. One thing is for sure about a lot of the negative comments on the Ritz the Resort has absolutely nothing to do with - the weather and the public beaches. It is astounding to me how many of the complainers stumble onto an island and a Resort without having done any research whatsoever on the destination - you know what glad the sand blew in your face at DT because your negativity is not what this place is about in any shape or form. Go to Long Drug and by a couple chairs and a cooler - rent a car because yes you are in Kapalua and yes Lahaina is all of 10 minutes away - and a beautiful drive as well - how can you COMPLAIN about this fact???!!!! Hilarious. And yes it is WINDY in Kapalua - deal with it! Kapalua is also isolated and lush with greenery and trees imported to the island - it you want commercially manicured landscaping sure go to Wailea where they pack the hotels onto small sites and on top of each other - if that is to your preference you aren't going to fare well in Kapalua. We spent time at Napili and Kapalua Bay beaches - both beautiful and very calm - a totally different experience from DT yet only like a half mile apart - again I just get some people! As to the complaints about service - too bad because we had a great time there as well - again pick up the phone and make contact with the Concierge before you go - we established a wonderful relationship with Kristine who proved to do a phenomenal job - but it didn't stop there - the entire door and bell staff were awesome - they would bend over backwards for you - and they are front and center so not sure how you miss that - housekeeping was fine/thorough and turndown was missed one night even after we called but on this I wasn't too concerned - again if you are having a great time the fact that your towels were not picked up in the eve isn't that big of a deal. Back to Kristine she introduced us to Island nanny and the Owner recommended Leslie as our babysitter for our ten year old boy - she was absolutely phenomenal and we affiliate her with the overall service of the Resort and in Kapalua. Thanks Leslie!!!!! We found room service exceptional and consistent - we would order for breakfast every day - because we don't like QUEUES! Jeez some people.........We thought the sushi restaurant was superb - the Chef has been there for years and does a great job - again if you want hordes of people and a \"scene\" go to Sansei - for us Kai was perfect. We didn't eat at the Terrace and Banyan Tree was good if not a bit disappointing. We found the service at the pool fine - again a bit busy but good for them - we rented the cabanas because for me we are on VACATION so I am not getting hung up on things - if you want quality I have learned sometimes that costs a little jack. We found the food and beverages quite good at the pool. The Beach House restaurant was also wonderful. Both my wife and I had treatments at the Spa - I ended up going back for a second message which I odn't normally do - it was very well designed adn the service excellent. Finally I would like to extend kudos to Lee at the Golf Academy - he was great in facilitating lessons for our boy and getting some good tee time on the Bay Course - he had a blast and the service outstanding. And one more comment on service - in case you haven't picked up a paper in the last year we are in a very down economy - I read in the local paper this is the worst summer for tourism in Hawaii since reporting started in 1987 - so yes maybe again it isn't the end of the world if your tv doesn't get fixed expeditiously - perhaps that was a message from above that you shouldn't be watching television in such a wonderful place. So the hotel obvioulsy is trying to make due - the Expedia crowd was certainly in evidence and having that many transient guests in that large of a facility pushes it to its seams. Again my suggestion on service is drink a mai tai and chill. What I also cannot understand the unwillingness to go out and explore - we aren't huge on that front but did at least venture out to what Kapalua has to offer - we found the Pineapple Grill very good and Meriman's exceptional - definitely need to book a 6 or 6:15pm table to catch the sunset - just perfect. And as stated above - the Feast at LeLe was fantastic - the food while yes a lot! was very very good - they went to the trouble of grilling some chicken for our 10 year old so don't get the complaints on that - anyway what was totally unexpected was the quality of the dancers - just great - all in all a wonderful evening. So in summary we had an exceptional visit to Maui, Kapalua and the Ritz-Carlton. I have stayed at Four Seasons around the wolrd and am a frequest visitor of One and Only's Palmilla in Cabo - I would rate this experience - in its totality - as one of the best family trips we have ever had. From the snorkeling to the natural beauty - to the golf to the beaches to the pool - we were completely immersed and relaxed.

The concierge (Leslie) and other employees on the club level welcomed us daily with genuine smile's and interest in making our trip unforgettable. Leslie helped us select two off site free snorkel areas that were amazing. It was like snorkeling in an aquarium. We did take a fun boat trip to Molokini , but felt the best snorkeling was at kapalua beach. The hotel van provides a free shuttle or you can walk the 1.7 miles along the coastal trail. Leslie also provided us with great advice and lent us a guided CD and cooler to use for the drive to Hana. The trip/drive to Hana is currently best to do on the weekends due to road construction. We also did the sunrise bike tour down Haleakala with \"Cruiser Phil's\" . It was fun and we both felt very safe with our guides ( Lisa and Jay).

Great food and bar/wine selections along with amazing sunset views. Prices were very good. Lahaina also has very impressive art galleries and cool little shops. Tips- bring or rent snorkel gear. Pull over and hop in the water when you notice other swimmers or snorkel boats in the area( Honolua bay). Drive around and enjoy other areas of the island. Each area is a little different. No need to overpack, we lived in bathing suits, cover-ups, flip flops , and casual wear. All the dressier evening wear came home never being worn.

Here are our pro's and con's from our stay. Pro's Rooms: Were large, well decorated and well maintained. We didn't have an ocean view room, but had a view of the golf course and the ocean nevertheless. Rooms have small fridge, coffee maker and decent sized balcony. Views: Hotel is situated on a hill--lobby, pool and most rooms have fantastic views. Aesthetic: Decor is great, landscaping, furnishings, etc. all well maintained and attractive. Service: Staff was all very friendly and helpful. Every staff member passing in the hall makes a point to say \"aloha\" and smile. Waiters at pool, valets, etc. were all prompt and friendly, but not intrusive. Beautiful beach: Short walk from the hotel, down the hill is DT Fleming Beach Park. Great beach; it's public, so no lounge chairs or waiters on the beach, but a gorgeous large beach. Can get windy in the afternoon though. Family Friendly: Fair number of families with children (but not clearly not overrun with kids); small kiddie pool with waterfall that was perfect for toddlers and a small playground. Activities: Decent, well maintained gym, tennis courts and a basketball court. Guests: Not overcrowded when we visited. Hotel guests were a mix of families and couples, some younger, some older. Most guests were pretty laid back--no loud or rude complainers, cell phone yakkers, screaming kids, etc. Wouldn't recommend it for singles though. Value: Overall, I thought this was the most important since we got a great deal on our room, basically paying less than what I've paid to stay at a Marriott or equivalent on the mainland. Cons: Food prices: It's tough to justify $40 entrees when family dining and there weren't any other options at the hotel. Not to fear though since there are a few options nearby and Lahaina was only about 15 minutes away. The food is supposed to be great, but we never ate at the hotel. My recommendation for the hotel is to leave the expensive places as is, but offer a cheaper option at the Beach House (the more casual place by the water). The Beach House was only open for lunch and then only offered $17 burgers and sandwiches. Drink prices were actually not that bad--less than $5 for a beer and $8 for a mixed drink or $12 for a \"specialty cocktail\". Distance to the beach: The hotel is a few hundred yards up the hill from the beach, so there's a little bit of a walk. There's a long golf cart to take you up and back. It's an easy walk so you don't really need it. I actually liked not being right on the beach since you had better views. Not much around: The RC is at the tip of Maui and \"civilization\" runs out just up the road. It's also pretty quiet at night. That being said, it's not that far to drive into Lahaina for the night and there's lots of places to eat, bars, etc. there. Again, this wasn't really a \"con\" for us since we enjoyed being away from the crowds--especially after walking around Kaanapali for a bit. Overall, I would say it was a great place to stay. I agree with the other reviewers who said that it is not quite 5-star, solely because of the really small things--like no little chocolate on your pillow, etc. If you want to pay another $200 a night or more for that, good for you. If I had paid top price for the room, maybe I would think differently, but having gotten a good rate, I was quite happy and would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Collins, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property, some improvements needed\u201d", "Author": "KKDFCARLSON", "ReviewID": "UR35975747", "Content": "Just returned from 7 nights at the Ritz. The property is beautiful and the proximity to great snorkeling a plus. We stayed in a residence suite and the extra space was terrific as was having the freezer/fridge drawers. Have stayed at the Hyatt and the Fairmont on Maui and would rate the Ritz better than both but it is a very different experience. Also would not consider this Ritz on par with the Atlanta or San Francisco Ritz that I have stayed at in the past. If you are looking for non- stop activities the Ritz would not be the best choice. If you are looking to relax in an amazing setting then this is the place. Comments on other reviews about the valet parking (don't bother for the cost), the lack of service at turn down and the small details in housekeeping and maintainence are all true. Ritz needs to elevate its game if they really want to be a 5 star hotel. The staff is very eager to please and friendly however. Kapalua is so relaxing, away from the crowds and plenty of room to get away from every one and every thing. If you are looking for the very best resort in Hawaii- consider the Four Season on the Big Island- truly the best resort I have ever stayed at. Pros: Location, larger rooms (residence suites), friendly service, Excellent food at Kai and the Terrance and the Beach House. Cons: Small details in service, housekeeping and maintaince need to be improved for this to be a true 5 star experience.

We stayed 6 nights at the Ritz and 3 nights at Hotel Hana Maui (see review posted there). The Ritz was fantastic! We enjoyed an Ocean View Club Level Room for our stay. If you are able, I highly recommend staying in the Club Level. Not only are the staff members helpful and cheery everyday, but the food and beverage services received with this package make the trip 10 times better! From 8:00am to 8:00pm, you enjoy drinks - including cocktails - each day in the lounge. They have 5 food presentations each day: breakfast, lunch snacks, afternoon tea, dinner apps, and dessert. Aside from the food, the pool and beach facilities are great. The pool staff, especially Anthony, were very accomodating and non-intrusive. They came around often to check on drink orders or food/snack needs. Around noon, an attendant comes around with cold fruit on a platter to cool you off. Very nice indeed. So the weather... maybe we just had fantastic weather, but it was sunny and warm everyday. It did rain over night once, but as we understand it, it rained elsewhere on the island as well. There is a breeze but for us, we enjoyed it. Otherwise it would have been WAY TOO HOT. The Ritz is the place to go if you want to escape from the chaos of your daily life. If you want to relax and unwind. I would stay here again and again!

We stayed in both a deluxe room with a great view and a residential suite. I will start this review with the only con that I have and that is in the deluxe room if it has an adjoining room it can be noisy and you can hear the room next to you. That said, we had a very loud party next to us and the hotel took care of it right away. The room itself is very nice and would have been perfect but for the adjoining room. The suite, however, was unbelivable - I highly recommend the upgrade as it is not that much more expenisve. The hotel grounds are the best on Maui, very expansive and well kept. It was fun just to walk around and soak up the place. The pool is was gorgegous and seemed to be well kept, I will admit that other than walking around the pool I did not spend much time there as I have a pool at home and came for the ocean. DT Fleming beach was a lot of fun and was never crowded like K-ali and Wailea. It was clean and the beachhouse is right there for a beer and food. Another interesting item was the Ambassdors of the Earth program. I must admit I was really surprised by this program and they haves some really unique and interesting programs that I highly recommend. We ate at several of the restaurants at the RC and each of them was great. I really didn't think they were that expensive as some people have said. Kapalua itself if great, there are some really good restaruants - pineapple grill, sansei, honula store for lunch etc. Not to mention gorgeous views all over the place. The service at the RC was great especially the valet. They know the island and can give you great tips on where to eat and what to do, take advantage of their knowledge. The coincerage was good and provided excellent service. I agree with previous posters in that the service is just right if you want more service they will serve you or if you want to be left alone in a tropical island they will do that. I higly recommend the RC and can't wait to go back next year.", "Date": "July 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gaithersburg, MD", "Title": "\u201cKapalua is the way to go\u201d", "Author": "MD4now", "ReviewID": "UR35646205", "Content": "Honestly, I really think the internet is great for people who love to gripe about everything. My Wife and I recently stayed here for our honeymoon and were absolutely floored by the Ritz. I was also floored by going back and looking at the reviews that I had read prior to our arrival in Maui, toilet paper complaints, really? We checked in and I grabbed a Kleenex and it was the last one, so I called housekeeping and I swear thirty seconds after I hung up the phone, a knock at the door and Voila, two boxes of Kleenex from a happy member of the Ritz staff was waiting outside the door. The Kapalua area of Maui is absolutely wonderful and the Ritz got the gold when they purchased that property years ago: quiet, secluded, scenic, golf, beach, sun, the views from the restaurants and grounds of the hotel, amazing. (Also for golfers they have been running special of all you can golf for like 400$ for 5 days, if you are an avid golfer take advantage, plus guests get free club rentals). Take a walk down by the chapel near the shoreline of the Ritz and you can walk on ancient harden lava rock right out side the hotel, plus take in some great scenery. We could not have been happier with the room and hotel. I thought the staff went out of their way to engage you if you wanted but also could tell when you wanted to be left alone. We didn't even have a suite or club level room and ours was wonderful, at first I was a little leary because we faced the golf course to the west but every evening getting to sit on the Lanai and watch the sun set behind Molokai island made it worth it. Plus the added bonus of being on the opposite side of the pool means it is so quiet when you are on the Lanai. Actually everything about the Ritz was quiet and relaxing, we soaked up the sun everyday at the pool and beach and never once had an issue finding a chair or towels (granted tourism in Hawaii is down 50% so this is the year to go and avoid the crowds). And I am still a little confused how people who were there recently, as my wife and I were, could complain about lack of shade, first off: the pool area is surrounded by Palm trees and we actually were looking to find a non shady spot, second: it is a pool area??? if you needed shade try the lobby or your room...jeez Third: it is a tropical island in the middle of the Pacific, there was on and off cloud coverage that provided relief from the sun all day long. I almost thought it was too perfect. You would get a good 30 minutes of sun and then 15 minutes of shade to cool of for a few, that cycle would repeat all day long, throw in the occasional spritz of rain... perfect. The food and restaurants are pricey but it is the Ritz and it is Maui if you are looking for cheap hit Florida or Mexico, (I remember that being the biggest complaint that people had: Value) If you don't want resort fees, pricey menus and drink items, I believe there are cheaper hotels on the island, have at them. But after staying in K'pali area three years ago, which was nice, the Kapalua in the Ritz are in a league of their own. I would like to pass along the tip of stopping in at the Honolua Store adjacent from the Ritz for cheaper coffee, lunch, and snacks throughout the day. Many people suggested that and it is the way to go if you are concerned about money, (though if you are I am not sure why you are at the Ritz). Also up the road in Napali there was a grocery store, stock up on drinks and snacks there if you don't want to pay ritz prices. We did. And no one ever said a work about bringing drinks to the pool as long as they were not in a glass container. Obviously the normal people who stay at Ritz/Four Seasons type hotels are willing to pay up. While there we read an article that a certian supermodel pays 14k for a massage three times a week... I am actually still laughing at that one. But my point is that yes the Ritz is pricey but we had a wondeful time staying in a secluded area of Maui and feeling like a movie star with staff always calling you by your name etc. If you are budget driven stay elsewhere, if you want to splurge. Make your reservations now. Our only Cons regarding the Ritz were that for as much as you do pay I think they should be a bit more vigilant on fixing the pool chairs on a regular basis some would have issue staying put in the middle positions. Our Pros: Location, Pool, Room Comfort, Free WiFi, and FREE computer use in the business center for those doing Flight Check In and Boarding Pass printing, Free WSJ and Local Paper near Concierge, empty fridge that you can stock yourself or have them do it.

We had a living room, bedroom, 2 flat screens, ipod docking station, 2 lanais, etc. - Price was just right through Expedia. We paid $2,350 for our room, airfare, and car rental. - About 6 miles from Whaler's Village. This is a positive because I don't like staying where it's too crowded. - Kapalua beach was awesome. Negative: - Food and drinks are ridiculously expensive. We paid $57 for 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries, and one soda. - The attendants at the pool are not as attentive as I'm use to. - I'm not sure if this is a negative, but it does get windy at times during the day (not always).

A bit of a hike down as the hotel is set back but we liked having some room to roam and not being on a busy stip like Wailea or Kaanapali. Huge, manicured grounds and three pools with good service. Nice rooms, good service and variety in food at the hotel and all around the resort (basically a secluded neighbourhood with the Ritz, some private villas and golf courses). We loved Honolua Store, a casual and cheap option for lunches and snacks and Sansei for sushi! It's very close a to a bunch of hiking trails (West Maui Mountains not Haleakala) and secluded but still only a few minutes drive to Napili and about 15-20 to Lahaina. One downside is that Kapalua area has a distinctly higher chance of clouds and sometimes rain. I read the stats beforehand and it didn't really affect our trip but you will see that it can be cloudy at the Ritz and bright and sunny in Lahaina. - usually passed quickly and we didn't mind a bit of a breeze and shade but if you want non-stop sun, you should consider this. We also spent a lot of time away from the hotel during the day. Nice amenities in the room , very friendly staff, excellent gym (pretty spacious, clean, good equipment) and resort shuttle to take you around the grounds if you need it. It seemed kid friendly without being too busy or loud for couples or singles looking for relaxation and fun.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gilbert AZ", "Title": "\u201cSimply Wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "David E", "ReviewID": "UR31718736", "Content": "On Friday 5 June 09, we left Phoenix at 10:50 and arrived on Maui at about 1:55 local time (6 hours). We rented a convertible, but upon leaving the airport, the sun was so warm that we had to put the top up to shield us. It was a very beautiful drive to the hotel. The road was one lane for probably the majority of the 31 miles to the hotel. We took TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice and took the longer (in distance) southern route and skipped the alleged cliff driving. Steve welcomed us very warmly and normally on arrival. No drippy fawning stuff. I always feel sorry for the poor folks who are forced to do that. We skipped the $18 valet as we almost always do. In this case it would have been more ridiculous than usual since it was a very short walk from the parking area. In the few minutes it took me to park the car and walk the very short distance to the reception counter, my wife had us checked in. She was a little disappointed however for the lack of information. But we soon found out why. The receptionist motioned to a gentleman named Rob to pick up our bags and take us to our room. It took about 5 minutes to walk/elevate to our room and all the way there Rob gave us a load of information on the hotel, area and restaurants. He spent at least 5 minutes more after we got to our room rapid firing information to us and pointing out places to go/see/do. We are value oriented and not the Ritz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122y type and so we generally stay in above average accommodations on a good deal. Normally it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5 spot for bringing our bags up. Being that this is the Ritz, $10 seemed appropriate. But after getting such very good information (in fact I had to make myself stop asking questions so he would go, because I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure I could remember half of what he already told us) I began to wonder if $10 was enough. We are in room 2314, which is on the third floor, but from which we can step out on to the green at the 4th hole. Very cool since you normally get hurt if you step off the patio of the third floor. The room is beautiful and huge. Within the 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 entrance way there is a sitting bench on the left and then a large closet. On the right is a nice guest bathroom with a shower. The entrance way opens into a 21x16 well-appointed living room with everything you need including a 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat TV and an empty refrigerator - thankfully. If you have a laptop, bring an HDMI cable so you can hook it up to the TV. The 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 window/door gives you a great view and lights up the room. Then you enter into the large 18x16 bedroom through double glass doors with a large, beautiful and very comfortable bed, large nightstands and another 42 flat panel TV which sits on a large dresser; a sitting chair and table in the corner, and another 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 window/door which gives you a great view and lights up the room. Both rooms have a nice patio outside the door. Then through the bedroom entrance way to the bathroom is a large walk-in closet with an organizer and room for everything, and includes an ironing board and an iron. To the right is a sitting area with large desk and chair. Upon entrance to the bathroom is a large double sink counter. To the left behind a door is a large toilet area and to the right behind a door is a bathtub and a roomy 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shower. All furnishings appear to be authentic Hawaiian (not that I would have a clue). There is no hint of anything dirty, grimy, moldy, old or worn and no smells whatsoever. The ambience is pure Hawaiian comfort. We booked this room through Costco Travel. $2244 includes: $54 trip protection covering everything, 8 day rental of the convertible through Alamo, 5 nights in Garden View 1 bedroom suite, $500 hotel credit towards anything charged to the room.

Some real tips you can use. I have been reading the reviews on this property for about 6 months leading up to our vacation to the Ritz on May 14-19. Bottom line, very, very good. Property is clean, modern, quiet, full of amenities and the service is awesome. Here are a few tips: At check in they will upgrade you right away without asking if the hotel is not sold out, and from what I've been reading they rarely are. We had booked a standard deluxe garden view room, value $495 a night. Upon check in they said \"We have good news. We've put you in a deluxe 'ocean view' room\" value $625 a night for the same room, but just on the \"inside\" of the property overlooking pool. There really is no true \"ocean view\" as the whole hotel is set way back from the ocean. That sounded great to us, so I asked what it would take to upgraded even further, say, to a suite. Well, they are obviously ready for this conversation with all of their guests because the gal checking us in pulled out this nifty price chart for all rooms. She pointed to our \"new\" upgraded room and the price was $625 a night. If we wanted to upgrade further we would have to pay the difference for the next level of room. We wanted a suite, but the price was $745 a night for an ocean view suite. But that's when i noticed something. The price for a \"garden view\" suite was less ($525) than than the room they had originally upgraded us to! In other words, we could get a suite for less than the deluxe room just because is wasnt an \"ocean view\". Well, I couldn't believe that a regular room was going to cost more than a suite, so I asked if I could see both rooms before I decided. They were very accommodating and I checked out both rooms. No comparison. Suite wins all the way. The suite was facing the outside of the property which just happens to be a beautiful golf course, and we could still see a bit of the ocean. It was was quiet and TWICE as big with a separate living area and two bathrooms and two showers, and the lanai is huge. The ocean view that the hotel keep selling is very limited at best. Don't be fooled about the whole \"ocean view\" thing. Trust me, you want one of these suites. It was awesome. Next tip; Valet parking. Valet parking cost $18.00 per day. But I found out that you only get charged that amount if your car stays overnight with the valet. In other words, if you come an go all day long and use the valet each time it will cost you nothing but the tip. At the end of the day, just self park your car and start the whole process again the next day. Side note: it is kinda lame how many spaces they take up for valet parking. Completely unnecessary. Lastly, take advantage of the Honolua store. It right there outside the front doors, and they have everything from breakfast to wine. Great selection and very reasonably priced. We never ate at any of the restaurants (way too many awesome places all over Maui) so we didn't have any sticker shock when it came to our bill at check out. In summary this place was awesome and the isolation is what we come to Maui for. If you want to be close to things, stay in Waikiki.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cOur New Favorite Maui Location\u201d", "Author": "K1334L", "ReviewID": "UR31320887", "Content": "My new husband and I spent our wedding week at the Ritz and were absolutely thrilled with the whole experience. My parents and a few other wedding guests also stayed at the resort and loved the understated elegance of the hotel and the grounds. The rooms are beautiful and the hardwood floors make the rooms feel clean and warm. We loved the staff members, especially the pool servers, who were incredibly friendly and fun to be around. We have been to Maui multiple times and prefer the more laid back vibe of Kapalua. Although Kaanapali and Wailea are great and have nice resorts, the atmosphere at the Ritz was much more our speed. If you are looking for a relaxing, pampered time away from many of the tourists, this is the place. After spending time at Wailea hotels in the past, the Ritz was a treat and we much prefered the fact that it was less crowded and much greener than most of Wailea. Plus, even over Memorial day, it did not feel overwhelmed with guests. The Honolua store is a great place to grab cheap breakfast and is within walking distance to the hotel. That being said, we found the prices at the Ritz's restaurants affordable compared to resorts in Wailea and the food was excellent. We never had to fight for a pool chair (like we have in the past in Kaanapali and Wailea) and generally had a portion of the pool to ourselves. Let me tell you, after being jammed in on a plane for an 8 hour trip to Maui, the relative lack of cheesy tourists fighting for seats at the pool was incredibly refreshing. Also, the maid staff was excellent. Our room looked like an entirely different place after they came and everything was organized, yet also easy to find. Overall, this place was a surprising gem after reading other reviews and reports about Kapalua's poor weather. We were in Kapalua for 2 weeks and saw no wind or rain and were thrilled with the absolutely beautiful views. Maybe May is the right month to come! As a side note, we married at the Plantation House restaurant and had our rehearsal dinner at the Pineapple Grill, both FABULOUS places in Kapalua to eat and our favorite food on Maui. We will definitely be coming back to the Ritz, especially if their rate specials continue. For our money, we would rather stay here than anywhere on the island outside of Hotel Hana Maui and in comparison, the Ritz is MUCH closer to any desired ammenities than Hana! In sum, the Ritz is understated elegance at its best. Its relative remote location compared to other more popular locations keeps it feeling like a peaceful retreat from overcrowded West and South Maui.

So, with that in mind, we stayed at the Ritz Carlton May 12 to the 22nd. We are late 50s, a couple, who've been to a fair number of places around the world and stayed in hotels/condos/inns/homes/tents, etc. We are not Ritz kind of people; probably more B&B types and New England/suburban NYC types for background. We found the Ritz to run like clockwork, with an ease and a \"pizazz\" that more pretentious hotels lack. We were there for 10 nights and we were just downright impressed-its that easy to say. All of the reports we read here about a cat on luggage, dust, noise at the pool, walking too far to the car and assorted mind numbing comments are just that-was it the hotel, their mates, the trip as a whole that created those curious memories? Is that what we base our travel plans on? Our take-we booked through amex platinum plus (no winner here in this scenario nor for that matter the seemingly indecent \"bait and switch\" tactics? of United Airlines-now there's an important issue that you will fall afoul of that should be addressed) and got a good room with an upgrade, breakfast, late checkout etc. and the 5th night free. Excellent deal. The staff was totally responsive, friendly, knowledgeable-well trained. Spend 10 days at a resort, smile, communicate, make reasonable requests, acknowledge the assistance and you will see the operation in its best and worst light. This outfit had it all. Really. The grounds are spectacular, pool, layout-this is Hawaii at its best. The included breakfast was buffet style and they would prepare something other than the buffet for you-the prices in Hawaii for food are astronomical and at the Ritz, that and beyond. The included breakfast, though was the best deal in town. As an aside a pint of milk was $3 at Safeway-on sale-get a Safeway card-and locals shops at Costco (there's one on the island) or grow their own. Certainly the food at the hotel is first rate but of course you pay for the experience. But back to the Ritz-if you want to see madness, hear good old cursing out loud, smoking everywhere, public drunkeness and havoc in general, there are a string of very well known chain hotels five or so miles down the coast-this is all West Maui. I'm all in favor of partying-I've done my share-but if you are looking for quiet, efficient, upscale relaxation then the Ritz is the place. The pools, vegetation, service and (sorry, lack of screaming kids) make this place a delight; if you check out their deals you may be surprised that it is not that far off from what that 800 room hotel with the small pool and noisy elevator (and likewise guests) has to offer. The shuttle at the Ritz should be looked at as a means to curtail transportation expense but probably you will want a car. Now, it can be windy there as any location will be in that spot on each Hawaiian island. Also, the weather can be more changeable than the southern areas of the island-but that's hot, dry and sunny always-very, It is separated from the collective inanity below, two beaches up is superb snorkeling, two beaches below peaceful crescent beach of world renown. We don't frequent hotels like this one, we don't play golf, eat $150 meals at the hotel's restaurant, or drink $15 drinks poolside. We were even a little uncomfortable carrying a Ritz bag we got, to the pool-but when we saw and heard the legion of kids at the other hotels-after traveling 15+ hours we knew we could stand a little \"ego reversal\" at the Ritz.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camarillo", "Title": "\u201cUnforgettable Weekend at The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua\u201d", "Author": "Hawaii_Beach_Fan", "ReviewID": "UR30494868", "Content": "After a couple of very busy days of work on Oahu, I hopped aboard a short Hawaiian Airlines flight to Maui for a long-overdue weekend at The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua. Arriving around 9:00 p.m. on Friday night, I was very happy to check-in and locate my room: a One-Bedroom Residential Suite that was truly exquisite, with a kitchen and dining area, fridge, microwave, two spacious lanais (balconies), two large flat panel, hi-def TVs, a living room and separate bedroom. In a word: amazing. I spent an hour on Friday night on the lanai with a beer (okay, it was two!), snacks, a full moon and the warm Kapalua breeze. Saturday morning dawned a little rainy, but the rain ended by mid-morning and as things dried out I strolled down to D.T. Fleming Beach, one of several in Kapalua. On my way back up to the resort, I stopped by the \"Ambassadors of the Environment\" center and learned about the growing list of eco-related activities they offer. There are planned outings for adults, kids and families. Buffet breakfast at The Terrace Restaurant was outstanding...a huge selection of breakfast items (I ended up going back for one-too-many helpings) and a very friendly staff. By mid-day, it was time to get to the beach! Took a long swim around the bay, then body-surfed for a while in some fun conditions. Soaked up the sun, then enjoyed a burger at The Ritz-Carlton's Beach House grill which overlooks the beach and seems very popular with guests. Later in the afternoon, I visited Whaler's Village in Kaanapali for some Aloha shirt shopping, then headed back up to Kapalua to catch up on some work and just enjoy my room. Sunday morning was Mother's Day, so I spent some time on the phone with my mom and mother-in-law from my lanai while savoring the views. Watched the Lakers lose badly in a playoff game, then headed back to the beach for an hour of stand-up paddle surfing and some snacks. Later in the afternoon, I lounged around the Ritz-Carlton's pool (the pool area is terraced, with three connecting pools), then walked next door for some fish and chips at the Honolua General Store, which may be a \"best kept secret\" as the food is really good and very reasonbly priced.

Our children stayed behind. Prior to our trip, a hotel concierge reached out to us to ask if we had questions. Unfortunately, the conceirge did not really provide us with advice on how to reach the hotel from Kahalui airport. There are two options: 1) an apparently short route along the northeast coast, or 2) a longer route through some of the bigger towns on the island. Wanting to get to the hotel as quickly as possible, we chose option 1. About 30 minutes into the drive we discovered that option 1 turns into a one lane road. Not one lane in both directions, but one lane total - zigging and zagging around several hundred-foot high cliffs without gaurd rail. We were twice literally one second away from a head on collision at a bend in the road. Only after arriving at the hotel an hour-and-a-half later, did the person who greeted say we should have taken option 2. A little late for that. IMO, if a concierge is going to contact a guest prior to the trip, they should fully explain both options of getting to the hotel. Other than the very start of our trip, the hotel and activities on the islands were really outstanding. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted with a nut/seed lei. Although the staff never greeted us by name, the employees always appeared upbeat and happy we were there. We had a standard room mostly overlooking a par-3 hole of the golf course, although on clear days a beautiful view of Molokai and the Pacific were available to our right. Our room was in very good condition as a result of a recent (within a year or two) renovation. Hardwood and tile floors, separate mosaic-tiled shower, luxurious bedding. All things that you would expect at this price point. Kidding aside, the only minor complaint about the room concerns the ultra-poor sound-proofing between the toilet area and the rest of the bathroom. The rest of the hotel is what you'd expect - incredibly landscaped and picturesque, yet very welcoming and pleasant. The pools are nice, but not really designed for asthetic appeal. We went to the pools twice for a total of five hours, and I was able to doze of both times. As stated in other reviews, there is a bit of a walk to the beach (which is a bit underwhelming), but the path is winding and along landscaped areas. We did not play tennis, but the courts looked to be considerably neglected, almost like ten-year-old public tennis courts. In contrast, the golf course looked well maintained. A quick comment about the resort of Kapalua. It kind of reminded me of being in a National Park, but not necessarily in a great way. The public resort buildings look very lodge/cabin-like. Basically, they don't really look upscale at all. Also, resort paints alot of thier public buildings in this awful reddish pain that reminds me of old National Parks from the 70s. They probably need to re-address the master plan of these buildings. While in Maui, we ran pretty hard (lots and lots and lots of driving): Day trip to the Big Island - drove to National Park, walked to the end of the road, took a helicopter tour over the spewing volcanoe, saw lava flowing, ate dinner at Seaside Restaurant (which came recommeded from multiple distinct sources). Drove about half of the road to Hana and saw counteless waterfalls and vistas of the coast. Too bad that focusing on driving really robs the driver of enjoying the views. Drove up to Haleakala for the sunsert and to see the stars. We were virtually the only ones there! Priceless and aside from the small National Park admission fee, practically free. Drove down to Wailea area and went to \"Turtle Beach\" to swim with the turtles. Walking to the beach, we ran into a couple from Poland who boasted about just seeing several turtles. Minutes later I very nearly drowned... and we never saw a single turtle. Took a sunrise sail with Trilogy to Lanai'i and did some fun snorkeling. I recommend doing this if you want an easy day of adventure. Went to Lahaina and Whaler's Village in Kaanapali for gift shopping.

There was live music every night in the lobby which was really enjoyable. We went to the nearby Kapalua Adventure Center for the zip line and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big swing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adventure. It was a fun 4 hours complete with great views and plenty of information from the guide about the area and local traditions. We also drove around the island thru upcountry (great winery!) and up to Mauna Kea Summit. There are amazing views not just at the top but the ride up and down the mountain too. One thing that was very surprising and interesting on our visit was all the different climates around the islands. Depending on which side of the island you are on and also the elevation. Another day we went on an all day boat trip with Captain Woody at the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion. We wanted to spend the day at sea but not on a mega touristy boat. This was perfect for us. He takes 6 passengers (in our case -3 couples) plus another staff member. It was a great day- we saw whales (it was in season), dolphins, snorkeled with turtles and lots of fish. The passengers let Woody know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to do and see- there is no set itinerary for each trip. He goes places depending on what everyone wants to do to find the best things to see and do. The last day we got a couples massage before our trip back home. They have a fabulous spa and we had one of the best massages ever (and I get massages often). It was a great finish to a memorable trip.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, VT", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for Relaxing Getaway\u201d", "Author": "vtgambler", "ReviewID": "UR29801789", "Content": "We stayed four nights in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153residential suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the end of April. We decided to splurge for the Ritz on Maui since the portion of our trip on Big Island was paid for. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough good things about this resort. Room: The suite was huge. Bedroom was spacious with big bathroom and closet. The main portion of the suite included the kitchenette, dining table and 2 couches. There were 2 lanais and even though we had a garden view room there was a great view of the ocean from the front lanai. Appliances/amenities: Two 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat screens, fridge, freezer, microwave, blender, dishwasher, coffee maker & plenty of dishes/utensils. Housekeeping did a thorough job and replaced towels and toiletries 2-3 times a day. By the end we had about 50 shampoo containers. Only complaint here was that our room was the first in the hallway next to some sort of utility closet or storage room so sometimes we could hear employees in there from our bathroom or bedroom. This was only during the daytime. Grounds: The setting is gorgeous. Everything is green and lush. The mix of palm trees and pine trees is interesting. Needless to say everything is well manicured. The place reeks relaxation. Beach: Was pleasantly surprised with the beach here (DT Fleming). Soft sand entry and clear water. There was pretty decent surf the days we were there and it seemed popular with boogie borders. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 5 minute walk to the beach from the pool but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really lazy they have a golf cart to shuttle you back and forth. There is a bar/restaurant down on the beach. One complaint was that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the hotel chairs on the beach only on the adjacent lawn. Pool: Very nice and the drink service was good. Nice padded loungers and no hassles obtaining chair covers and towels. The pictures on the hotel site are pretty accurate. Yes drinks are expensive but exactly the same as the major Kaanapali resorts. We actually spent more time at the pool then we usually do in Hawaii because it was so relaxing. Restaurants: Ended up not eating on the property. Had considered Banyon Tree for one night but it was closed the night we wanted to go. Only other dinner option is a Sushi place that is not our thing. Service: Everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful when required. They also stop to smile and say hello whenever you walk by. We had no bad interactions with any staff members. It was quite a shock to the system for someone who lives in the northeast! General thoughts: 1) Some posters had noted that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long walk to the self park area. Completely not true. It took about 3 minutes from the lobby. 2) As others have pointed out, the Honolua store next door has affordable food options for breakfast and lunch as well as snacks, soft drinks, alcohol etc.. 3) The remoteness of Kapalua has been overstated by a lot of people in my opinion. You might feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a million miles away from everything (exactly what we loved) but there are several restaurants within 5 minutes in Napili and Kahana. It also took us a grand total of 9 minutes to get to Kaanapali. 4) Maybe we got lucky with the weather but it was perfect the 4 days we were there. Apparently it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been so good the week prior. 5) We used the fitness center a few times. Decent for a hotel but not out of this world.

Upon arrival we were greeted with enthusiasm and then were upgraded from our bargain Terrace Rate room not once, but twice to an ocean view room on a high floor. I did not expect an upgrade and it was given graciously. Our room was well appointed and beautiful. The amenities were great and sheets were of very high quality. The pool and the grounds on the hotel were beautiful and well run. We never lacked for service at the pool and then attendants rushed to provide us with chair covers and beach towels. Initially we were disappointed that the middle level of the 3 tier pool was out of service, but by the time we got up the next day the pool was running perfectly and beautifully. The area by the beach was great too...which brings me to the best attraction at this resort...the surroundings. Kapalua, Maui is honestly one of the most if not the most beautiful place on earth. The resort is situated in such a way to take advantage of the vistas. We watched an amazing sunset from the 5th hole of the golf course, adjacent to a native Hawaiian burial ground completely alone. Unreal in it's beauty. The restaurant prices are steep, but all the food was tasty. The good news is that within walking distance is the Honolua Store which is cheap and tasty.

This place is just awesome. We had a residential suite on the ground level and it could not have been more perfect. We were able to walk out our back door each day...to the pool, ocean, meals, etc. If you can score the ground level rooms, you will be very pleased. It was quite windy, but you need that wind to keep you cool. While and the pool and ocean, we had nothing but sunshine, and that wind helped tremendously. The staff as a whole was awesome! The pool/cabana guys and gals were so friendly and wanted to help you any way they could. They are great resources on what to do and how to do it. The Ritz being the Ritz...its darn pricey. But, you only go around once right. Definitely take advantage of the Honalua store which is all of a 5 min walk from the hotel and is VERY reasonable on EVERYTHING they sell. We like to have a few cocktails at the pool and we learned very quickly that the ones served poolside are not cheap. We got around this by buying some liquor and mixers at the Honalua Store and used the tumblers from our room. Perfect! I was disappointed in the breakfasts...or the lack of selection. Not that i couldn't eat the Maui Gold pineapples all day (they are amazing! Low acid, twice the vitamin B, etc, and are only grown on the west side of Maui), but it would have been nice to have something else to choose from rather than the usual bacon, eggs, sausage, etc. My suggestion is to go to the Honalua Store once again. Thier full menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner items give you variety not found in the hotel. That being said...the restaurants were great for dinner. Kai was very good as was the Terrace. Didn't get to the Banyan tree...but heard good things. As others said, the hotel is not next to several other hotels. It is set apart from everything and sits back about 200 yards from the beach. This makes the walks you take absolutely breathtaking. When you do have to rent a car, we went down to Whaler's Village and found nothing there (strip mall). Lahiana is another story. This place actually has some local flavor and feeling. We spent some time there hanging out and people watching. This place can be packed at times when cruise ships are docked...so fair warning. Head north to Pa'ia. You will hear others talk about this place. Its the \"hippie village\" on Maui. Lots of cool places and people. We ate at an EXCELLENT flat bread pizza place along the main drag. Pa'ia was a nice place to hang out. Lastly, we did a helicopter tour with Blue Hawaiian. This was worth every penny. We took the Hana/Haleakala tour and had Gernod as our pilot. Dude was out of control with knowledge! He knew it all! The pics we got were great and the experience was unforgettable. Anyway, Maui is awesome.

From the moment we drove in to the Kapalua Resort, we knew we had found paradise. We rented a car for this trip because we knew we would want to explore the island. We quickly discovered that once we left paradise, we couldn't wait to get back. We took the ferry to Lanai to look at both of the Four Seasons resorts. While the resorts were very nice, we didn't care for the island. In fact, we only stayed for a few hours because we couldn't wait to get back to Kapalua. The Ritz has service that is beyond compare. The Valet knew our names when we arrived simply by asking us where we were from. When we checked in, we were pleasantly surprised that they had upgraded our room from an Ocean View Suite to an Ocean Front Suite. Our Suite was absolutely GORGEOUS! I am a neat freak. This room exceeded my expectations. There was a large fresh fruit basket and welcome note waiting for us. The view from the living room balcony was of the golf course and the ocean. From our bedroom balcony, we had peaceful golf course views. When you stay at Kapalua, they have a FREE shuttle service at your disposal that will take you anywhere on Kapalua that you'd like to go. The Plantation House is several miles away and it sits on top of a hill overlooking the golf course, ocean, and a distant Lanai. We HIGHLY recommend it for ANY meal! We especially loved the breakfast. (Grand Marnier French Toast with Bananas) Contrary to what many have written, you do NOT have to spend $30 for breakfast at the Ritz. That is just for the all-you-can-eat buffet. The buffet IS worth it if you do it. We just chose to mix it up a little bit. We also went to the little store that is within walking distance from the hotel. (I forget the name) The food there was terrific too. There were quite a few locals there every time we went. Pineapple Grill gave us the BEST service of any restaurant and the food was divine. Merriman's was wonderful too for both service and food. There is a sushi restaurant there also that is pretty good but probably our least favorite of all of the Kapalua restaurants. (Yes, the shuttle will take you to ALL of these places.) Another place that the shuttle will take you is to the trails. Visit the nature center at Kapalua to get trail maps and sign a waiver. You can either walk from the nature center to connecting trails, or you can have the shuttle take you to the top of the mountain, past the Plantation House Restaurant, to the Arboretum. We hiked several connecting trails back to the resort which was approx. 7 miles in total. The next day, we decided we would hike from the resort back to the arboretum. (7 miles again) The shuttle picked us up and took us back. There are many trails you can hike with many different distances. Some are even paved. We encountered all different ages and athletic abilities on the trails. The pool was exceptional. They do not come by to get drink orders from you every 5 minutes so you're actually able to relax. We had NO trouble getting great chairs any of the days we were there. Fleming Beach is beautiful. The water was a little cold for our liking, but the atmosphere is extremely relaxing. There is a Ritz beach hut there also so you are able to have drinks and service while you are there. We didn't have kids with us so we didn't need to use the kids club, but it looked super nice. The gym is AMAZING! There is lots of cardio equipment with personal televisions. There are free weights as well as circuit training. The room is HUGE. You shouldn't have to fight for equipment at any time. My husband and I plan to revisit Ritz Kapalua annually. There are no words to describe how incredible we feel about this resort. If we had to do our honeymoon over again, there is no question that we would do it here. By the way..the wind was wonderful!

We had drinks and lunch in The Alaloa lounge (The Ahi Cobb salad was absolutely delicious!) If we had had more time I would have liked to have dinner at The Banyan Tree, but we did go with suggestions from staff and had dinner one night at The Pineapple Grill (great drinks - coconut martini - yum!) and at Jameson's one night.

The store has everything including coffee, groceries, wine and gifts! The Cafe Kapalua is also reasonable and very good. I loved the mango smoothies! Another great spot for breakfast is the Gazebo in Napili. The wait is worth it! For dinner, you can take a complimentary hotel shuttle to Pineapple Grill, Merriman's and The Plantation House. All of the wonderful sunset dinners we had were delicious but my favorite was at Plantation house and that was not at sunset. It was the best meal we had during our trip!

The hotel is good for someone who plans to stay put using its facilities. Our room got upgraded to Deluxe by the front desk. Didn't ask for it. I guess it might be due to our late check-in around mid-night or due to the room availability. Also, we were lucked out with rooms next to us and on top of us. No noisy neighbors around. That doesn't mean the room is well-built with a noise cancellation system. One time, I could hear loud and clear the lady next door talking on the phone during the day. Luckily, she disappeared since then. By the way, the lobby is located on the 7th floor. Make sure you get the floor as high as you can (tower 1 has 8 floors and tower 2 has 9). It is far from many other attractions. Luckily, Maui is not a big island. Wherever we go, it takes 20 or 30 minutes except Hana and the Haleakala Summit. We did not try any of its restaurants.

We stayed in the Ritz-Carlton for 5 nights and loved every minute of it. After a very long flight/day, we checked in at around 12 AM (5 AM EST) and were nicely suprised to find that our room had been upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Residential Garden View Suite. The room was amazing and the view of the garden/pool area was breathtaking. I really do not understand how anyone could give this place a poor review unless they are entirely too high maintenance. Every inch of the resort is spotless, with a newly remodeled decor complete with hardwood flooring, huge mirrors, and 40\" HD televisions (one in the living area and one in the bedroom). We didnt use many of the services; however, at our daily visits to the pool, the staff was very friendly and attentive. There were some children but the place didn't seem to be overrun by them. The best thing about the hotel was its location. It wasn't located in a strip of busy hotels, it was set apart from them. The drive into Lahaina only took about 20 minutes. If you want a hotel that caters to partying/nightlife, this isn't the place for you. The hotel is very quiet near dark, with wild nights taking a backseat to romance and relaxation. We will definitetly be staying here again! PROs: Beautifully decorated, lush landscape, comfortable room, quiet and relaxing CONs: A little pricey: the computers in the business center could be used for $.75 per minute/5 minute min., 8 ounce drinks at the oceanside bar were $12.50, etc. This is the Ritz-Carlton however, so be prepared to pay top dollar. WARNING: From the airport take the route that runs around the south side of the island thru Lahaina, not the route the Google suggests around the North side, definetly if you are coming in after dark.

This was primarily a business trip, but I managed to fit in a few days of relaxation. The hotel is located on the Western side of the island, making it highly vulnerable to the winds that come off of the mountains. It is not well-sited and does not afford it's occupants a good opportunity to enjoy the little bit of sun that pops out, mid-day. The pool area is adequate, but the lounge chairs are utilitarian and the towels thin. Not what you'd expect from a Ritz. No cold towels offered, no spritzing. Quite a step down from what I am used to. The overall service is poor. After befriending some of the staff, I learned that the Ritz had recently laid off approximately 20% of its staff. Not wise, when they were expecting a group of over 800 for almost ten days in January! Front desk was outstanding; very helpful and friendly. This is where the expected Ritz attitude ended. Bell desk staff were unfriendly, bordering on rude. They had a general air of indifference, which I attributed to being short-staffed. I saw the same four guys all week, even when several hundred people were departing for various tours. Still, no need to take it out on the guests, who are responsible for your tips! Restaurant outlets are mediocre, at best. Limited menus, unpleasant and unattentive waitstaff. But the usual high prices you'd expect on Maui. Food quality was good, but not outstanding. Rooms were quite nice, although some were tired, considering that this property supposedly just underwent a multi-million dollar renovation. Again, not what I have come to expect from a Ritz. In general, there is an air of indifference with this property, which I have never seen at another Ritz (which I frequent in my business). I would not recommend for a group, although a leisure traveler might enjoy the scenic location during a warmer time of the year (think April-October). One last note: Kapalua is rather remote; the better beaches are in Wailea and in Lahaina, which is anywhere from 30-60 minutes away.

Then finally we got a good string of weather, while they said the weather was not typical you have to bear in mind that it is winter, and while some rain is likely, there was a strorm system that had moved in from California. That put a big dampner on my trip, no pun intended!! The lobby is OK, wasnt' super impressive but the hotel gets much better beyond the lobby. The hotel itself is beautiful, not the most beautiful ritz we have stayed at, but the location, the way its perched high on a cliff overlooking the ocean and the pool are all specatcular. The rooms are nice not over the top, comfy beds, nice bathrooms. One thing that made me crazy was they have a full length mirror in the bathroom and one tiny bathroom above the minibar and that is it. So when there are two or three people trying to get ready at night, it was super inconvenient since we were all vying for the same mirror in the bathroom, why they didnt' put a nice sized mirror in the room mystifies me. The staff couldn't have been nicer/friendlier, truly goes out of their way to help. Breakfast was good a nice buffet or typcial menu, for family of five runs about $150 including tax for buffet.

The Banyan Tree restaurant in the hotel was very mediocre, so wouldn't necessarily recommend, we went for their special new years eve dinner and wasn't thrilled especially compared with the excellent meals we had at just about every other restaurant we ate at.

Overall we had a great time, enjoying pretty much all the hotel had to offer. Having stayed in a Ritz-Carlton before we knew what to expect and in Maui it didn't disappoint. What we liked: - Customer service: this was excellent throughout our stay. All the staff are really friendly and helpful. They are laid back and unintrusive, exactly what you want on a vacation. From the Leis on arrival, to free water during turn-down and free pineapple by the pool, this really made us at ease. - The room: they automatically upgraded us to a suite which was great. Plenty of room for a couple with alot of space on the lanai (two balconies) to relax and stare at the beautiful scenery. We had a fridge and freezer, and all manner of other items should you want to partly self cater. Not our thing but the option is good. The room was very clean and well looked after. - Banyan Tree restaurant: we had dinner here twice during our stay and both times the food was high quality. Being from the UK, since the pound has fallen against the dollar I'm not sure I would rush back to Banyan Tree on its price. When we went ($1.8 to \u00c2\u00a31) it was reasonably priced for a good restaurant. - Breakfast: We had breakfast included in our package so saved $70 per couple per day. Probably wouldn't have it if not included. But since we did we really enjoyed the selection and good service. Maui Gold pineapple is great. - Beautiful grounds: The grounds are kept immaculately and provides a really relaxing setting. It was quiet when we went partly the time of year but also the recession hitting tourism. Apparently Hawaii tourism is down 20-25% according to the local news. Also the Ritz hotel is very private and secluded, unlike Kanapaali which has hordes of people who can walk in or out of your pool area/hotel. In fact it is encouraged by the hotels to show off their facilities! - Pool: On balance we liked the pool. Different tiered pools and plenty of space. You can swim anytime you want since it never closes. There were several elements we didn't like (see my didn't like section). What we didn't like: - Windy: A recurring theme in people's reviews. Yes, it is windy at Kapalua. Apparently the trade winds blow pretty much all year. Pop 15 mins down the road to Kanapaali or Lahaina and there's very little wind. It's a tough call, for some the wind might drive you nuts if you like calm surroundings. For us, it was only an irritant rather than annoying. On the positive it does help keep you cool in the Sun. - The Beach: This is a marginal decision. The beach itself is not too crowded and soft sand. But if you fancy a swim the break is quite steep and the waves tend to crash onto the shore rather than roll. Not really the type of sea you want for relaxing swimming. - No shade: Again, this was an irritant rather than something to mark the hotel down for. There are no sun umbrellas and so very little shade. If you want some shade it's going to cost you $70 for a two seater shade, $100 for a plain old Cabana and $250 for the luxury cabana with LCD TV, ipod dock etc. We found areas by the pool where the palm trees were more dense and so offered some more shade. But be prepared to chase the shade during the day if you are not a sun worshipper. We would recommend: - Sansei Sushi restaurant - Located near the entrance to the Ritz, we went here a few times for sushi. Very good quality at a reasonable price. Said to be the best sushi on the island. Remember to book or be prepared for a 30 min wait. - Eat the fish: Maui has some of the best fresh fish we have eaten and fully recommend taking advantage of it. You can buy sushi grade tuna in supermarkets! - Hire a car: This was really useful for getting out and about. We heard taxis are not cheap and buses can take forever. - Visit some of the other beaches on the island: such a Kanapaali. It's a much busier beach but you can see why. Very flat and calm sea with a beautiful sunset view. - Temptation Tours: We did the Hana picnic tour with these guys. Had a great time with some absolutely stunning scenery (think Jurassic Park - some scenes were shot here). They really know how to look after you. One tip, the road is winding and can make you travel sick. Be prepared if you're partial to a little queasiness! - Honolua store: If you want to grab a cheap bite for lunch pop to the Honolua store just by the entrance to the Ritz. Good quality cheap traditional Maui food available. Well, that's it from me. So the hotel gets 4 out of 5 just because of the few irritants. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with the Ritz-Carlton and recommend Maui as a fantastic, beautiful place to have a vacation.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus ohio", "Title": "\u201cReminiscing of Destination Wedding and Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "buckeyetravelgirl", "ReviewID": "UR21929365", "Content": "Planning a trip to Tahit for a early anniversary celebration and looked at the Ritz reviews...thought I would write one while I'm in that mindset.

We are frequent guests of both chains and our young children are as well so the family expectations are high. Our impression of the remodel is that the money was spent in the lobby (think Vegas goes to HI) the residential suites and the spa & fitness area. The rest of the remodel was pretty poor for example the \"wood floor\" rolled in our suite was already buckling. The Ritz Kids program has gone away at this property when we asked for baby shampoo for the room they sent us Four Seasons baby shampoo. The dining is very limited so make sure you have a car to dine off property. The Banyan Tree which was one of our favorite restaurants has a new chef who could use some continued time at culinary school. The sushi bar is fine but across the parking lot is Sensei which is better. The only other restaurant on property open every day is the lobby bar. Nice new cabana's with TV and Mp3 players good for football on the weekends. They want $250 per day but if you are there for any amount of time they will discount to $100 or even nothing, depending on the tip you give. The staff us as with all Ritz very accommodating and we appreciated their efforts. We did have club level access which was a must due to the limited dining options. For recreation the ropes course and zip lines are a lot of fun. Golf can be a bit slow; we walked off the plantation course after 5 hours and just on 15th hole. We spent three weeks there and doubt we will return. It is unfortunate because this has been a favorite property of ours for so many years. It just appears that many short cuts are being taken it could be because the property is not owned by Ritz just managed by them.

We had an excellent experience. We had booked a regular room but were upgraded to a two-room suite with a full kitchen and huge bathroom/changing area. This was fantastic as we stocked up on breakfast foods & were able to eat in the room some days (you don't always feel like a full hotel breakfast after traveling for 2 weeks). Our hotel stay here ended a 2 week trip to Hawaii, also visiting Oahu (staying at the Hilton) and Lanai (staying at the Four Seasons Lodge at Koele). All of the public areas and our room were very well done at the Ritz. Also, all of the servers/employees we encountered were excellent. The only small negative we saw was at the pool area - basically, if you want shade, you have to pay to reserve a cabana or umbrella chair which range from $75-$250. This seemed like a rip off. No one seemed to be using them either. There are no chairs on the beach - the hotel has a small section for chairs kind of overlooking the beach - it's not as nice as the pool(s) (which is one of the best we've seen). The hotel seemed quite empty - probably due to the timing our our trip (Oct.). We ate at the Pineapple Grill & Plantation restaurants - both easily accessed via the \"on demand\" resort shuttle.

We selected the Ritz Carlton, Maui as we have heard so much about the Ritz Carlton and their recent multi-million dollar renovation. We went in with very high expectations and were amazed when they were able to far exceed our expectations for our entire 9 day stay. From the moment we walked in the door and they placed the traditional Hawaiian Ley around mine and my wife's neck as they called us by name. Our room was fresh and clean and over looked both the Kapalua Bay course with views of the Pacific and neighboring Hawaiian Island, Malokai. This was only the beginning of the excellent and personalized service that we received during our stay. We stayed on the club level and experienced the 5 meal services per day which was abosolutely an outstanding culinary experience (thanks to April) from their fabulously fresh crossiants with a huge variety of fresh fruits during breakfast to their terrific fresh fish, shrimp or beef selections during the dinner hour. Each meal service presented a different entree option as they presented a sampling of their amazing food for us to taste. This may not be intended to be your meal, but I will say if you stay long enough to try everything and have a cocktail or two in the process, it can easily be all you need for the evening especially if you cap it off with their many dessert offerings (best carrot cake I've ever had). The service on the club level is personalized by the terrific team of Leslie, Erin, Albert and Kong all getting to know your names and genuinely caring about you during your visit and by the time we left, we walked away feeling like we made 3 new friends. We did dine in a couple of the restaurants on site, our favorite was the Banyan Tree which is located outside the hotel with views of the Pacific Ocean. The food was awesome, my wife had the Mahi Mahi and I chose the Chef's Special beef selection that melted in my mouth. Once again the service was expectional and personaized thanks to Nick who made sure our experience was unforgettable. Other highlights included the outstanding exercise facilities (was great to look at the Pacific while working out), lounging by the beautiful pool with very attentive serivce from everyone, loved the samples of the smoothies and flavored shaved ice. I had the best Kona coffee and great conversation with Cindy in the hotel lobby breakfast area. And lastly it was great to be able to walk to the beach, swim, snorkel, watch waves crash into the rocks and watch surfers all without having to leave the grounds. The Ritz Carlton has a new program called the Adbassadors of the Environment program and at the suggestion of Erin one of the concierge in the Club Room we went on a snorkeling tour and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our tour started with about a 30 minute presentation of the Ambassadors program and why the Ritz Carlton believes so much in educating their guests about the environment as well as many pictures of some of the fish and Sea creatures we may encounter on our tour. Then a short 5-minute shuttle ride to Kapalua Bay where we were fitted for our fins & mask. We had our own personal tour guide, Jaclyn who stayed within feet of us while we were in the water and continuously pointed out and named the fish, sea turtles and many other amazing sea creatures we were seeing among the coral reef within a short distance from the shore. After a fabulous picnic lunch which was provided with our tour, we returned to the Ambassadors of the Environment room back at the hotel where we were immediately able to review the hundreds of underwater photos we were able to take with our waterproof digital cameras that were provided with the tour. Then perhaps the entire highlight of the tour and vacation was the DVD put to music that they made for us which had many pictures that we and our guide Jaclyn took during our trip. This DVD has pictures and memories that are priceless and exceeded our expectations of the entire snorkeling trip as I cannot begin to express the feeling I had while viewing it over and over again. This trip was made possible by the terrific and knowledgable staff at the ambassadors program which included, Jaclyn, Amanda, Kepo and Ashley Carrol who is the Director of the entire program. I would highly recommend it to adults and children alike as it truly is an educational and fun experience for everyone.

I cannot say enough good things about the hotel staff and outstanding service we received. When we arrived we were greeted with bead leis and taken directly to our Residential Suite room which had a very distant ocean view. When I questioned the \"ocean view\" the bellman called the front desk and secured another room for us with a much better view. The bride and groom had reserved an ocean front room and were upgraded to a spectacular suite with kitchen, living room, bedroom and huge terrace overlooking the water. Soooo romantic for them. We had scheduled a cocktail party in the bar area for the night before the wedding. I worked with Lani, the Food & Beverage Manager, through emails and phone calls and was a bit nervous since we had never met face to face. However, when we arrived there was message from her saying she would be off the night of our party but that the bar manager had everything arranged. She even left me her personal cell phone number in case there were problems, which there weren't. The bar manager also called me to confirm everything. The bar at the Ritz has a little area with a terrace off to one side that is sort of private and they set up these buffet tables with the wonderful appetizers we chose (sliders, shrimp, california rolls, mushrooms, cheese plates, etc.). They assigned two waitresses exclusively for our party to serve cocktails and our 2 hour party ended up lasting about 4 hours. It was perfect. The day of the wedding the bride, her mom and I went to the spa for various treatments and to have our hair and make-up done for the wedding. I have never had my make-up done, but thought I'd give it a try. Irma did our make-up and I would definitely recommend her. We had champagne brought in and spent most of the day using the spa facilities. When you book a treatment you can spend the entire day at the spa, using the jacuzzi, sauna, steam or meditation rooms, etc. What a special treat. The wedding was at sunset and, although it did rain, the clouds cleared and we had a double rainbow for the ceremony. The wedding planner thought of everything, including umbrellas. We walked from the lawn to the restaurant for appetizers and cocktails and then went into the restaurant for a lovely dinner. They had set up two tables for us, again off to the side, and we also had two waiters just for our party of 26. The tables were beautifully set and the food was scrumptious. We especially enjoyed the lobster set atop risotto. Yummy. We loved everything about the Ritz. The rooms were spotless, the breakfasts to die for (included with our room) and the staff made you feel like they really wanted you to enjoy your stay.

We also enjoyed having an alarm with an iPod dock and complimentary wireless internet. My only major complaints with our stay were with the restaurants and the maid service. First of all, when we arrived, we discovered that the only restaurant open for dinner was the very pricey Banyan Tree. After asking the concierge, we were told the sushi bar was open (I do not like sushi) or that we would be able to order food from the lounge menu. It turns out the Terrace Restaurant was only open for dinner on Sunday and Monday evenings, and the other casual restaurants closed early due to unpredictable weather. I finally was able to find a salad to order to eat at the Alaloa Lounge. But at just under $20 for a salad, I was a little underwhelmed. One other evening, we ordered food from the room service menu. It was good food, but pretty pricey for what we got. We paid over $130 for appetizers and main course, no drinks. After that experience, we made it a point to eat our dinners off-site. The other complaint was that turn-down service sometimes arrived so late that we had already gone to bed. Granted, we did turn in a little early, but twice they came after 7 pm and once after 8:30. Otherwise, we had no issues at all with housekeeping. Our room and bathroom were always immaculate. We used the valet parking service just once, on arrival. It was efficient and convenient, but we didn't want to pay the extra charge so we self-parked the remainder of the time. The pools are lovely and there are ample chaise lounges around the pools. But pool towels seemed a little difficult to locate. We could only find one cabana handing out towels, even though there were several scattered around the pool area. And finding a place to put them in afterward was also a challenge. We ended up just leaving them on the chairs. The beach directly in front of the hotel is very nice and secluded, although it is just a bit of a walk down the hill from the hotel. It isn't too bad, though, and definitely worth it.

This was in large part due to the hotel ambiance, the service of the waitstaff during dinner/dancing, and the quality of the food and presentation. Following the wedding, we spent another two weeks at the hotel for our honeymoon. While there, we had \"club\" level access and enjoyed the multiple food presentations the hotel offered throughout the day. The \"club\" employees were always friendly and anticipated our needs, knowing that we enjoyed certain breakfast items not always on display. Despite the items not being out, they were always provided to us in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. We were in two different rooms during out stay.

For the honeymoon, the two of us shifted to a standard room with a king bed overlooking the three-tiered pool and pacific ocean. We loved it! The housekeeping staff were always polite and non-intrusive. We valeted our car the entire time we stayed, and within the first three days of the honeymoon, when the staff saw us heading out the front door of the hotel, they immediately ran off to grab our car. No waiting. Overall, the hotel is beautiful, having just completed a major renovation. The wood work in the lobby is stunning and the new bar area in the front lounge is gorgeous. We also took advantage of the newly renovated spa throughout our trip. The massages were wonderful and the salon did great work.

The bands are typical wedding set ups, with drums and bad singing , and masters of the art of LOUD . Usually, they aren't even that good!! If your idea of a good time here is to hear the ocean once in a while while sitting on your balcony enjoying a glass of wine while watching the sunset, you are probaly flat out of luck!! Nice hotel, good service, but LOUD LOUD LOUD!! Not much relaxing listening to hawaiin music. Also, while smoking is prohibited throughout the hotel ( I thought) a fair number of people smoke on the balcony, and especially near the special events. No one seemed to do anything about it. By the way, we had dinner at the Banyon Tree, which, while expensive, is pretty good. The whole atmosphere is very elegant -- until the bands start ( they are quite close by) and overwhelm the atmosphere. The staff jokes about how the special events are \"holding the place together\" so I suspect it will be a cold day in Hades before they clamp down and control this -- if they even want to!

The spa, which opened in June is GORGEOUS! Its a huge facility, with a co-ed indoor/outdoor lounge and hot tub, and the men's and women's lounges feature sauna, steam room, and a hot tub set in what looks like a Hawaiian cave. Like most Ritz-Carlton's, the service level is what makes this hotel truly shine. From the moment you arrive and receive your welcome lei, the staff is always there to take care of your every need. For a more personal touch, I highly recommend the Club Level, which has a private club lounge featuring 5 food presentations daily, free liquor, and a club concierge. The service on club is so personalized, and it is really the most memorable part of the hotel for me. You develop a relationship with the club concierge staff, and by the end of your trip you are sad to say goodbye.

My husband and I are in our early thirties and we just returned from a week vacation celebrating our 5 year annniversary.

Make sure you look at recent pictures of the rooms . . . they all have flat screen t.v's, ipod docking stations, marble bathrooms, and hardwood floors. The Ritz is a great combination of luxury and solitude, but within a short driving distance to activities, shopping and restaurants. The property is expansive and beautiful. Since we have a child at home, we were looking for a peaceful place to relax without having to deal with wristbands and fighting for a lounge chair at the pool (like some hotels in Kaanapali). The service was unbelievable- every single staff member greets you in the hall and calls you by name in the restaurants. The maid service was prompt and came twice daily. The hotel also sent us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary. The free poolside pineapple and smoothie samples were a nice treat. Some nice perks of the hotel were free self-parking and a mini fridge in the room. There is a free shuttle which comes on demand and will take you around the Kapalua area. Right next to the Ritz is the Pineapple Grill and Sansei . . . both were excellent! We had the breakfast buffet included in our room rate and I highly recommend doing it that way . . . it included tax and gratuity (about $65 per day). We had a couples massage in an outside cabana and that was amazing too. The spa is completely renovated and is a tranquil sanctuary. Some of complaints I read before we went were: 1) No cushions on the lounge chairs- that problem is solved. There always seemed like plenty of chairs for everyone too. 2) Very windy- it is windy but my husband and I found it to be refreshing when we were poolside (it was about 87 degrees when we were there). 3) Poor service- I don't know how people could say that??!! My husband and I are pretty high maintence and we thought everything was excellent. 4) No shade- Most of the pool are is sunny, but there are some shady chairs around the pool and down by the beach. There are also cabanas and two-person umbrellas you can rent . I personally wouldn't want too much shade or else I wouldn't have come home with a nice Maui tan!

I was somewhat concerned about some of the bad reviews on this Ritz, but as I have never had a bad experience at any Ritz before, I went ahead with the booking. Prior to arrival, I exchanged several emails with the concierge who arranged for a shuttle from the Kapalua airport, made several restaurant recommendations, and suggested several local child sitting services. During our stay our family didn't find one member of the staff who wasnt friendly or who didn't go out of their way to assist us in any request. On arrival, we paid for an upgrade to the club/concierge floor. This was supposed to have only a golf course view, but just past the 5th hole of the bay course, our room overlooked the Pacific and the island of Molokai. The views were spectacular. My only gripe about the balcony was that there was no outside lamp or light. Daily food presentations are available throughout the day on the club floor, and these were excellent. In the evening, there was even a chef cooking beautiful appetizers which tasted as good as they looked. The rooms have been recently redone and are very spacious. A flat screen TV and DVD player was in the room as well as a small fridge. Surprisingly the rooms have wood floors with some area rugs, and are very tastefully done. The grounds are beautiful and the pool area is quite large with three seating levels. Several comments have been made about the uncomfortable chairs. I am happy to say that cushions were installed during my visit and the chairs are now quite comfortable to lay on for an hour or all day! We didnt splurge on the covered canopy but if you are going to spend the whole day at the pool, it may be worth the $150 my wife was quoted. Personally, I didn't come to Hawaii to lay around the pool all day. The beach is a bit of a hike down a long hill, but there is a golf cart shuttle available. I played golf once on the plantation course and the views of the Pacific were spectacular. If you stay on site, club rental is included. There is also a free clinic on Thursday afternoon at the academy. Book it early. As noted the resort is on the north end of Maui and it can be a hike to get to get to parts of the island. I highly recommend a car rental if you plan to see other areas of the island. Hertz had our car waiting and we only had to sign for it at the concierge desk.

If you are looking for a cheap breakfast option, the Honolulu store offers great breakfast for cheap in addition to having a ton of other high quality low cost food and beverage options. The place is awesome. We did try a few local food options. I would not recommend the Pineapple Grille as the food was decent but very expensive. I think you could find better values. I would recommend the sushi place (Sensei) but make a reservation as it's PACKED. The only slight negative about the Ritz is the location as it does take time to get to the South or any other \"tourist\" destinations. For my wife and I, we did not care since we spent all of the time on West Maui. Also if up for an adventure, drive up the North Coast as it offers better views then the Road to Hana.

We were graciously given an upgraded room in the Napili wing. The front desk staff are truly the most accomodating folks you could imagine . The hotel seems to have retained most of its long term valued staff and that tells me a lot about the way things are run there. The Banyan Tree was much better than I had remembered it to be. Be aware that although this restaurant is pricey, the service and food are worth the expense. If you like dining early, there is a wonderful fixed price menu. The servers are top notch and most have been with the hotel for some time. My husband and I always book a breakfast package and this is the way to go. The chef on duty will make omelets to order and cheerfully accomodate any special request. This hotel is expensive but is located on one of the most beautiful parts of the island,. The property has an uncrowded resort feel that you just don't get in Wailea. The beach restaurant serves a wonderful lunch. The staff there is also friendly and they go beyond the norm to serve guests. If you enjoy and appreciate fine service and don't mind paying for it, this is the hotel for you. I consider it an excellent value over what I have seen on other parts of the island. We toured the new spa and it looked wonderful although we are not spa people. The new exercise facilities are nice but we chose to do the outdoor activities with the fitness staff. This stay was just amazing. How could it not be with such a beautiful property and extraordinary staff? There are a few finishing touches being put on the hotel due to the remodel but they did not affect our stay at all. The Ritz is located close to wonderful snorkeling and hiking. The concierge desk will help with any questions related to activities.

We found those areas to be fun to visit, but crowded and more \"touristy\" than relaxing. As for the breeze, it was nice to have that to cool us off. Other areas of the island were extremely warm with NO breeze. And the \"walk\" to the beach is a paved path down the side of the hotel. No big deal. Be sure to take advantage of the shuttle to check out other beaches and restaurants in the resort. Great views all over. Also, make the drive to the beaches north of the resort.

There are three separate pools plus a very grown up kiddy pool with their very own waterfall. :> For a relaxing way to end the day with a magnificent view, I would sit in the outside lounge overlooking the pool. Delicious food, tropical drinks and live music were just a few feet away. The housekeeping staff was very on top of things. I began to look forward to the nightly turn down service where I received the Ritz one page newspaper with the 'Hawaiian word of the day', fitness schedule and hotel info/updates. Basically to sum it all up, this was one of the best vacations ever! It was largely due to the Ritz Carlton hotel and staff. Thank you so much! I would absolutely recommend that everyone go for a visit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6at least once! ;>", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cVacation of a Lifetime\u201d", "Author": "Kim61779", "ReviewID": "UR17325395", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Ritz Kapalua for 10 days on our honeymoon in April/May 2008. It was the best vacation we have ever had. I'm reading some of these bad reviews of the hotel, and laughing to myself. Some people can find something wrong with just about everything -- even a five star resort in Maui!! I can honestly say that it was worth every penny, albeit many pennies! But you get what you pay for. My husband and I were blown away by the service -- from the bell staff, to the pool crew, to the lounge bartender, to the maids. I felt spoiled the entire time I was there, to the point I was embarrassed to be taking cold washcloths off silver plates and complimentary pineapple slices at the pool. We made friends with the pool staff, and they took care of us every single day. We were on a first name basis with them. We were getting invited to parties that they were attending on their days off -- kind of funny. We were involuntarily upgraded to a residential suite upon check-in. We didnt know what to do with all the space. We felt so comfortable and at home. If we wanted to, we could have cooked a full-course meal in our stocked kitchen, but we just didn't feel like cooking on our vacation. The only thing I didnt have was an iron, but who cares! My husband was, for some reason, overly impressed with the complimentary Bulgari bath products. Granted, they were nice, but he was a little too excited. I guess we're just easy to please. The pool was not overcrowded -- we always found great seats. They were working on tiling some of the pool waterfalls the week we were there, but it wasnt the end of the world. The spa was not open at the time, but it looked like it was going to be pretty cool. One thing that I have to recommend is getting the breakfast package. The daily prices arent cheap. We wound up with a complimentary breakfast package through our travel agency, and it was such a money saver. We went for a late breakfast every day around 11:00 and basically stuffed our faces. It held us over until dinner everyday, so we were only buying one meal a day.The meals aren't cheap, but you will never have better seafood than in Hawaii. My husband went into withdrawal when we got home after having had salmon and eggs benedict every single day. I was a big fan of the omelet station. I wasn't too crazy about dinner at the Terrace. The menu was kind of limited and pricey. The Banyan Tree was delicious. They were having half priced wine bottle specials when we were there, so we definitely capitalized on that. The sushi restaurant, Kai, was nice. I'm not a huge sushi fan, but my husband enjoyed himself. The weather was 84 degrees every day were there, and the biggest 'problem' we had were two really windy days at the end of our trip. We got over it. The pool staff actually hooked us up with a free cabana because there were hardly any people at the pool on one of the windy days. We paid $250 (yikes!) for a full day cabana rental so that my husband could tell all his friends that he watched the NFL draft poolside in Maui. I, being the new and accomodating wife, gladly went along with the fully stocked, fan-conditioned, plasma tv cabana. I kind of felt snobbish siitting in one of the seven cabanas that sit slightly up above everyone else at the pool, but I enjoyed myself. It was our week to splurge! The hotel has a complimentary shuttle service to various different places within Kapalua. I highly recommend the Plantation House for sunset dinner. I'd pass on the Pineapple Grill, except for maybe eating a quick bite off the bar menu. We heard great things about sandwiches at the general store, but we never made it there. We were so comfortable at the pool that we didnt spend too much time down on the beach, so I can't comment too much on that. The view of Molokai from the resort is beautiful. Kapalua is in a great location, about a 15 minute drive from the touristy Ka'anapali and Lahaina areas. Off-site recommendations: Haleakala bike tour (28 miles downhill after watching the sun rise at the top of a volcano), and the Old Lahaina luau. This luau is much more authentic than the others. I wasn't overly impressed with the food there, but it was just about the experience. Pacific'o restaurant in Lahaina was delcious and romantic. The Road to Hana is something you have to do just because everyone does it, but it is a long long day of driving. We chose to ride it ourselves instead of with a tour bus just so we could pick and choose what we wanted to stop and see. We enjoyed the Seven Sacred Pools and the Black Sand Beach the best. One more thing -- if you are renting a car, drive around the southwest side of the island when coming from the airport, as opposed to going up and around the northwest side of the island. I thought I was taking a shortcut when looking at the map, and we wound up on poorly paved roads basically dangling off the cliffs for 20 miles while trying to steer clear of locals that just buzz past you. It had all the makings of a bad start to the trip, but we survived. Summary -- go there. It's expensive, but worth the money. It's hard to beat this place. I loved it. I'd go back tomorrow if I could.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cBOOK YOUR VACATION THIS MINUTE!\u201d", "Author": "Jeannie H", "ReviewID": "UR17133632", "Content": "My daughter and I returned from a 9-day stay here last week. The property is spectacularly beautiful (which I already knew), well-maintained, and the staff was stupendous. I simply can't laud them enough, from the maids to the Terrace breakfast waiters to the valets to the pool staff. All were very friendly, professional, and immediately accommodating. I merely had to whisper and our needs were met. The remodel is unbelievable. The hotel is now the only 5-star property on the island. I stayed here prior to the over haul and the decor was all old world luxe (and getting worn) -- now it is hip, Hawaiian, and brand-spanking new. Our Residential suite was awesome -- 900 sq ft with 2 balconies, lovely furnishings plus refrigerator, freezer, blender, microwave, sink, dishwasher, martini shaker (you name it), etc. The bathroom was large and lovely. The products were by Bulgari. Two large flatscreen TVs, wireless connections, and an Ipod player/charger completed the picture. (I think there was a DVD player too.) The pools are wonderful and if you feel super self-indulgent, you can rent cabanas that have large screen plasmas (they were full almost every day!). DT Fleming Beach was rated as the world's top beach in 2006 (I believe). I spent about 3 hours in the water everyday. One day, a pod of dolphins (at least 20) came through and were swimming quite close to me. One kept jumping and twirling in the air. It was amazing!! The property has some wonderful lava formations just off the golf course (near the beach) very worth exploring and there are hiking trails with terrific views up in the hills behind the hotel and zip lines too. You can ride the shuttle up and walk or run through a Koa forest (initially) all the way back to the hotel -- probably about 8 miles in total but mostly down hill (watch your footing). The iron men and women among you could run it uphill for a harder workout. (My daugher who is 20 and rows varsity college crew for the Ivy League {can you tell I'm a proud mom?} did part of it and pronounced it a \"decent work out.\") The gym is well-stock with recumbent bikes, ellipiticals, treadmills, machines, and free weights. There are a number of classes and very fit instructors. A brand new fabulous spa is opening its doors any day now -- I heard from a PR person who took the tour that it is amazing. Re food: The Banyan Tree restaurant (on the property) is my favorite restaurant on Maui -- forget the very over-rated Pacific'O in Lahaina (it was expensive and so mediocre that the woman at the table next to us stormed out). The Banyan Tree has been consistently excellent over a long period, despite the change in chefs. It's expensive but if you love fine cuisine, worth every penny. Check and see if the unique musical group, Ranga Pae, is playing. The Terrace buffet breakfast was fantastic!! Book it with your package, otherwise it costs around $70.00 for two, with tip and tax. We only had to eat one other meal per day. I stocked our fridge with yogurt, etc. (Right now there is an incredible package on Expedia for every fourth night free and breakfast included. It is so worth it!!! I splurged on one of the residential suites and was delighted.) There is a Sushi restaurant on site and a beautiful lobby bar that serves until late. I didn't try either because my daughter, the athlete, has a very particular diet and doesn't drink. But they looked great and I heard good things. Room service was good (my daughter, a picky eater, kept talking about the pizza). Down by the beach, there is another restaurant that serves tropical drinks and burgers, etc. There are beach chairs and a towel station nearby and it is a great place to position yourself for lounging all day. One caveat: Kapalua is windy. It blows around the entire property which is quite large. I personally liked the wind (I've gone to Kapalua for years) -- it never gets unbearably hot, like it can in Wailea where all those fancy hotels are jammed together with lots of tourists. We opened our balconies at night and the wind blew through and refreshed us. So, walk on the beach, frolic on the beach but position yourself up on the shore near the restaurant -- it's an idyllic spot and you are sheltered there (shade and wind-wise). There are two others beaches within walking distance of this property -- the wonderfully tame Kapalua Beach and Oneloa Beach. The latter is practically deserted because people walk down to it and it looks entirely reefy, it's not -- walk to the other end and there is sandy bottom. No shade though. The property is close to Lahaina and Kaanapali and very close to Kahana and Napili -- where other good restaurants and beaches can be found. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Book your trip today!It is a very different experience than touristy Kaanapoli. PS If there is a sailor among you, you must go for a sail on America II. If the trades are blowing, you'll have the ride of a lifetime versus the other boats which usually motor or barely put their sails up.

Inept service, overpriced and overrated food service and nickel/dime mentality. 1. Grounds/Property. Kapalua is truly beautiful, the whole development is manicured and peaceful unlike the more commercial developments of Kaanapali. 2. Rooms. Fully renovated and up to the standards of a five star property, although the fairly industry standard nonsense of \"ocean front\", \"ocean view\" and \"mountain view\" are exploited to the maximum here as no room is really ocean front since the property is about 1/4 mile from the shoreline and the entire property is angled away from the ocean. Our \"ocean front\" room required neck straining to see a slice of blue. 3. Service. We found the property to be understaffed at the pool, valet and in the restaurants. It was a very quiet week and it appeared that a lot of people were given time off or were laid off. We had asked about a good beach for snorkeling at the valet desk, we were told that Kapalua had its own beach that we could get to by shuttle, we were told that it was part of the hotel complex. When we arrived we found out that it was no longer part of the Ritz' charging program so we were unable to get chairs, snorkels or anything else as we had no money. In addition, towels were not available at all, the valet had towels and never offered us one. Needless to say we turned around and went to the valet, who said, \"sorry, I wasn't really sure how they were set up, I've never been there myself\" - two hours of premium vacation time down the drain. 4. Restaurants. We invited guests from off property to dinner at the Banyan Tree. Again, a beautiful venue, but things were obviously lacking. In this case the food was, as our guest described it, \"Elfen\", portions were obscenely small, really, really small. Of course the prices were substantial for miniscule portions, truly laughable. The food itself was truly delicious, but it would have cost $1,500 to get a full meal for four. We called for a pizza when we got back to our room and our guests stoped at McDonalds on Rt. 30! The breakfast buffet was passable when compared to other properties of similar price, but somewhat hidden cost as it is included in many room rates. The best opportunity for food at anything like a fair value is at the Honolua Store. The sushi restaurant was mediocre, overpriced and lacked any kind creativity or specialness that you would expect in a Ritz property. 5. Pool. Deserves its own category, it was like a carnival in its absurd prices, lack of shade for less than $75 for a mini cabana chair and over priced and extremely limited service. It was beautiful, despite being away from the beach and very, very windy, but was something of a tourist trap within the hotel. Many other properties on Maui offer better value. We also stayed at Four Seasons Hualali and it was pure paradise - it took everything that the Ritz made a mess of and made it perfect. Simple things like cold bottled water for free, amuse buches in the restaurants, smiles on the employees and lots of gracious amenities at the pools.

I called two days before our visit to inquire about ongoing construction (no), refrigerators in the room (yes) and availability of boogie boards on site (no), but the phone went unanswered twice in a row. After letting the phone ring more than 50 times, I emailed a message detailing my frustration. Within 20 minutes, the executive rooms director called me, apologized and answered my questions. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite, compliments of the executive rooms director. It was a beautiful room with a full kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom, with patios outside both the living room and the bedroom. We stocked up on breakfast and lunch items, so we'd be able to maximize time on the beach and by the pool. Honalua General Store, on the premises, is excellent for stocking the room. We spent morning coffee on the patio with the colorful birds and ocean breezes. We had dinner at Plantation House just north of the hotel. It's high above the ocean on a golf course, with sweeping ocean views and killer sunsets. The food was excellent as well. It reminded us of Sea Watch on Wailea, and found out it is owned by the same restaurant group. Pineapple Grill on the Ritz's golf course was also excellent and has half price appetizers after 8pm. Dollies Pizza in nearby Kahana was recommended by every local we asked, and it was perfect on an evening where we wanted to stay casual and bring leftovers back to the room. Really delicious. Sensei, right next to the Honalua store, was fantastic. Great sushi. There's a branch in Oahu too. Snorkeling was the best on Kapalua Bay, and the Ritz shuttle will drop off right there. It's in the same parking lot as the Sea House restaurant and if you didn't know where it was beforehand, you would miss it, so be sure to ask for a ride.

We, therefore, had no problem booking a resort view room this time also, but we ended up being escorted to an ocean/pool view room - a very nice surprise. I'm not 100% certain but, due to the layout of the hotel/resort, I don't think you could end up with a room that overlooks the car park or anything unsightly. I mention this because I've read reviews from travelers who stayed in other hotels and their \"resort\" view did mean looking out at the car park. I found our room to be spacious, especially the bathroom (double sinks/separate bath and shower), and loved the wood floors and the slightly more modern take on the traditional Hawaiian resort decor. The balcony was spacious too. There was a flat screen TV, but we got the best use out of the Ipod docking station. There is a $20/day resort fee. However, the car park (for self-parking) and wireless high-speed internet access in your room are free (presumably because they're already covered by the resort fee). I know the weather in Kapalua is a frequent discussion point. I'm fair skinned, so very hot and/or humid weather is not for me. For that reason I found the wind/breeze refreshing. It kept the temperature manageable for me (mid-80s the entire week we were there) and made for a pleasant day by the pool. There was no rain while we were there. Breakfast was included in the package we purchased, so we had the breakfast buffet everyday. The Belgian waffles are my favorite, topped with macadamia nuts and coconut syrup! Tip - unlike the last time we were there, you have to actually ask your server for the coconut syrup, but make sure you do because it's not to be missed. As it was a buffet, the only other thing our server was responsible for was bringing us coffee and juice but, for some reason three of the six days they forgot our juice order and had to come back and ask us again - I did find that a little odd considering we were at the Ritz. We didn't use many of the hotel services - we always parked our car ourselves in the self-parking section and we didn't use the concierge. I did notice that there wasn't an iron in our room (even though there was an ironing board), but upon calling housekeeping one was brought to the room in less than 5 minutes.

Rented a convertible Sebring car through Dollar and drove all over the island. Less than 5 minutes to Napili, about 10 to Kaanapali and about 15-20 to Lahaina. Took us about an hour to get to Wailea. We liked the seclusion but since we live in a big city with tons of traffic, a 20 minute drive was a piece of cake. Outdoors: Loved the cascading pools. They do have a small kiddie pool but kids do still swim in the bigger pools. It was not an issue when we were there. Lots of lounge chairs so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any trouble getting one, but they are terribly uncomfortable! They did have floats available in the pool as well. It was very windy at the pool some days and drinks did get blown over. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me very much, but I could see how this could be a negative for some people. The weather was very nice while we were there with only one quick shower. Grounds were very well kept and there were beautiful flowers and plants everywhere. The beach was a little way away from the pool area but not a big deal. Walk down and then get the golf cart to bring you back. Beach: This was my one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gripe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about Maui. I overall prefer the beaches that we have visited in the Caribbean and Mexico. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that the hotel had no loungers or service on the beach. It seemed that people brought their own chairs to the beaches. We did that later in the week, but it was very different than our typical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach vacations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We also visited Wailea, Kaanapali and Napili beaches. Room: There was a convention there for part of our stay and our room type was not available so we were upgraded to a suite. We loved the room and the space. The kitchen was well stocked and we made breakfast in the room several mornings. There were lots of drawers in the room and closet area for storing clothes, etc. It was a very comfortable place to be. The view was of the grounds. Hotel Restaurants: We ate dinner at Kai Sushi at the Banyan Tree and had a very nice experience at both. I preferred Kai because I felt it was more relaxed and I liked the menu better overall. Service: The valets were all very friendly and called us by name. Check-in was great and everyone we encountered throughout the hotel would give you an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aloha!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The only spotty service we had was by the pool one day. Maui Excursions: Paragon Sunset Sail/Whale Watch-Really fun crew and sail. Basic snacks and any kind of drink you could want. We saw a whale breach and did the performance sail back to the dock. Kapalua Adventures-We only got to do 2 out of 4 zips because they said the winds were too strong. What we did get to do was lots of fun and awesome scenery but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that we had to ask for refunds. I think the company should have offered it before having to ask since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the complete experience. Shopped at Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village (ABC has practially anything you need), Front St in Lahaina and in Wailea. Some very unique finds and also lots of stores that you can find in many malls throughout the U.S. Drove to the top of Haleakala and had lunch at Kula Grill. Highly recommended. Was very glad we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the biking. The roads were a little narrow and winding and cars and bikes shared the road. I enjoyed driving it ourselves in the convertible. Other Maui restaurants: Feast at Lele-Our favorite night in Maui. Most of the food was really good and liked having our own server and table. The show was lots of fun to watch and we took some great pictures! Hula Grill-Fun for sunset cocktails and appetizers. Live music and fun to meet other travelers. Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-Quick service. Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but nice bar area. Had Caesar salads, fish and bread. All very tasty! Pretty casual. Honolua Store-Cheap breakfast and lunch in walking distance to the Ritz. Also a good place to get snacks, wine, etc for the room. Kula Grill-Neat place. Reminded me of how Hawaii probably was many years ago. Great pizzas, salads, wraps. Sea House in Napili-Had a nice lunch here. Service was pretty good. Fish and chips were great. Right on the beach. D\u00c3\u00a9cor in the restaurant was a little dated, but who cares when you have the great view outside.

To start it is a beautiful hotel. The setting in Kapalua is very nice. The renovations made recently appear to be a good investment. The pool area is very nice however there is little to no shade if you are looking for some around the pool area. The weather in Kapalua is very hit and miss. Unlike Wailea where they get less than 10 inches of rain a year, Kapalua gets a significant amount of rain and wind. The first three days we were there the tradewinds were whipping around bringing rain and clouds. The last four days the tradewinds shut down and it was sunny hot. The good thing is if it is raining in Kapalua drive 10 minutes south to Kannapali and it will be perfect. You just have to plan your days at the beaches accordingly. Now onto the service issues. The service is just flat out bad. I am not a huge service customer as I perfer to park my own car and get my own towels, but a hotel like the Ritz that prides themselves on service and charges big $$ for it, the Ritz Kapalua completely misses the mark. The bellman took 2 hours to get luggage to our room after I discovered it sitting in the lobby not being watched that whole time. When we checked out I gave them a two hour notice because I did not want a repeat. They were late. We passed them in the hall after waiting 1/2 hour past the time I asked them to come. The pool for the most part was unattended. The housekeeping was OK. There were issues with the bathroom not being that clean. You had to call and tell them exactly when you would be out of your room or they would let your room sit all day until they finally got there. We only ate at the Terrace restaurant for breakfast which was OK but not worth the $60 for two people not even close. For breakfast, we had two other reservations at Ritz restaurants but cancelled after the breakfast. The Honalua General Store right outside of the hotel is the way to go for breakfast. The Plantation is a great restaurant for dinner but very expensive. It is about 2 miles from the Ritz. Up on the hill. The beach at the Ritz is nice but the water is not nearly as clear or smooth as Kannapali. It does have three lifeguards that just kind of hang out, it is a public beach as are all Hawaii beaches but fairly quite for a public beach.

We got to the property late on a thursday evening and were assigned rooms that were not together. The reception clerk stated \"you will be staying in these rooms for the duration of your visit\" in a rather direct tone and proceeded to hand us our keys. Upon trying to explain the efforts made to ensure the correct room assignment, I was told that all the adjoining rooms had been given out and that I should have paid more for a suite but those were not available now anyway. No effort was made to even give the illusion that they were going to try to find a way to fill my request. (By the way, request means no guarantee even if someone says differently over the phone) Now since this was a business/vacation trip and I brought my 15 month old son and paid the way for a nanny to help while I was away at conference, I certainly wanted to have some proximity to the other room. Needless to say that didn't happen until 3/4 of my 8 day stay was up. I was unhappy about the outcome but upset about how it was handled. I called to the front desk after check in to voice my dissatisfaction. I was placed on hold for 20 minutes. Another time hung up on. I called back to speak with a manager and was instructed to call at another time. The manager was polite but did nothing but apologize. There were other problems too, In- room DVD did not work and engineering couldn't fix it. It took 2 days to figure out how to get the DVD to play on the TV through their entertainment system. Finally had to rewire from behind TV to DVD with an RCA cable running across the entertainment system to make work. Apparently all of the DVDs were not working right, they were taking them out of the rooms as we were leaving the property. In- room alarm clock not reset when rooms cleaned. Alarm went off at 3 am on first night. New alarm clocks so engineering did not know how to set. We were told to just unplug and use wake up call. If you walked halls late at night, other rooms had alarms going off. Ice machines were removed from our entire floor because they were not working They had to send someone to another hotel to get a crib because they were all out (I \"requested\" one but apparently those are first come first serve as well) One phone in the room was not operational Room service was inconsistant. One day the fruit plate was huge the next skimpy. Fruit plate is better later in the week. I ordered breakfast in the room every morning, timing was off on delivery. Ordered out from onsite restaurant (Pavillions) Part of meal was left out. Had to go back to get it. Bellman 20-30 minute wait Pool service is scant. If you want a drink, you are better of to get up and get it. Charges were placed on the bill that were not supposed to be there. I was charged double for valet. Construction still happening during day. Work out facility OK, no mens/womens changing rooms. One common locker area and one bathroom with shower in it. If you are looking for steam rooms or sauna or private changing area, not at Ritz Kapalua. Overall, the experience was full of little slips and mishaps that individually might be no big deal but together do not constitute the 700+ $/night charge.

The interior designer they used turned a standard hotel room into a chic, hawaiian-inspired masterpiece. Teak wood floors, honed stone bathrooms and gorgeous teak louvered his-and-her closets. Even the table lamps and burnt orange chaises were beautifully selected to add designer-punch to the room. I got a lot of ideas for my next home remodel. Every hotel on Maui should tour these rooms to understand what a tastefully designed room should look like (that means you, Grand Wailea!) The new refrigerators were so convenient to hold waters, fruit, wine, etc. Bedding was top notch. Bulgari toiletries were of the highest quality. Every morning we went to the lobby to have complimentary Kona coffee (they put away the coffee at 8am so you need to get there early) and read the WSJ and local paper. Then it was off to the Fitness center which is among the best we have every experienced. Like all hotels on Maui, food and beverage prices are outrageous at the Ritz. Best mai-tai's on the island but you will pay $12.50 plus tip for about 4 ounces of liquid nirvana. Add a burger and fries to that and you are looking at $35 for a quick snack at the pool. My only complaint is they need to designate an adult's only section at the pool or for one of the jacuzzi's. While relaxing in the jacuzzi one afternoon, I was treated to a mother who decided to change her daughter's dirty swim diaper under water. Several other parents brought their bare bottomed toddlers into the jacuzzi with them to spend some \"quality time\" together. Yuck! Servers at the pool were easy to get but I felt the pool boys could have done a better job of removing abandoned towels and other litter. Mostly I just saw them hanging out in the pool shack. Other than that, we had a lovely and very relaxing vacation at the Ritz. To really appreciate The Ritz, you need to stay at the Grand Wailea. Wow, what a difference. I'll post a very different review under that section. One word to the wise, if you are looking for a room with solitude, do NOT allow them to place you in a room that begins with 26 or 16. This is the level that all residents of that wing use to get to the elevators. All day/night you will hear extremely loud groups walking the hallways and discussing their plans and adventures.

The hotel is gorgeous and newly renovated and the location is spectacular. I can't say enough about how beautiful the cascading pools, the beach, the small town of Kapalua and the hotel rooms were. However, the service is not on par with other Ritz locations as well as the fact that though they are as or more expensive than the Four Season's Wailea the Four Seasons completely outclasses them on service and attention in every aspect. Check in was confusing to the employees. The pool is horribly serviced. There was always a lack of towels at the pool and at the beach, and on top of it the pool lounge chairs were not cleaned up or opened up for new sunbathers throughout the day. If someone used the lounge chair their chaise cover and towels were left to lay there for hours thus giving the impression that there were no chaises available throughout the day. At five o'clock the attendants started going around collecting towels and straightening up where at the Four Seasons which we have stayed out several times as well as for two days prior to our arrival at the Ritz, the chaises and pool were well attended and kept neat and clean. Drink cups and pieces of pineapple and food dishes were left to linger. Granted, it was spring break and the hotel was full but this was unacceptable. There seems to be lacking a level of middle management at the Ritz Kapalua thus the workers are not kept on their toes or held to any standard. Also, the winds are wicked up at the Ritz--called the Kapalua Winds--the south side of the island is warmer and not so windy. The beach is a good walk but they have a cart that drives guests up and down from the beach if you don't want to make the walk. The breakfast at the hotel was good but not great, instead we walked up to the little general store right outside of the hotel and had breakfast there which was casual and much cheaper. All in all, I would go back because it is so very beautiful there and I would hope that service improves.

The pool...not heated and while my children and many other children wanted to get in the water. I as well as many other parents didn't want to get in. It was just too cold and everytime you moved a rush of cold water went past you. When you stepped out of the pool you would freeze. It felt terrible not at all like a tropical pleasure. I called and complained and was told the pool could only be heated to 82 degrees. They never did heat it up, the water was frigid. For what we paid I think we should be comfortable in warmer water. As far as service, it seems there laundry service has a gliche because there never seemed to be enough clean towels. Poolside towels were always in short supply. In our room we always had to ask for bath and face towels. I used our laundry bags 2 days in and they were never replaced. We had to ask for an iron, but we did keep it for the week. Room service was all over the place one day you would get your order in 30 minutes and then there was the absolutely unacceptable 1 hour and 40 minute wait. The employees I found to be very friendly...that being said the service was not that great. I found I had to make a lot of concessions and excuses for things that would go wrong. I was always having to say\"that's okay\". Like riding up the elavator with housekeeping and her cart of dirty laundry because the service elavator was broken...that's okay. Or to the poolside waitress for telling me their espresso machine was broken so I would have to wait another 30 minutes for my coffee...that's o.k. Or the hotel engineer that said the cable box on my t.v. was on the fritz so I couldn't watch my program...that's o.k. Which is why I rate my overall experience \"OKAY\". As far as being a Ritz Carlton, I just don't see it. I mean the rooms are newly renovated so of course they're nice, not spectacular, not at all roomy. To me they are just clean and unworn. The look of the hotel is very understated and needs more finness and finishing touches. Or maybe the look they were going for is some kind of fusion of Eastern simplicity mixed with South Pacific ambiance. What ever it is, it didn't take my breath away at all.

We had to ask for one and so did other guests that we spoke with. This is unheard of at any hotel, let alone a Ritz! The bathroom did not include Q-tips and cotton balls - that's a small thing I know, but its something that has always been included in other Ritz properties. 2.

It is unkempt and the reason indicated is because it is public. We went to Kanpali and the Westin and other hotels had chairs, etc on the beach, so I really don't know what the issue is; but its a shame that you're in Maui and can't enjoy the beach!! 4. The lounge chairs by the pool are uncomfortable - there's no padding on them. This is very unusual and we have never experienced this at other Ritz properties. The concierge was extremely helpful with dining suggestions and car rentals and activities. The front desk, bell men were also very helpful. The free shuttle to the other areas of Kapalua were great and made it easy to get around. The Plantation House is a great place for breakfast and dinner. The view is amazing. We enjoyed our stay and the price was right as we received the conference rate for the nights we paid on our own; but the Ritz needs to get on the ball and step it up to bring this property to the same standards as other Ritz properties. I don't think its worth the full price at this point.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nashville", "Title": "\u201cFelt like royalty\u201d", "Author": "meredith0301", "ReviewID": "UR14179957", "Content": "We just got back from our honeymoon at the Ritz in Maui.

Will post pictures upon my departure. The rooms are amazing. This property has done a great job in satisfying the older Ritz-Carlton guest that has been with them for years while making it feel more modern with a more modern flair and new technology in the rooms to attract a younger crowd like myself. Upon check-in we were asked to verify our rate. When the rate was $250/night higher then our confirmation we were asked to show our confirmation which I did. I thought that would be it. The next moring we had a message on our hotel phone asking us to again provide the front desk with a copy of our confirmation in order to prove our rate. I took great offense to the fact that the Ritz asked me to \"prove my rate.\" It was squared away after that. We reserved an ocean view room in the honeymoon package which included complimentary valet, resort fee, $200 food/bev credit, champaigne, photo albumn, etc. We were upgraded to a \"Residential Suite.\" This is the way to go. These suites are 850 s.f. with a kitchen, living room, large bedroom and large bath. The kitchen has an awesome huge eat around granite bar top, approximately 6'4'. It is really awesome. Suite features Sub Zero pull out drawer dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer. It was very nice to bring your own food and drinks to your room. Suprisingly, many guests had their own food and drinks at the bar and the resort had no issue with it. We saved a ton by doing this. I would highly recommend anyone looking at a regular room to compare the price for the Residential Suite. You will likely save the price difference plus more in the savings of food and drinks. Recent posts have mentioned loud noises at the pool due to construction. All of the construction appears to be gone as we didn't have any construction noise during our stay which started on Feb 22. Housekeeping is not up to par with a Ritz. The coffee pot was not cleaned for 4 days. The shower door (as previous poster mentioned) appeared like it had not been cleaned in months. I just got the feel that the did a quick cleaning by fluffing pillows, etc. Amenities were not consistently replinished daily. The Spa will not be in its own facility until mid May 2008. Currently they are on the 9th floor of the hotel. Currently there is not access to steam or sauna. The services are provided in empty hotel rooms. Since much of the spa experience is the atmosphere and ability to use steam and sauna I felt as if the spa should have offered a discount on services until they open their new facility. I scheduled the Men's package for $395 which included a 50 minute massage, a 30 minute peppermint scalp and foot massage at the same time with two therapists, and a facial. When the schalp massage started the foot massage therapist didn't show up. When I went to check out it was on my bill. I brought it to their attention and the clerk asked if I wanted it removed from my bill. Of course I did! He said there was a schedulding conflict. Poor excuse. I brought it to the GM's attention and they comp'd the entire service as well as offered a complimentary massage to my partner and me. I was satisfied with this. I have stayed at the Four Season in Maui previously. The Four Seasons is smaller and seems to be more friendly. The Ritz is a much larger property and you don't get the personalized service that we did at the four Seasons. Overall, I liked the property, however, will likely go back to the Four Seasons next year since they have just remodeled their rooms also.

The pool is very nice (though doesn't get many hours of sun this time of year), and the fitness facility is excellent.

No gesture was made to acknowledge this problem (not even a drink at the bar or something), even after I politely expressed my dissatisfaction and asked if there was anything they would be willing to do. After traveling over 12 hours, this was not a pleasant arrival. There were also little things wrong with the room - there was no lock on the patio door, and the lock on the actual room door did not work. No one came to address these problems even after I nofied the front desk on the second day of our stay. Also, little inconsequential things - there were no ice machines on our floor due to construction, the alarm clock was out of batteries, the room safe was locked on our arrival, one of my room keys was not keyed correctly - these were all little things in themselves, but the entire experience left me less than impressed. More importantly, the grounds were not finished yet, and there was construction noise and work vehicles outside our room most of the day - not exactly great for the vacation mood or view.

We saw landscapers, painters in and out, carpet layers, furniture stacked to be delivered, etc. They did their best to keep things out of the way of customers. The worst was at the pool after most of the group left. They were building some kind of cabanas and noise was very annoying. We ended up moving down to the beach to get away. The rooms were nicely redone (a little sparse on furniture). Loved the new tiled separate shower with rain type spout. Had great water pressue and temps the whole time. Always plenty of towels and refreshed in the evening. Two towels for each person at the pool and the attendants put them out for you too. They had plenty of good service for drinks and even brought fresh pineapple around while at pool. Great food & service any place we ate. Weather was probably the biggest negative. Very windy (tradewinds) and cloudy which we were told was pretty typical. If you drove a few miles south to Kaanapalli or Lahaina it was 10degrees warmer. They had a nice type of general store you could walk to just off the property with a very reasonable deli which we appreciated. My husband golfed at the Plantation which was wonderful with the most gorgeous views. Lots of walking up and down hills could possibly challenge some. If you don't rent a car it is very costly $120 to get to Lahaina for shopping or other activities. They do not have transportation to airport either which is another expense. Better off to rent a car and return it and yourselves to the airport. Once all renovations are done this would be a great place to stay especially if you like a quieter hotel.

I found this to be excessive, and since I am fair - I could only stay for a short period by the pool. I find it a shame that a high end hotel like this would charge for shade.... The food at the restaurants on location were very pricey. If you missed the morning free coffee (until 8 AM), then the cost was about $3 per coffee. I paid over $7 for a muffin and a coffee. Also, we had a glass of wine and a Rye and Ginger in the pub at night, and it cost us $21.

There was great snorkeling nearby and Lahaina was a relatively short drive for dinner at night. Rooms and service were, of course, impeccable. I HIGHLY recommend the butler drawn bath w/rose petals, I think it's called the Romance Package or something like that. The concierge desk is so accomodating and helpful booking excursions or with info. It's expensive to stay here, but you get what you pay for - it is a fabulous experience. If it is a once in a lifetime trip and you can swing it, definitely stay here!", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, MI", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding stay\u201d", "Author": "Katoblitzo", "ReviewID": "UR8017253", "Content": "If you have the ca$h to splurge - this is the place to stay in Maui!!

We had a wonderful time and were very pleased with the hotel overall. First, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dispense with some of the incorrect comments on this site\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the hotel is beautiful and in a beautiful setting. Rooms are not disgusting, just a little dated. Service to us was excellent, save a couple of small last day attitude problems. The pool was large and deep enough (5.5 feet at the center of each of the three pools). There are not wind barriers everywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a few that are discretely placed between the first and second tier pools. The weather was not horrible all the time. During our stay, we had one day of drizzly weather (thankfully the day we left). The rest of the time, it was sunny and breezy. The food at breakfast was very good. The Ritz is closing for an extensive 6-month renovation period at the end of June 2007. However, several things are worth mentioning. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised by the level of service at the Ritz. Most employees we dealt with were pleasant and accommodating. Some went beyond our expectations. A couple didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live up to Ritz standards, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bound to happen anywhere. Our package included an upgrade to an oceanview room from partial oceanview. When we arrived, we were shown to our room, close to the end of the Napili wing, by Michael, a 13 year veteran of the hotel. The only ocean view from the room was from the balcony, off to the right. When we asked what other possibilities existed, Michael immediately checked with the front desk. He showed us one alternative, but when we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that one, he told us to sit tight in our first room until he called us with other options. A few minutes later, he called and stated that we could move to a direct ocean view room on the end of the Napili wing the next day and stay there for the rest of our stay. The view from the new room was amazing (see photos) and made our trip. Michael didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to accommodate us in this fashion, but he went way above the call of duty to please us. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that. Our package also included a daily breakfast buffet. We thought the food was quite good, though the choices were a bit limited. Nevertheless, all the basics were there, and we were able to order fresh omelettes and Belgian waffles, and eat as much amazing Hawaiian pineapple as we wanted. Unless you want to throw money away during your trip, however, make sure that your breakfast is included in your rate. The bill for two buffet breakfasts tops $70 otherwise. Also be sure to check your hotel bill upon checkout. Twice we were charged for breakfast by mistake (something I saw on other reviews). They will adjust the bill if you mention it, however. The view from the Terrace Restaurant, where breakfast is served, is wonderful, overlooking the pool and courtyard of the hotel, with the blue Pacific beyond. Yes, the rooms were somewhat dated, but clean and bright. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any disgusting stains. The bed was a little soft for my tastes, but comfortable. The carpet was fine. Keep in mind these carpets are probably walked on with wet, sunscreen plastered feet on a regular basis. Luxury carpet is not something to expect in the tropics. We felt lucky to have any at all. Many hotels, such as those in Mexico, only use tile in the rooms, which I hate. We were told by an employee that the renovation, which begins at the end of June, will make the rooms approximately one and a half times their current size. The hotel is also redoing the entire pool area to try and compete with the likes of the Grand Wailea. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tall order, especially for the space the Ritz has. We think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sad, because the pool was better than we expected. It was deeper than others reported on this site, ranging from about 3 feet at the edges to 5.5 feet in the middle of each of the three pools, and the atmosphere with the palm trees, waterfalls and landscaping was relaxing. The water was not too cold, either. Two nice, though very hot, Jacuzzis were pleasant as well. We were there the week before and through Memorial Day weekend, and never had a problem finding lounge chairs. As far as the wind is concerned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, it can be pretty windy. Our first three days there was a light breeze. We were wondering what all the complaining was about. Then the famous Kapalua winds kicked in and for the rest of our trip, there was a steady 20-30mph wind, with higher gusts, through the entire area during the day. It was occasionally annoying at the pool (especially when you wanted to wear a hat), but by no means ruined our trip. We went to Fleming Beach (in front of the hotel), Kapalua Bay Beach, and Kaanapali Beach. Surprisingly, we liked Fleming beach the best. In our opinion, Kapalua Bay is overrated. If you are a die hard snorkeler, you may want to check Kapalua out because of the volcanic rock offshore, but the setting right now is awful. The Ritz is building its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153partial ownership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd resort at one end of the bay, and 3-4 cranes, along with construction noise, tower over the beach, destroying the touted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153idyllic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd view. Kapalua was also quite crowded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written up in tour books as being one of the best beaches on Maui. The surf was also a little rough while we were there. We left after about an hour. Napili Bay, a short walk through the Napili Kai resort from Kapalua Bay, is much bigger and in our opinion more beautiful than Kapalua Bay. However, neither Kapalua or Napili seemed good beaches for shallow swimming. The sand drops off rather sharply, with resulting waves that can knock you around. We also checked out the north end of Kaanapali Beach, north of Black Rock. A good place to read a book, but again, not for shallow swimming. We saw an elderly couple get knocked down and almost out into the water by the waves. I and another person had to help them up. Fleming Beach was never crowded, and had a nice area in the center where you could wade out and enjoy the gentle waves without running into rocks. Areas at the edge of the bay, which have some volcanic rock, are supposedly nice for snorkeling. A couple of other items are worth noting: the Hawaiian slack key guitar series at the hotel is excellent if you enjoy different kinds of music. The music is not the typical Hawaiian steel guitar (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Blue Hawaii\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), but Hawaii\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own folk music with performers playing guitar and singing in Hawaiian language. Second, for our 10th Anniversary, we booked two tickets on Volcano Air Tours. Stay away from this tour operator! Despite the claims (which we double checked by having the Ritz call them to confirm), there was no air conditioning on the plane, most sights are only visible on the right side of the plane, and the engine noise was deafening even with headsets on. At $400 a ticket, it was a huge disappointment and basically ruined our day. Because of the constant dipping and steep turning of the plane, both my wife and I got sick during the flight (along with at least one other passenger), everyone was sweating, and the pilot, Captain Bill, had the audacity to play his own band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music through the headsets and ask for tips at the end of the flight! Credit to the Ritz and Front of Office Manager JoAnne. We told her of our experience the next day and after the operator refused to grant any concession, she promptly removed the operator from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of recommended activities, AND credited us for one of the tickets since they had booked it for us. Another example where an employee went beyond the call of duty to please us. Our only negative comments about our stay at the Ritz have to do with the restaurant prices. We only ate breakfast there since it was included in our package. The other options on the immediate property were the Lobby Bar, the Terrace and the Banyan Tree. Our first night there we were tired and only wanted something light to eat. The Lobby Bar charges $20 for hamburgers and wraps (along with the Terrace). We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stomach such prices and ended up driving to get dinner down the road in Kahana \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like doing after 12 hours traveling. The menu at the pool bar is also very expensive. However, you can ask for the kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually hidden!) and order very good chicken fingers with fries for $7. We did that twice and were happy. The Banyan Tree looked great, but again, the prices were ridiculous, even for Maui. $40+ for entrees, $10 for side items and nearly $15 for desserts is just taking advantage of people. Although other good restaurants on the island aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better price-wise, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a limit. We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been able to enjoy our dinner knowing it cost so much. Our best meal was actually at one of the cheaper restaurants: the Hula Grill (beachside section) at Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village in Kaanapali. Their crab and macadamia nut wonton appetizers were awesome! Also try the firecracker fish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as good as any of the more expensive fish dishes on the island. Plus a great sunset if you get there on time. Plan on a 45 minute wait for a table. Other restaurant recommendations: Plantation Grill is nice for lunch or dinner (killer view). Pineapple Grill, Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and Kimo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were also good. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much (tough steaks), except for the view. Pacific \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcO was good but pricey. Finally, Old Lahaina Luau is fun, but a little expensive. Overall, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blown away by the food on Maui. Nothing made us go \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wow!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, except the wontons at Hula and the chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9 at Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Enjoy the Ritz this month, but plan to eat out if you want to save money. Four stars only because the rooms are a little dated and the restaurant prices are too high - otherwise it's a five star property.

I do have to say I was a little bit un easy staying here because I have always found the Ritz to be very stuffy. Superisingly this hotel was anything but stuffy. It was very airy and relaxed yet you still recieved the amazing service that the Ritz always provides. The hotel was decorated in a 1930's colonial hawaiian feel that was very relaxed and airy. Alot of out door indoor spaces with incredible views. The rooms are due for an update but were very spacious and clean. The beds were heaven and the bathroom was huge with seperated bathtub and shower all in white carrera marble. Every room has a balcony which either over looks the amazing grounds or the ocean (you can't loose either way). The hotel has an amazing pool that is has three different levels. I am not really a pool person so I did not spend any time at the pool but I did notice the size and the beauty of it. The beach was incredible about 500 hundred yards of private beach that had crystal clear waters and powder sugar soft sand enclosed by beautiful volcanic rocks and cliffs. There are lounge, chairs and cabanas with service at the beach which is very nice. You also have 2 of the best snorkeling coves in all of Maui on both sides of the resort which were absolutely breathtaking. There are 4 restaurants on the resort which were all fantastic especially the banyan tree!!!!! The Town of Kapalua is incredible!!!!! It reminded me of a little camp ground with pine trees and redwood cabins with stores, shops and restaurants. Kapalua resembles if Santa Cruz or Bolder Colorado were in Hawaii this is what Kapalua would be. Very charming incredibly beautiful and had an extremely special feeling. The Ritz is a huge resort and the grounds are enormous but I found it to be very private and very personal. You rarely saw anyone unless you were at the pool.

I booked our reservation about 4 months before our weeklong stay from 4/27-5/4. For the last 4 months I have jumped on here frequently to see the updated reviews on the Ritz as I wanted to make sure my honeymoon was as good as it could be. I noticed that it seemed people either loved it or hated it....no in between. I was worried but decided to keep our reservation anyway as I am always skeptical of how accurate these reviews really are. I am glad I did. I believe that it helps to know a little about the type of person that is giving the review in order to understand if the review maybe would apply to how you look at things. That said, my wife and I are 27, are both professionals, and have been fortunate enough to have traveled quite a bit for both work and play, and have stayed in some pretty nice hotels and locales. We wanted a romantic honeymoon spot that was quiet (i.e. not loaded with kids), that was fun, and also classy without being uppity. I am the guy who likes to see things, but likes to spend most of the time relaxing on the beach with a drink in my hand. My wife is the sight seer who has to be on a schedule and wants to see and do every possible thing she can. We are also \"foodies\", i.e. we love to try new food and restaurants. Therefore, we wanted a vacation that gave us lots of options. The Ritz and the island of Maui fit this need perfectly. The experience started off rocky at first. When I checked in I was told that they had upgraded us to an ocean view room but that the upgrade would be $140/nt extra. I was hoping to receive a complimentary upgrade as I have read that they do this quite a bit for honeymooners. My wife and I went and looked at the room and really enjoyed it (not to mention the rose petals they had laid out for us on the floor and all over the bed when we walked in!). However, we decided that paying that much extra per night was not worth it. The good news was, I worked with Maria at the front desk and after allowing me to look at a few different rooms to see what I liked they ended up moving us into a room that was in the exact same spot as the ocean view room we had previously, except it was on the 7th floor instead of the 9th.....and it was complimentary. I was very happy with it. The Ritz also gave us a photo album to put all our honeymoon pictures in which was a nice touch. Grace at the front desk also waived the $20/day resort charge for us, as a honeymoon \"gift.\" After check-in, all went smooth. Our bell hop, Byron, was awesome, he gave us all kinds of info, and even called up a restaurant in Lahina that he used to work at, from our room, and got us a reservation for that evening. Nice touch! As far as the rooms, here is my take. The partial ocean view room we were in was fine, except for the carpet. We were on the lobby level (7th floor) of the hotel....and our carpet in the entry way to the room was very dirty around the baseboards and opening to the bathroom. It looked bad, and definitely not what you would expect from the Ritz. However, the rest of the decor and room was great, bed was comfortable, lanai was nice, bathroom was very spacious and nice. TV's are old, but they are fine, work just like any other TV, and like others have said, who cares...you shouldn't be watching TV in Hawaii anyway!! The front desk seems to be very aware that some of the rooms have terrible carpet, because as I was checking in and looking at different rooms the front desk girl would constantly ask room service over the walkie talkie, \"how are the carpets in that room?\" They seem to understand that renovation is very needed and try to avoid putting people in those rooms that are in bad shape. And it sounds like those people who are able to stay in the Club Level rooms have had no problems. If you don't like the room, just go to the front desk and tell them to move you....they are more than accomodating. Also, with regards to housekeeping...we had no problems. They did a good job, were friendly, even thanking us for the tips we left them each day. My wife accidentally broke a bottle of makeup/moisturizer she had brought along and left it it pieces on the counter in the bathroom because she still wanted to use as much of it as possible. We came back to the room one day to find a note sitting besides the broken makeup bottle from housekeeping apologizing for breaking the bottle and offereing to replace it for us, and they didn't even break it! Other than the carpet in our room, everything else about the Ritz was great. The staff was all nice and curteous, the concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable, the pool was great (huge, not overcrowed, nice breeze) and the beach and beach restaurant were nice (try the pulled pork sandwich at the Beach House). The beach does get a rough surf, so I wouldn't recommend it for little ones, but then again, I wouldn't recommed the Ritz for families with kids anyway. I loved the location. Yes you are as far northwest as you can stay on Maui, but it is a great location. You are a five minute drive (at most) from Kaanapali and 10 minutes at most from Lahina. It is a windy at times in Kapalua, but it was also windy when we were in Kaanapali or Lahina. It rained a couple of days for about 5 minutes, and other than that the weather was great! The Kapalua resort is very nice, and quiet. You have Kapalua Bay which is calm and a great swimming and snorkling spot, and also DT Fleming Beach in front of the Ritz which is better for boogie boarding and surfing. By the way, the walk to the beach is no big deal, it is a 5 minute walk, at most from the hotel lobby. It is just down the hill from the pool, by the basketball and tennis courts. There are also some great restaurants in the resort as well, not to mention the golf. Vino (Italian tapas), and Sensei (sushi) are a MUST. Both of these are located right up the hill from the Ritz...easy 2-5 minute walk. We also ate at the Plantation House at the Plantation Golf Course. Amazing. Unbelievable sunset and views looking out over the course and then the ocean and Molokai island in the distance. Make sure you make a reservation for about a half hour before sunset...it is well worth it. I would also highly recommend playing the Plantation Course if you are a golfer.....$195/person if you are staying at the Ritz...$130/person if you play after 2pm. I am a 15 handicap and still loved it. I thought it would eat me alive, but it was actually very enjoyable. Well worth the money. I would also highly recommed going to Lahina to eat and shop. We ate at a few restaurants in Lahina that we loved, Kimo's, Pacific O, and we went to the Feast of LeLe Luau which is on the beach in Lahina (highly, highly recommend this luau for couples...it is expensive, but they put couples at their own table. The food is awesome, they keep the drinks coming, the show is entertaining, and the view of the ocean and sunset can't be beat...it is also put on by the same people who do the Old Lahina Luau). We were very glad that we chose to stay on the west side of Maui as opposed to the south side in Wailea. We have a couple friends of ours that honeymooned in Wailea a year ago, so we made it a point to go over there and check it out. Wailea is nice, but it is very crowded, and has the \"resort feel\", i.e. very touristy, nothing else to do really accept stuff at the resorts. West Maui just seems to have more to do, be more authentic, and it has Lahina which is really the only town with nightlife. Another friend of mine is honeymooning in Maui this October, and we recommended to him, based on what we saw, to either stay in Kapalua or in Kaanapali (either the Hyatt or Westin). Overall, I would definitely recommend the Ritz to honeymooners who want a quiet, classy place to stay, but also be close enough to awesome restaurants, activities, golf, beaches, and nightlife. Would would stay there again in a heartbeat. And after the renovation this year, the place should be even more amazing, and take care of the few small problems with the hotel. (I have noticed that many of the reviews quote different time frames for the renovation....the correct time frame is July-December...they hope to be done by X-mas). If you are planning your honeymoon for Spring of '08, I would definitely think about staying at the Ritz. Feel free to ask me any questions you have, and I will try to help as much as possible. Hope this helps some of you out there.

We booked a club level room, but were switched to a different floor after seeing the view from the only available room on the 8th floor.

The Ritz offers a bunch of free classes like how to make a lei, hula dancing, sarong tying, yoga, Maui meditation and I actually went to some of them this time. Most people don't go so you end up getting a one-on-one class. The BEST thing I did was go to the \"Sense of Place\" class which features a cultural advisor (very knowledgeable and super nice) who shows the documentary film \"Then There Were None\" and discusses the history or Hawaii and specifically the significance of the Ritz location. I would also highly recommend booking a reservation at Sensei. The sashimi is amazing and the mango crab salad hand roll was great too. As other reviewers have stated, the rooms are somewhat outdated. I believe we were told that it had not been updated in 15 years and the decor in the rooms reflects that. Also, we did encounter some similar experiences of ambivalent/not overly friendly staff - particularly at check-in and at the pool. It wasn't negative - just not what we've come to expect at the Ritz. Since we have been there before, we know that they did not welcome us in the same way they did in the past (offer us punch or water, etc). We missed some of the nice little touches they use to do in the past. For example, at the pool they use to give us Evian spritzes, little pineapple samplings, and staff regularly would check if we needed anything. Not this time. It's probably because of the closing. I think the attitude of the staff depended on their personal circumstances because the staff members that were friendly were looking forward to the closing so they could travel. Others maybe were bitter about the closing for 6 months and it showed. Overall, the staff at the Ritz were better than almost everyone we encountered during our subsequent stay on the Big Island. Looking forward to seeing the improvements next year.

We were a little concerned about some of the negative comments posted on tripadvisor, but after our stay, I have to wonder if the guests with negative comments were staying at the same resort? We stayed in a Club Level room that was absolutely gorgeous facing the Bay Course and ocean. The decor is classic Carribean......I read a lot of reviews complaining about the dated furniture......but what was in our room never goes out of style. True, the TV is old......if you watch a lot of television and need a new plasma, you will be disappointed. We try to watch as little TV as possible on vacation.....so it was not an issue for us. In our opinion, the Club Level is the only way to go.......it is a Ritz within a Ritz and offers highly personalized and friendly service. The entire Club Lounge staff was outstanding (especially Erin, Leslie, and Albert.....thank you!). They were there for anything we needed and surprised us with several in-room gift amenities that made our stay very special. The food and drinks were excellent. The multi-level pool is beautiful. It is big enough so you can always find a quiet spot in the sun or shade to read. True, it is slightly windier than in Lahaina/Kaanapali, but we enjoyed the cooling ocean breeze. Every morning my wife visited the spa to work out which had a lot of great amenities. A special thank you to Linda for the gift she sent to our room for my wife's birthday. Also, DT Flemming beach was awesome. We had a great time playing in the surf which was pretty big on a couple of the days. The walk down to the beach is less than 5 minutes. While we spent most of our time at the pool, everyday we would take a quick break, run down to the beach, and go for a swim. The drive to the big resort areas in Kaanapali and Lahaina is no more than 10 minutes. While fun for a few hours, these areas are extremely crowed, and we were always glad to get back to the solitude of the Ritz. Bottom line: If you are looking for a brand new room, plasma tv, pool with water slide, next door tourist shops/restaurants, and large crowds of people.......the hotels in Lahaina/Kaanapali and Wailea are probably best.

After a long flight, with 2 kids, from the mainland, this was a welcome greeting. After making the hotel reservations through American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts Program, we expected to have the amenities described by AMEX. Upon check in, we were politely told we would not get the amenities as we were staying on the Club Level floor.

Within moments of being inthe room, Mr. Hoy phoned and relayed AMEX has errored, but he would offer a suite upgrade on the tail end of our trip and an extened check-out. Mr. Hoy handled the situation with style expected from a hotel like the Ritz. When going to Hawaii, folks must expect a slower pace and not be upset when things don't come quickly. The folks working on the Club level at the Ritz were terrific. Many thanks to Kimberly, Erin, Kong and Leslie. If you can swing it, do the Club Level. With kids, the price is offset by the amount you save on things like water, soda and milk! Expect some quicrly things with the property, such as no towels on the beach after 5pm. After the long flight to Maui, all my kids wanted to do was hit the beach, but with no towels to be found, the water had to wait!

From the minute we arrived at the Ritz Kapalua, we felt like we had finally started the romantic honeymoon we desired.

The only other Ritz-related restaurant at which we dined was the Banyan Tree and it was quite good, too.

For those of you considering the Ritz Carlton Kapalua, you're right on! The Ritz offers a beautiful, romantic environment coupled with phenomenal service that no other hotel in Maui will be able to hold a candle to. Location, location, location! First of all the Ritz is located in the heart of Kapalua, an upscale area of Maui, surrounded by lush golf courses, and multi-multi million dollar homes. The drive into the resort makes you feel like you're going to THE RITZ! Kapalua itself is like a self contained town, it offers a complimentary shuttle to any of it's fine dining restaurants, and golf courses, just moments away from the Ritz itself. For the nights when you want to venture out into the more populated areas of Maui, the historic and popular town of Lahaina (known for it's nightlife) is only 10 minutes away, unlike Wailea, where its off on it's own, far away from any real nightlife. For my trip, I booked a club level room, which was the icing on the cake. The club level offers a private lounge, private concierges, and 5 complimentary food presentations daily, ranging from breakfast to dessert. The food is marvelous, presented so beautifully as you would expect from a Ritz. There is not another hotel in Maui that offers this same level of service. Between 6:30 and 10:30 they offered coffee, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, lox, pastries, juice, cereal, and bacon! Between 12:00 and 3:30 they offered gourmet sandwiches, pasta salads, green salads, beautiful desserts, and crudite. In the late afternoon they offered a variety of fruit drinks and teas and of course the famous Ritz Carlton cookies. Early evening they offered crab claws, oysters, variety of baked brie, cheese, crackers and so much more. Late night they offered cordials and sweets. The menu changed daily, but was always refreshing and high quality. If there was ever anything I wanted and didn't see they made sure to bring especially for me. Throughout the day they also serve whatever drink you wish, from coffee to tea, to bloody marys. The staff would even send you on your way with a plastic cup filled with your favorite cocktail. The club lounge even has a computer with internet access for your convenience. The club lounge staff is INCREDIBLE. The Ritz Carlton's motto is \"Ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen\" and during my visit it was just that! I must commend Leslie, Kim, Kimberly, Kong, and Albert for their excellence. They always remembered my name, remembered what type of drink I liked, and were so genuine. They mean it when they would say \"it is my pleasure!\" Any night I wanted to venture out for dinner, they offered their recommendations on restaurants, and even made the reservations, arranged the transportation, and always checked in the next day to make sure I was satisfied. Any activities I was interested in, they offered phamplets, and their recommendations and once again, arranged it all! WONDERFUL! The club level is worth every penny - the exclusivity of it made the whole trip! The resort itself is also top notch. The gym is perfect and up to date. The spa is tranquill. The common areas are very authentic, and rich. The grounds are kept very well! The pool and jaccuzzi were beautiful, never crowded or uncomfortable. I don't care what others might have said about the wind, but it is welcomed! It is so hot and humid in Hawaii, but in Kapalua there is a very nice wind that makes the hot and humid weather tolerable and pleasant. I don't think I could enjoy myself poolside very long if it weren't for the wind. I know a lot of people on Trip Advisor bash the Ritz because of the wind, but it never impeded my enjoyment! The restaurants are fabulous as well. You must try the Banyan Tree restaurant located in the Ritz. it is the best restaurants on the island! It has goregous views of the sunset and ocean, and the food is marvelous. Jojo the head chef even came to my table and introduced himself. Ranga Pi, the live entertainment are so good I even purchased one of their CDs before I left! As you have read, I enjoyed every moment of my trip to the Ritz Carlton. It offered everything I was looking for: tranquility, great food, lush accomodations, excellent service, and beautiful weather! I have very high standards, and would recommend this resort to my best friends, and associates. If the Ritz is this great now, I can't wait to go back after it's renovation!

I was, however, thrilled at having an extra couple of days to stay on Maui since I have been wanting to stay at the Ritz here for a number of years but never had the extra time to do so. That said, I am certain that people will disagree with my review of this hotel, and I have been trying to decide whether or not to write it. However, this site is designed for people who have all kinds of experiences, and perhaps at least one future reader will be able to avoid my experience here. I will start with the positives: (1) Beautiful setting--Kapalua is quite beautiful and removed from the \"hustle-bustle\" that is becoming Maui. But, if you do stay here, it is not a very convenient home base for any of the island's many activities. (2) Free self-parking--definitely good to avoid the $18 valet fee by parking it yourself. I never had a problem finding a relatively close spot. (3) Polite service, but I would not characterize it as warm or friendly; they are doing their job, but not with much caring or enthusiasm (4) Comfortable furniture in room and on lanai; very nice bathrooms with prerequisite separate toilet room, shower stall, and tub; GREAT bath amenities Okay, now the negatives (please stop reading here if you are squeamish): -On my third morning I decided to wake up at 3 am and head up to Haleakala for the sunrise; I didn't have to check out until 4 pm to move down to my hotel in Wailea (The Four Seasons, which I reviewed separately under their name), and when I returned to the hotel (around 11am), I went to lay down for a nap. There was a feather from the featherbed sticking me, so I pulled back the sheet to take the feather out. What I found was a dirty, stained (with yellow stains) mattress cover with hair (not mine) on it. It was absolutely disgusting. I cannot imagine a housekeeper seeing that and still making up a bed over it. The sheets are not that thick, and I was nauseated looking at what I had been sleeping on for two nights. I called down to get a manager to come to the room to look at it. Both the housekeeping manager (Robert) and the front desk manager on duty (Richard) both came to my room. After showing them the mattress pad, I told them I was amazed to find such a dirty and stained pad at a hotel like the Ritz. I told them I could not understand how a housekeeper could make up a bed like that. To their complete credit, they agreed with me, and offered me a credit for one night's stay. They also offered to get me another room to take a nap in (which I declined), and then offered to remake my current room, which I also declined. They then very kindly escorted me and my luggage down to the checkout area, and waited with my things while I checked out and got my car. I have to say, they handled the problem beautifully, but I still cannot get over the fact that it happened to begin with. This was not a little piece of hair in the corner of a bathroom. It was a dirty and obviously stained mattress pad that they saw every time they made up the bed. Yuck. -Other negatives: -There were a couple of billing problems (which they promptly corrected when I pointed them out)--I was charged twice for the same day of internet service--which is NOT included in the \"resort fee,\" and I was not credited with my meal credit under my travel package -Pool area is pretty loud, and the sound travels since the hotel buildings surround it on three sides -Restaurants: The Terrace Restaurant and Beach House are a little disappointing, and the Banyan Tree restaurant is inexplicably closed on Sundays (and Mondays--which is more understandable) So, under what circumstances would I recommend this hotel? Honestly, it is in a beautiful setting, but I cannot fathom the level of ineptitude (or just plain uncaring) that it takes to make up a dirty bed. So, if you are prepared to check your mattress pad when you check in, you will likely have a 100% percent better experience than I did.

This was our third visit to Maui-previously we had stayed at the Hyatt and Westin in Ka'anappli-but have always found it to be too noisy and 'busier' then Kapalua. We arrived at the Ritz ahead of schedule-checked in with no problem-cold juice and a lei greeting. We were shown to our room right away-garden view-very nice view though. The rooms are good-decent size, but I agree with others that the room decor is lacking-and not as 'plush' as one might expect. Okay-the king size bed was soooo comfortable-loved it! The hotel was very nice-the staff was excellent-always asking if there was something they could do for us etc...We used the concierge on several occassions: to book a few tee times at the Plantation course, dinner reservations and scuba reservations. They were quick, efficient and helpful. Parking was easy-unlike our stay at the Westin last time (2 years ago)-there was plenty of parking (at the Westin-there were several nights when there was NO parking available). The beach is a quick walk down a hill-very very easy. There are golf carts, but we preferred to walk. The Beach House should stay open longer-but we often got dressed for dinner and took a drink down to the beach and no one said anything to us. Maid service was twice daily-always timely. We had a great time at the Ritz-I do think this is less 'plush' then the other Ritz's we have stayed in-but we had a FANTASTIC vacation and would recommend the Ritz to anyone looking to enjoy Maui at a great property with a reasonable price and a bit removed from all the hustle and bustle.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cStay away\u201d", "Author": "ALKDVS", "ReviewID": "UR7115650", "Content": "What a disappointment!

Of course, they don't tell you that it disappears at 8 am, when most people are coming down. But that's OK, because it was lousy! The pool and beach service was atrocious, in that no one cleaned up towels after people had left, and the staff were more interested in talking among themselves, then in serving the guests some mediocre and overpriced food. I have stayed at the Four Seasons and Hotel Hana-Maui on this island, and both of them beat this place easily. Management was something more than indifferent but only barely. If you want a luxury experience on Maui, don't stay here--there are better places that get both service and luxury, and with better amenities as well. I have not felt so aggrieved in a long time.

This was my third trip to Maui - and my ninth trip to the Hawaiian Islands overall. By far, this was the most disappointing resort I've stayed in. Everything about this resort screams - we're not doing well, and we know it. I hear they are about to undergo extensive renovations - and they need it. It makes me wonder if the \"good\" staff have moved on to greener pastures as the renovation period approaches. The resort feels as if the wind has been knocked out of it. The architecture of the place is so uninspired. There's really only one viewing area of the ocean and the horizon - the lobby bar. And once you sit at a table, the terrace bannister obstructs most of the view. The \"Beach House\" area is somewhat of a joke. Since the hotel had to work around the ancient burial ground that was on the property (and boy do they downplay the fact that there are hundreds of bodies there) - it's quite a hike to the beach. This would be the place you'd think you'd like to stay to see the sunset - perhaps while sipping a Mai Tai. Unfortunately they shut the Beach House area down at 5p.m. And even if you wanted to walk back to the lobby bar and bring a Mai Tai back down with you - the sunset isn't spectacular as the sun just dips behind the hills - nothing as dramatic as the sun setting into the ocean which you can see from many other resort areas on the island. And don't forget the WIND. It seems as if they couldn't have chosen a worse place to build a resort. There are wind barriers everywhere. Add to that the mundane service and the little touches like pathway lighting being burnt out and it all adds up to a disappointing choice. This is literally the least Hawaiian hotel I've experienced on the islands. Take away the tropical print fabrics in the rooms and you could really be anywhere. And that's not what I want from a Hawaiian vacation. I am so thankful that we changed our seven day reservation to just two nights in order to take the drive to Hana and stay there for a few nights before finishing up at the Hyatt Ka'anapali.

Just for background, we are a young family, with two children ages 6 & 5. We do not have \"throw-away\" money but we do like to vacation well. We have stayed at numerous RC's, 4S's, etc worldwide. After reading some of the negative reviews on this site and then staying on the property, you will wonder to yourself, \"did these people stay at the same resort?\". Granted, the resort is due for a renovation (newer furniture, tv's, etc...), which is coming in July. The hotel will reopen for Christmas. That said, it was not \"falling apart\" or \"aged and ratty\" as a few reviews claim. In fact, it was very clean with twice daily maid service. Although I promised myself I would not go to Hawaii to stare at the corners of my room and public areas to see if the carpets were frayed, or search for coffee stains, I did anyway, and after 9 days at the hotel, I did not find any stains, but did notice in the corner of my room that a small section of the carpet was starting to look a bit worn. I can't believe I even took the time to write that. Seriously, the place is not falling apart, in fact it is very nice. The renovation will only enhance the quality of the rooms. Here are some thoughts by section: 1. The beach. DT Fleming beach was voted the \"Best beach in America of 2006\" by some guy named Dr. Beach. I do not know who Dr. Beach is, but I will say, the beach was beautiful. Big, fun waves were excellent for body surfing/boogy boarding. The sights and sounds of waves crashing, along with the views and the sandy beach were amazing. I would not take my daughters in the water on some days because the waves were pretty big. Kapuala Bay (right next door) is better for young kids and snorkeling. Some reviews claim the hotel is far from the beach and say negative things about the beach. Again, here is where I pause and say \"where were you staying ? The hotel rests on top of the hill overlooking the ocean, which creates stunning views and is a very short walk to the beach. If you had too many \"lava flows\" the night before, they have a golf cart/shuttle that will take you to the sand from the pool area. As an added bonus, on the first morning of our visit, we all woke up ridiculously early (East coasters) so we decided to take a walk to the beach. On the way down, we happened to see whales breaching in the ocean. Amazing. 2. Pool. Very nice, big with multiple levels, beatiful views. Pool service was good. The renovation will include an area designated as a \"kids pool\". Good idea. Although we never had any issues, I always looked for a spot away from sunbathers or people relaxing in the pool. Because the pool was big enough, I never had a problem finding an area to play with my kids. Tip: Unless the hotel is crowded, don't bother with the cabanas. 3. Grounds/Location/Weather. I thought the location was the best in Maui. A big resort with tremendous views and beatiful landscaping. Other activities were mini golf, bocce, shuffleboard and great tennis club. The gym was roomy (for a resort) with plenty of machines. Spa was very nice. Resorts in kaanopoli, Wailea and other areas are either \"cookie cutter\" or right on top of each other. Kapalua, to me is one of the nicest areas on Maui. Maui, like much of Hawaii, is a bit over-crowded and over-developed. It was nice to be in more quiet, remote area of the island. Kapalua also has some of the islands best golf (PGA Mercedes Benz championship is played in Kapalua every January). No crowded boardwalk. Don't get me wrong, it was very nice to visit kaanopoli, we were just glad to return to Kapalua. We also really enjoyed Lahaina. Definitely rent a car and explore the island (we did on an overcast day), especially north of the hotel. Lahaina was about 20 minutes away due to traffic and lights. As for the weather, we were there for 9 days. One day was not good (light rain/overcast). Another 2 days were a bit windier, but still able to swim/sit outside. Other days were postcard perfect. 4. The room. We stayed on the club level, room 2829. As mentioned above, the room was fine and maid service was excellent. It was large enough for two double beds and a roll-away. The four of us stayed in the room and were fine. Bathroom was big. The patio was big and we were lucky enough to have a magnificent view of the ocean and pool grounds. Note: Stay on the club level. It is worth it. Leslie, Kimberly and the other concierges in the club were awesome. Food was great and the staff were very helpfull in making arrangements. We ate at the club for breakfast and lunch. Usually stopped in at night for a drink/app before going out to dinner or after dinner for drink/dessert. During the day, it was a nice place to go for a drink or light snack. My girls loved the cookie jar. We ate off property for dinner otherwise, excpet for one night we went to the Banyan Tree for our 10 year anniversary dinner. Robert, our waiter was great and the food was very good. 5. Service. As mentioned above, the club level service was outstanding as was our waiter at the Banyan Tree. Check-in and check-out were fine. Lei greeting and tropical juice at check-in. If you havn't figured it out yet, we really enjoyed our stay and can not wait to return to the Ritz Carlton.

So, we had to go to the Lobby area to get a cup of their \"Complimentary Coffee\" that is part of the 18.00 per day service charge. Needless to say, walking into the lobby at 6am for coffee is not joyful. All the guests were scrambling over a coffee set up. The hotel is run down as they are closing in July for a complete renovation. So, expect everything including the Pool Lounges to be aged and \"ratty.\" We have about 40 large spider webs in the trees in front of our balcony with large spiders in them, which is a little creepy and distracting. The views are terrible, we have a peek a boo ocean view. No sounds of crashing waves or sunsets or any of the wonderful things that make Hawaii so special. The Service Staff have not been properly trained in the true meaning of \"service and hospitality\". They are proficient but don't expect any special treatment. They have a pool with 3 levels, one of the levels should be for Adults only, but instead their is alot of children. Which is fine, except if I was \"honeymooning\", I would hope for a different atmosphere. I would suggest for the RC Managment Team to visit a Four Seasons in a crash course on Service, Style and Operations. One visit to a Four Seasons will make anyone realize how disappointing this hotel is.....I hope in December when they re-open that everything is turned around. But given the off water, way north location I still would not suggest it to anyone unless they bring \"very special service\" into the equation.

They have small refrigerators in-room, but no mini bar. The in -room safe is keyed, so you have to take the key with you everywhere which is inconvenient. The pool area is really large which is nice, but the service at the pool was bad. Not nearly enough servers and you do have to wait a long time for drinks. Also, it can be hard to get someone to help you find a place to sit and the pool area does get really crowded. On one occassion, someone went to get us towels and set up our chairs and just never came back. The Terrace Restaurant was overpriced and not worth it. If you want a good and inexpensive breakfast, just walk over to the Honolua General Store and get breakfast there. They had eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc. This seemed to be where the locals in the area had breakfast and you can sit on the deck and eat there for $5 per person. Also, you can order sandwiches to go for a picnic lunch at Haleakala or in Hana. The Banyan Tree was excellent and the service there is what you would expect from the Ritz. We had drinks in the lobby bar one night and the service was horrible. They were completely understaffed and the atmosphere was lacking also.

One could literally die of thirst waiting for the pool staff to acknowledge your existence, much less bring you a ten dollar plastic cup of Stella.

The food is top notch, albeit expensive, but in the Ritz's defense, most food in Kaanapali is expensive and far from top notch.

The rumble of semitrucks is deafening and for those who like to jog along the road, this is completely unsafe. At Christmas the hotel is booked beyond capacity and the fighting for lounge chairs around the pool is fierce. Considering the amount of children under the age of 6 using the pool, I seriously would not recommend actually going into the pool. the bathroom closest to the pool should not be patronized without shower sandals and disinfectant. The gym is better than most hotels, but most cruise ships have three times the equipment. The stair access from our floor to the pool deck has clearly been used as a public urinal, as well as the odd room service delivery.

Vino's had good appetizers, and wine list, but main dishes were average. Service wise and Food wise Banyan Tree was the best, and Vino's, and Sansei were lacking.

Other tidbits from our stay is to do the Circle Island Helicopter Tour which show you the whole Island about $600 for 2 people for about 65 minutes and you get to see the whole Island.

We stayed at the Ritz over a period of about 2 weeks. We had our wedding at the Sacred Hearts Mission (next to the Honalua General Store), our reception in the Anuenue Room, and stayed there afterwards as our base for our Honeymoon. Our Deluxe Ocean View room (4th floor) was in great shape. The bathrooms were in good order, clean, and very large (separate shower stall and shower/tub). The TV was hilariously old, but worked fine. It's one of those things where you expect something nicer... but the reality is that for as much as we actually watched the TV while there... it simply didn't matter. We appreciated the decent-sized mini fridge that was empty for us to keep drinks and such that we bought at the General Store. It easily fit a six-pack of beer, 6 bottles of water, some food, and a decent sized Gatorade. There was only one small bleach stain on the carpet, but wasn't noticed until a few days in. I did get a complimentary room the day of the wedding to get ready in on the 1st floor (facing out) and I will say there was a noticeable difference in room quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even the hallways were darker and less inviting. Contrary to earlier reviews, we were given 2 bottles of water at least twice a day - sometimes three. The staff cleaned our rooms a minimum of twice a day and were extremely friendly. We had robes in our room as well. Towels were replenished/replaced fully every time they were in the room. Overall, I was VERY happy with the condition of the grounds and the hotel itself. The Christmas/Holiday decorations were stunning to say the least. The concierges were great every time we asked a question or made a reservation. The lobby greeter always said hello to me each morning. The lobby bar attendant was prompt the one time I sat there looking for a drink - and very friendly. The pool staff was excellent both days we sat out there - coming around every 30 minutes asking if there was anything we needed. They also came around with fresh pineapple every couple hours. The pool bartenders we encountered on both days were very talkative and happy. They were more than happy to order a sandwich only available at the beach grill and send it up. The beach grill was relaxed and offered decent service. In fact, there was only one bad employee we encountered the entire trip. My wife loved Joy - who ran the bracelet and lei making classes... she was genuinely happy to be there and you could tell. We saw no trash in hallways more than an hour or so. The putting course is fun for what it's worth (surface is more like fairway than green) and the bocce lawn was maintained well enough. The walk from the grounds to the beach is a 5-10 minute walk at most, but is all up - or all down. They had a convenient shuttle cart taking people up and down that we saw others taking. The beach was nice. By far, it was the best boogey-boarding beach we encountered on the trip. For pure sun worship - nothing is better than we saw at Big Beach - south of Wailea. The spa was very nice (as well as the gym). I had a sports massage and a signature facial and was very happy with both - especially the facial. The only Ritz establishments we dined at were the Pineapple Grill and Vino - and we were happy with the experiences. Vino is definitely more casual (atmosphere, not the food) than you would expect - which was honestly nice. Sansei was decent, but mobbed every night. Sushi there was only above average to me (except the Onaga... wow!). Please be sure to eat at David Paul's in Lahaina. The Honalua General Store is fantastic for a simple breakfast. For couples interested in honeymooning or having a wedding here - we had nothing but a MAGNIFICENT experience. Maria, our coordinator was superb with everything and made us feel as though our small wedding of a dozen people was as important as a 300 person wedding. The food at the reception was hands-down the best food anyone has had at a wedding. The entire staff that helped or was involved was wonderful. I know it's been said a bazillion times, but it's worth mentioning again. The Ritz is really out of the way from most things you will want to do while in Maui (if you're into doing the touristy things). It's windier and will drizzle more often there, so keep that in mind. You WILL be driving a lot to get places. The advantage though is that it is remote, and very quiet. There were only 2 days where the weather was noticeably bad during our stay. I've also experienced places MUCH nicer than the Ritz, but that's not what we were looking for either. I pretty much think your experience will boil down to this: If you are going to stay on the property for most of everything and expect to be pampered non-stop - you WILL be disappointed. If you want a warmer beach with calmer waters and a much warmer (temperature) experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Wailea might be a better choice. If you're looking for a top-flight experience overall with relaxation in mind and a great, unpretentious staff - the Ritz is for you. We were very happy with the experience and would go back again. As a last note: We also heard that the Ritz will most likely be shutting down for 4-5 months this summer/fall and opening again for November/December to undergo a massive renovation (something like 80 million dollars).", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cNOT a 5 star hotel...a well executed 4\u201d", "Author": "woods1966", "ReviewID": "UR6344536", "Content": "The fact of the matter is, this is NOT a 5 star property. Anyone rating it as such, hasn't stayed at 5 star properties. Regardless of its current condition and execution, by design of the resort and level of service, the Ritz is a 4 star establishment. The physical property, furnishing, service, accomodations, etc. are all very good in design and intent, but not best in class. That's not a criticism of the hotel, it's simply a fair assessment of the property based on years of travel for both business and pleasure at US and international 4 and 5 star hotels. So, with a level set that this is a 4 star establishment, here's my review: Rooms: Good size and lanais are well done. Furnishings and carpet are very dated and in poor repair. Furniture was damaged with hinges and handles missing or broken, lamp shade liners in many areas torn, carpet feeling it's age. Room features, were, frankly, lacking and surprisingly poor. No in room entertainment except very old tube televisions...no stereo, dvd, etc. No in room self coffee service. No in room honor bar. Very small and marginally useful in room refrigerator. Bathrooms were spacious and well designed...but clearly designed a decade ago. Functionally, fine. Bed, adequate, other furnture, also showing it's age. Lanai furntire, stricly low rent. Hotel Facilities: Pool...in good shape and well staffed. Clean. On site restaraunts...Banyon tree is superb. Bar in the hotel is laughable...airport bars have more ambiance. Beach, very nice and with good food and drink service at the waterfront. It is a 200 yard walk...if you can't walk that far without complaining, you've got issues. Beach is fine for lite swimming and body surfing, the left edge (as facing the ocean) is more shallow for an easier time. Workout facility, etc...all adequate. Services: Pool...good. Plenty of staff and good, courteous service. Housekeeping...no complaints. Food service, quite good to excellent. Banyan Tree is a real find...superb. Staff is generally courteous and very helpful. Our best scuba was an unsolicited recommendation from a young man at the pool who was checking out towels. Management: This is where the resort needs some work. On nearly every walk through the hallways going point to point, there were the occasional empty bottles, cups, brochres, whatever. That is NOT an acceptable level of property management at true 5 star resorts. Upon checking, 1 person in our 4 person party was greeted and presented with a lei...again, a fundamentally basic property management/guest services issue that should NOT get screwed up. Conceierge...courteous but on two occassions provided downright incorrect information regarding local beaches...that's, again, a staff management/quality control issue. Overall, the experience was 90% positive, WITH the proviso that your expectations are for a 4 star hotel. If you're expecting a 5 star property, your expectations will NOT be met. We would return with the expectation of paying a 4 star rate for the stay until substantial updates are made to the property, largely in the area of accomodations (furnishing, in room extras, etc)...the staff is doing a good job, but management needs to focus on the details. In terms of location, the Ritz is removed from other parts of maui, which is good for getting away from 'it all'...but does make driving to dinner off resort quite an experience.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corona, California", "Title": "\u201cOur first and probably last stay - Take the kids to the Four Seasons\u201d", "Author": "partyofour", "ReviewID": "UR6335635", "Content": "We are a family of four, 2 adults 30's-40's and 2 children, 3 1/2 and 5 years old. We booked our trip to the Ritz Carlton Kapalua to celebrate our 6th anniversary. We used Marriott Points for our stay which covered our room and tax but not the daily resort fee of $18 or the $15 a night valet parking. This was our second trip to Maui, we stayed in Wailea at the Four Seasons last summer. We did a lot of comparing between the Ritz and Four Seasons during our stay. The Four Seasons always came out on top. The Ritz was only at 39% occupancy while we were there from Nov. 28th to Dec. 3rd. We had almost constant rain from the evening of the 29th until we left on the 3rd - sometimes light sometimes torrential downpour! We got rained on at the pool, rained on at the beach, rained on during the Christmas Tree lighting, etc. We had to leave the resort every day and travel toward Wailea or Makena (loved Big Beach - gorgeous!)just to get some sun. If you're coming to stay here definetly rent a car, we almost didn't and boy would we have regretted that decision! I'll address the main complaints that I read so often here on Trip Advisor. The musty smell - we could definetly smell it when we got off of the elevator on the 5th floor a couple of times, no problem in the room or anywhere else for that matter. Did the smell ruin our vacation - no! Rooms needing renovation - Our room looked great to me. It was in no way dingy or dirty or falling apart. The bed was very comfortable and the furniture was in good shape. The bathroom was marble with a seperate tub and shower and double sink vanity. The room was extremely clean and kept that way throughout our stay. Yes the TV is old, couldn't even hook up the kids portable DVD player to it. With all of the rain we did watch TV more than we though we would! There were also 2 refrigerators in the room and not much closet or drawer space for a family of 4. I did peak in at a few rooms that housekeeping was cleaning and noticed some rooms with ugly peach carpet that did need to be replaced. It does appear that some rooms have been slightly updated and some have not. We saw different carpets, drapery and bedding in other rooms down our hall, none of which was very appealing - we lucked out! For those of you who are waiting for the renovations they are coming soon. We were told by several employees that an $80 million dollar renovation will begin in late July, with the entire resort being shut down from July - December. This is just word of mouth from the staff not the GM so who knows what the actual plans are. The long walk to the beach - It's a paved path that gradually winds down a hill to the beach, it's not a steep incline. It took a few minutes at the most to get to the beach. It is not a walk that will wear you out. There are golf carts to take you down to the beach and back up if you prefer not to walk., you won't need them. The beach is clean, and beautiful. Lounge chairs are set up above the beach, not in the sand itself. The Beach House Grill restaurant also sits just above the beach for food and drinks. Because of the weather we only got one good day on the beach in front of the resort and it was not crowded at all. Waves were small but signs were up stating that the shore break was dangerous. My kids had a great time playing in the water. Lack of service at the pools - We never had a problem with service when we were at the pool. There were several servers that made rounds frequently to take orders for food and drinks. We had some great grilled fish sandwiches and pineapple-strawberry smoothies at the pool. Expect to pay $18+ for sandwiches and burgers, $8.50 for non alcoholic drinks, and $12+ for alcohol. Kids meals were $8+, typical resort prices, but everything we had was very good. There were always plenty of towles and someone to set up cabanas and chairs if you needed them. We had reserved a cabana for our entire stay but again because of the weather only ended up using it for one day. The cost for a cabana is $75 for a large white cabana that seats 4 people. You also get a cooler full of sodas and water and a pinapple plate. You have to let one of the pool guys know that you will be returning to the cabana if you plan to leave for any amount of time otherwise they'll clean it up and give it to someone else. I found that kind of annoying - when you're paying to reserve the cabana it should be yours for the day. Unless the resort is extremely crowded or you have a need for constant shade (there are no umbrellas around the pool) you can definetly skip the cabana. Too many kids at the resort - Not while we were there. There were only about 15, I think we met them all at one point or another. When we went to the pool we tried to go where the other children were so the adults around the other pools could really relax. Again, the hotel was only at 39% occupancy so i'm sure there are more kids at other times. I have kids and I will be the first one to tell you that this resort is no place for children. When the weather is bad there is absolutely nothing for the kids, or anyone else for that matter, to do on site. The information book in the room states that there are movies and activities planned for rainy days- we called to inquire as to what was available and were told that they had nothing scheduled! Great! It wasn't like this was some light rain, nor was it the first day of rain. There is actually a swingset just in front of the resort pools, but it too was usless in the rain. We walked down to check out the kids club which was held in one of the basic hotel rooms - it was tiny - we walked in and walked right back out. The cost for kids club is $70 per child, children must be 5 years old or you have to accompany them. You also must make a reservation 24 hrs in advance. Food at the resort - Yes it is expensive with a capital E. Because of the time change my kids were up at 4:30am each morning ready for breakfast which meant room service. The room service menu is extremely limited, and they only offer lunch and dinner selections for kids, there is no childrens breakfast menu. Pancakes and sausage with hot chocolate and orange juice - $23, pancakes a la carte - $20, waffles with whipped cream and strawberries - $21, croissants $10, side of bacon $5, etc. Breakfast entrees ranged from $20 - $28, they had the typical breakfast fare. Kids meals for lunch and dinner ranged from $8-$11, all the kids basics, PB & J, spaghetti, hamburger, chicken fingers, etc. Meals included fruit or fries, drinks are extra. Lunch was limited to a club sandwich, burger, a salad, soup or a pizza - that was it, again everything $18+. We also had dinner in a few nights due to my son falling asleep at 5pm and heavy rain. For dinner you could choose the lunch offerings or a steak, filet mignon & lobster, a chicken dish, fresh fish or a pasta. Dinner entrees ranged from $28-$42., don't forget about the $5 delivery charge and the 18% service charge. Had an amazing linguini with scallops and shrimp, the filet and lobster was the worst i've ever had. Food always arrived withing 30 minutes and was great all but the night we arrived - everything was cold, it had definetly been sitting around for a while. Prices in the restaurants are basically the same as the room service prices. I don't mind paying resort prices as long as the food is good and it really was. The resort and grounds are beautiful, everything was decorated for christmas. We were there for the tree lighting on Dec. 1st. We sat sipping our hot chocolate in the pouring rain waiting for Santa. He and an elf actually parachuted in! It was a nice show and the lights were beautiful. Everyone just wrapped up in towels and pulled out their umbrellas. It rained so hard at one point that we just started laughing - it was rediculous! Our clothes were soaked all the way through by the time we got back to our room. The staff - everyone we dealt with before and during our vacation were extremely nice and helpful. They were all great with the my kids too. If you e-mail any requests before your trip be sure to follow up. I took up to a week to receive a reply at times and we still had to make an additional requests once in our room for things that were forgotten. One of the staff members did send us a beautiful cake for our anniversary to make up for the delays. We also received a box of chocolates, and a wooden pineapple and card upon arrival in celebration of our anniversary. Bottom line, would we stay at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua in the future? The answer is an easy no for a few reasons - the weather can be very iffy and I don't like to have to pack up the kids and drive to the other side of the island each day to find the sun, the resort is not family friendly, and i've been to the Four Seasons in Wailea so I know how good things can be. If you're trying to decide between the Ritz and the Four Seasons I'll tell you why I liked the Four Seasons so much more: much larger rooms, great kids club and plenty of on site activities for families, DVD players in the rooms - great if you have kids, great restaurants, extensive room service and kids menus, complimentary cabanas at the pools, lounge chairs directly in the sand on Wailea Beach, and it has a great paved beach path that stretches to the Grand Wailea and Kea Lani for more dining and shopping choices. I think the Ritz Carlton Kapalua would be a great choice for honeymooners or adult couples that want a quite secluded week by the pool - weather permitting. This isn't the place to be for young families or the party crowd.

In particular, the concierge desk was essential in planning all of our excursions since we did not book any activities before we left. They handled everything from snorkeling trips to dinner reservations. They also have detailed maps and driving directions for any destination in Maui for you, free of charge. The breakfast buffet was the best buffet I've ever experienced, and I'm definately not a buffet fan. The breakfast staples were always fresh and ready to go, plus they changed up some of items so we didn't feel like we were eating the same thing daily. We had purchased the breakfast package with our trip, and it was definately worth it. Even though it was a buffet, the serving staff was very attentive with coffee refils and water. I found the room to be very nice and a good size. The \"partial ocean view\" was AWESOME... we saw a lot of the coastline and the pool right from our room... it was gorgeous. The Not So Good Parts-- The pools were clean and well maintained with plenty of towles and lounge chair covers. During peak hours we did have a hard time finding a good spot to settle. There were two jacuuzis that did need some repair. Wait staff at the pool was minimal, and we always wound up going to the bar ourselves to get our own cocktails since we were never waited on from our seats. The rooms were slow to be cleaned, though it did not interfere too much with our stay since we were out most of the day. We left our room early every morning, and twice we just passed the cleaning attendant leaving our room at 4pm. Trash and room service items lingered in the hallway for many hours before being removed. A note to honeymooners--- My husband and I were Maui newbies, and when we booked our trip we of course wanted the most romantic setting possible. Maui did NOT dissapoint. We timed our trip in the offpeak season to avoid massive crowds and families. We were told to stay at The Ritz for the most calm, romantic experience possible, versus other hotels like the Grand Wailea (very, very nice, though!) because it was geared towards families.* We suggest having dinner at SanSei, just down the road from the hotel on the same property (a 2 minute drive, max) for the freshest sushi and tastiest entrees. The hotel sushi bar was extremely good, but two small rolls and two beers was over $70. In summary, we'd definately return to Maui and to the Ritz. *I'm not a parent (yet) and in no way do I wish to offend people who travel with children.

We flew Delta from Atlanta to Honolulu. It was a 9.5 hour flight. There is a five hour time difference between SC and HI that we never got used to while in HI. We were always dead tired by 9:00 pm and up at 5:00 am. We had a great time on both but there was no comparison to the two islands or hotels. We stayed on Oahu primarily to visit Pearl Harbor and see the USS Arizona Memorial, the USS Missouri etc. That alone is worth the trip to Oahu. A day or two on Oahu is all you need. Honolulu is a very busy and crowded city full of tourist, mostly from Japan, traffic and high rise hotels. Maui on the other hand is much more laid back. We flew into Kahului, Maui and rented a jeep. I would strongly encourage anyone visiting Maui to rent a car. A convertible jeep if you can afford it. We got married at sunset on the beach in Kaanapali. I would highly recommend Jeff and Fuji at Happy Maui weddings for getting hitched. Now about the Ritz. We got \"leid\" as soon as we got there with fresh beuatiful flowers. When we told them we were getting married the immediately upgraded our room to ocean view. The bellhop was very friendly and informative. He immediately filled our ice bucket up with ice. Once we got to our room I noticed the safe key was missing. I called the front desk and they immediately had the lock replaced. The pillows and mattress were very soft and comfortable, probably down. The room was spacious. The bathroom was wall to wall marble and large. Very first class all the way. That evening when we got back from dinner we noticed the hotel left us some chocolates and a leather bound photo book for us to keep our wedding photos in. The waiter at the pool talked to us 45 minutes giving us the 411 on where to go, where to eat etc. He was very helpful. The day of our wedding my wife needed safety pins. We looked in drug stores and grocery stores with no luck. When we got back to the room I called the front desk to see if they had any. Ten minutes later they delivered an envelope full of safety pins to the room! We got turn down service every night which included fresh towels and bottled water. The breakfast buffett is the best I have ever seen. Fortunately for us it was included in our package because it is VERY expensive. $30 a piece! Since it was included in our package we ate there every morning. The pools were first rate. You don't need to bring towels. They are provided and free of charge. The drinks poolside are expensive. $5.50 for a can of Miller Lite but hey it's the Ritz right! The jacuzzi was nice but did show some age. The cement around the edges was coming loose. The hotel is 14 years old and was told by a server renovations are planned for next year. We didn't eat at the Banyan Tree which is part of the Ritz but I can tell you the Pineapple Grill down the road is fantastic and expensive. The Ritz is surrounded by top rate golf courses although we don't golf and didn't while we were there. If you love golf Kapalua is the place to be. The beach is little stroll from the hotel because of an ancient Hawaiian burial ground that you have to walk around. This didn't bother us because we were so busy we only went to the beach at the Ritz once. They have lawn chairs at the beach on a nice grassy area about twenty feet from the sand. I would highly recommend doing the following while in Maui; snorkeling/snuba diving, attending a Luau, drving to Hana (water falls, lava tubes, black sand beach, blow hole, seven pools etc).

The Ritz Carlton, Kapalua was amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and luxurious vacation. The food was delicious and the drinks were wonderful (try the Kapalua Punch). I would highly recommend upgrading to the club level. They provide a more personal concierge service and there are 5 food presentations daily, not to mention it's open bar! It's definitely worth the money. It starts with a continental breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack (their cookies are famous), light dinner and finally cordials and chocolates (the chocolate covered strawberries are the best). Honestly it is worth every penny & there are always chocolate chip cookies available 24 hours a day (convenient after you go out)! You won't be disappointed, unless you're a bit hard to please. The rooms are simple and elegant and the beds are very comfortable. The location is phenomenal. It's located away from the city and up on a big hill.

Booked our whole vacation through Pleasant Holidays. Picked up car rental from Dollar and drove to the Ritz Carlton. It's really FAR from the airport. This was our first time on Maui, so we didn't expect such a long drive. It is very scenic with views of the ocean almost the entire way. The Ritz sits on what I feel may be the most beautiful rolling hills. My wife and I fell in love with the location. Check-in was a little cause for concern. The front desk didn't seem to have my name in their system and acted like they didn't want to give me a room. Good thing I had our trip itinerary in my backpack. After about 10 minutes, they tell us our room wouldn't be ready till after 3pm. This upset my wife because she had a headache and wanted to shower and lay down from the long plane ride. The front desk did try and be somewhat accomodating, they offered us use of their spa area to shower and relax until our room was ready. We took advantage of that and then went to lunch in Lahaina. What we did not like about the hotel was that most things or places you wanted to go to were a bit of a drive. Our room was finally ready, the hotel called us by cell phone. We felt that the grounds and main lobbies were well appointed, we didn't see any signs of frayed carpets or worn sofas as many on these boards had written about. Our room was an ocean view room on the 8th floor. A bit of a walk I thought. Room was very clean and we liked the view. Maid service was good. Room was cleaned at least twice daily with turn-down service every night. From what I've read on these boards, Ritz Kapalua is due for renovation. Well, bring it on. Rooms are not equipped with computers in rooms, not even ones that interface with the television. And speaking of televisions, oh my, the one in our room must've been15 yrs old. It was a 19 inch, with a dinosaur for remote! I couldn't believe that. When I asked about internet access, the front desk showed me an area in the hotel where I could use a credit-card and be charged by the minute for internet access. This really bothered me, when rooms cost about $400/day average you'd think, they'd give you internet access for free. We were there for 5 days, each day, we started off with full buffet breakfast in the The Terrace Restaurant. It was so delicious and every seat is an ocean view. We really looked forward to this breakfast. It's kinda pricey, about $30 bucks per person, but is sometimes included in your hotel package. The wait staff there is very good and efficient. The pool area is beautiful very clean and remarkably quiet. We went to the pool each morning after breakfast. The grounds are manicured to perfection. What we liked most about the Ritz was the attention the staff payed to detail. We have already decided that when we return to Maui we will only stay at the Ritz Carlton. Having gone to a luau in Kaanapali where some of the other hotels are we feel Ritz Carlton had them beat. We felt the other restaurants at the hotel were too pricey for average food. We ate at the Banyan Tree one night and the The Pineapple Grill, which is in Kapalua also, not on hotel grounds. Checkout was also a little awkward, when I went to front desk to review my bill and settle it in cash, the concierge told me that my hotel package must've only included my rental car and flight. I told her that couldn't be, because I had already paid Pleasant Holidays for the entire trip, including my room fees. I called the TA and returned to check-out, magically, the front desk help was able to figure out that I had already paid in my package.

It was like a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. We have stayed at the Ritz about 8-10 times since 2002 and have always been treated so well. Our Ritz stays have always been the highlight of our Hawaii trips. We always called it our home away from home because we knew that no matter how the rest of our trip went, that we would have a great stay at the Ritz. This was not meant to be this time. Upon check-in we were not recognized as repeat guests and definately not treated that way. We arrived early and did not expect to check in right away, but we had to wait over five hours when they plenty of availibility. We asked the front desk where we could change for the pool while we waited. They told us to use the spa as they have lockers there. When we arrived at the spa, the woman there told us to go down the hall and use the PUBLIC restrooms to change. We told her twice that we were waiting to check-in. So the tone is setting for this stay. After about five hours and twenty minutes they finally had our room ready. We were the last people who had thier luggage stored by the bell desk to get checked in. Whe booked an Ocean View Suite. We almost died hwn we saw where they had put us. It was the worst room in the category! We were on the side towards the back. We had to crane to the left to see the ocean. We were facing some woods too. The double lanai was so small on one side that it would be hard for the two fo us to fit on it. The other side had no roof over it. We found it VERY strange that this was the first time we had not recieved an upgrade. I would understand if they had a full house, but they were fairly empty. We just looked at each other and told the bellman not to take our luggage off the cart. They finally put us in an Ocean Front Suite. They had so many avilable that they gave us four choices. On a previous stay they asked for our preferences for which side of the resort we like as well as our wine preferences, etc. Why did they put us through this hassle then? When we were there last March, there was a knock on the door every hour for five hours with welcome back amenities. This stay, we didn't even have one knock. We didn't even get the obligatory welcome back letter from the GM. We called down to let housekeeping know what time we like our turndown and regular houskeeping done. It's always 10:00 am and 6:30 PM. That night at 7:00 PM they still hadn't come for turndown and we had dinner on the way, so they had to rush up to refresh towels etc. We are off to a very bad start and it still gets MUCH worse. Of course there were 35 mile an hour winds so we couldn't enjoy our lanai's. My husband had to pull a chair into the very corner to smoke a cigar. The next morning we sent down a lot of dry cleaning and went to the pool for the day. That evening they put our drycleaning in the living room closet. We ordered dinner at 7:00 PM. When you order room service they always say that dinner will be up in 30 minutes or less. We were talking and noticed that it was 7:45. I called down to see where our dinner was. They said they had a problem with our order. How bizzare. They said it would be another 25 minutes. I called down to management to ask why we were being treated the way we were. They didn't know what to say. Dinner finally showed up around 8:15 or a bit before. The manager said that dinner was on them. I will gladly pay my bill, just give me what's promised. By this time we had decided that we were checking out three days early. Enough was enough. Apparently, guest loyalty didn't mean too much to the Ritz Kapalua. The next morning I went to put on one of the blouses I had dry cleaned. All the clothes we sent down were Tommy Bahama, which is all silk. I looked at it and it had huge blue ink stains on the front and back. When we checked all our other clothes we had sent down, we found 7 articles that were ruined. Management sent up loss prevention and they took pictures to put in a claim. Once Tommy Bahama does a print they never do it again. My blouses can never be replaced. My husband lost 4 pair of Tommy Bahama shorts and the rest were mine. The Ritz has since sent us a check for $580.00. We cannot fathom why the Ritz would let loyal guest such a us go through what we did. The whole thing was so weird because my husband kept saying that he had a creepy feeling this stay and I told him that it felt like someone was watching us. I don't know if the rumors about the Ritz being haunted are true, but the hair on the back of my neck still stands on end when I remember how both of us had an eerie feeling while on that property. I have not felt the \"cold\"(ghost) spots people talk about, but if someone built a resort on top of or so many feet from my relatives, I would haunt it too. We were told that the GM would be contacting us soon.

We booked a club room with 2 double beds. Upon check in the check in staff member informed us that the only room available on the club floor was a king size room. I explained that we made our reservation six months ago. It did not matter to him. He said that they cannot guarantee this room. He told us we could get a roll away bed. I was not happy but we did take the king size room with the roll away. Upon entering the room there was a very musty smell. Other reviewers have also noted this problem. When reading trip advisor reviews for this hotel for six month prior to our trip I did not believe the negative reviews. Really, how bad could the Ritz Carlton in Maui be. We have stayed at the Ritz in Naples, Floriida several times and that hotel was extremely nice. In my opinion no hotels are perfect but I was sure the Ritz in Maui would come close. In reading other reviews for this hotel I found both the negative and positive reviews to have accurrate information (except for maybe a few). First the negataives: Not getting the room we booked six months in advance. After spending 3 nights in the King size room we moved down a floor to a room with 2 double beds. This was not the club floor but we kept the club floor amenities. The furniture in both rooms was indeed very dated. The curtains in both rooms had a lot of small holes in them. In the morning, the sun would stream through these holes. Basically the rooms appeared to be pretty clean but the bathroom in the lower floor had a bright yellow stain around the toilet. (gross). The first floor on the club level had a very damp, musty smell. The lower floor did not. Our second day at the hotel it rained constantly. That evening the musty smell in the room was bordering on unbearable. Because the smell got worse after a constant rain there must be some issues with dampness in the hotel. The rest of our stay we enjoyed very nice weather. We did notice the wind in our first room. This room was on the top floor and was located at the end of the building. There was one side of the balcony that did not have a wall therefore you really could not sit out there. The lower room was located in the center of the building and that balcony was very pleasant. This was the only time I noticed the wind. There was always a pile of wet towels located on top of a trash can when you entered the hotel from the pool area. I understand that there are going to be renovations at this hotel but renovations will not do anything for keeping the hotel grounds neat. The restroom at the pool had overflowing trash cans. The floor was wet and messy. Did not appear to be very clean. No one ever approached us at the pool to take a food or drink order. The pool restaurant/bar was close so it was not a big deal to get our own food/drinks but it just didn't do anything for having a feeling of being at a luxury hotel. We were charged $95.00 for a pool cabana. We never rented a cabana. Upon a phone call to the front desk, this charge was taken off. I read other reviews to check your bill daily on the television. That tip did help. The landscaping around the hotel was very basic (nothing special). Tiles were missing from the hot tub. I thought the beach at the hotel was a long walk. Even if you are in good shape, it's not fun carrying towel, and beach gear up and down a hill. I did not see the golf carts. They may be there but I don't think they sit there waiting for guests. You may catch one by chance. The staff told us that the beach was not safe to swim in. Positives: The views from the hotel were very beautiful. The club floor staff was very professional. They were extremely helpful in making activity and dinner reservations. The food on the club level was good but could have used more variety. Just a note regarding alcoholic drinks on the club floor. If you wanted a drink , a staff member would get it for you. Not a big deal but if they were busy you had to wait. In Naples, they would have an open bar so you could help yourself. We do not drink a lot but enjoy one or two drinks before dinner. If the staff member was busy and you were short of time it was annoying to wait. All in all the club floor amenities were nice. We used the Ritz shuttle to go to Kapalua Beach and the Plantation House Restaurant. This was very convenient. The shuttles were prompt and the drivers professional. The Plantation House restaurant was very nice. Enjoyed the food, service and spectacular views. We ate there twice. We ate dinner at the Terrace Restaurant once. Service and food were fine. The only problem was that everything came out so fast that we were not able to sit and relax. The buffet breakfast at the Terrace was very nice. Even though it was a huge buffet, the food was well presented. Some people have complained about the birds in the morning making noise, etc. This is not just at the Ritz but other locations. I thought the birds were beautiful and fun to watch and listen to.

Both were very nice, rooms were very clean, bed very comfortable, and room size was larger than other hotel rooms. We had a nice balcony where we watched beautiful sunsets, while drinking champagne. We also enjoyed the Bulgari soap bath amenities and actually loved gthe smell so much purchased the parfum when I got home. Our rooms were cleaned promptly everyday and the turn down service at the end of the day was great! The staff at the restaurants were excellent, and the luau was very entertaining! We enjoyed the Honolua general store (less than 5 minutes walk from hotell) you can charge all purchases to your room at the Ritz. Breakfast was so delicious and plentiful, and very reasonable at the General Store! A plus is also the Catholic church that is by the general store and had Saturday evening and Sunday service!!! We also enjoyed the walking trails every morning, it was a good workout. The towels and cold water at the bellhop desk at the entrance of the hotel were so convenient!!!!! We would get them as we took the shutle to the snorkling beach and drop them off when we returned!!! The weather was excellent, in the 7 days we were there it rained for about 1/2 hour one night while we had dinner and another time for about 10 minutes, no hard prolonged rain.

The nearby Japanese Restaurant Sansei, which actually moved was very good and reasonable, and the Tapas bar VIno, the appetizers were excelent and the melon Martini was awesome (also walking distance from hotel).

You mujst ask to be seated out in the terrace, by the water! Dessert was also fabulous!

First of all overall it was excellent, good service,great food and excellent facilities. Yes, the wind does blow (on average 10-20 mph) but the pool area is sheltered and comfortable - the hotel beach is nice but the wind can sometimes make it dangerously rough and sand blows around on windy days- there are no sunning chairs on the beach (local law) but some comfortable ones just above it overlooking. If you insist on laying on a beach all the time this may not be the best choice. The rooms are very nice although perhaps could use a bit of an update which they say is coming soon.Still,comfortable,good beds, sufficiently large. We had a deluxe oceanview which overlooked the beautiful pool area with only limited ocean view - I probably would not pay extra for ocean view again as the way the hotel is laid out most rooms (except suties) are only going to get ocean view from the side. Staff and servcie are excellent and the concierge desk is helpful though busy. Nearby Honolua store is a plus for typical \"general store\" type things. The grounds and resort area are lovely and expansive,good running routes and excellent (andreasonably priced tennis (at the nearby Tennis Garden we played with ball machines for a very reasonable $31 an hour which they usually let you strecth to 1.5 hours, there are also free courts on the Ritz property). Food here is very good, the package breakfast buffet at the Terrace is ample and delicious - definitely worth it, as the charge is $61 fro two without the package. The Banyan tree is the best restaurant in Maui (and we ate at almost all the top rated ones) but it is somewhat pricey (lots of $35-45 entrees). We loved the location it is quite and besutiful but it is a drive to anything off the Kapalua resort area Kaanapali is about 5 minutes and Lahaina 10-15. We are not golfers but there are also 3 world class (PGA) golf courses. We also did the Luau they have twice a week and it was fun - food again was ample and very tasty and the entertainment was enjoyable as well (music, fire dancers etc.). It's $95 per person with open bar so not a bad deal either. Do it if you want the luau experience ( they do the buried roast pig and a lot of local foods).

From the second we walked into the hotel lobby, they made us feel special and welcomed (and we weren't even celebrating an anniversary or birthday!). We talked to the concierge at least twice a day to get advice on restaurants, the road to Hana, and other activities, and the staff was always friendly and prompt. * We opted for the cheapest room we could find, and it sounds like we made the best decision. Our \"garden view\" room offered a gorgeous view of palm trees, hillsides, and YES - a huge view of the ocean (see pics). It was stunning and so surprising. Our room was #1609 and I think all of the rooms in this wing, facing due east, offer this same view. The room itself had a very comfortable bed, tasteful colors, a fridge, and a gorgeous bathroom. Loved the Bulgari soaps too! An added bonus was the twice-daily housecleaning service. * Beautiful, expansive grounds. Our first night, we watched the sun set while sipping cocktails by the beach. The whole experience was romantic, uncrowded, and relaxing. Our second night, we walked from the hotel to the nearby Sansei restaurant. The walk takes you along the coast, past the pristine villas, toward the Napili resort area, which offers stunning sunset views. * Open, airy design of the hotel. Unlike a few other reviewers, we found the decor to be just fine (and not run-down). We liked how breezy and open the corridors and lobbies were. * Proximity to great beaches and snorkeling (Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali, Kapalua Beach, Kahekili Beach/Old Airport Rd -- turtles here!), as well as to shopping and dining in Lahaina. The cons about the Ritz: * Okay, we heard the weather is sometimes rainy and gusty in Kapalua. BUT, we had abundant sunshine for three days, and only a couple of hours of rain.

When we arrived we were brought up to our room, which was NOT what my husband expected. He booked the $600 a night ocean view room, and when we got there it was a view of the pool, with a sliver of ocean to the right.

We went check it out and it was nicer than the last view(mountains in the front and a little more ocean to the left). So we stayed there. I didn't find the hotel to be in \"horrible\" condition at all. I thought the room was nice, the bed super comfy, and the bathroom was pretty(marble, separate shower, etc.). The pool area is nice(more kids than I had thought which cut down on the serene/calm). I loved the chairs and fresh towels available.

One day was very windy, the rest was sunny and nice. All in all it was a nice experience, though I would not book the ocean view again. I would opt to book the cheapest room since the view in the more expensive room isn't that great anyway. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room to begin with.

The chicken quesadilla we had at the poolside bar was pretty good too. The staff was always helpful and friendly. If we had any requests, they were at our room right away to drop it off. The pool staff was excellant as well. They were always willing to setup our chairs or carry our towels. When they started the drink/food service around 11am, they came by often to see if we needed another drink or a bite to eat. The guy walking around offering fresh pineapple was a nice too!

Also, the tvs are archaic, there is limited TV options and no dvd players (we had a day of rain, it would have been nice to have some options). Service was spotty.

We chose to stay at the Ritz despite some of the negative reviews we saw on TripAdvisor and in a couple of guidebooks. Overall, the experience was good, but I have to admit that I was disappointed with some aspects of staying at the Ritz. First of all, our room DID smell musty, as other Trip Advisor travelers have noted. The common areas were beautiful, but if you looked closer, the carpets were frayed and things looked worn. I did see some housekeeping issues - like room service food left out in the hallway for way too long and some lack of service in the dining room (like getting coffee refills and minor things like that). On the positive side, the hotel sits on a beautiful piece of property. You do have to walk, or take a golf cart shuttle, to the beach, but it really isn't that far. The beach is beautiful and not overcrowded since there aren't many resorts in that area. The ironwood trees are beautiful, and we find the constant breeze to actuallly be refreshing in the hot July sun. We went down to the south of Maui, where the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea are, and let me tell you, it was HOT! The breezes at Kapalua were nice, indeed! Anyway, if you want hot, there is beautiful Kaanapali Beach, which is only ten minutes from the Ritz. I actually thought Kaanapali Beach was better than Wailea Beach. My husband and son had a ball snorkeling at Black Rock, which is right by the Sheraton Hotel on Kaanapali Beach. Anyway, back to the Ritz. Our breakfast was included in our package and was quite good. Lots of variety and quite tasty. The staff at the Ritz were always friendly and always willing to help out if you needed something. We attended a luau at the Ritz, which was pretty standard, I guess, but the food was good, and my husband and son had a great time. The Ritz Carlton signature facial was excellent. There were two great restaurants nearby that we visited - Vino and Sansei. Both are owned by two Japanese guys, and the food is great. Vino is located in the same building as the golf pro shop, but the food is excellent and the environment was nice, too. Sansei had excellent sushi but also had a great dinner menu, too. Both restaurants are accessible by the Ritz Carlton shuttle service and are just a couple of minutes away. We did not go to Banyan Tree and did not miss it one bit. Maui is a beautiful island. We had a wonderful time touring Haleakala, the road to Hana, and visiting its many beautiful beaches. The Ritz Carlton definitely had its issues, but overall, we enjoyed our vacation there. One word of caution, however. If you plan to do a lot of driving and sightseeing, the Ritz Carlton is way over on the upper northwest side of the island, so you will have to drive a lot to get to many of the attractions. This isn't too bad, but make sure you avoid the morning and evening rush hour traffic. Yes, there are traffic jams in Maui when all of the residents are trying to go to work, or go home from work. Also, when we arrived at the airport, the first thing we did was stop at the nearby Walmart to stock up on water, sunscreen, and snack items.

After reading other reviews, I was a little worried about what to expect. When all was said and done, I would have to say it was a good stay. The room (2503) was large, comfortable and clean. It was classified as a garden view, but I would say it would have been more appropriately called partial ocean view. The lanai was big enough to seat four comfortably. The bathroom was also quite nice. While we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in the room watching television, I was surprised to find a TV that looked as though it was 20 years old. The service was generally pretty good. When I initially booked the room (using the Internet) I had requested a King bed. When the confirmation email arrived (not booked directly through the Ritz) it stated that no King beds were available. Since this was our anniversary, I decided that I would try to secure a King bed through the hotel directly. One email resolved the issue. In addition, we were surprised by a bottle of sparkling wine on the second day of our visit!!!! I found the pool staff to be great. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait long for drinks, food, or towels. They were friendly and helpful. On a slightly negative note, there were a few issues that I thought could have been handled better. One day, after spending the entire day exploring the Island, we returned back to the room to find the door ajar. It was very obvious that the room door was left open. Given that this was at the end of the day and we had left early in the morning, it had to have been left open by hotel personnel. I was stunned by this rather huge lapse in security. I was further annoyed when I called the front desk to complain, only to be told that their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loss prevention manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I think that is what they called the person) would look into it, but never received any word about this after the fact. Quite frankly, I expected a manager to call and apologize. We did spend a fair amount of time at the pool and billed a number of items to our room. I am a little anal, so each day I would check my charges for the previous day (using their television system). On three separate days I found charges that should not have been applied. First I found a valet charge that should have been included as part of our package. Then there was a charge for 14 Miller Lights (from the pool). The following day there was another $70 of other pool stuff charged to the account. In all three cases, the charges were immediately removed; however, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I should need to check my account so closely EVERYDAY. In addition, I felt that given the ongoing nature of the problem, that a manager should have contacted us and apologized. We ordered room service on one evening and had very mixed feelings about the experience. I asked if we could eat on the lanai. When the food arrived the gentleman who delivered the food had everything needed for a romantic dinner on the lanai. He did a fantastic job setting up a table that looked as though it belonged in a fine restaurant. Unfortunately, the food was awful. I think part of the problem was that we ordered appetizers as well as entrees. In a regular restaurant they would come separately; however, because it was room service, they arrived together. By the time the appetizers were done the entrees were cold. Even the appetizers were not the greatest and they were warm. Since the food is so pricey, I would have thought they could take the added effort to deliver it in two stages\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I know that is asking a lot, but given what we spent, I would expect that kind of service. Okay, enough complaining\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The hotel and grounds were beautiful. While there was no doubt that it was windy;however, I found the breeze to be refreshing when we were sitting poolside in the hot sun. During the six day stay we got sprinkled on twice, and it was only for a few minutes. I enjoyed the free coffee in the morning and the nightly entertainment was really great. Our package included the breakfast buffet in the terrace restaurant. The food and selection was great. Each day it was different in slight ways (different fruit selections and variations on eggs benni). We were served by Amy on our third day, and we requested her every day after. After our first day, she knew what we drank and even offered to toast our bread for us. She was awesome! This was my fourth trip to Hawaii this year. What struck me most about this stay was that at any time of day, I could go to the pool and find an empty lounger. On Oahu, it seems that if you want a poolside seat you need to wait in line at 7:30 in the morning. At the Ritz, you can relax, relax, relax. I will never tire of hearing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Certainly Mr. xxxxxxxx, it would be our pleasure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

We stayed in a waterfront suite and because our flight out wasn't until 10:00 p.m., we were told by our travel agent that they would gladly let us stay in our room until late.

This hotel sits on windy, rainy side of island with nothing to do except play golf! And, when the surf is high, which is pretty much all of the time, the beach staff will refuse to rent surfboards, etc. to you! How absurd! Want to go biking? Nope!

I wanted to give a relatively objective review, addressing a number of the concerns raised by the negative reviews. Before I do that, a little about the stay, so that you know where I am coming from. I traveled to the Ritz to celebrate my engagement with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 in June 2006. I am well traveled and in my late 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Room quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The hotel rooms do appear to need some kind of renovation. With that said, this has been acknowledged by management, as the hotel will undergo a major renovation at the end of this year. Despite that, the rooms were still comfortable. We did notice a smell in the room, but realized that it went away once the A/C was turned on. We did not ask for a change, and smell was not noticed after the first hour in the room. Hotel layout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The beach is down the hill, and quite a walk. The reason for this is due to the hotel being moved up the hill to leave ancient burial grounds intact. This hill is not huge, but gets annoying after the first couple of trips. Again, the management realizes the issue and provides a shuttle bus free of charge. Service quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drink services took some time at a number of locations. Frankly, I am not sure why this is, other than the pool and beach areas were relatively crowded. When speaking with local friends, this is not an issue with the Ritz, but an issue of the cost of living making finding good help an issue with all the hotels. Nonetheless, there was a number of times where we felts that certain staff members went above an beyond the call and lived up to the Ritz reputation. Weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201c People have complained about the wind. Indeed there were 20 to 30 mph winds throughout the resort. I am not sure what the other resorts were like, but no matter where we were on the island, we experienced similar winds, leading us to believe that this is an island phenomenon rather than poor location. With that said, given the heat of the sun, the wind was a nice touch cooling us down. Cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Food costs are astronomical \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no other way to say this. However, the $30 for breakfast is typical at all the resorts on Maui. This is not the Ritz ripping you off, but the cost to ship most ingredients from the mainland to Maui. We went to a number of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclocal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 restaurants and paid similar prices to the Ritz. Conclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c People complain that the hotel may be overrated, and they are entitled to their opinion. I agree that this may not be the best place for families, as a number of the activities are geared towards adults. With that said, we had a wonderful time. I would not have a problem going back to this resort and paying the prices that they ask. Lastly, and I need to stress this part \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Maui is a great place. It have a number of fantastic things to do, and while sitting by the pool/beach is nice, I seriously recommend only spending one to two days at the resort and the rest of the time exploring the island.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carrollton, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWe Love the Ritz!\u201d", "Author": "gpa59", "ReviewID": "UR5410900", "Content": "The more recent post of the Ritz was less than positive. I wanted to give our take on our stay last week. We just returned home from our second stay at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua. We were there a year ago with my parents and it was a great trip, so we hoped lightening would strike twice. It did! We were greeted warmly by the staff and we were shown directly to our room. (We arrived mid-week, so maybe the person who says it took 45 minutes arrived on a busier day?) We stayed on the same floor my parents were on last year, so I know the rooms have been updated. (We checked our pictures from last year!) Different color schemes in the carpets, drapes, and bedding. The room was quite comfortable and we were told we had a partial ocean view. It was a pretty \"full view\" by me! We had a nice view of the bay from the chairs on our lanai. This year I booked us the bed and breakfast package. We were glad we did, but we did over indulge the breakfast buffet! I was surprised that someone said he wished for fresh pineapple. There was plenty of it on the buffet and even papaya and melons, too. The waitstaff was very friendly and made us feel welcome, in fact, they even remembered our names each morning! There really wasn't any incentive for them to be so nice, our package meant that the tip was already included, so they could have treated us indifferently knowing we were on the \"package\". We also splurged and had dinner in the Terrace Restaurant one night and we thought our steaks were great! The weather in Kapalua is different from even Kaanapali, which is just a short drive to the south. If you want to bake in a hot sun, then don't stay in this area. We like the cooler breezes up that way and we don't worry about a little drizzly rain. It rained two mornings, but it was gone by 10:00 and didn't interfere with ourday at all. The fitness center was really nice, we were sorry we hadn't checked it out in our previous visit, but we will be sure to use it again in the future. Massages and other spa treatments were pricey, but all we wanted was to use the gym, and that was complimentary. (On the second leg of our trip on a different island in a different hotel we had to pay to use the fitness center) The beach area is nice, and I don't think it's a mile walk, but it is a good downhill trail to get there. It took us only five minutes to walk it. And, if you're tired and not willing to face the uphill walk when you're ready to head back to the room, there is a shuttle ride on a golf cart you can use, free of charge! The beach is public and state maintained, but it's secluded, so it's pretty much just the Ritz patrons. Yes, the crowd is more mature than other hotels, so if you're looking for other young couples or singles to hook up with, don't stay here. We were annoyed that there was a family with loud children who were allowed to run amok in the dining room at breakfast. At least it was just one group! Personally, I think if your children don't have Ritz Carlton manners yet, then please stay at another hotel! Give me a quieter \"mature\" crowd, to each his own.... (and I mean no disrespect to families. We saw many familiies on our trip with very well-behaved children. It's the ones who are out of control that one remembers) Despite the great stay, I will make a couple of complaints. First, I agree that poolside and beach area service was gone this year. I don't know if they were understaffed or if they didn't hire enough people to offer bar/snack service this season. And, the lounge area is nice, but their bar menu is very limited if you don't like sushi. We had a big lunch while out touring one day and hoped for appetizers and a cocktail that evening. Since we didn't like the choices on the bar menu we ended up driving down to Kahana and got a light dinner there. Also, the staff was very helpful, but they need be sure that they keep up with daily schedules and changes in policy. We were told the first night that the Beach House Grill was open for dinner, only walk down there and find that it was closed due to the Luau. Then, were told that our Bed and Breakfast package was good for room service orders and a la carte items, which wasn't true. If you book that package you need to eat at the Terrace Restaurant and order the buffet. (Which was very good!). I spoke to the manager about that and she apologized telling us that the package used to be more open ended and she would be sure that employees are reminded of that change. All things considered, the Ritz is our hotel of choice. We love the quiet, secluded area. We love the cooler weather (hence more Cook Island Pines than palms) and the more mautre crowd. We visited Kaanapali Beach one evening only to find it wall-to-wall people.

I was surprised they left us two chocolate covered strawberries on our honeymoon arrival. I would expect the Maui Ritz to have FRESH pineapple (at least a few chunks) every morning. I get fresh fruit at many other hotels I stay at for business. The real dark spot is the pool. The service was horrible and unacceptable. It is staffed by a bunch of inept white college students or mainland expatriots. No one EVER offered to set up our chaise chair. When I was at a Raddison in Aruba, you couldn't set foot near the pool before the guy comes to you finding the BEST chair in the house along with setting your towels on the chair.

After reading some of the reviews I was apprehensive but kept an open mind. The bad news is that I could not wait to get out of there. Even our kids, age 11 and 13, seemed unhappy. The furnishings in both of our rooms were threadbare. The sunlight poured in through dozens of frayed holes in the curtains every morning and the rooms really did smell bad. It sounds like I'm being picky, but it was kind of depressing, especially since we had been looking so forward to this vacation. Quite honestly, I think it is a disgrace for a hotel chain of this caliber to let the condition of their property get so run down. It's almost bizarre. I knew that to ask to change rooms was pointless, as we were on the club level and the other rooms looked as threadbare. The beach is beautiful, but it is a hike. It didn't bother us at first, since we love to excercise, but the walking up and down the hill did get old. There are lounge chairs available above the beach, but no beach chairs on the beach. When we're on such a great beach, I want to be by the ocean, so we ended up lying on little beach towels like we did in high school. We had just come from a 4 night stay at the Four Seasons on the Big Island, which I admit, was a tough act to follow. It is my idea of the perfect spot to vacation in Hawaii. The dining was okay at the Ritz but not great. I guess because of the wind, they've installed giant sheets of plexiglass in the dining areas which took all the natural feel away. Also kind of depressing. My one last negative thought is about the number of other guests who sat around smoking and yakking loudly on their cell phones. It really is hard to ignore. At our previous hotels cell phone use was discouraged. Now for something positive. The service was excellent. The staff really did bend over backward to be pleasant and accomodating. It is probably the only thing that is keeping the resort afloat until they do some renovations. \"The weather was an absolutely perfect sunny 80 degrees the entire time we were there. We didn't experience the dreaded wind problem. Also, there is snorkling nearby that is excellent. My advice if you are thinking of staying at this resort is: DON'T DO IT!! The island experience is simply too beautiful to be tarnished by bad accomodations at a supposedly luxury resort.

Our stay was excellent and we highly reccommend this resort. First, stay in the club level if you can afford it. It's worth the additional price, as you get a free continental breakfast every morning, plus 4 more food presentations daily and free drinks (including bottled water) at all times. If you are disciplined, this is a great way to save money. The food at the hotel is very good, but like all resorts (and not just the Ritz - the food is more expensive at the Hyatt where we spent 2 nights) it is expensive. Furthermore, the Ritz provides you with a personal concierge with a club level room. The folks that helped us (Kimberly, Kong, Leslie, and Erin) were fabulous. They were so helpful, so friendly, and really helped make a great trip all the more special. They made (and cancelled) reservations for us, gave us great activity reccomendations, and were all around a pleasure to visit with. The Ritz should be aware of their fabulous contributions. As for service generally, we also found this to be very good. After being \"lei-d\" upon our arrival at the resort, we were checked in and escorted to our room. Whenever we needed anything, somebody was there to help us out with a smile. Otherwise, we were left to ourselves. We did overhear a few other people complaining about slow service at times, but we did not personally experience this. Of course, people have different expectations of what first class service really is and there are complainers in every bunch. Other items. We had a basic room, which was very nice. Our only disappointment was that we did not have a soaking tub. Otherwise, we enjoyed the room very much and the private lanai offered a great view of both the pool and the ocean (see pictures). My fiance wishes we got a suite so that she could watch tv during those times that my work intruded on our vacation, but c'est la vie. The beach is not that far - as other reviews would have you believe. It's a five minute walk downhill. The Ritz also offers cart service around the property, but seriously. If this is a problem you need to lose some weight and get on a treadmill. The beach itself is beautiful. Although all beaches in Hawaii are public by law, the Ritz's beach has a very private and intimate feel to it. The sand is soft like sugar and the water is both warm and rock-free (hardly a given at the various beach resorts we've stayed at around the world). We had a great time boogie-boarding as well as just relaxing and soaking in the sun and the beautiful pacific ocean. The pool is awesome. It is actually three pools, each lower than the next and connected by a waterfall. It is a very relaxing atmosphere, not like some other resorts where the pool is \"a scene.\" If you want to relax, soak in some sun, swim, read a book, etc., the Ritz' pool is perfect. If you want to see and be seen, try someplace else. Finally, if you are a golfer, the Plantation course is a must-play. The course is in great condition, the service is fabulous, and the views are amazing. The wind blows hard here, however, so pratice your knock-down shots. Also, make sure you eat dinner at the restaraunt in the clubhouse. This is not some random golfcourse bar. The food - and the fish in particular - is the best seafood we had on Maui. Try either the Plantation Oscar or the Fish Special. Overall, this is a great property. For those looking for a relaxing, luxurious vacation, the Ritz Kapalua is a can't miss.

It is the place on the islands where I feel tranformed from a wiki-wiki person (hurry hurry) to a serene and peaceful person. We arrived at the Ritz on March 27th for five nights. The bell staff is the best. They are always smiling and will answer any questions they can. Check in was flawless. The front desk staff is very cordial and got us checked in quickly. We were upgraded to an ocean front suite. We used to walk by these on previous visits and say that one day we will stay in one. Our wish came true. It was enourmous! As we walked in through the foyer, there was a small hallway with bathroom. It had a shower, water closet and a vanity. We walked through our huge livingroom and into our bedroom with another full bathroom. It is all marble and has seperate shower and tub. We also had two huge lanai's. We were in heaven. The next thing we know there is a knock at the door and they delivered a nice bottle of wine with cheese and crackers. A little while later there was another knock at the door and they had sent up some kukui nut lei's with a book about Hawaii. I have the lei's around my bedroom lampshade. I think it was four times all together that they sent up goodies to us. Later in the week we met a woman named Joy who is the guest relations manager. What a pleasure it was talking to her. She even asked us for our preferences on certain things. Before we know it she had sent up a wonderful bottle of chardonnay to us. It felt like christmas. They know that we love the resort's mascot. She's a tiger cat named Carly. They took a picture of Carly with a lei around her neck, put it in a card and wrote a note from Carly that she was glad we were back. I will always treasure that picture. We like to get the Maui News when we are on the islands but the hotels are now delivering USA Today. I asked if I could get the Maui news. Even though they are a rare commodity at the hotels, the bell staff delivered one to our door every morning. What else could one ask for. This experience was sheer bliss. Thank you so much Phyllis and Joy. We mostly ate in room because it was raining so hard the whole time we were there. (all the islands had that freaky weather) We had in room breakfast included in our package, which we savored. We hate buffets! I eat like a bird so they are really a waste for me and my husband loves his eggs benedict, which you can't get at a buffet. We ate once at Banyan Tree and I have to honestly say that we don't care for the new chef's creations. It has always been our favorite restaurant but we left there (Banyan Tree) feeling deflated. We want the Austrailian chef back. I can still taste his food. yum. Room service was impeccable. They always brought up everything we ordered and it was nice and warm. They were pleasant and always timely. The food is absolutely delicious. We ventured down to Lahaina a few times because we had to go to Dan's Greenhouse to see a Palm Cockatoo named Prince Ele Ele. We used to be so afraid of him. He's rather ominous looking but he's as friendly as can be. He hopped right on our arms and kept wanting us to pat him. It was awesome. These birds are rare, so it's a hightlight for us to go see Price each time we go back. Imagine being in Hawaii and the highlight of your day is going to a pet store to see a bird? That's me! The weather was horrendous. I have never seen so much rain in my life. Kapalua can be rainy, but all the islands were going through the same thing. We didn't get to use the pool once. We had a couple of hours of sun one day and made a beeline to the chairs down by the beach. Actually these storms washed out the entrance to the beach so you would have to walk way around to get down there. We were just as happy to sit on the chairs as long as we had some sun. The clouds started to roll in so we took a ride down to Lahaina to Mr. Wine. If you want great wine go see them. We love Kongsgarad and Mer Soleil charddonay and they usually carry it. You name it, they have it. We stoped by all the shops and also went to see Prince again. The rain was so bad there was not a whole lot we could go and see or do so we went back to the Ritz and to our cavernous suite. The resort is doing a $40 million renovation starting next year. We can't wait to see how they decorate it. It was a wonderful stay. I am really glad we stayed on the days we did because shortly after we went to another part of the island I became very sick and had to go to the urgent care center. I am still recovering.

Overall, I think it is a nice resort with a few key drawbacks. Pluses: As mentioned by other reviewers, the service is excellent - probably the best I've experienced at hotels/resorts of this caliber. Almost everone from management to housekeeping to the bellhops says \"Good morning\" or \"Aloha.\" Staff in the lobby even walk up to me to greet me and ask if they can help me even after several days into my stay. We had a few inconveniences, that were addressed satisfactorally (see below) along with $100 in credit for each complaint we had. The food is very good - not cheap of course- especially the breakfast buffet for $26 which offers high quality and a nice selection. The location is relatively secluded - ideal if you want to get away from a more congested scene like Kaanapali. MInuses: The hotel is located on a bluff in a windy location. The resort is shaped like a\"U\" with the open part facing the ocean, which creates a wind tunnel effect through the pool area in the center of the \"U.\" When I stayed there, trade winds were predicted to be 15-20 mph throughout the island, however at the Ritz poolside,winds were easily 25-35 mph - strong enough to make laying around the pool unpleasant. The Ritz seems to address this by a 6 foot plexiglass wall for several of the reclining sun chairs which seem to offer very little actual shelter. For this reason, we cut short our stay by 3 nights and moved to the Grand Wailea, a warmer and less windy location. Secondly, the room we stayed in was in need of repair/renovation - the carpet was older and musty smelling. I didn't feel comfortable, having my 13 month old daughter crawl on it. Also, the door frame was cracked and the TV was old (with no convenient AV jacks in front of the TV which I use to review my photos and videos recorded for the day). Thirdly, I noticed several ants in my room, which I complained about on my first day. Apparently the ants weren't exterminated promptly and my baby girl suffered about a dozen ant bites. Another important consideration is that the three pools are all 3.5 feet deep with no deep areas for diving nor any slides or other extra features. The pool was not heated as well, making it less inviting for my baby girl to get comfortable in. Also, the closest beach is about a 5-10 min walk down hill but the waves break a bit rough - not ideal for snorkeling. Also I paid extra for a ocean view room which turned out to feature a partial view of ocean if I were standing on the deck. I paid roughly half the full price since I was part of a convention.

Boy, did she hit the head on the nail. She escorted us to check in which took only a couple of minutes. Next to our delight they up-graded us to a club level. Our room was great, nothing out of place, dirty, or outdated. It was perfect from the minute we arrived to the minute we had to leave. The weather was beautiful, we stayed 7 days and only on the last day it was mostly cloudy but warm. Flemming beach was beautiful, the surf was great, not to rough, and the wind was pretty calm during our stay. The air temp was 83-86 degrees most days and mostly bright sunshine. Water temp. felt about 76 degrees. Kapalua Bay is just a great beach and we went quite a few times to snorkel and soak up the sun. Reiko Fukino still entertains in the lobby lounge some evenings and she is still great! I could not find one thing to complain about this entire week, oh what a week!

We have stayed at the Kapalua Ridge Villas several times with our boys as well as just by ourselves. We have also stayed at the Hyatt at Kanaapali. All of those were fun times and we were happy with the accommodations. However, in stayng at the Ritz for a week in October, I would have to say that we will definitely be doing that again! We wanted a quiet time just to ourselves and the Ritz provided all of that plus the excellent customer service. From the time of check-in, to our times laying out by the pool or by the beach, the staff were friendly and always greeted us. I was also impressed with how the coffee cart in the morning really made sure that they found some soy milk for my latte, since I don't drink milk! A short drive down is the Kapalua Bay where you can snorkle and we didn't mind the 3 minute drive there at all. The grounds of the Ritz are so beautiful and the surroundings with the golf courses really takes you away. If you like the hustle and bustle, this may not be the place for you since you can't just \"walk\" to lots of shops or eating places. It's more a time to relax and get away. The rooms are all well appointed and spacioius with all the great ammenities--not exrememly luxurious however. My only complaint is that the lanai eating place upstairs right off the lobby--our waitress was very slow and it took forever to get our food and by the time we got it, my husband's food was cold!

The front desk staff made us feel like they thought they were better than us, when in actuality they should have been servicing us and making us feel like kings and queens, especially at the prices we were paying! The other guests also seemed to be pretty uppity and not at all friendly. The most annoying part of our stay was our inability to use the pool area because it is situated in some sort of wind tunnel. People lounging by the pool were often wrapped up in their big white Ritz-Carlton towels trying to keep from freezing to death from the onslaught of the deafening wind. We tried on several occasions to use the pool area, but everytime was the same. The beach, which was within walking distance, suffered the same problem of rough winds and, thus, rough currents. If you want to escape the winds you need to drive to the beaches further south on Maui, so I would recommend just staying at a hotel down there.

I was leery of the resort due to the numerous negative reviews that are posted on this site. After my stay, I've got to report that my fears were unfounded. From the moment we stepped off the transport bus (or in my case my rental car) we were treated like royalty. The concierge and his staff arranged for a private check-in for our group. What a way to start a vacation/business trip - with yummy local treats and that gorgeous view of the blue ocean beyond. Our room was spacious and clean. IMHO was tastefully decorated in a subdued tropical motiff. The beds were so comfortable. Down comforters and mattress pads. Bliss on a bed! The partial ocean view from my lanai was just that. You could see the ocean with a little bit of neck craning. Our room overlooked the spacious lawn and tennis courts. In the distance you could see the beach area. A little bit of a walk but if it really was an issue you could call for the golf cart for a ride up the road. The room was kept clean throughout our stay. We had no issues with bugs or other vermin. Although one of our group members reported that the staff had left water in their ice bucket from the past guest and mold had started to grow. The cleaning staff was responsive to her and to us. Whatever we needed-we received in a timely manner. The one thing that was a little off - was the layout of the hotel. It took a little to get used to. To get to our room (1329 - executive suite) you had to walk down two \"never ending\" and at times stuffy hallways and take \"the second\" elevator down to the third floor. But again this was a minor issue in the scheme of things. Some members of our group experienced what I call \"sticker shock\". Most understood that Hawaii was expensive with Maui being the most expensive of all of the islands. Add to that the fact that we're at Ritz which adds at least 25% more to any bill. All we could think was \"ouch\"! There aren't many placed where I would consider paying $30 for a buffet breakfast and smile while doing it. But I'm on vacation, the food was good, the view was better - I just acknowledged that it's expensive and moved on. Not a gripe just a comment. Another minor problem for some - was the location. The Ritz is located in a \"remote\" area approximately 15 minutes from Kaanapali and Lahaina. Most of the group had nothing on the agenda except sunning by the pool and watching for whales on our lanais. The rest of us were forewarned and got cars so that we could explore the island. The remoteness is part of the attraction for me. The area is beautiful and quiet. If needed adventure I'd head off to Lahaina. My husband and I were lucky enough to have a couple of spa treatments. The spa itself is tucked away on the fourth floor the hotel. It is smaller than I expected. The \"wait and relax\" area seemed a little cramped and busy. Many people going in and out which made it hard to concentrate on relaxing. The treatments were good but expensive. Their saving grace was that they didn't push their spa goodies on us after we were done with our treatments. The last thing I usually want to hear is that my skin ----- and would be \"vastly\" improved if I used their $50 face creams and lotions. One thing that overcomes all of minor negatives is the Ritz' commitment to customer service. As I said before, they treated us like royalty. We weren't Joe Schmo's, we were Mr Schmo! Most of the people in my group experienced the same. Two examples of the kind of customer service provided. A couple in our group brought their 10-mos old son, they told me that each time they walked through the lobby, their son would receive a small gift - a small stuffed animal or a t-shirt. They really cater to the small keikis and were wonderful to this little boy. Another couple joined the Ritz sponsored \"leisure walk\" around the Kapalua resort. Unfortunately, the employee was new and basically checked all of the people in and then did her own power walk, leaving the 40-50-60 year olds huffing and puffing in her wake. The couple voiced their complaints with the concierge. All they wanted was something more than the \"ok - so you didn't like the walk - what do you want me to do about it\" response. They were impressed with the concierge's initial response. \"We're sorry - she is new and will receive more training on customer service. Please accept my apologies\". The Ritz staff called them later on that afternoon, again apologized, was given an update regarding the employee and get this - was give a complimentary massage for two\". Why they couldn't add me to the list of walkers I don't know. Customer service is their forte' and it shows. You felt welcomed at this resort. You will never passed a staff member without hearing \"aloha\" or receiving a small smile or nod in acknowledgement. The resort itself was spectacular. Beautiful views from the lobby and throughout the resort. Although it isn't directly ocean-side, I have more respect for the Ritz for valuing the sacredness of the site to the Hawaiian people and building higher up the mountain. All in all it was a great week. I would not hesitate to stay at the Ritz again. By the way - the Feast at Lele, Skyline EcoAdventure's zip lines and Warren and Annabelle's are not to be missed.

Half way through our stay we had to request a room change due to the non-stop crying infant next to us. Although we moved and were equally happy with our room getting settled in for 8 days and then having to move is a tad aggravating- but oh well. What bothered me more is the fact that this hotel obviously caters to honeymooners or those like us with no kids looking for a relaxing trip or families with small children. They should be conscious when placing people in rooms that maybe the couple looking for peace and quiet may not want to be next to a family with a toddler and newborn. Every time we walked down the hall we saw numerous cribs-etc. Again- the staff took care of us but not until a whole night of a baby crying. Don't pay to valet- too easy to park yourself. Service at beachfront was not the best-we rented a palapa for the day and never could find someone to take our numerous drink orders- maybe they were short staffed that day. all in all- really pretty but definately isolated if you want to do more touristy activities- Hana- Oreo Gulch-etc. Make the hike to the waterfall at Oreo Gulch - really beautiful-and not crowded like the seven pools.

Nice experience. we now call it the 'fat trip' since we gained so much weight during our stay (even though we swam and hiked every day). our room was on the top floor, very quiet with a great view. because you are a great distance away from the water, you will not hear the ocean. The room was probably about 500 square feet and very nice, although starting to feel dated then. (i believe they are refurbishing now). The club level costs a bit more, but you probably save money in the long run. food is free and alcohol is free. and you get a special key to the club level and other perks (like free breakfast buffet). if you drink and eat alot, book the club level. The grounds are huge, with ancient hawaiin burial grounds, dramatic golf courses and you will never feel pinched in the way you will at the four seasons wailea during high season. there is more wind here than wailea. less kids here than wailea. easier to get a tee time here than wailea. basically, less crowded than wialea. THE COVE: there is great snorkelling at a cove nearby. free shuttle from the hotel to the cove. free self-parking. also, you are closer to the maui blow hole which no one ever talks about. if you are at the maui ritz, check it out! the drive it a bit hairy, but worth it. The beach here is far from the main edifice, but really special. no one on it. deserted. but not the best for snorkelling - hey, go to the cove for snorkelling! Having stayed in wailea at 4 seasons and kea lani, i would recommed the ritz carlton to honeymooners or the more adventurous who still want to be pampered a bit. If you are a golfer, the rits is ideal, better than the makena and wailea experience. the driving range itself has an amazing vista, the course you have seen on TV during the PGA tournamant. Tiger was staying on the club level when we were there. Versus FS wailea or Kea Lani, i would certainly recommend the ritz at high season since wailea becomes packed with people.

Things we liked: The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very well maintained/manicured. Beautiful pools and 2 large jacuzzis on the property. There are 2 different towels available by the pool, one for you to dry off with and another for your lounge chair. The beach is a short hike down a hill past the Hawaiian burial site. Not too bad of a hike, but a little inconvenient. We had a ground floor room that had a small lanai with 2 charis and a table. The room was a good size with nice Hawaiian furniture and a mini fridge to keep our drinks cold. Didn't notice any weird smells. The bathroom was HUGE. There were 2 separate showers (one a stand up and the other with a tub), 2 sinks, and plenty of nice shampoos, conditioners, etc. 2 terrycloth robes and slippers were also provided in the room. Large closet also. The staff were friendly and upon arrival they give you a nice cold hand towel to cool off with and offer you a drink. My husband also lost his wedding ring during our stay by accidentally leaving it on the bed . When housekeeping came, the ring apparently got mixed in with the sheets. After a call to the front desk, they were able to find and return the ring to us the next day. There is a great little convience store located by the golf course before the Ritz entrance that had great food and was cheap. Things that could've been better: A couple of the jacuzzi tiles had come off and were not fixed. Not a big deal, but for a Ritz Carlton, we expected more attention to detail. The parking lot was kind of far from the hotel entrance, so if you have a lot of luggage and are not going to use the valet, I'd recommend dropping off the luggage first and then going to park your car. Otherwise you'll have to lug it all downhill to the hotel. Also, at night the parking lot gets kind of crowded so you may have a pretty far walk to your room and the parking lot is poorly lit. We had told the Ritz in advance that it was our anniversary, but nothing special or extra was provided as some other people had mentioned. Not that big of a deal, but it would've been nice. The location on Maui itself could be better. It's on the windy, side so often we would get dark clouds rolling in along with some brief showers. The Ritz is kind of far and secluded from a lot of other attractions in Maui such as Wailea, Haleakala, etc. It's about an hour drive from the airport. Lahaina and Whaler's Village were relatively close to the hotel. Probably about a 20 min drive. Overall it was a nice stay, but it was a definate splurge and we normally don't spend that much on a hotel room. So for the price I don't think we would stay there again just based on the location alone. I think we'll try somewhere more central.

Been to the Ritz,Kapalua property three times and yes we will go back if not yearly. Stayed for 10 days this time and just recharged while there. Yes the rooms need updating, yes the food is not all that good, and yes sometimes the service can be spotty. When we stayed at the Ritz, I was concerned to of all the current negative reviews as we have not been back in three years. We figured, you cannot go wrong with the Ritz so we chose to come back. Service was outstanding from the moment your car pulled up to the lei greeting at the front desk and down to your room. Since we have a one year old, I requested a room that is of garden view but lead directly to the pool. The first room provided did not have immediate access. Requested another room and the next time we were provided an Ocean View room with direct access to the pool and playground. Unheard of specially during Christmas holiday week. We spent 6 days poolside and really enjoyed ourselves. After a while, you get to know the people around you from different states and countries. We inquired on how their stay was going and 15 out of the 16 we asked consistently responded that - you can never go wrong at the Ritz in Kapalua. Most of the families come from the East and the South and just really enjoyed their 8-10 days in Kapalua. Here is the deal. When you stay at the Ritz in Kapalua or Ritz in general, you choose to stay for the experience. Its not the luxurious rooms or the good food or the outstanding service or the Hollywood and Sports Celebs which the place was peppered with (Kinear, Hopper, Parker and Broderick, LT, Vijay, Pettit,etc...) by themselves but the whole package. When you stay at the Ritz, you pay for the experience. Do not expect to save a few dollars on the food or receive a discounted room. If that is the goal, then the Ritz is not for you. Service at the Ritz, Kapalua is outstanding. There will always be some bad apples as with any other place. Ritz, Kapalua employees and management still practice the Ritz Credo and Basics (ie. Smile - you are on stage, We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen...). For additional information, please visit this website: Yes, the carpets and room had some musty smell. We lived in the tropics for several years and know first hand the challenge of mixing carpet, humidity/tropical climate can lead to this challenge. Its not because the rooms were not cleaned or maintained, its just the mixture of materials and the climate. In fact, I saw them shampoo and steam cleanded several rooms. Nice gesture but carpet lifespan in this environment is about 5 years. We also discovered that the Kapalua property will be undergoing renovations beginning in March 06 with plans of adding flat pannel TV, ***Tiles*** in lieu of carpet,etc... Wade, a Director at the Ritz invited me to three model units as prototype for the rest of the property. We ran out of time so was unable to view the rooms and take pictures for this audience. Wade promised that an announcement is forthcoming and pictures posted on their website for the public to see. The New Year's eve Luaua was fantastic and cost $100 per person including unlimited drinks. This was a gourmet buffet. The entertainment was fun and food was excellent!! Trust me, we come from San Francisco. As I said the service was outstanding with a few bad apples.

However, we had already booked and paid a deposit before I read the reviews, so it was a point of no return. In general, I was very pleased with the RC. We stayed there 12/22 to 12/29 and the weather was perfect the whole time. Only on one morning was it overcast and windy, but no rain the entire time. It was occasionally windy by the pool and on the beach, but the sun was hot enough to make the wind pleasant and cooling, rather than annoying. Check in was smooth. We were immediately greeted with a lei and a fresh fruit drink, although we did have to wait in line for about 15 minutes before being attended to at the desk. We had booked a garden view for the first 4 nights and then an ocean view for the remainder of the trip, they upgraded us to an ocean view for the whole stay, so we wouldn't have to move. The lobby and grounds are really pretty. The room was probably the biggest disappointment of the stay. The man at reception kept asking us if it was ok with us to be on the ground floor and we said \"fine\", given that he was upgrading us, but perhaps we should have taken that as a warning. There definitely was an obvious musty smell. This was covered up in the mornings with a flower scented spray housekeeping used, but by the afternoon it was pretty obvious. Perhaps it is just ground floor rooms that smell bad? I'm pretty sensitive to bad smells and it wasn't bad enough for me to ask for a room change, it was bearable. The linens and towels were fine, not super luxurious, but not torn or thin or anything. The furniture was fine, if a little spartan and the bathroom was quite nice. The carpet was truly terrible and this needs to go! Our view was pretty good, especially from our lanai, and I liked our location with easy access to the pool and the grassy area. A long walk to the lobby, though! The pool was very pretty and nice and warm. The pool towels are plentiful, large and soft. The pool service was ok, not great. I always had to find my own chair and get my own towels, an unheard of event at the 4 seasons, but at least it saved me in tips! Rarely I would see attendants walking around with free pineapple or iced water to offer. The staff from the pool bar are very attentive and the food was great, although pricey, as expected. My biggest beef is that there was absolutely no shade, unless you booked and paid for a cabana ($75 a day). The 4 seasons offers complimentary cabanas and has many more of them. The RC needs to provide umbrellas for the people who don't want to fork out $75 just to sit by the pool. All the food we had at the restaurants was good. We actually liked our dinner at the Terrace better than the Banyon Tree. Food is expensive, as expected at the RC. $5 sodas at the beach restaurant - this is a small cup with lots of ice and little soda. The beach is only a short walk. Not a big deal. The beach is much more secluded and private than the beaches at either Kaanapali or Waliea. It was nice to only have to share the beach with RC guests and a few locals. We walked along the beaches at both Kaanapali and Waliea and there are literally hundreds of resort guests on both beaches, vying for space. I liked the quietness of the RC beach. The only downside is that they won't let you take any of their beach chairs onto the beach, I don't understand why when all the other resorts do it. Overall, I was pleased with the RC and would stay there again, but perhaps only if we could get a better deal on the rooms. We paid $475 for the first 4 nights and $725 for the last three.

This was my 11th trip to Maui and most definitely the best. The exact dates of our trip were December 9th-19th. Reservations The Ritz-Carlton website was easy to use as always and I was able to book dinner reservations, tee times, spa services, and room upgrades all through the website and email with the hotel concierge. The reservation staff was very helpful and met every request we had. The same can be said for the hotel management. I was in constant contact prior to our trip with Wade H. of the RCK management team and he offered a room upgrade at not cost for our honeymoon. Arrival/Check In The door staff was very friendly and helpful. They immediately directed us to the front desk and informed us they would meet us with our luggage after check-in. We were presented with a lei and guava juice upon our approach to the check-in counter. The staff was all smiles and very hospitable. As stated earlier they accommodated and upgrade to a deluxe ocean view. After check in the bell staff walked us to our room while giving us an overview of the hotel and its services. Great experience! Rooms The rooms DO NOT smell poorly as indicated in many reviews. We walked into six or seven different rooms during our stay and all of them had a very fresh flower smell.

My wife didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even notice. The facility itself does not look dated. In fact it looked very modern and new. Spa/Pool/Athletic The spa is nice, a little small but nice. I have seen smaller five star resort spas and larger. It had all the amenities one would expect. The three tiered pool is nice and it keeps the crowds separated. The tennis courts/club are/is being remodeled, we think. They may be getting rid of their tennis club all together. We played tennis a couple of days and it is a beautiful facility however it needs to be fixed up. The beach is a short walk down the hill and is nice and secluded. Every beach in Hawaii is public so you share it with the locals but you hardly notice they are there. The beach bar/restaurant is perfectly situation next to the sand. Food Other reviews talk about how expensive the food is at the Ritz. Yes, it is expensive but think about what Island you are on. As stated earlier I have been to Maui numerous times and I found the dining costs far less (with the exception of the Banyon Tree) than any of the hotels on Wailea. Case in point: the breakfast buffet at the RCK is priced at $24 per person. The three star Renaissance Wailea is $29 per person and less quality. All food in Hawaii is expensive, the Ritz Carlton is no different. Yes, the Banyon Tree is extremely pricy. $52 for their lobster/steak combo. My duck was $32. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great experience, you must do it once. Staff The staff at the Ritz was the best part. Absolutely amazing. EVERY time you passed a staff member they smiled and said hello, and your name if they knew it. Roger (from France) at the Banyon tree is AMAZING. Best service I have EVERY had was from him. Spa staff is great, pool staff is great, everyone was great. Location/Weather We never saw one drop of rain the entire time we were there. Perfectly clear blue skies the entire time of our stay. 82 degrees every day with only a slight breeze the first and last day, absolutely perfect. The location is on the North side of the island but close to Lahaina. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why other reviews say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be prepared to drive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Drive where? Anywhere you stay on the island you have to drive to excursions. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let that sway you. If you want to drive to Haleakala it will take a while, if you want to drive to Lahaina you have the advantage over those that stay on Weilea. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all six one half dozen or the other. Opportunities The spa needs a full time staff member to clean the mens room. They only have three showers and they are used frequently. Every time I used their showers I was having to step over used towels etc. The spa is nice, it just needs to be better maintained. Price at the Banyon Tree. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little steep. Final Thoughts You can save yourself $15 a day by self parking. The self parking lot is no more than 25 yards from the front door. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what other reviews were talking about when they said it was far. Really, it is one of the best experiences I have ever had at a five star resort. I have stayed at all the big hotels on Wailea and the value isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even close. We paid mid 200\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s each night for our RC stay. The rates for the same time period on Wailea were in the 400\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The Renaissance Wailea was in the 300\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and that hotel is terrible. Kapalua is secluded, quiet, and perfect for all types. We saw plenty of kids and there was plenty for them to do. We also saw a lot of young honeymooners and we all had a blast.

It should be noted that if you just want to soak up the sun this may not be the place as being on the north shore it gets the worst of the weather. It can be blowy and gets a lot more rain. We had a couple of days which rained hard but then we were always out and about so didn't bother us. The hotel is certainly five star and has all the ammenities you would require. If I was really being picky I could point out that some things look slightly worn here and there but nothing major. Our ocean view room upgrade was awesome and everyone at the resort was particularly friendly. No issues with any musty smells in the rooms as I have read others to say, but i could see why that might happen given that area gets it's fair share of rain. Our room was spotless everyday. I'd certainly recommend the hotel and it's very handily placed to Lahanai if you are looking for dining alternatives. The Golf was superb and the plantation course is the cream of the crop.

Leave your kids at home. The pool area is very quiet so we tried the beach. It was very windy and cold. Skip the Ritz beach and go to the Kapalua Bay Hotel beach in the hotel shuttle. Much better beach. No food or drink service on the beach but you can walk up to the pool bar and order to-go there. Now the rooms...they are in need of a major renovation. The carpet has to be the same carpet they installed 13 years ago. It was gross. Beds were very comfortable, but furniture looks like it may have been nice 13 years ago as well. Sheets and towels also need to be replaced. We stayed at the Grand Wailea the remainder of our trip. Customer service was not the same but the kids had a much better time there.

Check-in was prompt, efficient and friendly. The Ritz was not stuffy as so many are, but casual in a classy way. The hotel had open air entrance and terraces and beautiful art displayed everywhere. The breakfast buffet was bountiful and service was outstanding. In fact, all the staff greeted with smiles and a warm \"Aloha.\" Our partial ocean view room had an attractive view of green expanse with palm trees and uncluttered grounds, but scarcely a tad of blue to be seen. We requested an upgrade which we received on the third night of our eight night stay. The \"new\" room definitely smelled musty (though everything was clean), one of the shutter doors to the terrace did not work smoothly, the faucet in the bathroom sink dripped, there was someone's leftover food in the mini-fridge and the carpet had some stains. The first room was in better shape and more pleasing, but these were only minor matters that certainly did not detract from a very comfortable and relaxing stay. Golf was why we chose this hotel and we were not disappointed. The courses were gorgeous and in excellent condition but carts had to remain on cart paths for the most part. That meant LOTS of walking and these were long, hilly courses. I was a rider most of the time but my golfer husband thoroughly enjoyed these top notch courses. I took some great photos of gorgeous scenery. The resort location is removed from the action of Lahaina but a close drive and easily done. There were occasional showers, but light and brief and it did get windy, especially out in the open of the golf courses. (Most of the time the weather was sunny and not too hot.) But then, one does know this when coming here if the homework is done and does not let minor weather inconveniences tarnish the overall beauty and low-key, but gracious surroundings and service that can be expected. It was a very pleasant experience. We especially enjoyed the casual snack/bar area near the beach. The pool was beautiful and there were lots of chaise lounges available. The grounds, setting and Kapalua area are quiet, beautiful and so relaxing it's hard not to enjoy. The $15 daily service charge did not include local phone calls. But the shuttle to the golf courses and their recommended restaurants was a welcome convenience, as the parking lot was a bit of a walk and uphill(did not want to pay the $15 daily valet parking fee, but when you're paying this much for a top-notch vacation spot, some would not care).

Rainy? Yes, it does rain daily - everywhere in the Hawaiian Islands for that matter - usually at night or very early morning for about 15 - 20 minutes. Windy? More like breezy which is the case for most of the island. Bugs? Are you kidding me? Not at this hotel. Not in the bed, not in the bath not even on the lanai. Service? Oh and how...Not one employee failed to say \"aloha, good morning, afternoon etc upon passing. Phone anywhere in the resort- valet, front desk, housekeeping etc and the call is always answered with \"aloha mr or mrs so and so. How may we help?\" Maid service twice daily keeps the room spotless. Nighly turn down service with complimentary bottles of water on each nightstand. We were celebrating our anniversary and received upon check in, large fruit basket and chocolate covered strawberries on a bed of fresh coconut plus congratulatory letters. All staff we encountered were gracious and polite. More than I can say for some of the guests - way too stuffy and uptight and on occasion - down right rude. Hint: Relax, have fun, SMILE - you're on vacation. Stained carpet, worn rooms/hallways etc? Where did these people stay? True, some of the furnishings were rattan (not my personal favorite) but certainly not old and crusty. Tv is not a flat screen plasma HD. This matters? Maybe if you're paying $500 and up a night. And if you are, next time talk to your travel agent. We've been working with a wonderful gal that has been saving us money for years. The Ritz usually offers a free night special that includes daily buffet breakfast. Comparing the rates directly through the hotel vs what our travel agent could work out - big difference plus the perks of breakfast, free night, convertible car, etc. We have taken advantage of this special both January 2005 and October 2005. At $26pp for breakfast buffet, we welcomed the savings. Location - Northwestern side of the island slightly removed from the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali or Lahaina but only 10 - 15 min drive. If you want to be in the middle of the action (the \"strip\" numerous hotels/shops/restaurants/bars) stay in one the two aforementioned areas. For a bit more privacy, Kapalua is perfect. From our partial ocean view room, we enjoyed beautiful views of Molokai, sunset, some ocean and palm trees. We had a deluxe ocean view in January - full ocean view - no obstructions. Interior of both rooms was exactly the same - king bed with down mattress cover/comforter/pillows - marble bath with double sinks, shower/tub combo, separate shower and separate toilet. Plus two incredibly plush robes and slippers. Slippers average - robes well above average. But both were free for use during your stay. Have visited other resorts in the islands that charge for both. Resort fee? $15 daily per room and yes it is a nickle and dime thing but that's the same with all of Hawaii. Almost all resorts charge either a daily parking fee or resort fee. Four Seasons is about the only resort that doesn't charge for those things but the nightly rate well makes up for that $15. Golf/beach/pool/grounds - We don't golf so firsthand knowledge of the links doesn't extend past what was asthetically pleasing. Beach is awesome! Crescent shaped, soft sand, crystal clear water and fairly private. All beaches in Maui are public. However, Ritz Carlton is the only resort that fronts the beach so it's never crowded. The three tiered pool is terraced into the hillside and is open 24hours along with the hot tubs. Plenty of poolside lounges - no 7am scramble for a seat. Grounds are lush and well manicured. Lots of flowers and foliage. Not a speck of trash other than those inconsiderates who carelessly flick their cigarette butts where ever they chose. Come on guys - use an ashtray already! We witnessed several employees taking the time to stop and pick them up. Dining - The Banyan Tree and the sushi bar Kai are wonderful. Also breakfast at the Terrace with sweeping views of the grounds and pool was fantastic. Banyan Tree is such a treat for a well executed gourmet meal though your wallet won't necessarily agree. If you're looking to spend a little less on food costs, don't eat at the resort or any resort for that matter. Resort dining is always more expensive than it is off property no matter where you stay. The room had a brand new mini fridge which I would suggest utilizing if you're looking to save $$. All of the above info is based on the assumption that one will rent a car while on island (pick up and drop off at the airport is easiest). Maui is such a diverse and beautiful island - without the car you will certainly miss out on most of the sights. We had a ball at the Ritz but are really in love with the island and it's people in general. Maui is the perfect mix of all the islands in one. Definitely something for everyone.

I recently traveled to Maui on business and decided to treat myself to a one night stay at the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua Maui. This resort is located on the Lahaina side of the island - about 1 hour from Kahalui Aiport. My expectations were set pretty high. This hotel prides itself on being that of a five star hotel- it's far from it. I am not a golfer so I don't pretend to know much about the whole golfing experience that this particular hotel is known for. What I can tell you is that the front desk and valet are very nice folks. I was pretty much assaulted with a fresh flower lei and an ice cold drink at check in. I was certainly feeling the \"Aloha spirit,\" even though I am from Oahu. The woman at the front desk was helping train another gentleman so my check in took a little longer than normal, but that is okay. I was given my room key and I happily wandered off to my room, enjoying all the anticipation of a relaxing visit. My room was about 1/4 mile away- again...that is okay. I needed the exercise. As I left the main lobby, I slowly creeped into a part of the hotel that is starting to look a little shabby. Oh well, it was a lobby- I entered the room and was really let down. The floor was a little dirty, the beds looked comfy but when I plopped down on it- there was a poof of dust that led me into 3 minutes of sneezing. The furniture was worn and scratched with what looked like crayon in some areas. The clock radio was totally beat up as was the telephone. I entered the bathroom to find towels with Ritz logos that looked in about the same condition of those towels that I use to dry my dogs. You know that type- about 5 years ago they were your best towels- and now you just use them as handy wipes to mop things up. The fixures were scratched and I was less than impressed. I came back from dinner to turn on the light and find 5 baby cockroaches flying around the sink fixtures. I killed 2 but 3 got away. I'm a girl that is used to living in the tropics and I can catch a roach with the best of them. I do NOT want to see roaches in a hotel that expects guests to pay $300 / night. Now, that being said, I did not pay that. I did get a Kamaaina rate ...but it was still $195!!! I went to the desk to explain about the roaches- they offered to \"spray\" my room. Now, I was a little tipsy from the $10 drinks - so I don't want to smell RAID roach killer while I try and get a good nights sleep. I was very surprised that I was not offered another room- they should have offered to help me move into another room, don't you think?

We played in Wailea too and found it to be crowded. Our room at the Ritz was not the best decorated but it was clean and spacious (we stayed in a suite with a view of the golf course). I found the rooms at the Four Seasons to be dark but better furnished and modern. We thought the service at the Ritz was much better than that at the Four Seasons.

We did not feel as relaxed when we moved to the Four Seasons. The amenities were much better (and mostly free) at the Four Seasons, but crowded. The Ritz does charge for things that the Four Seasons does not but it does make for more crowded pool time, waiting for the valet and longer time to be serviced. The buffet breakfast at both places were terrible compared to the fresh food you were offered at the breakfast buffet at the Kapalua Bay Hotel. The restaurants were Ok in Kapalua. We ate at Vinos and found the tapas to be ok. We also ate lunch at the Pineapple Grill (I think that is the name, it is located on one of the golf courses) and the food was good but not excellent. There were definitely fewer selections to choose from if you didn't want to drive. The beach at the Ritz is windy and choppier than the beach near the Kapalua Bay Hotel. If you were to spend time at the beach, take the shuttle there for good snorkeling and calmer water. Overall, if you are looking for a more relaxed stay, good golf and a great view, stay in Kapalua If you want more restaurant choices, better shopping and better amenities, stay at the Four Seasons. You do have to \"beat the crowd\" at the pool for prime cabanas and deal with more kids at the Four Seasons. For honeymooners looking for quiet and solitidue, consider the Ritz instead. My husband loved the Ritz and would never go back to the Four Seasons. I found both to be great for different reasons.

Service throughout the hotel was fast, friendly and wonderful. The Club Level costs approximately $100/day more than a regular room but in our opinion the extra cost is worth the personal pampering, the all-day food (changes 5 times during the day and is all very delicious -- lots of tasty gourmet appetizers), free drinks (we had multiple dirty martini's and/or mai tai's every evening before going to dinner), helpful private concierge and other extra services that the Club Level provides. The room was very clean and comfortable, especially the lania (balcony) which directly overlooked hole #3 of the Kapalua Bay Golf Course (and the ocean and other islands in the distance) and featured a large nice table and two chaise lounges. The room decor was above average and Hawaiian-themed, down to the metal pineapples that are featured on the balcony railings. Those who expect ultra-modern furnishings will be disappointed -- this is a Hawaiian beach resort and the furnishings are more themed to this type of locale and culture than they would be to a toney modern hotel located in other mainland resorts (no ultra suede upholstery and halogen lamps here). The furnishings are not new, but they are clean and nice and fit the theme. The TV is not a fancy plasma -- yes, it's a Magnavox that works just fine (and in my opinion, if you are going to Maui to watch TV you could save yourself alot of money by staying home). The bathroom was classic Ritz -- all marble, large and terrific -- and we liked all the great smelling Ritz Carlton bath potions and products too. Speaking of smell -- we also feared finding the musty/mildew smell that others here have experienced, and we were pleasantly relieved to not smell anything beyond the normal \"humid\" conditions found at all beach resorts. The grounds of the hotel are also lovely and extremely well-maintained -- lots of beautiful island flowers, great views and singing tropical birds. Pretty pool area too. We never made it to the beach but did play two rounds of golf on the spectacular Kapalua and Wailea courses. In a previous trip to Maui I stayed in the Four Season Wailea -- another wonderful hotel that is newer and has a more modern \"feel\" than the Ritz Carlton. I happened to like the Ritz Kapalua equally as much if not better and after my wife and I visited Wailea to play golf, we decided that we also prefer Kapalua's scenery and ambiance over Wailea.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Ritz\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4041040", "Content": "We stayed at the Ritz in Maui from October 2nd - 12th. I was a bit nervous after reading all the negative reviews. But decided to go with an open mind. From the moment that we arrived, we received the 5star service that we expected from the Ritz. When checking in I mentioned that we were getting married while on our visit to Maui. When we got to our room, we were pleased to discover that they had upgraded us from a garden view to a partial ocean/pool view. While we were unpacking we received a letter along with coconut-chocolate covered strawberries. They wanted to congratulate us on our upcoming wedding. (nice touch) A few days later we received another card thanking us for our stay along with a Ritz Carlton photo album. Any time we called housekeeping or the bell desk we were always greeted by our name. The staff was very prompt, whenever we called for service we had what we needed in less than 15 minutes. One tip, if you use the valet service and move your car by 10pm, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge you the $15 fee. The Ritz is definitely a 5star hotel when it comes to service. The rooms are a bit outdated I must admit. I tend to like the higher end hotels and expect the rooms to be 5 star quality. However, the room itself and the bathroom were very spacious. The large closet had a full length mirror and there was plenty of space to either hang or put your clothes away. The beds were also surprisingly very comfortable. Over all, the room needs to be redecorated but it's not that bad! There were so many other things that made up for it. The pool area is beautiful and was never crowded. We were always able to find a spot right next to the pool, overlooking the ocean. The beach is down the hill, about a 5 minute walk, but worth it. The beach at the Ritz is very private compared to the other beaches in Kaanapali. The Ritz has it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own beach side bar/restaurant. The have lounge chairs available on a small grassy area just above the sand area over looking the ocean. If you dont want to take the walk to and from the pool, you can get a ride up and down the hill. We enjoyed the walk back and forth from the beach as the scenery was gorgeous. While at the Ritz, we ate at the Terrace Restaurant. The Sea Bass was incredible and worth every penny. The beach side grill also had the best Kuala pork sandwich!! Another thing, Kapalua is known to have more rain and wind. We thought it was fine. It is actually really green due to the rain. We saw rainbows over the hills to the North of us almost every day. If you like Sushi, you have to eat at Sansei Seafood and Sushi at the Kapalua Shops. It's less than a 5 minute drive from the Ritz. (make sure to make reservations as we got turn down the 1st time we tried to eat there as it was already booked full) Since we were getting married while we were there, we had family and friends at other hotels on the island. After visiting some of the other hotels down in the Kaanapali area, we were happy that we chose the Ritz. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind driving down to Kaanapali/Lahaina where the majority of the action and night-life is. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 10 minute drive) The beaches, shops and restaurant in Kaanapali were always busy. We walked along the path way and the pool area at the other hotles were really crowded and not very private. The beach are in Kaanapali was also crowded as there are a lot of hotels in that one area. We like the idea that we could escape the crowds back at the Ritz, where it was very private and peaceful. We also drove down to the Wailea area to check out the beaches and the hotels. The area is very nice and the weather was a bit hotter down there. Wailea has fewer hotels than Kaanapali. The beach was not as crowded. But all the hotels shared the same strip of beach. The one thing about the Ritz, is that the beach area is secluded. Wailea is also about a 35-40 minute from the main area in Lahaina. The only down side to the Ritz is the rooms need to be updated. But according to some of our friends and family who stayed at other major upscale hotels down in the Kaanapali area, their rooms were smaller than ours and they complained that there rooms needed to be updated. Overall the Ritz is a great place to stay. As we were leaving we were already talking about our next trip to Maui and how we plan to stay at the Ritz again.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Disappointment!

The hotel itself is on a gorgeous piece of property but the rooms are in terrible shape. When was the last time you saw a Magnovox TV?! The room looked like a rundown Sheraton hotel. The wallpaper was peeling off, the carpet in the room was bare-thin and the sheets on the hotel bed were worn through and there was an actual tear in the top sheet! A hole in the sheet at a luxury hotel!!!! We had a deluxe room with oceanview and for the amount of money spent, the Ritz-Carlton should have made some renovations long long ago. We were completely disappointed. Don't stay here unless you're an avid golfer because they do have great discounts for the golfing on the property. The weather in Capalua is also not as sunny and warm as it is in Wailea (where the Four Seasons is located). Again, if you're golfer, then perhaps a good idea but otherwise, stay at the Four Seasons for the money. The Ritz-Carlton charges $75 for the poolside cabana for 1 day use. The Four Seasons is free. The Ritz-Carlton charges as \"resort fee\". Four Seasons does not. Ritz charges for valet parking, Four Seasons does not. Food at the Ritz is mediocre. Food at Four Seasons was fantastic.

At the beach the do not allow you to take the lounge chairs on the actual sand because it is a public beach. Also the beach bar closes at 5:00 each day. We spent alot of time by the pool as well. There was always staff around to get you a drink or fill any other requests. Even though the property was sold out due to a convention the pool and beach never seemed overcrowded. We ate at the Beach Bar and the Terrace restaurant. We looked at the menu for the Banyon Tree but decided the entrees seemed a little more exotic than what we wanted. Both of the restaurants had decent food but a little pricey. The wine selection at the Terrace was lacking. For lunch one day we went down the street to the Honolua Store. It was crowded and the lady that took our order reminded me of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld but the food was pretty good. Overall I have to say that the Ritz Carlton Maui is spectacular.

(Not to be snobby, but to avoid children as much as humanly possible...we love them, but not in a hot tub while we are drinking wine.) We arrived at the hotel around 3pm, and it was moderately busy in the lobby. We barely noticed all the other people though, because we were so attentively taken care of from minute one. Our car was parked and luggage hauled immediately upon arrival, and we got our lei greeting right away as well. The front desk staff was excellent and we got a free upgrade to an ocean-view room. Our room was gorgeous and I have no idea what this \"mildew smell\" is that these pretentious rich people speak off. I smelled nothing but plumeria blooms and food from the fabulous restaurants the entire 10 days we spent there. As for the TV comments...who on earth travels to a tropical paradise to watch TV!? My husband and I only had the TV on for the channel with relaxing Hawaiian music playing 24/7. I also read a comment about having \"nowhere but their luggage to store their clothing.\" I have no idea what kind of room they had, but we had a normal, ocean-view room and it came equipped with about 5 dresser drawers, a few shelves and a large double closet complete with numerous hangers, robes, slippers and an auto shut-off light. The bathroom was fabulous and the twice- daily maid service was sure to replenish our towels every time they came. Our lanai was beautiful and so was our surprise ocean view. The maid service was nothing short of stellar and the food was not priced much higher than any other 5 star resort we have stayed in. Anyone complaining about the food prices clearly has no idea what the \"usual\" prices are in 5 star hotels. We food none of the prices unusual at all. The pool was fabulous, and besides the few inconsiderate people who brought their babies (yes I said babies) into the hot tub, we didn't have too many problems with children running rampant. My husband and I wondered aloud who on earth would travel to a place like this and bring children? They cannot possibly appreciate it and they have to take care of them the entire time so how is it a vacation for them? Whatever happened to Disney or Cape Cod for little ones? Anyway, I digress....we were nothing but impressed with the Ritz, even when they screwed up! They called us on our second to last day and asked us if we would mind spending a night at the Kapalua Bay resort as they had overbooked and needed the room. They were entirely gracious and apologetic with no need to be as they removed $800 from our bill and gave us hours before we had to vacate. Everyone was sweet and competant from day one. If I had to be picky, the only thing that ever bothered me was that sometimes there would be random cups and trash in the hallways that had been left by guests.

The staff and maids were very friendly and polite, they never missed a chance to say \"aloha\" to you and always went out of their way to go the extra mile for you! And the night before we departed, they called again to wish us a safe trip home to check to see if we needed assistance on the day of departure! The grounds of the hotel was beautiful and the views are breathtaking!! The Kapalua area reminds me of an exotic version of Pebble Beach, CA but more beautiful. This area is definitely the more exclusive part of Maui and not as touristy as Ka'anapalii and Wailea. If you're looking for a romantic atmosphere or just someplace calm and serene to relax, this is your best bet. But if you're looking for nightlife, places to stay with kids, Wailea and Ka'anapalii would be a better selection for you. Shopping, dining, and nightlife is only a 15-20 minute drive away in Lahaina and Ka'napalii. RC has a perfect location because it's away from all the \"busy\" areas and you can always choose to hop into the car and drive a few minutes whenever you feel like leaving the hotel. It wasn't an inconvenience to us because the drive was so scenic and relaxing! I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples if you're looking to book a romantic getaway!

After spending the last 10 days on my honeymoon at this Ritz in Kapalua, reading some of the posts here I just have to giggle. The hotel is not horribly outdated. The rooms do not reek of mildew. The beach isn't an hour's walk away. I was able to order a decent lunch and drink at the pool. Our room did have a magnavox TV, which was an older model. However, it was 27\", had a clear picture and worked fine. Besides, who travels to paradise to watch television? The service here was incredible, nothing short of perfect. Everything we asked for we were given, including some things we didn't ask for like an ocean view room and a bottle of champange on our arrival. They bend over backwards for their guests, and my only thoughts as to why some people find the service unacceptable is because (a) they are overprivileged snobs or (b) they are overprivileged snobs. The grounds and property are simply fantastic. One of the best things about this hotel is how out of the way it is -- it makes for a very relaxing stay compared to the other resorts on the island that are all in the thick of the action. It's a 20 min drive to Lahaina to go out on the town, and there are a few great restaurants in the immediate area: Sansei (wonderful sushi), The Banyan Tree (at the hotel), The Plantation House (Hawai'ian cuisine), Roy's (5 min in Kahana). The beach was a bit small but it was quite beautiful, and the nearby Kapalua bay and Ka'anapali beaches are very easy to get to. Staying at the Ritz gives you beach privileges at Kapaula bay as well. I also recommend a trip down to Wailea, the beach there was fantastic. As you might imagine, there is no shortage of amazing beaches on Maui :) The pool was wonderful; clean and clear and nicely heated. There are two hot tubs, and a few putting greens, shuffleboard, bocce ball, and tennis courts all near the pool to keep you entertained if lying around has you bored. We also spent one afternoon in their spa and got a couples massage in the garden. Being under the tent with the soft music playing and listening to birds and other exotic life chirp away in the backround just plain awesome. One of the highlights of the trip. All in all, we had a fantastic trip and a great stay at the Ritz. One of the couples we met there were returning for their 5th anniversary after their honeymoon stay, and another couple we met said they've stayed all over Maui and the Ritz just takes the cake. It's serene location, beautiful gorunds and exceptional service put it ahead of the rest.

I was assured that my request would be entered into their reservations system. The day we left for Maui, since we were scheduled to arrive at the hotel about midnight, I called again to check on my earlier request. Guess what? We arrived exhausted and were rudely treated by a woman behind the desk who was wearing a parka - she clearly wasn't the usual desk clerk - our daugher and her family went to their room after they were assured it was set up with a crib - it wasn't. My husband and I went to check out our room and I couldn't barely breathe in it -- as I said to my husband, \"Somebody just sprayed this room,\" a man appeared who asked if the room was okay. He told us he had just been told to spray it because of the mildew smell - the \"desk clerk\" had called him on her walkie-talkie while we were walking to the room. After much discussion back at the desk, the night manager grudgingly moved us - to a really faded room with stained carpet, promising to move us the next day. The next day the \"only\" room they had to move us to was directly above a play area and next to a convention party room, so we ended up staying 6 nights in this room.

While the grounds are certainly beautiful, the rooms are in dire need of a remodel. They smell of mildew, and the decor is outdated. Floral prints and wicker furniture abound here, and for the price, we were both dissappointed. I beilieve the decor is circa 1980. There is no space for clothing except in your own luggage, and even the ironing board was warped. The TV was Magnavox, and I didn't even know they still made TV's. There were as many Kapalua specific channels as other channels. In all there were approximatley 14 channels, of which 7 were Maui specific (one in Japanese). This also carried on into the Gym. The gym and pool are another annoyance. You will pay a $15 a day charge for facilities, but the gym is not full of the facilities you need and the pool is not stafed with enough employees to serve you. Do not get me wrong, the staff is amazing! They are there for your every need...there are just no enough of them at the pool. The gym is under equipped with cardio machines, and adaquite free weight equipment, and the tvs are inconsistant showing only a few channels, and all different depending on which machine you are on. The food was great! The food was also Terribly Over Priced! A candy bar costs $3 and a lemonade cost $5, not to mention tax and tip!!! With the exception of The Signature Wrap (a few pieces of chicken, in a horrible sauce, wrapped in a tortilla, with a lot of lettuce for $13) at the pool, everything we ate was delicious. The drinks were very weak though, and at the cost, they could be a little heavy handed I think! I watched, and they did not even put an ounce in the drinks. Our bath tub had a shower in it that did not work. Luckily we also had a separate shower! There was also no place to put your sundries and toiletries. As stated before the grounds were beautiful. We saw the Aloha Festival Inductions, and the grounds are built on historic land. If you take the time to tour them, it can be quite relaxing and fulfilling. The beach is beautiful and private. There are plenty of chairs, and the sun is hot and strong. The evening entertainment in the lounge is very good. The Road to Hana, Iao Valley, Kaleakala Valcano, Snorkeling, and general site seeing, can all be done for the price of gas and time. Look into things before going and do it all for free on your own. You are not limited to other's time and you can explore. Other things to avoid: Molokini snorkling. Clear water but no variety of fish. My girlfirend was a first time snorkler and was unimpressed. Lahaina Princess adventures. Boat looks nothing like the picture and other boats are more attractive. We had precooked food that was served steamed, and passed off as bar-b- que lunch. ALAMO CAR RENTALS. Yikes. We reserved our car online and got there to a huge line. Understandable. But where was our car? We waited 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a car while others who came after us got their cars and left as we watched. When our car finally arrived, the drivers window did not work, I asked an employee for help incase tehy knowa bout some lock I could not find and they left never to be seen again. I went inside to get a new car and was treated fairly and hastily, but it took still another 15 minutes to get the next car. An hour and a half - after paying for a car we reserved days in advance.

The property is still beautiful but the rooms are in need of an update. In the 5 years we have been coming there they have not even changed a bedspread. Things are still clean but carpets and linens need help. Plus I had a horrible time once again getting my soap and shampoo refilled each day. The housekeepers guard that stuff like gold. The buffet was still very good and included(otherwise $27 p/person) if you stay 6 nights during the high season or 5 nights in the low season. We had one rude encounter with a staff member which has NEVER happened before(they go out of their way to be extra nice to you) but she apologized after the waitress overheard our complaint and she brought us a nice book with pictures of Maui (we forgave her). It was a very different experience going during the summer since the resort was filled with kids. We always go in the off season so kids running through the halls and pushing and shoving on the elevators wasn't the relaxing trip we are used to. We tried the spa this time and the Couple's Hawaiian Natural healing massage in the outdoor garden was excellent. My facial however was nothing special for the price. My husband also had a regular massage which he enjoyed. Another thing to mention is this hotel was about $1,000 more expensive this year than it has ever been. With all of this in mind I probably would have tried the Four Season's next year. Instead we ended up buying a timeshare at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villa's.

I think the reviewers complaining about the room decor need to get over it -- it's not your home, someone else picked the carpet color, so what! And the rooms are not moldy, its just the type of tropical atmosphere you get when everyone has their A/C blowing at max with the Lanai door wide open. Prospective guests, don't be deterred by these comments; the place is clean and luxurious. The pool is outstanding. Unlike another reviewer, I didn't feel the hotel was at all stodgy; there were plenty of young couples and young families including small children around while we were there, yet nothing obnoxious or annoying. I might be biased because of the golf. It was simply amazing. The three different courses each have their own distinctive character that makes for true variety. I suppose you could stay anywhere in Kapalua and benefit from the golf, but we felt that the Ritz was great. If you want a luxurious hotel from a name with which you're familiar and great golf, the Ritz should sit squarely atop your list. Objectively speaking, if you don't golf, or if you plan on spending a great deal of time off-premises, the one detractor for me was that Kapalua is fairly isolated from other attractions. So the 25 minute drive to Lahaina (or anywhere else) might get annoying. (And trust me, the road to Hana is a loong day.) Regarding customer service: we found everyone to be truly interested in making our stay a great one. In fact, we had one snafu the day before our early morning departure involving a missed dry cleaning pickup on the part of the hotel. This could have been a major disaster for us, but the staff (all the way up to the hotel manager-on-duty) moved mountains to fix things.

Now post-trip, happy to report that the sky is not falling and the Kapalua Ritz truly is up to the levels to be expected of a Ritz Carlton hotel. Not sure what's up with some of the negative nelly trip reports but I can honestly say that our stay was fantastic and having stayed at some of the top hotels in the world, I think we know of what we speak. Are the rooms spacious? By Maui standards, yes although they are not the largest in the Ritz chain. Rooms in need of an update? Our room appeared to have been recently redone, either that or very well maintained. The staff and services of the hotel were all within normal Ritz standards. Staff answered each of our requests with \"Yes, of course\" including our request for a late check-out which was some how accomodated even though the hotel was competely full. The pools and beach areas (very windy-not the hotels fault of course), are extremely well-maintained with very attentive staff (not a given at other Maui high-end hotels). One highlight for us was the incredible meal we had at The Banyan Tree. On scale with some of the best restaurants we've eaten at in Chicago. Our experiences at the sushi restaurant, Kai, were not as good. For us the one and only place for sushi on Maui is Sansei (located at the Shops at Kapalua-you can take the quick & easy hotel shuttle-also located in Kihei near Wailea). If you're coming to Kapalua to golf, the Ritz makes it easy with shuttles and club storage. Also, the three Kapalua courses will transfer your clubs between courses which was a nice feature. The only negative I can even come up with would be the Luau at the Ritz. Apparently, the Ritz has contracted this out to a family which runs the entire show (except food & bev). This was without a doubt the most uninspired luau you could imagine. While claiming to \"stay true to the history of the island\", the production is an absolute bore. While some of the other luaus may go over the top (think tacky), the Ritz event lacked spirit.

After having been to the Ritz in Puerto Rico this year, which provided the \"ritz level\" service and beautiful accomodations, we would expect that it would only be better in Hawaii. We were very disappointed to say the least. I'll start by saying the Kapalua property is unbelievable. Set high on a cliff overlooking the ocean the grounds are pretty impressive. The rooms however are an embarassment to the Ritz name. They are run down and are badly in need of renovations. They truly look like a middle tier hotel and with the rates at the Ritz, we found this to be unacceptable. The beds are old and the decor is tired. The hotel is huge, so it really lacks the intimate level of service that you would expect. The beach is very nice, the golf courses are great, and the spa and gym are nice as well.

Having been in the hotel business, I have come to know and respect the reputation of the Ritz brand. After driving for an hour from the airport, we arrived on property. The valet staff was attentive and check in was fast. We made our way to our room and let out an audible gasp when we walked into the room. It was as though we walked onto the set of \"Golden Girls\" The dated pink carpet and floral prints would have served most retirement villages well, but certainly not what I expected (and was disappointing). I was waiting for Bea Arthur or Betty White to walk in from the Lanai and say \"just kidding.\" The large marble bathroom with double sink, private toilet area, and stall/tub shower was probably the best part of the room. Oddly enough, each room is equipped with a \"cooler\" that looks like a refrigerator, but does not work as such (its sole purpose is to keep things at room temperature), so we needed to order a refrigerator for the room. The hotel was extremely quiet and stodgy. Definitely not the place to bring kids, or young adults, or middle-aged adults, or young senior citizens...people 80 and over may feel comfortable there... Don't look for elaborate pools or resort type beachfronts...for this, you need to go to Ka'napali. The hotel is far from most everything and its restaurants are severly overpriced and overrated. We ate at the Banyan tree for dinner, where the atmosphere and live music was great, but the food left something to be desired (ie, small portions, big tickets, mediocre quality). The waiter there was handling roughly 10 tables on his own (during dinner hour) which indicates poor planning/management by the hotel. This level of (dis)service salted the wound of $200. The beach restaurant is ok, but overpriced and again the level of service (one waitress for the entire restaurant at lunch hour) made for a long wait, in addition to a ridiculous check when compared to the food quality. Luckily, our package included breakfast because I could not see spending $60 for two people for a buffet that probably costs the hotel $4.50 per person at most. We did have a good experience at the Terrace restaurant for dinner, where (once again, only one waiter) the gentlemen server was extremely friendly and hospitable. The absolute worst part of our stay was when the hotel valet gave our rental car to someone else, and someone else's car to us. We realized this after an hour into our drive to the Hana Highway. We wound up turning around and going back to the hotel. While the hotel manager on duty helped us rearrange our schedule and offered us 2 complimentary massages, this really aggravated my wife and I, as we totally blew a whole day on trying to track down our car and trying to rearrange our schedule of pre-booked and pre-paid activities. Lastly, on checkout, we had to wait 47 minutes for the hotel's only bellman on duty to take our bags from our room. This was the icing on the cake to our less than satisfactory visit to the Ritz. I would highly recommend that people stay at another property, because this is not the type of Ritz Carlton quality of service that exists on the mainland. Instead, check out the Hyatt or Westin in Ka'anapali (which is closer to Lahina and also has better weather).

My overall impression is that the hotel is beautiful, in good shape and in a beautiful and quiet setting far from the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali, Lahaina or Wailea. Facilities are up to Ritz Carlton standards. Restaurants are pretty good, not great. Service levels are OK, but not what I have come to expect at Ritz Carltons - in general, the personnel there, from the concierge to the front desk staff to the pool staff are helpful, but not overly enthusiastic about helping guests. They would fit-in much better at a typical Hilton or Marriott. Another important thing to consider is that this part of the island is windier and cloudier than the more touristy areas in Kaanapali or Wailea. At some points, this was very annoying (although at other times, we commented on how nice it was not to overheat while we were at the pool). Another minor point is that the hotel itself doesn't offer a good set of scheduled cultural or recreational activities as most other luxury resorts do - in fact, when we inquired about scheduled activities, the concierge looked perplexed and referred us to the tour desk at the hotel. I would say that if we visit Maui and decide to spend the $$$$ on another luxury resort, we'd probably spring a few extra bucks and stay at the Four Seasons, where we ate a few times and were much more impressed with the hotel's staff and restaurants (as well as the hotel's ambiance).

Service: Well, I pulled up with 7 people in the van and had to unload my own luggage from the van - not a bellman in sight - I have never had to do this at a Ritz - 7 bags unloaded by me personally - they did show up with a cart to put them on and bring to the room. Grounds: Beautiful when you walk around. Final thoughts: I would not return here - in fact, I sincerely believe some of the \"exceptional\" reviews listed here are false. This hotel is absolutely not Ritz quality - save yourself the aggravation of high expectations and low realizations.", "Date": "July 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cThe Ritz was a let down.\u201d", "Author": "Tinlemon", "ReviewID": "UR3621871", "Content": "Given the many glowing reviews, especially recently, I hesitate to provide my review considering that most people will probably read it and think that I am being overly picky or irrational. To create some credibility for my review I will mention that I've stayed at many nice hotels in the past, and even over the course of our wedding and this honeymoon alone we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton (Washington DC), LeParker Meridian (NYC), Kahala Mandarin Oriental (Oahu, HI), Orchard Hotel (San Francisco) and of course, the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua. During my stay at these hotels I've come to expect a higher level of service and an overall hotel experience that can only be provided by hotels of this level, and this is also the exact reason why I came away from the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua disappointed. I'll walk through my experience and then explain why we didn't like it. LOCATION: Kapalua is definately further from the other resorts, but we liked this. After checking out the other resorts during our stay, we valued the Ritz for the fact that it was more private and relaxing. Compared to the resorts in Wailea (Four Seasons, Fairmont) you are much closer to the action at the Ritz, and are an easy 10-15 min. drive to Lahaina where it seems most shops and restaurants are. The one downside about the Ritz location is that it's very windy in the afternoons and evenings, and also the weather is pretty unpredictable. GROUNDS: What can I say...they are beautiful! The plantation style layout and lots of land make everything feel spread out and comfortable. The pool looked amazing and was much less cramped than the Four Seasons. We spent all of our time at the beach, and while it was very nice they don't allow any of the lounge chairs to actually be on the sand... you have to sit in the designated area. Initially I didn't like this, but I got over it and it wasn't much of a problem. The beach that the Ritz is on is a public beach, but since it is further north it was never crowded and used primarily by guests of the Kapalua resorts. The lobby is very open and impressive with an expansive view of the entire resort all the way down to the ocean as soon as you walk in. CHECK-IN: Easy check in.... we jumped out of our car and went to the desk where we were greated with a lei. They offered us some guava juice as they went over the details with us which was a nice touch. Our bags were delivered promptly to our room and our car was parked without us ever having to go back outside after check-in. ROOM: This is where I start to have problems. Since this is a plantation style resort, picture the hotel to be a large U shape where the lobby is at the bottom of the U and the rooms are down 2 long halls ways to each side.... we of course got the second to last room. We joked that we needed to have a golf cart pick us up every morning, but it was a pretty annoying walk by the end of our stay. The room itself was U-G-L-Y!! Having stayed at the Ritz previously I know they use a more classic floral style for their rooms, but this was just bad. It reminded us of a cheap beach hotel. There was a white bamboo entertainment center with about 10 empty shelves, a small (27\") outdated TV, our minibar was complately empty, there was a simple sitting area consisting of one white wicker chair and small table, and then a desk. The balcony was nice, and we had a real nice view of the ocean, golf course, and this small church that ended up being a wedding factory (several weddings there each day). We had a partial ocean view room and I'd say that 99% of the rooms fit this category, and full ocean view rooms are difficult as well since the resort is set pretty far back from the beach. Don't stress too much room about location because none of the rooms look over a parking lot or anything like that, mostly just golf courses. SERVICE: Service was just OK to me. The bellmen and valet were professional and friendly, and very helpful with everything... from directions to restaurant suggestions. They were all exceptional. The rest of the staff was nothing special.... in fact, this is where a lot of my frusturation with the hotel stems from. For example, while sitting at the beach (in the designated sitting area) for approx 4 hrs each day we never once had anyone come by to offer us a drink or see if we wanted something to eat. On another day we were out of our room from 7am until 4:15pm and our room never got cleaned. Also, the halls had these tables that were always full of garbage..... mostly left over room service dishes. The list goes on, but to me it seems like they need some extra staff or something because there are some details being missed that a hotel with a world wide reputation like the Ritz shouldn't be missing. ~~~~ The root of my problems with this hotel were the fact that when you stay at a luxury hotel such as the Ritz, you expect a higher level of service. Even comparing this Ritz in Maui against another Ritz (in DC) I am surprised that corporate has let this resort shape into what it is today. Throughout my stay I started making a list of the things that just struck me wrong which will eventually be made into a letter and sent to the appropriate people. Some of the other things that frusturated us were: -resort fee... $15. what this covers according to the front desk person... toll free calls only (still get charged .75 per local call), free day time valet, access to gym, reduced rates on tennis and golf (shouldn't you just include tennis in the fee!), complimentary coffee each morning in the lobby (no pastries or anything), and a newspaper. This is no exageration. For a luxury hotel to even charge for local calls is rediculous. I feel like this charge is worthless and I could've easily done without ALL of these services... but you don't have that choice. - No beachside waiter service... in previous hotels I was getting served complimentary papya slices at the beach, but here all they put out was a cooler of water and some paper cups. Then on top of that they would clean up the beach chairs each day at 3pm, which to me is pretty early. I also didn't like that we couldn't use our chairs on the beach, but I suspect that was because the beach was public (although, after seeing other resorts having beach chairs on the beach I don't know why the Ritz doesn't). The little tables around the beach chairs were also always littered with used cups and I watched numerous staff pick up used towels etc from the chairs but never touch the used paper cups. - didn't refill soaps and shampoos daily. I know this seems silly, but even if you stay at the local Holiday Inn they will toss a new bottle of shampoo into your bathroom each day. Nope... not at the Ritz... what we got on the first day of our stay was all we had for the duration. I'm sure I could've requested more, and I admit that I didn't even need the extras... it just seems cheap and another way they are cutting corners. -sheets weren't long enough on the bed. Each morning our feet were on the matress pad. Also, our matress pad was off center was hanging off the side of the bed....we had to fix this ourselves. - security chain on back of door was backwards... so if you opened the door the chain popped off. Again, there is a lack of attention that SHOULD be there at a place like the Ritz. - tables in halls always had leftover room service dishes on them. That's fine that people put their dishes there, but it's not fine that nobody comes by regularly to clean the halls. If you're going to have these tables you need to have someone take care of them. More attention to detail that is missing. - breakfast buffett was completely overpriced for what was offered. It was something like $25/pp for a very basic spread, and one morning we didn't even get our coffee served until we had finished our meal. BOTTOM LINE: Sad to say it, but the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua is just another beach hotel with nothing more to offer than any other basic resort, and you might yourself disappointed for the amount of money you spent to stay here. When we picked this hotel we were a little concerned because of the previous negative reviews, but we kept telling ourselves \"Hey.. it's the Ritz... it can't be THAT bad\". Well it's not THAT bad, but there are many better hotels on Maui for less money. If I were to go back again to Maui I'd probably stay in the Ka'anapali area because of it's location to Lahaina, exceptional beaches, and the nicer weather compared to Kapalua.", "Date": "June 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cPerfect 10 year anniversary\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3610009", "Content": "This was one of the most amazing hotels.

I had started doing research several months ago, and my wife was a bit apprehensive due to all of the negative reviews posted on the site (roaches, dirty/musty rooms, rude staff, bad service, bad weather, etc). I had asked my sister and a friend of mine who stayed there and they assured me that we would be very pleased with the Ritz. After many weeks of debate (and a great room rate we lucked out on) we decided to go with the Ritz. Even on our drive from the airport to Kapalua, we were a bit worried. We pulled in and were greeted by an extremely nice valet, and were escorted to check in. (We lucked out at this point because we were in between two conventions that day, so no line at all). We were greeted with Lei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and the woman at the desk was very pleasant. She then told us that they had a very special room for us, and that even though it was a long walk, it was well worth it. Well the walk was very long, but it was definitely worth it. When we arrived at our room (2153), I knew we were in for something special (corner at the end of the hallway). We walked into a corner ocean front suite (foyer, living room, bedroom, vanity room, shower room, separate bathroom and a double lanai. We were shocked. I did notice that the furniture is a bit outdated, and the TV was pretty bad as well (for example, the TV hutch was pretty ugly and it looked cheap). To tell you the truth though, we could have cared less, we were in Hawaii, and the room still exceeded our expectations. STAFF: From the bell hops, to the valet, to the maid staff; everyone was pleasant, said hello (aloha) all the time and smiled. Our luggage arrived at our room minutes after we did. The twice a day maid service was fine, but we could have done without the turndown at night, just seemed like they were in our room a lot. The concierge was wonderful, always very helpful and it seemed like they genuinely wanted us to have a great trip. (the standard champagne and strawberries was nice, but the handwritten congratulatory note was a great touch). GROUNDS: I remember a review a while back saying the grounds were in bad shape (broken concrete at the pool..) We saw nothing of the sort, in fact everyday we saw several people working on the grounds every day doing general maintenance. They have a mini golf course, bocce ball court and shuffleboard as well. We did not use these, but many guests did. POOL/BEACH: We thought the pool was great. Our first morning, we decided to hit the pool for a few hours and as soon as we grabbed some chairs, a woman came over with chair covers and towels and set up shop for us. There were many cabanas for rental, but we passed as we wanted to be in the sun as much as possible. Service was great, we got the chicken quesadillas three times that week, and the drinks were pretty good as well ($9ish). We only walked down to the beach once while we were there. I read several complaints about their beach, and we actually liked it a lot (we just liked the pool better). The views were great, no crowds, the sand was nice (read a complaint about it being rocky..), the walk was not that bad at all (are we really that lazy now??), and for those of us who are lazy, they do provide a shuttle. The water did seem a bit rough while we were there. WEATHER: Yes, it was bit cooler than Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali, yes it did rain, yes it was very windy. But for 6 days in the low 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with about 5 hours of total rain, it was a heck of al of better than Chicago. This was another worry point for my wife, if the weather stunk she would have really had a bad trip. It rained one day, so we did Lahaina, Kaanapali. (and no, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hassle driving 20 minutes..). It was windy, but it was a nice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153air conditioner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the tropical sun. It was cooler than the resort areas to the south, if you think 80 is cool. All in all, we thought the weather was fine, but maybe we lucked out that week. FOOD: Ate breakfast 3 days there, had eggs benedict the first time (very good) and the buffet the other 2 times. The food was pretty good, and there was quite a selection, but not worth the $24 or whatever. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on vacation, so why not? (try the coconut maple syrup for the waffles/pancakes, good times.) We dined elsewhere on the Island for the most part, but I really wanted to try Banyan Tree. I was VERY pleased and I highly suggest it. I got the sashimi appetizer and the Kobe Beef tartar. Both were very tasty and presented well. (my wife hates seafood and or raw meat so she watched). For entr\u00c3\u00a9e\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, I got the Ahi Tuna and fois gras with sun dried cherries. Sounds like an odd mix with the cherries, but it was spectacular. My wife got the Proscuitto wrapped filet, and it was outstanding as well (obviously not as good as some Chicago steaks, but still very good). The service was great, and they even comped our desserts and presented us a card congratulating us on our Honeymoon. MISC: We did the couples massage in the cabana at the spa the day it rained. (I think it was $130 w/o tip, but not sure). It was my first massage, and it will not be my last. The whole experience was great, from the cucumber-lemon ice water in the locker rooms to mind-blowing massage itself. It lasted an hour, and with the relaxing music in the cabana with the rain in the background, it was perfect. I felt like a wet noodle when I was done. >>Overall, we had a great time, everything was perfect. Granted, there are some flaws, but none which ruined our trip (seems that some people have to nitpick everything, OK, so there was a roomservice cart in the hallway for 4 hours, not that big of a deal).

Prior to arrival- I called the day before we were to arrive and asked the desk worker to, please, try to put us in the best room they could. He said that they were going to be quite full, but would see what he could do.

When we arrive at our room (1336) we discovered that we had a tremendous view of not only the pool area but also the grounds and ocean. The perfect view! The room was very clean and showed not a sign of wear or abuse. I must say that the room was a little smaller than I was expecting, but in light of all the positives, this was easily overlooked. We were in Maui, after all, and did not plan on spending too much time in the room. Pool - we tremendously enjoyed our time at the pool - which was popular but never overcrowded. The three-tier design with waterfalls was quite beautiful and the cocktails ($9) were very refreshing and inviting. We enjoyed our servers and they were all quite effective and quick with all of our orders. Valet - When we called ahead, our car was always out front and waiting for us when we got to the main entrance. By the way.. splurge a little and get the convertible. The drives we had around the island with the top down, sun shining and magnificent views just added to our overall enjoyment of this trip. Trips to nightlife - We heard horror stories from guests on here who thought that the Ritz was too far from the nightlife....this is far from the truth. We were able to get to Kaanapali and Lahaina within 20 minutes, and, as mentioned before, we enjoyed the trips immensely. The trips we made were, in some cases, during what would have been peak travel times (between 4-8) and we never ran into any traffic of any note. We enjoyed Lahaina and the shops, restaurants and clubs and also Whalers Village. We had a terrific dinner at the Hula Grill (highly recommended!) to start off our trip and walked right out on Kaanapali Beach afterwards during the sunset - perfect end to a long day of travel. We did lots of other things, but I will write about these outside of this review of the Ritz. Beach - the DT Fleming Beach at the Ritz was superb - absolutely beautiful and pristine. Since the access to it is through the Ritz property and since it is \"so far away\" from everything else, we had to endure a perfect island paradise with at most 20 other people on most days - our first two days we counted 6 other people on the beach and the weather was simply perfect. The beach is quite large meaning that there wasn't anyone within 50 yards of us at any given time. This, to us, was reason enough to wholeheartedly endorse the Ritz - the peace and tranquility of having a tropical paradise almost to yourself. The waves were not conducive to body surfing or boogie boarding when we were there, but were perfect for just bobbing and cooling off. I feared that the water was going to be too hot to be refreshing but was relieved to find that it had just the right amount of \"bite\" to cool you off on a hot day (temperatures ranged from 87-92 each day) We saw kayak-ers, boogie boarders, and snorkelers (although I don't think this beach is known for snorkeling). The Ritz has all kinds of rental gear for the beach available. We took advantage of the beach chairs and enjoyed lounging in the surf. One possible negative...it was windy and sometimes the sand did whip into our faces which could be unpleasant. We looked it as the perfect excuse to jump back into the ocean to wash off...still, for those who are particularly sensitive to sand, we did find some merit in this complaint. If you have our attitude about it, it wasn't an issue...and remember they have plenty of recliners off the beach near the entrance that did not have this sand/wind problem...or go to the pool. Grounds - perfect array of flowers and tropical arrangements. The lava flow jetty made for an interesting morning walk - I went all the way to the end with the pounding surf and experienced one of those \"ends of the earth\" moments one bright and sunny morning. An exceptional personal experience. Bocce ball, tennis, and putting green also were available for recreation Food - We were there as part sales reward and part vacation and did not want to use up all of our per diem money on high priced breakfasts, so each morning we arose - had a complimentary cup of java at the Ritz and a piece of fresh fruit, then walked up to the Honolua Store a short walk off the Ritz grounds. There we had wonderful relaxing breakfasts outside on the porch - watching golfers and others coming and going starting their day. Nice view of the golf course (Bay course) there as well although we must have been on one of the later holes as we never saw anyone that bright and early on the hole that faces the store. We did each lunch at the Terrace on day and we both enjoyed our choices - but it was expensive. We also ate lunch at the restaurant near the beach one day - I really enjoyed my salad with rock shrimp, but my wifes Kahlua pork sandwich was soggy. Being there on a part business trip - we also had a group breakfast function - basic fare of scrambled eggs, sausage, pancakes, bacon etc. As far as buffets go, it was fine...I certainly have had much worse. Our dinner function was terrific - a steak and chicken dinner - the food arrived fresh and hot and the steak, especially, was cooked to perfection. We did have breakfast in bed our last day and, sure enough it was expensive...but the food was of high quality. We also ordered a late-night pizza on night and found it to be quite delicous and, considering where we were, reasonably priced. Shops - there are a number of high priced shops on site with beautiful clothing and jewelry...if you are looking for that type of thing. Spa - my wife had a massage and facial and enjoyed the pampering and talk with the masseuse who told her a lot about Maui and the other islands. She enjoyed her morning at the spa immensely. Concierge - very professional and helpful with suggestions and in making reservations - did all that we asked quickly and efficiently. Staff - we did not run across anyone at the Ritz who was not pleasant and many remembered us by name when we ran across them. In short, you get the attention and respect that you would want from a 4-5 star resort On the day we were to leave, we took a ride to the south end of the island and it was quite beautiful, and, admittedly we did not spend any considerable amount of time there. But we were quite certain that Kapalua was the right location for us. The Ritz was perfect, the DT Fleming beach pristine and isolated, the nightlife in Kaanapali and Lahaina was easily and enjoyably reachable and accessible.

This was our seventh trip to Maui, but first to the Kapalua area. We have always stayed on Wailea. Since this is the windy side of the island,it is wonderful for people who like to do outdoor activities like golf, hike, play tennis, etc. You will not feel as hot as Wailea. If you love being in the water as I do, you may not want to be in Kapalua. The ocean was cold and very rough, tossed me over twice in 15 minutes and every day there was a red flag warning not to go in. Took the free shuttle to the Kapalua Bay Hotel and used their beach which was a little calmer, but still cold. The air is cool, so the pool was cold as well. Its great if you just want to sit poolside and not get overheated. Don't eat at the pool. Have an attendant take you down to the Ritz's beach in a golf cart if you don't want to walk, and eat at the Beach House which has spectacular views and a better selection than the pool. If you have children, be sure to ask for the kid's menu at all hotel restaurants. It's a great deal, and good food, but the pool attendants don't offer it unless you ask. Fun poolside activities include a children's playset, shuffleboard, and bocce ball. As for the hotel, I prefer an open air beachy Hawaiian look to the closed in, traditonal building of the Ritz. The grounds are immaculate and lushly tropical. The room's furnishings are outdated and worn, but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The beds, though, have down pillows and comforters. As for food, the Ritz is typically Maui expensive (most entrees in the 30-50 dollar range for dinner), but for the budget conscious, the reliable Kapalua free shuttle can take you to the Kapalua Bay Hotel's Gardenia Court for the early bird special ($17 for a three course dinner overlooking the Pacific), to the Plantation House for a delicious breakfast and beautiful views, or to the popular Sensei at the Kapalua Bay shops. We finally went to Mama's Fish House in Paia and are sorry we did. The kid's lunch meals are all $15 and consisted of 3 fried shrimp or two small pieces of fried fish, a small scoop of white rice and some cole slaw, with a scoop of ice cream for dessert. After a $110 dollar lunch bill for 2 kid meals and 2 adult entrees only, we were still hungry and feeling ripped off.

There are plenty of activities on or near the hotel like snorkling, golf, tennis, shuffleboard etc... After looking at other hotels on Maui, we would stay at the Ritz again. We liked the Kapalua area b/c it was seperated from the main resort areas, but close enough if you want to drive to Lahaina you could do so (it is about 20 min). There are many good shops and places to eat in Lahaina. If you want to do a luau, we would recommend the Feast at lele. Next to the Feast of Lele there is a wonderful place to eat on the ocean called Pacifico. If staying in Kapalua, would recommend going to Lahaina and sitting in a bar to watch the sunset. There are several good places on the water to do so. If looking a good happy hour, Moose & McG's has $1 drinks from 3-6 everyday. We did a snorkle trip with Blue Water Rafting. Great people and Captain Ray treated us well. They have a 5 hour trip on a small raft that only holds 5-7 people. So it is not crowded at all, but please note it is a rough ride b/c of the size raft. On the way out of Maui, try Momma's Seafood. It is near the aiport, so we ate there before our flight.

We could not try the Banyantree restaurant, because we were there on the two nights they are closed (Sundays and Mondays). But we tried the breakfast buffet at Terrace restaurant and it was very good. We stuffed ourselves with waffles topped with tropical fruits butter and macademia nuts! We did not spend any time at the pool side, so cannot say anything about their services or food, but the pool area was beautiful as you can see in the photo. We preferred to go to the beach and we did not mind walking 3min to the beach at all, and they do offer the golf cart services if you ask. Fleming beach was not crowded at all, but the wave was strong even in the morning and thought not kids-friendly. An employee at the beach house told us it was not a good snorkeling beach and recommended us to go to the Kapalua Bay instead, so we did. We took the convenient shuttle service from the hotel to the Kapalua Bay, so we would not have to worry about the parking at this popular beach. We saw a lot of fish there, and when we were ready to get back to the hotel, all we had to do was just ask the people at the beach house to call the shuttle, and we did not have to wait long. We also used this convenient shuttle service when we went to the Plantation House restaurant in the golf course. We used the spa service for a couple's massages in the garden cabana.

The included breakfast buffet was outstanding (in the same class as the Halekulani's). The short hike to the beach didn't bother us, and we could always get a ride back on the Ritz's shuttle cart. Dinner at the Ritz's Terrace was delicious but a little pricey. We drove to Lahaina for dinner at one night at Mama's Fish House, and to Kaanapali to eat at Hula Grill. They were both great and reasonably priced, but the Plantation House right at Kapalua was one of the most memorable meals we've ever had, anyplace - and the included shuttle service took us there and back so we didn't have to worry about driving. Stunning views, wonderfully-prepared fish - get there early to get a windowside table. We almost always check out a few other hotels when we visit - the Westin Maui's rooms we thought were way too small, Kapalua Bay was looking a little neglected (it's being torn down next year, we were told), the Four Seasons doesn't live up to the reputation (overpriced for what you get, unspectacular guest rooms but fabulous activities and game room for kids if that's important to you). The Grand Wailea was the only hotel we saw that we would've considered trading for the Ritz. But with the offers available at the Ritz (sixth night free, breakfast included) it just might be the best luxury deal on Maui, especially if you don't have kids. Suggestion: the Ritz should serve regular dinners in their \"Lobby Lounge\". The menu there only mentions drinks and sushi bar but guests were regularly talking waitresses into bringing them burgers and sandwiches. With live entertainment each evening and a beautiful view of the property, they could draw a serious crowd for dinner at the Lounge if they just offered a couple of simple entrees like fresh fish.

Being that the weather was chilly & windy, the ocean was turbulent and unswimable. The hotel was orginally planned to be build right beside the beach but they unearthed a very LARGE ancient Hawaiian cemetery while digging. So they had to build about 1000ft back from the ocean. The rooms, restaurants, gym, spa, etc. was right on the money but the location is the downfall. This is my first time at this hotel, at this location, maybe during the summer months it is better.

You expect high prices at such a resort, especially one in Hawaii, but a few things were a little extreme in my opinion. I just couldn't bring myself to buy a $20 cheeseburger by the pool! My husband ordered a shrimp cocktail at the lounge one afternoon ($17) and he got 3 medium sized shrimp with about 1 1/2 Tbs. of relish.

We arrived in Maui during what was apparently an unusual winter storm in Hawaii, so our first day was a rainout. Day 2 was much better, until we drove from Lahaina to Kapalua to check in at the Ritz. I had read plenty of review on this site and others, so was fairly warned of the weather. We figured we'd take the chance and splurge a little on a week at the Ritz. Long story short - we checked out early! We saw the sun without rain for maybe 20 minutes during the two days we were there. The wind was unbearable and the sunshiney-rain wasn't pleasant. We are sun and beach lovers, so this was a bit of a nightmare. When we awoke to more dark clouds and wind monday morning, we rented a car (definitely a must, now we know better!) and drove until we saw the sun.

Personally, I don't think it's worth the risk - you can't predict the weather, but the odds are much better further south on the island! We stayed near the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea, which both looked fabulous. If you are going to spend the money on the Ritz, you mine as well spend it further south at the Four Seasons.

After complaining, we were pleasantly surprised by having our choice of three other ocean front rooms. Great right??

There seemed to be a break in communication somewhere along the lines, and we had to pay for it. To top it off, we were treated a bit crassly upon checkout.

No way, but for free, pass the coconut syrup and macadamia nut pancakes, please. Room was supposedly a 'garden view'...if only my garden at home looked like this...While I could see a bit of the garden from my lanai, I had sweeping full ocean views from the room, which was spacious and gorgeous. The TV was of low, garage sale quality, the kind people who are now buying plasma tv's threw out three TV's ago, but I wasn't there to watch TV...never experienced any of the probs other TA users have had...no moldy smell or roaches present in my room! Loved the comp. shoe shine! Must disagree with the user who did not care for the Banyan Tree but liked Kai, the Ritz' sushi bar...Dined at Banyan Tree the first night, food was high priced but excellent. Highly recommend the scallop/foie gras appetizer...also had the opakapaka and the mahi special with lobster medallions. The food was perfectly prepared though the wine ($50ish range Pinot Grigio) was wholly unimpressive. True, it was expensive at around $40-45 an entree, but, as about as discerning an eater as you can find, I would recommend it highly. On the other hand, Kai looks as if it were added as a sympathetic concession to the many Asian visitors...it was in the middle of the lobby bar with no noticeable difference between the raucous bar and the sushi bar. High prices for run of the mill sushi -- no toro, uni, or amaebi here...instead, you'll find very safe california rolls and $10 salmon nigiri...save your money and go to the interesting Sansei (on Kapalua) instead. Only complaint was the few hours of rain and high winds we had while Kaanapali and south was beautiful...other whine involves being told the resort fee included snorkel equipment and finding on the bill that it most certainly did not.

Mini-fridge (non-electric) kept cool with ice bucket inside. We shopped in a local grocery market for such items as yogurt and beverages and kept cool in the fridge. We did not eat at the Banyan Tree (the most highly rated restaurant) but we did eat at the Terrace (very good) and the Kai (spelling?), a sushi retaurant in the hotel. The night before we had eaten at the San-sei sushi restaurant in the Kapalua shops plaza, and I know that the San-Sei is the most highly rated sushi restaurant on the island, but we found the Ritz to be even better. It was the absolute best I have ever had at my life and between hubby and I and many dishes and his sake, our bill came to only $70 total. While we were there it was the Hula Bowl and there was something like 200+ cheerleaders of all ages on the premises, and we never heard a peep out of them. Talk about great soundproofing. The design of this hotel is very similar to that of the Animal Kingdom Lodge and Wilderness Lodge in DisneyWorld, but the Ritz is much more plushly appointed. Possibly the same architectural firm?? Anyway, a couple of travelers have mentioned a funny smell in the room when the A/C is turned off and the balcony door opened.

Room 1142. A room at the end of the hotel facing out to the beach. The minute we opened the door, the view took our breath away. The waves, palms and coastline were framed by our ground floor french doors with a private patio. We would sit on the patio throughout the day and watch the whales play in the water. What a treat. The rooms are a little tired and the thing that bothered me the most were the stains on the older pale green carpet. It looked as if someone had gotten sick on them! The maid for some reason always left our robes in the pile that we left them in. That seemed strange, the rest of the room was very clean. However, we would stay in the room again because of the spectacular view. The Banyon Tree was a joke. We had dinner with 3 drinks and the total for 2 was $240.00. It was pretentious service and presentation in a restaraunt that is like a pool snack house with patio furniture. Half the food was delicious, but not worth the price at all. The servers were terrible and the host was the rudest person we encountered at the hotel. Eat at David Paul in Lahaina for the most exquisite, generous,fabulously served food in any restaurant anywhere in the world. We went to David Paul twice and wanted to go again but were leaving the island. We ate at Vino's for lunch at the village golf course and that was very tasty. The best food at the Ritz may be the Honolua country store on the property for lunch or breakfast. Wonderful store with homemade meals that you take outside and eat on the store porch. The tuna melt was exceptional. All in all the hotel is wonderful and we would go again. We loved the privacy of the area and not being surrounded by people with their big drink cups and laundry baskets all day (Marriott Ocean Club).

Basically, she slept outside the entire 6 night stay. So fun! Our room was partial ocean view and full pool view. I did not notice any mustiness issues; we did request a down free room, due to allergies. Perhaps that made a difference? Due to weather we arrived one day late. Even though we prepaid with a package, they shifted the room dates so we wouldn't lose anything. I thought that was gracious and more than one would expect on a holiday week. I loved and hated the seclusion of the Ritz. After visiting Ka'anapoli Beach and seeing the MOBS of people down there, I liked how quiet the Ritz was, even though they were quite busy over Christmas break. However, it was a very long way to drive for ANYTHING. So it's a trade-off. The beach and pool were beautiful and not crowded. If we return to Maui and the Ritz I will be prepared for the very high restaurant prices. We got in late and \"grabbed\" hamburgers at the Terrace Restaurant.

We had been there for our Honeymoon and were looking forward to the return eight years later. We had left the Maui Ocean Club with a less than perfect stay because of the mold in the air conditioner and the room over the laundry area that had constant aroma of laundry detergent wafting into our room. I assured my husband that it would be worth the extra money for a first class hotel. On check-in, we were told our reservation was lost. We went to the Terrace Club for a pizza while we waited for them to work it out. Two of the three ingredients on our pizza were missing and about fifteen minutes later they arrived on a separate plate. The waitress apologized and was very nice. Two hours later (because the delay with the pizza) we tried checking in again, they still couldn't find the reservation, but gave us a room anyway. When we arrived, the bellhop laid out our suitcases, took his tip and left. It was then that I noticed the robe on the chair (used), the jacket from the previous guest's stay on the table, and when I walked into the bathroom was shocked to see open toiletries everywhere. I called for assistance to clean the bathroom and 40 minutes later walked to the front desk with the open bars of soap, shampoo, etc. to exchange. It was another 20 minutes before a maid showed up to clean the room. That night, I was tired and disappointed but determined to make the best of it and laid down on the bed, curled up on my side, and promptly slid to the floor as a result of the swayback mattress. I propped up the mattress with a pillow and just slept, hoping the next day would be better. We left a note for them to switch or flip the mattress and weren't surprised when the tip was gone, but the note still there hours later. The best part of the stay was the pool, we had it to ourselves at night and swam our frustrations away, but I feel we were robbed for the price we paid for a mediocre dirty room, less than five star service, and a lack on the part of management to make things right.

Kapalua is absolutely beautiful, and the fact that it is away from the hustle and bustle of Lahaina and the glitz of Wailea was exactly what my wife and I were looking for on our honeymoon. As background we spent two weeks in Hawaii and were really looking to relax. The Four Seasons Hualalai was perfect for our first week, but our second week was to be spent in Wailea. We checked into our hotel and then checked out the next morning. We drove to Kapalua and checked into the Ritz. The hotel does not feel like a huge beach resort, rather it feels a bit more like a relaxed, upscale seaside lodge. The views of the ocean and other islands are gorgeous and the rolling lawns and golf courses surrounded by forest give a little feel of being in the mountains. Also despite the fact that the Ritz is bigger than either the Maui FS or Fairmont it feels more intimate and less cramped. The food at the Banyan Tree was wonderful and the burgers I had for lunch down at the beach bar (go here instead of Cheeseburger in Paradise) were two of the best I have had anywhere. The breakfast buffet was good, but after two weeks of breakfast buffets I was more interested in fruits and juice than omelettes and bacon. The pool is very nice and the overall service, while not quite as attentive as the Four Seasons, was mostly good. However, this resort has a few areas to improve upon, the most important of which is the rooms. Since my wife and I were last minute guests we did not have much choice, but we did look at a few rooms and each one had the distinct mustiness mentioned by other posters. I have bad athsma so it was almost enough to keep us away, but we really liked the setting and feel of the hotel and knew we would not be happy in Wailea. Since it was not uncomfortably hot at night (the cool mountain breezes helped) we wound up keeping the windows open and the A/C off most nights and this helped the smell immensely. I think the smell came mostly from the A/C vent because the minute it was turned on the smell would return. The furnishings were a bit dated and the beds were mediocre at best. While I mentioned that the hotel setting is beautiful, the grounds could use a little bit more attention. A few of the tiles around the pool and on the walkways were broken or missing and little things like left behind trash or overturned flower pots were not dealt with in what I would consider a timely manner. The tennis courts were built in a nice cluster with a clubhouse, but the clubhouse was closed while we were there (is this permanent?), and the courts seem to receive little love from the staff these days. I do not know if I payed the $15 resort fee because my travel agent handled all of the arrangements, but hidden charges like that irritate me. The $15 valet parking fee seemed unusual given that it was a complimentary service at the other hotels. I only used it when we checked in, but was annoyed since the majority of the hotel parking spaces were reserved for valet parking. Overall my wife and I liked the Ritz and for what we wanted it was the best spot on Maui. However, it is likely that our future Hawaiian vacations will focus on the Big Island and Kuaui and not Maui.

The resort was quite empty and peaceful and the staff were all extremely friendly from check-in to check-out. The layout reminded me a lot of the Four Seasons although the swimming beach in Kapalua was not as calm as in Wailea so we didn't get to go in the ocean as much as we would have liked.

While the Four Seasons is amazing, I now prefer the Kapalua area for much better views, a little cooler (which was perfect- highs around 85) and more laid back.

We felt like we were at a honeymoon factory - they tried to make us feel special but it was pretty robotic - preprinted cards saying Welcome to your Honeymoon. With so many couples on their honeymoon though, it was nice of them to at least try to make us feel special. We actually stayed at a Four Seasons on our wedding night before our flight to Maui and they gave us a handwritten note and some chocolates. At the RC in Maui, they did give us a complimentary bottle of champagne. The lobby was really pretty. We were greeted with leis and fruit juice. The views of the ocean from the lobby were spectacular. Our rooms were not what I would call the nicest we have ever stayed in. They looked really cheesy and outdated - with bamboo and wicker furniture and really old television and alarm clock. The carpet was green and had stains. The bathtub was just okay, not very fancy and didn't really seem like it was built for two. Room service was mediocre. They pride themselves on saying they clean the room twice a day, but I think they only changed our sheets and bedding once while we were there and the room wasn't that impressive. Room service was a rip off. Everything was pricey, and we started ordering off the kid's menu because it was the same, if not better food, for a lower cost. It took forever for them to come get our trays. Once we called after we were done eating, waited about half an hour, decided to leave and came back about 4 hours later, and the table was still in our room. We pushed it out to the hall and called room service again to let them know about the table. It stayed there for another 4 hours. We peeped in the morning and it was finally gone. We did stay on the Club Level, but I didn't feel like this was any big deal. There were a TON of people there, it started to feel like a frat party sometimes. There must have been a young group who traveled together because they would go in, take all the tables, order a bunch of beers, and be loud and obnoxious. However, the concierge on the Club Level were absolutely WONDERFUL!!! They made our stay worthwhile. The pool area was nice. They come by every once in a while with water and a piece of pineapple when it got hot. There were lots of kids by the pool though, which is not something you really want to see on your honeymoon, but then again, we weren't at a Sandals so we can't really complain. The beach was gorgeous. We had a lot of fun playing in the waves and it was very clean. Overall, it was an average hotel with really high prices. I don't know what the $15 fee per day was for. We parked our own car instead of paying another $15 for valet. The spa was okay. We enjoyed our massage, but it smelled really musty and the gym really reeked and it was close to where we had to go for our treatments. The carpets looked really old too.

Even discounting the poor weather conditions, this Ritz does not come close to living up to the expected Ritz standards.

We booked the resort expecting to enjoy a five-star hotel in Maui. This certainly was not the case, especially when compared to our experience at the other five-star hotels we stayed at on Hawaii and Oahu. From the moment we arrived, we knew we wanted to leave. We had to remove our own bags from our rental car since the young woman who was working at the bellhop desk could not lift them herself. Inside, we were not greeted as we had been when we arrived at the other hotels we had visited with flower leis and cool drinks. While checking in, we were not placed in the same room category as we had reserved. We were told the only room ready was one with a partial ocean view. What initially appeared to be an upgrade, was in fact a pool view room with a huge palm tree obstructing any view of the ocean. We were given the keys and told to walk down the hallway and find it ourselves. We were not offered any tour of the resort, explanation of amenities or services, nor the breakfast that was included in our rate, or locations of the various facilities. In fact, there was a whole hallway full of shops that we stumbled upon before we checked out that we never knew of. To add insult to injury, during our stay we watched as other guests were greeted with such amenities and shown to their rooms by hotel staff. While the property at the Ritz Carlton is aesthetically pleasing, it certainly leaves a lot to be desired in every other department. The room had a musty odor that resembled dirty socks and urine and overall was generally was dirty. The housekeeper did not change or even pick up our robes off the floor during our entire stay. The sheets were not changed. Those are just complaints related to the condition of our room. While at breakfast the first morning, I was given a \"wake up call\" by pouring clumpy sour milk into my coffee. Trying to relax at the pool was impossible. There are no umbrellas to shade guests from the intense Hawaiian sun. In order to sit in a cabana, you need to rent it for more than $75 a day. While at the pool one day, a rude waiter insisted that we moved seats while he was ordering our drinks despite us being the only people sitting in the particular location for forty minutes while waiting for him to return. We even overheard him bad mouthing us to other guests. Our bed was broken and worn out. There was a big gully on one side. After complaining about the bed, we returned one night to find an alleged \"new mattress,\" which was curiously covered with down feathers. The bed linens were thrown in a ball on top of our luggage.

This was the first time I have ever paid $675 a night for a room so we made sure we did our homework. We booked an oceanview suite and repeatedly called the hotel to ensure that we were given a room that had had a commanding view of the water. The view in a hotel room is very important and I totally understand paying extra for this feature. Check-in We checked in around 4pm on a Friday afternoon and it took about 10 minutes for us to get to the front of the line. I have never seen such a slow checkin process at what is supposed to be a 5 diamond hotel. They do handout leis when you check in. Room We booked an oceanview suite and was given 1519. We were extremely DISAPPOINTED with the view. This was supposed to be a FULL OCEANVIEW room but really it seemed like a partial oceanview room. We could only see a small part of the water by going out to the edge of our balcony and looking to our extreme left. We were extremely disappointed with this. I noticed that the rooms that do not face pool side have a terribly inferior view of the water; the Ritz should not sell these as full oceanview rooms. If you want oceanview, you should definitely ask for a room that faces the pool side of the property. The next day, I called the front desk and spoke with the manager, JoAnne. She said that another room was available. She managed to get us 1540. This room has an AWESOME view because it is a corner room at the end of the hall. I found out that this room is not an oceanview suite, rather it is a seaview suite that goes for about $1100 a night. I am extremely thankful that JoAnne basically upgraded us for. However, I felt irritated that I had to complain about this in a property such as the Ritz. It seems like all the oceanview rooms face the water at an angle. I would request that reservations fax you a layout of the property before making a booking. The hotel is gorgeous. I have stayed at the Ritz in Bali and the Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay and Sayam in Bali and the Ritz Kapalua is the most beautiful hotel I have ever seem. Kapalua is beautiful and it has an exclusive feel staying there. ONE PROBLEM: The main problem with this hotel is that it is a huge property and has a lot of rooms. I think this is the largest Ritz in the world It's hard to give 5-star service when the hotel has so many guests. The food is nothing special. If you want good sushi, skip the hotel restaurants and go eat at Sansei at the Kapalua Shops. The overall service is adequate; If you are used to other properties in Asia, then you will be disappointed at the Ritz because the service does fall short. My overall thoughts are that Kapalua is beautiful and it definitely is worth it to stay here. Kapalua has to be one of the most beautiful spots on earth. I totally envey the people that have those homes on the hill that you can see from the Ritz. The hotel and the whole area never really felt crowded. The beach is also very private. You should do your homework about the kind of room you want and are willing to pay for. The seaview suite we were subsequently upgraded to is excellent but I can't justify paying $1000 a night for a room like that. We drove to Wailea to have lunch at the Four Seasons and noticed that the pool area there was extremely crowded. However, as always, they have the signature Four Seasons service which is consistently excellent. I have never been disappointed with the service at any Four Seasons in the world and we have stayed at their properties ranging from Maldives to Bali to Dallas and San Francisco. I guess next time we will try the Four Seasons in Wailea.

Apololgies to all you naysayers, but our experience there was grand. While it's true that the price tags on just about everything at the resort are high, that's why Hawaii exists, right? Anyway we cached in a bunch of Marriott points so our stay was free and we passed on most of the $50 a plate restaurant drek in favor of Maui Tacos and hit a few spots in Lahaina including Gerard's and Cafe O'Lei. For an exception our sunset dinner at the Plantation House restaurant was worth the ticket, but overall I wasn't knocked out by the food on Maui because I didn't feel much like eating, which is strange because normally I'm an amateur restauraunt critic and I can't wait to get out and eat. In Maui A bag of Onion potato chips and a Kirin was heaven. Anything more than light fare and appetizers and I was too weighed down. Must have been the climate. In retrospect for us Maui was really all about the setting; ambiance, paradise, beaches, and Mai-Tais. The Ritz up on cool pleasant Kapalua was a great home base to explore the island. We took a ride down to Wailea to see the Four Seasons just to comparison shop and the differences were immediately evident to my wife and I. Wailea is like a Newport Beach/Maimi Beach/Vegas/Palm Springs kind of a place in a noticeably hotter part of the island. I felt like I was in Ceasar's Place when I was at the 4 Seasons (not my trip) and in contrast I really appreciated the sedate and distinguished exclusive charm of the Ritz. It's at least ten degrees cooler up on Kapalua, and the whole Kapalua Bay resort is great. Since we went in August I can't say what things might be like in February, and truth be told I was a bit freaked out about going to the RC after I read some of the reviews on this site, but to the people who harshly panned it all I can say is - That wasn't the hotel I stayed at. I'm giving the RC 4 stars since Maui is full of great resorts, and while good, there was nothing about the RC that sent me totally over the edge. I think if the food was better and more tuned to the climate I would have been more enthusiastic. The situation of the hotel is also something of a trade-off - The hotel is goregous, the pool grand, but it takes a little work to get down to the beach. But this is a refined trade-off since the views are stunning and we had no problem getting sunburned just the same. In the evening the tree frog seranade is unbelieveable. Just be sure to rent a car and get some snorkel gear from Boss Frog's and don't be shy. Take the shuttle to the Kapalua Bay beach and check out the island. All beaches have public access and the water is fabulous, and it's the lesser traveled paths that turned out to be the better ones.

One would expect outstanding service, amenities, food, and accomodations at a 5-star resort; and this resort not only met, but exceeded all of my expectations. The last time I checked, which was today, the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua was still rated 5 stars. I wonder if the complainers in some of these reviews know exactly what discriminating travelers like myself enjoy? Obviously those who rate the hotel know what they are talking about. In my opinion, this is the best Ritz-Carlton in the world! It is located in the best place (Maui), near the most private beach (Kapalua), and employs a friendly staff which goes beyond their call of duty. This hotel is a complete universe, a place where I was able to happily sit by the ocean with a book all day one day, relax on my lanai enjoying the view another day, and rejuvinate by the pool eating fresh pineapple another day. The Ritz is located on a knoll, in a spectacular setting between the rainforest and the sea. The 5-minute stroll from the pool down the path to the beach with the refreshing breeze blissfully blowing on your back is truly an invigorating awakening of the senses. Somewhere during that walk, even the most stressed-out traveler should come upon the realization that this is paradise! This is the way life should be! When it rains, and it will (remember you are next to a rainforest), that is the perfect excuse to enjoy a relaxing afteroon nap in your room or suite. The sun will come out again soon. I found my suite to be up to par with the usual Ritz standard, complete with marble baths, separate showers, private lanais, and a decadently comfortable bed. There were 3 televisions in my suite, but I never once turned them on. I preferred enjoying the ocean vistas! Finally, I must say that hospitality is the keynote at this elegant, yet non-imposing plantation-style resort. I found exemplary service topped off with good old-fashioned Hawaiian aloha!

The hotel is beautiful, massive (yet the common areas are scaled in such a way so you don't feel lost in space). The beach access is just a short walk, and nowhere near the trek some make it out to be. Besides, the beach is well worth it: quite, clean, and with plenty of open space. The food is excellent, presentation in the restaurants is first class, and the views are picture-perfect. The rooms (we had a suite and a standard room) were both clean, and well furnished (the beds are great). If you golf, the three courses that surround the hotel are breathtaking... The concierge was able to get me on the courses last minute with no trouble. Ignore all the complaints about the wind. Most of Maui is windy, and the parts that are not, are muggy at best. All in all, if you want a fantastic resort, with a great location, excellent service, and privacy you have to check out the Ritz.

I had decided to take my mom on her first tropical vacation ever, and booked an ocean view room. Before leaving, I sent an email to the concierge, asking if they would try to secure us a really nice view, because (a) this was mom's first ever trip to an island, and (b) she had recently been diagnosed with a terrible illness... and I wanted to make the trip very special for her. When we checked in, we were shown to our room, which turned out had been upgraded to a full ocean view SUITE thanks to the lovely lady at the concierge desk!

I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the poor reviews on this website before we went. The grounds are amazing and the pool is not like an aquatic playground, but it is tasteful and large enough so you don't feel like you're on top of everyone, which is how it is at most of the other resorts. Our room was always kept spotless, with twice a day cleaning service. The staff was extremely nice and helpful with making or cancelling any reservations. If you are looking for a lot of people and pools with waterslides, then you should look in Kaanapali. If you are looking for a tasteful resort on the most gorgeous property in Maui, then the Ritz is for you. Another popular complaint is that the beach is so far away. Are we Americans that lazy?! The beach is not even a three minute walk from the pool and it's a better beach than Kaanapali by far because it is very spreadout. The beaches in Kaanapali are very small and there isn't much beach. The resort is pushed up on the hill because down by the beach is an ancient Hawaaiin burial ground, so they couldn't build on top of it. The way the resort is pushed back on a cliff allows for it to be spread out and also offers amazing views. The bocci court and nine putting greens are also a nice touch. Oh, and did I mention the staff that comes around with fresh slices of pineapple while you are lounging by the pool? Wonderful! Another complaint we read about was the wind. Kapalua is a windy part of the island, but the breeze felt wonderful with the hot sun. It is nothing that would keep you from lying by the pool or anything. I guess there is always going to be someone who is going to complain about something. And to the people who were complaining about the room size! I know the hotel is a bit expensive, but you're not just paying for the room, you're paying for the resort. And why are you spending so much time in your room in Maui anyway?!

The cheap furniture(especially the TV credenza) has not aged well. The TV was something you would find in a 1970's Ramada...very strange! Overall cleanliness should have been better, especially around the toilet paper holders...gross! They use an industrial strength air freshener in the rooms that can be quite overwhelming. At least the bed was comfortable. Where are the flowers? At most Hawaiian resorts, you are surrounded by fresh orchids in bathrooms, hallways, etc. There were very few at this property. The room service that we used several times did not even come with a flower...something that a Marriott in Kansas City can do...why not the Ritz in Maui? There is a very stinky type of plant they have on their grounds near the rooms...why don't they get rid of them? The beach is not your typical Hawaiian resort beach...way down the hill from the hotel. It looked more like a beach you would find in Wisconsin. Dark murky water and mostly pine trees.

I suspect they spend their time looking for something to complain about rather than looking at the positive things life has to offer. We found the hotel to offer elevated levels of service; from the constant Aloha greetings from staff members, to the twice-daily housekeeping service. Everything was picture perfect. The hotel is located on a bluff overlooking the Pacific. The lobby is on the eighth floor, which is the entry lobby level, and the rooms are on the lower levels. The beach might as well be the Ritz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private beach, (there are no private beaches in Hawaii, all must offer and have public access), as there was only a handful of beach goers during our entire stay. Previous reviewers mentioned the terrible lengthy walk to the beach, yet it is only 385 steps, I counted, from the pool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge to the sand. The hotel offers golf cart shuttles down to the beach for those unwilling or unable to make the 385 step walk down to the beach. The walk to the beach is on a stone paved, lit, walkway. At the end of the walkway, on the beach, is the Beach House Caf\u00c3\u00a9, where we enjoyed a delightful breakfast of an egg white frittata, an egg and local sausage quesadilla, with some tropical smoothies. This is a nice spot to enjoy the Hawaiian sunsets with a delicious tropical beverage and local appetizers. We did learn, as I am certain the negative reviewers did, that the hotel is on the bluff as the lower portion of the property is a sacred Hawaiian burial area about 1000 years old. The area is a protected site, is clearly marked with stone markers and landscaped with native hedges. It is a nice area to reflect on the history of the island and its people. For those interested, the service is top notch, the rooms are tastefully decorated, about 450 square feet, large bathrooms, with a separate glass shower and tub, the toilet is housed in it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own little room, double sinks, a bath scale, hair dryers, in room safe, ironing board, iron, and soft thick white cotton Ritz-Carlton robes. The hotel offers TV cable with enough channels to keep the TV watcher fully occupied. Twice daily housekeeping service keeps the room nice and tidy. The room lanai offers outdoor chairs, an ottoman, and a table. One has the choice of closing off the outside world with draperies, shutters, or if one desires, opening up the room to the lanai using the screen slider instead of the glass doors. The beds come with feather bed toppers, which made me, feel like being at home in my own bed. The hotel offers a choice of valet parking for a daily fee or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd self-parking for quests. For the beach goer, the hotel has big green beach towels, and boogie boards. In the pool area the hotel has towel service, food and beverage service, and live soft hawaiian music playing in an tented area near the outside bar area. For those not wishing to have every meal on the property on has options. The Honoloa Market, just across from the valet area, offers breakfast and lunch from its kitchen. One can eat the local goodies in the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front porch area. The market was the old post office and gathering place for the locals. Try their chocolate chip cookies, pretty yummy. There are also many fine restaurants in the Kapalua area, just minutes from the hotel and all without having to drive on the main highway. The hotel offers morning coffee in the open lobby, which is open to a view of the pool and ocean. This is a nice area to catch up on the news, a book, and a great cup of java. My only disappointment was the constant pointless cell phone conversations guests were having at this time of the morning. I say point less because the majority started the conversation with, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What are you doing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they were also loud as if they were competing with each other on who was more important. So much for a quite tranquil morning in Paradise. However I do not consider this to be a hotel problem.

We were there during the first week of June, 2004. The Hotel itself and the grounds are immaculate. There is plenty of green space and gardens throughout. The pool is beyond relaxing and I belive it intentionally does not have waterslides and volleyball to facilitate a calm and tranquil day at the pool. Younger children may prefer a more waterpark like atmosphere so keep that in mind. I believe individuals on this site take isolated complaints and turn them into generalities. The pool service was excellent, so much so that you have to be careful when you can simply sign everything off to your room. As for the beach, yest in Kaanapali and Waimea the beach is literally a sun tan lotion bottle throw from the pool. For some that may be important. However, to classify the beach as being a \"good distance\" from the Ritz is misleading and speaks more towards someone's laziness. It is a two minute walk down a widing path that takes you past the sacred burial grounds they discovered when building the hotel. At the beach, there is another restaurant and bar. Moreover, for those who simply refuse to walk more than 10 feet on vacation there are stretch golf carts running almost continuously offering rides. The lobby was great in the evenings, and has hotel caliber musicians. I am not sure what some people expect, Sting performing at night while a dozen or so people sip 7 dollar beers and lava flows? The sushi bar is a tad expensive, but the excellent Sansei restaurant is located in Kapaula so make the 30 second drive down the road and enjoy the rolls there. On to location. Any one that thinks Kapalua is too far from everywhere, either visited from a town of 2000 people where nothing is further than the Walmart 2 minutes down County Line Road or should have ... oh I don't know looked at a map before visiting Maui. Yes, it is up from Kaanapali but in Island terms that means 5 minutes. Out of curiousity we timed each of our trips into Lahaina from the Hotel, average time was 12 minutes. If you can't spend 12 minutes in a car with the person you are vacationing with than maybe you have other issues to resolve prior to taking a vacation. The nice thing about being a little bit further away is the spaciousness of the resort. We went to Waimea and last time we stayed in Kaanapali and those places are excellent, maybe even preferable to many people. But the resorts are literally stacked right next to one another. Any green space surrounding a pool is covered in lawn chairs and lounges. The Ritz just felt like you had more space to yourself, there is hardly anyone ever next to you at the pool unless you wanted them to be (12 minute car complainers could swim and sun in isolation if they want). Plus, with the beach being down the path you don't get a bunch of on-lookers passing through because remember the beaches in front of the hotels are open to the public there is not some imaginary line. Obviously, weather is a concern depending on when you travel. If you are going during Maui's wet season (check a website this is easy to find) than maybe go a little South of Kapalua. If you are going in the summer there is little concern. Last point, I promise. The individual complaining about the age group at the Ritz. My wife and I are in our late 20's and thought there a wide age range of people at the resort. However, what did you expect when you chose to stay a Ritz Carlton, the same early 20 something crowd you encountered at the Best Western in Daytona during your senior year Spring Break. The Ritz is expensive, typically people of middle age tend to have the income to be able to stay at such a resort. All in all, take all the 1 star ratings of the Ritz with a grain of salt.

Additionally, I have also spent some time at most of the major hotels on the Big Island, Maui and Kauai (just checking them out). Regarding the complaints about the distance to the beach - it is at most a 500 yard walk to the beach. Plus, it is a very pleasant 500 yards. I can't for the life of me imagine the lazy slobs who find it so distressing that they would have to walk 500 leisurely yards to the beach. Big deal. As far as being a long ways away from civilization. First of all, there is also another hotel at the resort (in case you didn't realize that) - it's called the Kapalua Bay Hotel (and there are over 500 villas throughout the resort). There are also 3 golf courses, not one. Plus the best restaurant on the island is in Kapalua (Sansei). In any case, it's meant to be a retreat - if you wanted a ton of action then maybe you should have looked into Waikiki. Or if you want something in between a retreat and a ton of action (and you have a family) try Kaanapaali. Although, to my mind, if you don't have kids you will hate Kaanapaali because the pools and beaches are swarming with little kids. The food in Kaanapali (and Whaler's Village) is also pretty bad (it's meant for the Olive Garden and Spaghetti Factory clientele). The Ritz has top notch service and sits on a beautiful piece of land. The hotel is spectacular and I never encoutered any mildew smells. If I had to list my favorite Hawaiian Hotels, I would say that it would go something like this: 1) Four Seasons Big Island 2) Hapuna (very secluded, not meant for kids, with a breathtaking lobby). 3a) Ritz 3b) Hyatt 4) Mauna Lani 5) Kapalua Bay Hotel 6) Mauna Kea 7) Princeville 8) Grand Wailea 9) Four Seasons Wailea (nice, but the pool is just too damned crowded for a Four Seasons). Way down the list would be anything in Kaanapali or Waikoloa (too Disney-like) and then way down after that would be the Kauai Marriott (fails at even being Disney-like).", "Date": "June 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful property\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2148842", "Content": "My husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary at the Ritz in March, 2004.

I wonder if some of the reviewers have stayed in Maui before to compare. We just returned from the Ritz Carlton and were not really all that impressed. The grounds are certainly nice but that is to be expected for a five star hotel and a five star price. Where to begin...The beach is very small and is quite a hike from the hotel itself, most people didn't make it past the pool. The level of service in the lobby bar is non-existent. It is almost like they wouldn't be paid if they tied to offer you another round. Someone mentioned the musicians were great, I would strongly diasgree, not only was the music bad, it was so loud you could not carry on a conversation without screaming to the person next to you. The location of the hotel is very far from anything, expect a long drive to anything you may plan on seeing. The fitness centre is plain embarassing. Some of the equipment looks like it was made in 1927, and the steam room in the Mens change area was not working half of the time we were there. When it was working it was not at all impressive, as a matter of fact the steam room at the YMCA here locally is more impressive. The door on the shower in our bathroom would not close, and we also had the mildew smell in our room. On a positive note, 1) the golf course does look very nice and I understand it is one of the best in the U.S. 2)If you like being isolated, this is the place for you, although most of Maui has the secluded feel to it as it is not as densely populated as other Islands. 3)There is a server whom my wife dubbed the \"Juice Pusher\" who was serving during the breakfast buffet that is highly entertaining. He ressembles the late Chris Farley, and won't leave you alone until you've had at least 3 glasses of OJ. As we were walking out we saw him entertaining another group by dancing around the table with the salt and pepper coconut shakers; I don't think I have ever had a more enjoyable breakfast. This is the 4th review I have written here and the first negative one. Ironically of the 4 places I have recently been to, this one was the most expensive, but the one most lacking in service. We were in Montego Bay at a 3 Star all inclusive resort a month ago and the service was incredible and for a lower price all meals and alcohol were included, plus the beach and pool areas were far superior. If you are considering a trip to Maui, I highly reccomend staying in the Kaanapali area, there is a variety of hotels and restaurants for the same price (or less) with better customer service, village shops and long beautiful beaches. As for me, this being my second trip to Maui, I am done.

Geographically, the area is gorgeous (reminds me somewhat of the Tuscany and Umbria regions of Italy) and the hotel had a very relaxed, very welcoming feel to it (which is nice after a long flight). Was a bit underwhelmed with the room we were given - mainly because of the condition of the carpet and the VERY crooked pictures on the walls (looked like the room had been hit by a tropical storm). Once we had the pictures in their correct position and had unpacked, we went down to enjoy an incredible meal in their premier restaurant (food, wine were excellent, live music in the restaurant was amazing, breezy tropical environment was perfect). Later, enjoyed a drink and more live music in the main hotel bar (I can't say enough good things about the musicians that performed at the hotel - a different group in both the restaurant and bar each night). Woke up early the first morning (4:30 AM or so) to the loud sounds of foot traffic on the floor above us (sounded like children running around). Was very concerned that the hotel had a noise problem, but they readily accomodated our request to change rooms and we never heard even a peep again for the remainder of the visit. Used the hotel gym twice, which was great (though some of the machines must be on loan from defunct fitness clubs - have never seen such worn pads in my life). Got a massage, sat in the sauna, etc. By day, we sat by the pool, which was very nice and well maintained. Went for long walks each morning, took naps, etc. Never wore a pair of long pants the entire stay - which was a pleasant surprise. Was glad we stayed at the Ritz Carlton and not one of the other top hotels we looked at in Wailea (there's new construction going on now in Wailea that makes a lot of noise. We had lunch there one day and found it disturbing. Couldn't wait to get back to our hotel). Overall had a truly relaxing experience at this property and was sad to have to leave our last day.

Employees were courteous and very helpful. The pool area is well served with great towels, lovely drinks, and a good menu for snacking or lunching by the pool. Everyone seems to jog or golf in the morning, so people are up and going by 6 or 7 a.m. The morning coffee and Wall Street Journal are a nice way to start the day. Yes, the hotel is an hour from Wailea or the north shore, but everything as far as activities is spread out on Maui, so it didn't bother me. We snorkeled in Nipili and at Mile Marker 14 beaches which were fairly close and convenient. Guest Activities is very convenient. We booked our surfing lessons there. I'm not sure that it was worth the price, but it was fun to try to surf. Book an early morning lesson so that the wind won't be as much of a factor. It would have been nice for the hotel employees to tell us that.We did a spa day at the Grand Wailea. The concierge desk has the menu of services for us to review, and we booked the services ourselves. In comparing the two great hotels, it was clear that the Grand Wailea was \"grand\" and meant to take your breath away (as the prices there do also), and the Ritz-Carlton was meant to make you comfortable and pampered in your Maui vacation.Overall, I loved the hotel.

The golf courses surrounding the resort were beautiful and very tempting, but I had to hold off this time. Definitely next time, if there is one. The lobby was very nice, the pool was nice (could use more frequent cleaning though), and our room was just OK. That was our only complaint. There was no doubt a damp smell coming from the A/C, which I think is gross, and the carpets were ugly and worn. The furniture needs to be updated, but the lanai was nice with new comfortable furniture, and the bathroom was very big and I liked the 2 shower idea. The lighting was bad in there, but that didn't bother us. The robes were awesome though, very thick and comfortable. The $15 resort fee is excessive, mainly b/c it didn't include valet parking. Otherwise, I wouldn't care that much, b/c hotels in disney have it, so I'm not surprised.

The Banyon Tree for dinner was fine dining at its best...elegant, delicious and alas...expensive. Kapalua is a nice spot on the island, but it might not be the best choice for those seeking sunny beaches, ocean sunsets, and accessibiltity to a more vibrant setting.", "Date": "February 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malibu, CA", "Title": "\u201cNeeds some serious work!\u201d", "Author": "sullyboy", "ReviewID": "UR1639284", "Content": "Just got back from a 4 night stay (14-18 JAN 2004). The location was fine (about 20 minutes north of Lahaina), other than the fact that you have more wind in Kapalua than say Wailea or Ka'anapali. The wind only became an issue after taking a dip in the pool and then trying to lay out in the sun. Quite chilly and unpleasant. We had no rain during our stay.As for the rooms, they could use MAJOR work. We made the front desk move us to a new room, because our first room smelled damp, and strongly of mold/mildew. I had previously read that some people encountered the same problem on tripadvisor.com, but didn't figure we'd have the same problem. I've been to many hotels on all of the Hawaiian Islands, and have never encountered this problem. So to say that \"it just happens\" in Hawaii is absurd. In reality, it \"just happens\" to those hotels (like the Ritz Kapalua) who don't bother to keep up their facilities.Our new room still smelled a bit musty, but due to the long walk back to the front desk, we decided that we'd just make do. Anyway, we are not the type of travelers that spend much time in our room. Our first room was what they called \"ocean view'. Because the hotel is not directly on the water, \"ocean view\" means you get a small sliver of ocean from your balcony.Our new room had virtually no view whatsoever, but as I said, it was quite a trek to keep walking between the front desk and the room, so we decided to accept the new room.A word about both rooms... Having seen two separate rooms which both exhibited the same sign of deterioration, I can say with some level of accuracy that this hotel is very sub-par when it comes to other Ritz-Carltons.Both rooms had very ratty looking furniture. One of the rooms had a giant stain all over the carpet, and the other room's carpet was worn and filthy. We did not walk around barefoot in the room. Tip: call housekeeping and ask for slippers... at least you can have something comfortable to wear between the bed and the bathroom. The screen on the screen door was totally ripped in our second room. Good thing we didn't encounter any mosquitoes around the resort.Both rooms had very old televisions... you know, the 14\" Sony's from 1985? That is what they reminded me of anyway. Again, we don't watch TV when we go to Hawaii since we?d rather spend our time outdoors, but it?s just one more item not up to par with the Ritz standards.The bathrooms were dated... very old marble showing signs of wear.We only did breakfast at the hotel, and only once, because of the LOUSY service and overpriced $25 buffet. Let me tell you, I've had better breakfast buffets for $10 at Hyatt Hotels.Poolside service was very indifferent. Only one lady employee treated us with a smile every time. The heavy set blonde attendant needs to get an attitude check, or check into a new line of work. Her service was consistently rude and indifferent.The $15 daily resort fee is the straw that breaks the camel's back. For a daily $15 charge (which you may not decline), you receive 'complimentary' coffee/tea in the morning, in the lobby. But don't sleep in until 10am like we did...or you will miss the coffee and tea service. Silly us, we thought we were on vacation... but apparently you must set an alarm for 9am in order to get your $15 money's worth for the day.That is the only material good you receive for the $15 daily fee. They name a bunch of intangible services such as \"the privilege of shopping in the lobby shops and charging your purchases to your room\". You be the judge of that, but I don't think it costs them $15/day to negotiate with those merchants, to let the guests sign charges to their rooms.So for us, we paid a total of $60 for resort fees for our 4 days, and we got a total of 6 cups of coffee. You do the math...for $10 per cup of coffee; I'd just assume buy two large bags of premium-grade Peaberry Kona Coffee to take home.We will absolutely not return to the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua. Their combination of lousy rooms, rude employees and irritating resort fee is good reason to keep us away in the future.I almost forgot... beware of lunatic bellhops in the narrow hallways. (By the time you get all the housekeeping carts in the halls, you literally must walk in a single file line to pass them.) We were \"forced off the road\" so to speak twice by the same bellhop guy, who insisted on not yielding to us, the guests. Again, silly me for thinking the guest would be given the right of way, especially at a supposed 5-star hotel.The only nice employees we encountered were: the tall brunette pool-attendant, the housekeeping women, and the short Hawaiian girl who greets you with a lei. Also the Caucasian gall at the concierge desk.If you don?t want to pay ridiculous parking fees, there is a self parking area, albeit a short walk from the lobby.Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. We will return to Mau?i, but we?ll stay at the Four Seasons in Wailea. We checked out the Four Seasons Wailea during our trip, and it is just miles above and beyond the Ritz.I will continue to patronize other Ritz Carlton?s, because I know the Ritz in Kapalua is just an exception to the brand. I would like to know how such an awful hotel maintains the Ritz logo.Overall, the staff seems very full of themselves. We got the overall impression that the staff forgot that their job is to serve us. We?re paying them to serve us, but they behaved like they were on a vacation too.This hotel was nothing more than a 3-star Marriott or Hilton in terms of rooms and service.", "Date": "February 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1552328", "Content": "I just returned from a great vacation. I'm astounded as I read some of the other reviews. This was truly a wonderful hotel. True, you do have to hoof it down to the beach. But the Ritz made a decision to NOT disturb a sacred Hawiian burial site. That is total class in my book. I did have to pay a lot of money for the buffet, but on the Big Island I paid the same at the Marriott. Yep the pine trees got to me, I could not figure that one until I read the history of the plantation. Still, Palm trees would have seem more Hawaiian. If you are looking for crowds and a very close beach go to the Hyatt. In fact when I go back I may stay at the Marriott because I do have two small children.

You can sit in the lobby at night with the trade winds relaxing breathe as entertainment sings/dances for you. The golfing is one that you will never experience anywhere else! The only negatives, which are none to worry about are, the fact that you need to walk about 1/4 to get to your room if it is an ocean view, or about 1/2 mile to walk to the Ritz's private ocean beach. Other reviews complained about the prices, but if you stay in Hawaii, and at the Ritz Carlton, you should expect the higher proce, this is no econolodge!

A restaurant recommendation made by the concierge was clearly a kickback arrangement with nauseatingly disgusting food and equally obnoxious prices.

I too was concerned about some feedback I had read, but I really don't understand where the negative vibes are coming from. First off, the weather. Yes, it is a bit windy and overcast in Kapalua, but we managed to get a tan after only a few hours of laying out. Once it rained at night (i.e. 3 AM) and there was one only one instance of a rainy mist at 10 AM that cleared in less than ten minutes! Constant tradewinds keep you from feeling like you're frying in the sun. DT Fleming Beach is a five minute walk at best and the path is paved. Kapalua Beach is also nice (our friends were married there) but it's a shuttle or short car ride away. The rooms were not out of date or musty smelling. (Musty and out of date is where we stayed in Oahu & that smell was from the humidity! ) We slept with the lanai door open, never felt the need for AC. Bathrooms are marble with shower, shower/tub & two sinks. I remember at least two washcloths because I used them everyday & at night they give you new towels when housekeeping comes by for a second time. Food prices were consistent with what you'd find in almost any hotel on Maui or Hawaii (i.e. $12 for an omlette). Best deal going at Kapalua is a two minute walk to the Honolua store for fresh pineapple or take out breakfast or lunch for under $5.00.

Location: Feels like you've arrived in the pacific northwest. Property is surrounded by pineapple plantations and the golf course. There are many tall evergreen trees, which is nice, but makes you feel like you're not in Maui. Weather: Be prepared for cool, windy and possibly wet weather as compared to other areas on the island (Wailea, for instance). We ended up leaving the resort early most every day in search of better weather. Rooms: The room was somewhat adequate, but the furnishings need serious updating as well as the overall decor (paint, peeling wallpaper, etc.). Ritz needs to put money in remodeling the rooms of the hotel. The overall feel of the room was not 5-star. Public Spaces/Lobby: Lobby was nice for drinking complimentary coffee in the morning, but you're likely to be surrounded by conference attendees who are discussing business at tables nearby. The hallways need to be redone with new wallpaper and paint for a more simple, but elegant look. The current wallpaper is too busy and tacky. Spa/Gym: Luxurious and inviting. The gym was small, but well laid out. The steam room and sauna in the spa were wonderful. Grounds: Beautiful grounds, very manicured. Pool was very nice as well. It would be nice if the pool had umbrellas for shade. DT Fleming Beach: Rough beach - quite a ways downhill from the resort. Not for kids. The Kapalua Bay beach in front of Kapalua Bay hotel is probably better (we didn't go). Service/Staff: Service was very competent and efficient. The concierge was helpful. The complimentary shuttle was a nice amenity. We didn't use the staff much as we are very much self sufficient. Overall: The property has become a predominantly conference hotel. Unless you can get a very good rate here, which we got using the Hawaii website, you are better off spending your money at Four Seasons or Grand Wailea if you are looking for a 5-star experience. It's rated as a 5-star, but felt like a Hilton. Next time, we plan on either renting a house on the Northshore or staying at a condo in Wailea. Tip: Take the shuttle to the Bay Club and/or the Kapalua Bay Hotel for happy hour. The Bay Club has $4 drinks from approx. 5:30-6 p.m. with a three-piece jazz band on weekends. There's also a happy hour available at the Lehua Lounge from approx. 5-6:30 p.m. Also 50% off sushi prices at Sansei after 10 p.m.", "Date": "December 19, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorribley run hotel... a total rip off\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1513323", "Content": "Besides the physical problems facing this hotel (it's located 10 minutes from the beach) the rooms are dirty (I had them move me three times - and each time the hotel put me in a room where the bed spread looked like it had been used to film a porno movie), the service is indifferent at best (they seem to think if they say \"Aloha\" or \"Maholo\" enough that will cover for bad service.

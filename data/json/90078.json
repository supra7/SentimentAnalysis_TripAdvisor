{"Reviews": [{"Content": "LOVED THE MIRAMAR My husband booked the Miramar for my 40th birthday. We took our 2 kids with us and had a wonderful time, one of the best holidays that we have ever had.Hotel location is excellent, close to beach, restaurants and shopping. Denny's restaurant is at the bottom of this hotel and we ate there inleast once a day for one of our meals (they give alot of food and not expensive)Hotel is very clean and we had no problems with our room and no problems with anything in this hotel and I would recommend this hotel very much and would stay there again. There is so much to do in hawaii and this is why we stayed for 2 weeks. We were there over the Christmas holidays and there were tones of tourists. The island was decorated for the Christmas time and at night all of the palm trees had lights around them and it made the whole street light up. New Years Eve they gave a spectacular fire works show on the beach. We did alot of the tours, but you need to shop around to find the cheapest price, dont book any tours from the hotel its more expensive its cheaper to go around the corner to Afordable Tours. we also booked Afordable Tours shuttle van to drive us back to the airport for $30 because when we arrived to Hawaii we took a cab and it cost us more it was $40 to the hotel.The ABC stores were great! We bought so many things there. If you spend more than $100 just save your receipts and show the cashier and she will give you a free coffee mug. Our holiday was wonderful and very special to us and I thank my wonderful husband for bringing us there for my birthday. I couldnt have asked for anything more.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR639158680", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ALOHAToronto"}, {"Content": "To The Miramar, with Aloha! We have stayed at this hotel in the past and have always had a very pleasant visit. The location to beautiful Waikiki beach was excellent, a short fun trip through the International Market Place ( good food  many great booths to shop!) a big plus. The management and staff were extremely professional and brought the spirit of ALOHA, as well. Our room had an ocean view by day and at night all the surrounding hotel lights provided a romantic atmosphere.... The rooms are very clean and the beds SO COMFORTABLE for a hotel, we have stayed at 5 star hotels with hard uncomfortable beds. The pool was clean and the food is something to look forward to! Amazing breakfast. Room service is also available, no long waits. We highly recommend staying at this hotel.

It seeped through the lobby and ALL through the parking garage - disgusting!The staff was friendly and nice. It was, as you should expect for a three star hotel....One other thing: its on a busy street, and at night there are prostitutes hanging outside the hotel, who are actually quite aggressive from what we could see. Also there were drug dealers on that block and a couple blocks either way that offered us drugs on several locations (not the hotel's fault per se, but speaks to the location).You're about two blocks to the beach, so its a nice central location. Parking costs 10 dollars a day, which is a bit of a pain.All in all, if you're there just to sleep, which we were, the hotel is pretty good for that, as your room will be clean and well kept.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR931930266", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "vanessaxox"}, {"Content": "Good value for Waikiki We stayed at this hotel in 2006.

We just got back from 9 days at the Miramar. To say the least, we were overwhelmingly surprised. We've been to Oahu almost every year since 1994, and have stayed at numerous hotels and condos in the Waikiki area. Although we never stayed at the Miramar before, we were extremely pleased with our stay. From the beginning of our search for a smoker-friendly hotel, I was in contact with Angie via on-line reservations. She was extremely friendly and helpful throughout. Before our trip, we knew that we didn't book the Hilton, however, we were concerned about our upcoming trip. While the hotel could use a little TLC in certain areas, we were very pleased with the large rooms (we booked two connecting rooms for the four of us), and the pool area was larger than we had at other, more expensive hotels we previously stayed at. Parking was a breeze in the hotel lot ($10 per day), and being across the street from the Food Pantry, two blocks from the beach, and steps away from the International Marketplace made our trip so much more enjoyable. We will definitely make future plans to stay at the Miramar again.

The smell of a moldy must was just terrible from the second we stepped of the elevator onto the 11th floor and was worse when entering the room. My whole family was stuffed up and coughing by morning. When I inquired about it, the Manager said it was probably the chemical they used when cleaning the carpets and it probably just needed aired out. However, when leaving the room, the housekeeping informed us that they had sprayed for something the day before and that was probably what we were smelling. I couldn't understand what she said that they were spraying for and am not sure I would have wanted to know. The bathroom was dirty. The sink fictures had scum around them as well as the tub.

Having travelled to Honolulu at least once a year for the past 10 years, we have been able to 'tailor' the two weeks to suit our needs each time. This is the first year we have stayed at Miramar and found the accommodation more than adequate for our needs.The very comfortable Deluxe room was of ample size ( larger than rooms at more expensive hotels we have stayed at) with a spotlessly clean bathroom, perfect size balcony overlooking the pool with plenty of afternoon sunshine. The best feature was the quietness - no traffic noise and no tourist buses arriving at 6am- yet it is in the heart of Waikiki with the Food Pantry and The Bus stop across the road, International Market next door and within walking distance of many features. PERFECT.If one avoided getting out of the lift on the fifth floor, the hotel was fine. The fifth floor foyer is GRIM and needs a good clean out. There are tatty signs and sad plants, tired floor tiling, a mismatch of seating and several incongruous drink machines to assail the senses, as this area provides access to the dining room and the pool area.A disappointing aspect was that after arriving from Sydney at 10.30am we were not able to access our room until after 3pm - a real nuisance as we had left home at 10am the previous day to travel to Melbourne, fly to Sydney, wait the 2+ hours then fly on to Honolulu (plus the four hours time difference). All we wanted was a shower, change out of our winter clothes and get settled. Being so tired and in need of somewhere to relax, it felt as if we were wasting the first day of our all too brief two weeks. Along with others who were waiting for access to their rooms, we ended up 'snoozing' on the lounges in the foyer until 3pm.On departure day, we had checked out and left the hotel before 5.45am, as had a number of other tourists. Thus in such a considerable time frame, it must be surely possible for newly arrived guests to access their rooms prior to 3pm", "Date": "Jul 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR562662685", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "katiepat"}, {"Content": "Very goog hotel for the money This is a very nice hotel that is centrally located in Wakiki, next to the INternational Centre at a reasonable price.

We enjoyed wallking around the International Marketplace and adjoining shopping plazas. The shops all look the same, and the prices are all about the same too.... so just browsing in the stores was fun to see all the nick-naks and shirts and Hawaii memorablilia. There was enjoyable (free) shows at the food court.And just outside the IM is the action of Waikiki with the beaches, shows and hotels and restaurants.In summary, if you want a more affordable hotel with a pleasant staff, adequate accomodations, and a GREAT location, the Miramar is the place to go.

The view was of more high rise hotels, with a glimpse of the ocean if you twist your head around enough. The problems were with the room itself. If you have a choice, don't get onto the top floor. The air conditioning couldn't bring the temp of the room below 79, and that was in the middle of the night with AC on full. During the day, the temp was in the low 80's in the room. Even after letting the front desk know about the problem, they told us they would send maintenance up but the problem was never fixed. There is a window across one full wall, but it didn't open and there was no balcony. We would look out the window and see hundreds of other windows with balconies, but none in our room.The positives about the place is its location. The hotel lobby opens into the International Marketplace. It was a lot of fun to just leave the hotel and walk around the touristy shops. It's a few blocks off of the beach, an easy walk. The pool was on the 5th floor on the roof, and it was nice and clean. There was a tiki theme bar next to the pool.One recommendation for tourists, go to the North Shore of the island, about a 30 minute drive depending on traffic, and go to one of the shrimp trucks. We tried Mackeys. It had a sign with pictures of Rachel Ray and her $20 a day food show. A shrimp plate was like $11, but well worth it.The parking garage ($10 a day to park) was cramped and difficult to navigate. Lots of paint marks on the cement walls and posts from rental cars.Overall the stay was a good one, after all, it was in Hawaii.

The maid staff was excellent.Rooms: We are smokers so we were on a smoking floor (18). We were there when it was quite windy and some of the other people on our floor didn't quite grasp the fact that if you left the lanai door open during the wind the ceiling tiles would bang and the front door would slam shut. So there was some late night banging on a few nights. Someone at the front desk must have figured out the culprit because a phone rang and the banging stopped. The rooms themselves were fine. It is nice to have a mini fridge. Elevators: Just a note, if you are on a high floor there is quite a wait for the elevator in the morning so plan your morning accordingly. The pool: Plenty of chairs and lounges. The pool is heated by the sun, so since it can get shady in the late afternoon it is a little chilly. The pool bar has a daily special and the bartenders are all quite nice. The bar closes at the vague time of sunset, but they all asked if we wanted anything before they left for the day. (tip) bring your ice bucket down with you and fill it before you head back up to the room. The ice machine is on the 5th floor with the pool and restaurant. Location: Aside from the staff this is the hotel's best feature. Easy walk to the beach. You can get to Duke's thru the International Marketplace very easily (if you aren't distracted by shopping that is). Lobby: We did a few mornings of waiting in the lobby for family and it is spacious with plenty of seating. Parking: We didn't have a car, but when my cousin came in from the North side he was able to park in the lot for a reasonable amount. The lot is tight, but apparently that is the norm in Honolulu.

There were 14 of us, aged 5 to 66 years-old.It is easy to fly to Oahu with a great selection of airlines/price as well as non-stop flights. The airport is well-organized and it took us about 15 minutes to get our luggage and leave. Some of our group purchased an airport transfer which included a 'lei greeting'. Unfortunately, they ran out of leis so many people didn't get them. We stayed at the Miramar at Waikiki Hotel. It is 15 minutes from the airport. Some of us took a taxi which cost $35 ($30 transportation and $5 luggage fee). There are many shuttles that you can book to and from the airport (cost $8-9 per person). We have heard that Robertson's is the most reliable. DON'T use Ohana Express Shuttle (we booked them for when we left and they didn't come to get us. We phoned them twice to remind them on the evening of our departure. In the end, we ended up taking a taxi to the airport 45 minutes after our scheduled pick-up time with Ohana!).The check-in at the Miramar was done in less than 5 minutes. We stayed on the 15th floor with partial ocean views. The hotel wallpaper and carpets are old but it was otherwise fine. The rooms had 2 double or 1 king-size bed, 2 night stands, 1 table with 2 chairs, 2 dressers, a small fridge, coffee maker, TV, safe, iron/ironing board, hairdryer and a balconey with 2 chairs and small table. There is some traffic noise that you can hear but it didn't bother us.The hotel has 3 restaurants but we didn't try them as there are so many other places to eat. There is a grocery store right across the street which also serves deli sandwiches, sushi and fresh creampuffs. The Denny's at the hotel is extremely busy. Despite that, we never had to wait longer than 15 minutes to get seating for 14 people. We also ate at Perry's (buffet, 1 block away), IHOP (family fare/pancakes, 3 blocks away) and Chili's (TexMex, across the street). For fine dining, we went to Keoni's (Thai/Seafood, very good, 1 block away), Cheesecake Factory (variety, excellent, 2 blocks away - very busy so eat early as wait-times are over 1 hour by 7 p.m.) and the Hula Grill (variety, above Duke's on the beach, excellent food, beautiful view, 2 blocks away). For lunch, we tried Duke's (beach bar so you can go in your swimsuit/bare feet if you want) and Cheeseburger in Paradise (excellent burgers and good portions but very overpriced/no view). The Hyatt Snack Bar on the beach is excellent. Reasonable prices, good variety and large portion sizes.The hotel pool is a good size and well-maintained. About a quarter of the pool area gets direct sun and the rest is in shade. Waikiki Beach is only 1 and a half blocks away. There are many activities to try there or you can swim/soak up the sun. There are 2 enormous turtles that live in the reef at Waikiki and you can see them swimming throughout the day.The International Market Place is at the base of the hotel. We found that the vendors overprice their merchandise and then sell it to you for about 40% of what they asked. Duke's Lane is 2 blocks over and has many vendors with cheaper prices. ABC stores are every block in Waikiki and sell almost anything you want at reasonable prices.At night, there are street performers 1 block from the hotel. It was fun for the family to walk the street and see them. There is also a live band on the beach at 6:30 p.m. each night about 4 blocks from the hotel. The hotel has a lounge but we didn't go in. We did go to Coconut Willy's Bar and Grill above the marketplace. It has a live band every night. We also went over to The Yard House (a sports bar and restaurant). They have 110 beer/ale, a good menu and multiple flat-screen TVs with different programming on. There are prostitutes out in the late evening about 1 block from the hotel (near Ohana East Hotel).There is lots to do in Waikiki, Honolulu area and on Oahu. These have been well-reviewed in the travel guides and trip reviews here so I won't go over it again. I would strongly encourage people to rent a car as it only takes 40 minutes to go to other side of the island to less-crowded, fun, beautiful beachs.We had a lot of fun on Oahu and would definitely go back.

We just got back (last night) from a 16 night stay at the Miramar Hotel in Waikiki. We are from Sydney Australia and I have personally been to Honolulu 7 times.We travelled with a variety of ages.Firstly, there was myself and my husband and our 5 kids aged 13,11,5, 3 and 21 months. We also were travelling with my 73 year old mother and our best friends and their 13 month old son.We chose the Miramar as we have stayed there before and also because of the FANTASTIC LOCATION!Check in was smooth and the front desk staff were friendly. We arrived at 11am and check in is not until 3pm. We were told to come back around 2pm but we walked around and had lunch and returned after 3pm and the 3 rooms were all ready to go.We had requested rooms overlooking the pool and we got that on the 14th floor and were happy with our rooms. Sure...they are a little bit dated but I personally found the decore to be tasteful...not TOO Hawaiian or tacky and personally I found the room size comfortable. We even had a crib in our room for our 21 month old. Having a bath in the bathroom is a bonus, especially when travelling with young children. Not many hotels in Waikiki have a bath. The view from the Lanai is lovely.The location of the hotel is great. For a family, personally, it doesnt get much better (unless you have BIG BUCKS). The walk to the beach is about 7-10 minutes away depending on which end you are going to. Personally we liked the beach in front of the Hilton hawaiin village which is a longer walk but it was more child friendly and you can rent many things form aqua bikes to canoes and so on. Also, much less busy than in front of th Sheratons.As for places to eat, this location has it all. Denny's which is a favourite for us with so many children, is in the hotel, on the bottom level. Also, many fast food places, Jack in the Box, KFC, Burger King, Subway all within a very short walk. Chili's is across the street, as is Perrys Smorgasboard. There are some more upscale places to eat as well but seeing as though we do have 5 kids, we didnt go to many of them. We did go to the Cheesecake Factory which is a MUST for everyone. Worth every cent. Amazing place, great atmosphere and the food is the BEST! We also at at TGI Fridays which was a 10 minute walk along Kuhio Ave. IHOP is about a 7 minute walk and also child friendly.Miramar is right next to the International Market place which is a great place for all your souveniers and just nice to walk through day or night. There are some bars in there too and a good food court. We didnt eat there but it was usually busy which is usually a sign of good food and cheap too.We liked the pool area and the kids were happy with the pool. Yes it was a little on the cool side but the weather was warm so the kids were happy to be in cooler water and once you were in, it was lovely. Others have complained about the bar. We went to the pool many times and the bar was open and the staff friendly and the cocktails were great! So no complaints from us about the pool area or the bar. The elevators were ALWAYS fast and never too full and there is a glass elevator on the side which has a beautiful view and was a favourite for us.There are 2 small stores in the lobby. One is clothing store and we didnt go in there but the other had souveniers and supplies like sodas, liquor, some groceries and so on and the prices were actually rather good!!We always found the front desk staff pleasant and helpful and we cashed travellers checks everyday and that was never a problem. The laundry on the 5th floor (same floor as the pool) was handy and it's $1 for the washing machine and also the dryer. We bought some cheap laundry powder at a supermarket which worked out better for us as we had to do laundry a few times during our 16 night stay.Now...we did have a few drama's with our stay which did put a downer on the experience which is why I am not giving this hotel 5 out of 5.On day 9 we were sitting in the interconnecting room and one of my kids informed me that water was coming from the ceiling of the bathroom in the other room. It turns out that there was some pipe problem in the room above and we ended up with massive amounts of water (which came from the sewerage pipes) in our bathroom so we had to up and leave that room at 9pm at night!!!!!! The response to the problem was extremely fast but it was a MAJOR inconvience. As you can imagine, travelling with so many children, we had completely unpacked. We were told we could come back in the morning and pack our things and be moved to another room.. My Mother and 2 older kids stayed in their connecting room until morning and then we were all moved to the 22nd floor. The view from this floor was amazing but its the only floor without a balcony so this was a definite inconvenience as my husband and I loved sitting out there and having a quiet drink once the kids were settled each evening. Also, the rooms seemed warmer up there and we did have a problem with our AC. Again, the response to the problem was fast but after the problems we already had, we found this another inconvience.I would never choose to stay on floor 22 for the reason of no balconies, 21 would have been nice :)Drama's aside, our stay at the Miramar was great and we would stay there again despite the problems. The children loved it and we felt we could walk in ANY direction from the hotel and it was never too far away from anything. Also, the bus line is on Kuhio Ave and as others have already said, its a cheap way to get anywhere on the island. $2 for adults, $1 for seniors and juniors and children under 6 are free which was great for us having 3 under 6.We rented cars (mini van and also a jeep cherokee I think it was) and this was comfortable for our party of 11. We had the cars for 7 days and we explored almost the entire island. We have done this before and also find we see SO much more of Oahu this way. The spots we loved were Kailua Bay, Waimalo Beach, Turtle Bay and the North Shore. The Windward side of the island though is my favourite and the drive from Waikiki around to Hanuama Bay and to Kanehoe is just STUNNING.We did a lot of our shopping outside of Waikiki too as its much cheaper. Windward Mall is great, as is Pearlridge Mall. Ala Moana is great to visit but MANY upscale stores. But we still got some bargains at places like Sears, The Disney Store and Old Navy.If you are travelling with a family, I do highly recommend this hotel for its location. It doesnt have a kitchenette but does have a fridge. We knew this before we got there and we planned to eat all our meals out as we LOVE the food choices in the USA/Hawaii. We did have breakfast in the hotel and bought some supplies across the road at the FOOD PANTRY which is convenient and open early in the morning and till late at night. A little more pricey than the supermarkets but still ok. Also, many ABC stores (souveiners, groceries..coffee..etc) are within a few minutes walk of the hotel.If you require any other info about the hotel or Oahu, feel free to contact me anytime. I am always more than happy to talk about Hawaii!!!! :)I miss the Miramar and Waikiki and Oahu already.

That's pretty hilarious I think but bad that its so early and with kids and families walking around its a joke and u just wonder why its allowed to go on. Bit of excitement for the adults I guess.

It has a great location, while not on the beach is in easy walking distance of it. It's located right next to the International Market, so was very convenient to go over to get a cheap meal or the last minute souvenir. It is right on the bus/tram line, so there's easy access to mass transportation. There are also the ubiquitous ABC stores on every corner, and they were convenient to pick up basic necessities and snacks at reasonable (for Waikiki) prices.It's certainly not a luxury hotel, but you're not paying luxury prices either. It's a comfortable place to stay, and would be good for families. Staff was friendly and helpful, and the maid service was very good. Parking was always available for $10 a night.The pool is very small and not heated. The bar area was often not staffed, but as the pool wasn't very inviting, we didn't go to the pool. Elevators can be very slow, especially in the morning. Once we had to wait for 20 minutes for an elevator to come. We would have taken the stairs, but the only working stairway they have leads directly into the parking garage. Not sure, but this seems like it would be a fire hazard. I would stay here again if I got a good deal on the price.

We had a wonderful time. When we checked in our room wasn't ready. Granted, we got there at 11AM so we weren't surprised. They did let us check in and told us to come back at 3 and they would give us our keys, no need to wait in line if there was one. When we got back at 3 (after leaving our bags with the bell desk) the front desk said they were fixing a drip in the bathroom sink of our room but we could still check in if we didn't mind. We said that was fine so we went ahead to the room. We had booked room 2106 ahead of time after hearing that one had the best view for the price range. It faced Waikiki Beach and had an oversized lanai. So we get to the room and the guy fixing the sink was so nice! He gave us many tips on where to have dinner and also which buses to take to various spots. We enjoyed talking with him. Plus, he must have fixed the sink because we had no problems with it during our stay. The room was nice--two double beds, a pretty big bathroom with tub and shower, big vanity area and enough closet space in the hallway for two women to put all their clothes for 10 days! As for the rest of the hotel, as some other posts have mentioned--the pool needs some help as far as the bar goes. It was only open one time (the day we arrived--a Saturday) the whole time we were there. There are signs all over that no outside food or beverages are allowed in the pool area. Meaning if you want to eat or drink you have to buy it from the bar. Well that's hard to do when it's never open! I'm not sitting out in the heat without a beverage. So of course I was not the only one who brought water/soft drinks, etc out there anyway. Sorry but I'm not getting dehydrated. I did like all the umbrellas by the pool, some shade was nice. Beware--the pool doesn't get early morning sun due to the other buildings blocking the sun. Not sure what time it acutally gets sunny, as I was at the beach every morning as soon as I found that out. There were mainly kids in the pool every time I went to lay out in the sun so I didn't actually ever go in the pool. The rest of the hotel is nice--there's a bar that had live bands/singers, a gift shop with some food items, two clothing stores, a tour operator desk and on the 5th floor there was Sammy's, their restaurant. Can't comment on the food because we didn't go there at all. Attached to the back of the hotel is a Vietnamese restaurant (didnt eat there either) and outside the back door is Fatty's Chinese (nope, not there either). Also out the back door is a walkway that leads right to the International Market so that's really close. There is a parking ramp attached too. The room rate we got included free parking but I think it's normally $10 a day, which seems very reasonable compared to $25 at other hotels. I really have no complaints (except for the bar never being open) about this hotel and for sure would go back again. Try getting a high floor for a better view and less traffic noise (Kuhio Street is the front of the hotel facing away from the beach and is busy) The other side of the hotel faces Waikiki Beach-the higher up you are the better view you have (over the other hotels). 2106 was perfect.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR232051219", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kgfan1"}, {"Content": "BeWare We arrived at the Miramar on March 12th the previous 3 times we had stayed at the waikiki west, across the street, so we knew where it was and what it looked like. I had originally booked at waikiki west but they went totally smoke free (ya I know people, but I am not a critic of yours so dont be of me) so I called my travel agent and they found a room at the miramar for $110 more for the 10 days. I told them that i wasnt going to pay that and then get there and not have a smokin room. They put me on hold and when they came back they said I just talked to the hotel and you are guaranteed a smoking room, so we took it. On day of arrival was told that there were none left (this was monday) but come back wednesday and they would have one. Tuedsay mornign while walking by the desk saw the manager there so told him, he said go pack your bags and we will ahve a room for you. We were headed out so told him woul dbe back around 10. came back and was told the room wasnt ready, went back at 12 and was told the maid was cleaning now. So we went to the room to see what side of the building it was on, there was no one there. Went back at 1245 and the maid was making the bed, went to the front desk was told no ready yet, have a seat in the lobby. went to desk at 130 was told not ready yet, went to the desk at 200 was told not ready yet, went to the desk at 230 was told not ready yet at 300 wife went to the desk and was told it was ready a long time ago and that her husband had gotten the keys, I was sitting in the lobby when she told them that they said they thought that I had the keys a long time ago. needless to say half a day wasted. To top off all of this when we get to the room, (we were there for our 39th anniversary) there were two beds in the room not the king that we asked for and neither big enough for both of us so we spent our anniversary 10 days in separate beds. Other then that the maid service was wonderful and the hotel is clean, a little outdated but very clean and even had a bathtub, something we didnt have at waikiki west. The pool area is a joke, small pool and we went down there the first day and sat at the bar, had to pry the girl away from the tv set (watching her soaps) to get waited on and then when she went to make the pina colada she couldnt get either blender to work so she went into a shed and got a 3rd one and brought it out. didnt even bother to rinse it out just made the drink in it. We finished that drink and thought about another one but couldnt get her to wait on us, must have been a interesting part in the soap plus the bar closes at 5 pm Now to me that is a dumb time, most people go on tours and most tours get back to the hotel at 5 or 6 at night, but then the bar is closed.

It is a great location. Close to the beach, close to restauants, etc. We felt very safe walking around at night. No complaints there. A big selling point for many hotels in the area seems to be the International Marketplace. If you've ever been to Mexico or the and wandered throught their marketplaces full of cheap jewelry  junk then save yourself the some time and don't bother walking through here. Same junk - Different pile.Service was also great. Front desk staff were very friendly, the bellmen were terrific, they gave us directions booked us shuttles, etc. and the maintenance people reacted quickly to our needs.The trouble we had was the hotel itself. Our room was seriously out of date. Which I normally wouldn't mind because I didn't book 5 star so I didn't expect 5 star. But I did expect a comfortable stay which we did not get. I highly doubt that the washroom has ever been updated. Ours was in bad repair. Sink, tub, toilet, walls all very worn out and dirty looking (even though I think they technically were clean). Our toilet was broken when we arrived. After a 12 hour trip getting to Hawaii, the last thing I wanted to deal with was a broken toilet and a maintenance person in my room. And our nice clean white towels, well they were white but had someone else's hairs on them.Our bed was so old and worn out that we ended up with serious back issues over our 3 night stay. This from 2 people who have never had back problems. I thought long and hard about sleeping on the floor because it couldn't be any worse than the bed. The lobby, while clean, again very out of date. I was shocked at the scratched up and peeling paint on the lobby washroom doors. Everyone sees the lobby why would you not keep the lobby looking good? And the front entrance - well besides the prostitutes patrolling in front of the hotel it was okay. Why would the hotel not ask them to leave? They weren't in front of any of the other hotels in the area.I am not saying all the rooms are as outdated as ours as I understand the Miramar is upgrading their hotel rooms unfortunately we just got one of the old rooms. I'm sure many people have gotten the updated rooms and had a fabulous stay.We had also considered staying at the Ohana East or Ohana West. The price  amenaties were identical. And they were all within 1 or 2 block of each other - so they had the same great location.

Very handy when you've got a hire car. Note the car park entry  the hotel check in area are off the small side lane (left hand side when facing the hotel ) next to the hotel.We prefer to self -cater ( cost  food preference ) - this was easy to do with a good range of restaurants within 5 - 10 mins walking distance + a supermarket just over the road. There is a chilli's just over the road from the hotel; with your back to the hotel , there is an all you can eat buffet style restaurant on the opposite side of the road and 1 block to the right. There is a very good vietnamese restaurant approx 1 - 2 blocks to the left of the hotel on the oppsite side of the road.

I know this is a while ago, but I just discovered this site and would like to highly recommend this hotel. It is about a 2 block walk to Waikiki Beach. At that time they had an excellent hot breakfast included with the room each morning. The cost of the breakfast listed in the elevator was $12.95/person. The room was just over $100 U.S., so with the 2 of us staying there and breakfast being the price it was, an excellent stay for a great price. You could book any tours you wanted right in the hotel lobby and the tour buses picked up and dropped off right at the door. All you had to do was to be there on time for your pick up. In 4 days we saw Pearl Harbor (well worth going to), whale watching in a catamaran (we actually saw whales!), and to a luau. There was a better luau I think at the Cultural Centre and I think I would try that next time. The one we went to was quite a bus ride out of town and although the food was okay, the reports I heard from other travellers about the Cultural Centre were great.

The hotel is located adjacent to the International Market Place which is great for shopping and a quick bite. Restaurants, too numerous to count, are within a five minute walk. The Food Panty Grocery Store is located across the street and the Fun Factory Video Arcade, for the kids, is next door.The hotel provdes towels for use at the beach and pool. The beach is less than a block away. The pool was adequate for cooling off and has food and cocktail service.

My wife and I stayed at the miramar for 1 week and found it to be an excellent place to hang out, drop your stuff and go exploring. Or drop in and take a snooze. As this was my first time in Hawaii I wanted to see everything. The Aloha Tours operator located in the lobby was very helpful and planned our entire stay there. The hotel staff are very friendly and attentive. Rooms are always clean.The breakfast buffet is a great way to start the morning. The staff are courteous, food trays are always full and the restaurant is always kept clean. Good selection of food although I would recommend alternating what you eat or you could get tired of the food by the seventh day. After breakfast you can always grab a bite in the many restaurants located close by for lunch or dinner. There is also a denny's and fatty's chineese food located just off the lobby.The location is 'central' so you can really explore alot of different things while you walk along the different streets. The beach is very close by. Some other hotels charge huge just to be located 'on the beach' but the miramar is just half a block away! You can't beat that.We rented a car for a couple days and were allowed free parking as we were guests in the hotel. The lot attendents are very nice and patient. (we needed directions and they were very forthcoming on details)As we had a late flight coming back to Edmonton [11pm] we were given the option of a late checkout 6pm instead of having to checkout at the usual 11am for just $45 bucks. Gave us time to just sit around and relax before catching our flight back. From 6pm we were allowed to check our luggage with the front desk for free.The only down side I can see is that the rooms are smaller. You have room to move around but it isn't huge.

Our flight left late so we requested an 6PM late check out and were only charged a marginal amount.The International Market is pretty much just outside the hotel if you like looking for souveniers and things like that.As for eating options, there is a Denny's downstairs, a breakfast buffet on the 5th level. But within a very short walk there are a ton of restaurant options from a Chili's across the street, to a nice American/Thai restaurant, Keoni by Keo's which is next door to the hotel. There are two Starbucks within 3 blocks of the hotel.Right across the street there is a good size grocery store where you can get drinks and food to stock up your refrigerator that is in the room which I did the first morning I was there.The hotel is a little outdated, but not dirty by any stretch of the imagination, we found everything functioning and clean.There is a parking garage that is in the hotel and they charge $10 a day for guests of the hotel with in and out privileges.Towels for the beach are available near the front desk for borrowing at no charge.Overall, we were quite happy with the hotel. It was a good value, clean, close to the beach hotel.On a side note, we had dinner at the Side Street Inn, 1225 Hopaka Street, it's a local bar/restaurant where a lot of the locals go.

We booked one deluxe room for 15 days and a superior room for 8 days after taking the word of the FunSun tour information regarding the quality of the Miramar being a superior rated hotel. Our deluxe rated room was very large with two double (not queen) as we'd been promised, a bathroom where the chain on the flush of the toilet kept disconecting, the sink faucet fell off in my hand and the shower only had hot water and the carpet was grubby. We changed to another room where we requested the dirty bedspreads be changed and were delighted to find the bathroom functioned properly. However in the deluxe rooms there are no tables and chairs and one's back gets very sore after days of nothing to sit on except the bed. Our Grandaughter's room was better at half the price. The staff was wonderful, friendly and very helpful. I can not say enough good about them. The hotel may not be 1st class but the staff certainly is. The tourist information centre was also excellent and very, very helpful.I did feel we were misled,when told by the travel agent, the Miramar was equal to the Radison Prince Kuhio. The differences (which did not include cost) were huge including no hot tub anywhere, a boring buffet breakfast serving canned peaches and no in house restaurant forcing guests to seek out a simple sandwich. We chose the Miramar thinking our Grandaughters would enjoy the Market which they certainly did, not realizing our own comfort would be lacking. I should add (for those of you who do not daily work out a a gym) the walk to the main part of the beach is hardly as easy on a crowded street as many seem to happily claim.

Today I went to the Hotel to check it out, went to several upper floors and concluded it was probably too outdated for me. Nevertheless, on the way out I stopped by the front desk to ask at what age did the senior rate begin. We were the only ones waiting in line. The two female receptionists were busy.

He curtly informed me the line started a few feet away from where we were standing and then walked away.A minute later he came back and said you had a question? I asked him what the rate for seniors was. He said $2.50 a minute. Didn't know what he was referring to. I explained I was talking about a room rate. He replied they had no senior room rates. I then explained I had seen a senior rate last night on the internet and was wondering what was the age for a person to be a senior. He said 65 - it sounded like a number he pulled off the top of his head. I asked him if he knew that for sure. He said no, and opened a 3-ring binder and then told me the age was 55.

We expected this to be in the 3 star range given what we paid for our package deal.We arrived on a 9am flight (10hrs in the air) and by the time we arrived at the Miramar it was around 11.30am and we felt pretty wrecked. We knew checkin was not until 3pm but we asked at the desk for something earlier and they obliged at 1.30pm which was hugely appreciated. We were given a room on the 11th floor which was a Deluxe room. 2 double beds and a balcony. We were facing back towards the airport direction and could see the ocean from our balcony if you looked left - not much of a view, but heck it was fine. We also overlooked the large pool area. The hotel is ideally located on Kuhio Ave - a main road but not that bad, just one block back from the beach and pretty much in the middle of everything. The room was clean and quiet. The bathroom was dated, but clean. There was an inroom safe (great feature) but not free - wonder why not - seems scroogy to charge $2 a day for it - better just to include it in the rate. There was a bar fridge and a 48cm TV with 30 odd channels. The reception/lobby was large and the staff were ok - not great, but this is not a 5 star, overpriced hotel. The rear of the lobby lead directly into the Intl Mkt Place which was just great. Security staff seemed to always be around so there were no undesirables anywhere. Over the road there is a Food Pantry which we found well priced - plenty of food  liquor to take back to the room. Sure you can get stuff cheaper out of Waikiki, but I can't imagine it would be much less. Take aways are everywhere, as are the dreaded ABC stores. The chinese in the lane downstairs was nice, just very basic! The Bus passes on Kuhio very often and can take you anywhere. The Aloha VIP Tour desk is just great - Brianne cannot help enough with v honest advice. The maids did a good job - the time they came to the room varied greatly which was sometimes incovenient when you wanted a quiet late afternoon in the room when they had not been past, whereas somedays they would come at say 10am. We didn't make use of the pool but it looked fine - a large deck area plus a bar. The rooms are airconditioned which is a must! In summary, we would stay there again without doubt.

Maybe Hilton was a little better class but for the price about 4X of the Miramar (and no breakfast) it wasn't a good move.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR366048728", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "arekVancouverBC"}, {"Content": "Excellent for families Our family (2 adults and 2 children under 8) has just returned home to Australia after spending a fabulous week at Waikiki staying at the Miramar. While the hotel is a little dated in its decor the rooms were very clean and comfortable and the bathrooms were spacious compared to some hotels. We felt that it was excellent value for money and right in the heart of the vibrant Waikiki area. We had quite a reasonable view from our lanai - a little of the beach but mostly of the city. It is worth eating at the international marketplace eatery (very near to the hotel) if you are looking for value meals and we loved the fact that we felt very safe walking around at night when many of the people come out to shop/dine or just wander like us. The public transport system was excellent and right at our door - TheBus - and it took us everywhere we wanted to go for under $5 a time! Our children loved the pool and we spent every afternoon out there. We also didn't feel crowded like you do at some of the larger hotels. For the kids I would give Waikiki beach a miss - it is narrow and drops away quickly which is not good for little kids. Instead head to Gray's Beach, Kuhio Beach or Ala Moana Beach - these all have lovely wide strips of sand beach with safer swimming for kids. All of these beaches are easily accessible to the hotel via walking or TheBus. Overall the service at the hotel was excellent. We found breakfast (full buffet breakfast - hot and cold) was a great way to start the day. If you needed extra bits and pieces during your stay the hotel lobby has a shop which has a range of things or there are plenty of cornerstores which may have what you need. We would certainly consider staying there again because of the value for money aspect with a family.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR850012181", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Students everywhere Miramar is crowded with students.

It was very clean. They clean the rooms very late in the day, so if you put your sign out that says Maid clean room Wiki Wiki its cleaned earlier than the others.The breakfast buffet is not managed by Miramar. However, we had no complaints there either.Our daughter loved swimming in the pool at the end of a beach day.The lobby has a shop where they will braid hair for $30 plus. So we did that at the end of the trip. Real cute.Having a fridg in the room really helps on the expense of money. So we ate in the buffet for breakfast, and packed lunches for the beach, and then ate out for dinner around town. Joes Burgers in the International Market makes very good, fresh, burgers, the Terriayaki with pineapple is really good. The Cheese Cake Factory was our favorite dinner out. Everything is $10 and up for dinners in Waikiki, however if you are on a strict budget, theres Jack In The Box down the street and they have 2 tacos for .99 cents.Also we rented a car for the entire week, I think we would just use the trolley cars to go where we wanted to next time and rent a car for one day to do the North Shore or go to Hanuama Bay which is out of the this world for snorkeling and seeing all the fish of Hawaii. You don't even have to snorkel just walk out on the sand and stand near the reefs and what you will see is unbelievable. We also went horse back riding on the beach at the Turtle Bay Resort at North Shore. It was alot of fun, and then went to find the shrimp vans for lunch. Expensive but very good eats.We packed our own beach towels and also bought the hawaii towels, which are good prices also. So we never checked out the towels they give you for the beach.Shopping for extras and or snacks: ABC Stores (on every corner), the EZ drug store across the street, and also the little store in the lobby wasn't too bad of prices either, especially for a little ice cream snack at 9 pm for our daughter, .99 cent cup of frozen ice cream compared to $5. in the ice cream places down the street. Also if you are a big Starbucks fan, not to worry they are all over the place also.Parking is $8. a day but oh well, compared to everything else that was good.We never used the safe and never had a problem with anything missing either.Our flight left Hawaii at 10:45 pm, so Miramar stored our luggage for us and we came back at 5 pm and picked it up and went to the airport early.I'm glad we did because most flights out are evening and the airport gets very packed. Long lines for inspection for plants, produce items ect and then you have to go thru the security. So we were way ahead of that crowd.Miramar was definitely worth the money even though its a 2 star we found it to be just perfect.

Stayed 4 nights at the Mirimar. Wanted the $99 room only internet special (see their web-site) but it was sold out, so opted for the $122 room including breakfast. We got a corner room, on the 14th floor with a partial ocean view. Nothing exciting - you could see the water, but the beach view was blocked by buildings and instead we had a great view of the parking lot.Breakfast as surprisingly good and convenient. The hotel caters to Asian clientele, and so breakfast includes white rice, rice soup and miso soup. Also salad with dressings, Hawaiian eggs, scrambled eggs, pancakes, potatoes, breakfast meats (varies by day - bacon, sausage links, sliced sausage). On the cold side (there are two spreads) were fruits (pineapple, pear, peaches, others I cant remember), baked goods (pastries, breads, croissants, muffins, etc) and there was a selection of drinks (milk, water, juices - orange, pineapple, passion fruit/orange/guava mix). I'm not a breakfast person, but I actually enjoyed going to breakfast each morning. And it saved money because we could eat a lighter lunch.They provide towels in the lobby that you can sign out and bring to the beach. A little raggedy, but acceptable. Waikiki Beach is more like 2 blocks away... If you exit from the front, you go around the corner and turn south. When you get to Kakakula (sp?) Street, you are only a few feet from the ocean, but you cant see it. You have to go around some buildings or through one of the hotels to get there. The International Marketplace is right next door. We ended up eating in the food court twice. Nothing great, but it was convenient. We bought a few trinkets there also, but basically its a tourist trap.There is a Chili's across from the hotel. A Denny's is attached (separate entrance) Also saw a Jack in the Box. One block away is Perry Smorgy's, a buffet place. There was a good writeup on it in one of the Info books, but the food only turned out to be so-so. Like so many places in Hawaii, the restaurant is open air... birds were flying around inside the restaurant. Kind of a turnoff for cityfolk like us. Also across from the hotel is a Food Panty, which is a supermarket, where we bought snacks, drinks, etc.Note that things in Hawaii are rather expensive - milk is $8 a gallon, ground beef is $5 lb, etc... it made many of the prices for prepared foods seem cheap by comparison. (And made the buffet seem like a good value - all you can drink milk! haha.)Overall, we had a good time in Oahu (will write a review on Polynesian Cultural Center later) and would recommend the Miramar as a good moderately priced place to stay. (If you dont want/need to be as close to the beach, there are other hotels you can find for less than $100 per night.) The service was good (asked for extra towels the first day, got them the rest of our stay, front desk was helpful with several questions, the Info desk gave good directions).", "Date": "May 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR449237610", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "roykirk1"}, {"Content": "what more do you need My best friend and I (2 girls in mid-thirties) went to Waikiki and stayed at the Miramar for the last week of April. Friendly staff, hot breakfast, beach towels, and located close to everything. The rooms were clean and had unexpectedly been upgraded to a partial ocean view. We booked through Companion Holidays and felt like it was the most hassle-free vacation as they took care of our hotel transfers too. Of course, we checked out Waikiki Beach which is only 2-3 minutes away - gotta find the beach access! But I highly suggest that you rent a car. We rented a jeep for 4 days so we could take our time to see the hotspots listed in Oahu Revealed - no we didn't leave anything in the car. Plus, it was fun just driving around aimlessly to see what it would be like to live there. Sigh... We absolutely loved the North Shore - make sure you jump off the rock at Waimea Beach or you'll regret it! We also had a blast at Duke's on Sunday night - fun times/fun people. Being located right next to the International Marketplace made it easy to shop for our friends. For some nitelife, there's Moose's, DawgHouse, and Bobby G's - if you like to dance. One thing to note... we had planned an itinerary of things to do - but we threw that out the window so we could just explore and relax. We knew we'd be back anyway so why rush things.

Check in time is not until 3.00pm and the flights from Australia arrive at 7.30am, so check the times of your travel as it may pay to have the additional night. The Miramar is very clean, the staff were very friendly and the lady at the travel desk very knowledgeable on the best tours to undertake. Would recommend taking the trip to the Big Island (Hawaii) to see the Volcano - lava was flowing). Would however not recommend that you use Island-Air. On the day we travelled after leaving at 5.30am there was a 6 hour delay and 2 airoplanes, scheduled for our return flight were cancelled while we were waiting on the return trip as they had mechanical problems. Out of 8 planes, 4 were out of action due to mechanical problems. Numerous people missed international flights because of this. Did not arrive back at the Miramar until 1.00am. A very long day, however the actual tour itself was great. According to staff at the airport, this is a regular occurance with this airline. Would recommend the Volcano trip but say you want to use Aloha or Hawaiin Airlines only! Alternative days use different airlines.Breakfast at the Miramar was included in package and there is a large choice within the buffet for all. Lovely pool, laundry facilities and helpful porters at the Miramar. Centrally located, next to International Markets with easy walk (one block) to beach and all facilities. We were expecting a mountain view room, but were pleasantly surprised to have a room with ocean views. Great King size bed, spacious room, only downside is that you have to pay $2.25 per day for the safe. Had read in previous reviews that rooms were very noisy. We were on the 14th floor, and yes you can hear the noise of Wakiki, but it sounds more like air conditioners than traffic. Actually lying in bed sound like the ocean in the distance, so not a bad sound.Plenty of restaurants and take away outlets to eat dinner. Had a lovely meal at the Top of Wakiki revolving restaurant and not too expensive. Views were great.We emailed the motel prior to our arrival, and managed to get an earlier checkin of 2.00pm. Check out is Mid-day so if flying out that night, once again check your travel times as it may pay to have the additional night.This trip to Hawaii was part of a package that included 5 nights in Fiji and 8 nights in Hawaii advertised regularly in Sunday Papers.

But here you are watching people come and go. it was fine.I would reccomend this hotel for people who want a decent place to stay and would like to save a bit of money on lodging.SummaryGreat breakfast Clean AffordableClose to the Action .....Tour pick up points", "Date": "Nov 9, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR988532673", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "What a Dump This is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in in my life.. i tried to be fair .. knowing that i had come from more opulant hotels during my trip.. even so, i had also stayed in moderate hotels so after 4 weeks of travelling to end it in this dive was a bit of a disappointment.. firstly there was a mix up with my room ..they had double booked and i ended up opening the door to see another couple in there (how embarrassing).. after struggling with 2 full bags up to the 10th floor ..

The most frustrating thing was the varying shower temperature, which was mentioned in several reviews. The shower could go from comfortable to freezing cold to searingly hot in a matter of seconds. The breakfast buffet was an excellent value, and the selections varied from day to day. One bad thing, though, was when my son found a cockroach in his oatmeal.

On two nights, the people next door to our room were noisy after midnight, but as soon as we called the front desk, the noise stopped. One tip for the parking garage-it is very tight. We had a minivan and had a very difficult time manuvering around the garage. Also, the parking garage is cash only-you can't add it to your hotel bill-be prepared for that.

I went with my boyfriend and some friends and we were all pleasantly surprised. Our trip was from the 5th to the 12th of August, which was definitely not enough time. The hotel was very nice and the staff were excellent. Our room was really nice and comfortable and the bathroom was pretty large considering the reviews that I have read, and there was also a lanai which we found real nice just to be able to wake up and walk outside to beautiful weather made our trip real pleasant or even at night we would sit out there and talk and admire the view that we had. There was also a tour desk right down stairs and we were able to book all of our outings there. Our only complaints were the water kept on getting hot and cold which was pretty annoying. We complained twice to the front desk and they said they would send maintanence right up, but it didn't help. So the fourth night on our way out we went to front desk to find out if there was anything that they could do for us, and the man was very nice and offered us a double upgrade to a higher floor (we were already on the 12th floor), so we were assigned to the 18th floor. We were pretty excited b ut when we got up there the room was exactly the same and almost the same view of the city/ water. So we decided it would be more convenient to just stay where we were. The breakfast was surprisingly good, the only thing is after a few days it starts to get repetitive. The location was great, we were across the street from a Chilis restaurant and a 24 hour grocery store which was nice. And outside our back door was the International Market which was cool except for the fact that if anyone has travelled to Waikiki they would agree that the IMP is not the cleanest of all places. I saw cockroaches which I am extremely afraid of, I am a California girl and we don't really have those.Another convenience was the bus and shuttle pickups were out front our hotel or directly across the street. If you are planning a trip to Waikiki this hotel is great for the cost. I was very pleased along with our friends. I really loved the hotel but I think that next time we go we will try a hotel maybe across the street on Kalakua instead of Kuhio Ave. But our hotel was worth the money we paid and the staff is great which makes the trip all the more fun..

The rooms were clean, with new carpet, and recent furnishings. All five of us agreed that the greatest benefit on our vaction was the location of the hotel. Please note that the room safe in one room would not work but rather than complain we simply stored things in the other room's safe. Charge for this is $2.50 per day when used.

It was an ok place to stay but I wouldn't go back. There is alot of constuction right now on Kuhio and the lobby of the Miramar is an open concept so you feel as if you are on the street when in the hotel. It's quite noisy so if you are looking for relaxation pick a hotel farther away. We were on the 17th floor and still heard some traffic, although the room was nice there were quite a few high school partiers on our floor. The hotel staff in the restaurant are nice but not the front desk ladies. They weren't friendly at all and didn't seem to want to help. We had requested a king size bed but received two doubles and when we called down to tell them this mistake, they said we would have to pay an upgrade and didn't try to make us satisfied at all. The sheets on the bed are strange as well, they don't use a fitted sheet on the bottom, they use a flat sheet. So every morning the sheets were completely off the bed and we were on the mattress. For the price of this hotel you should at least have a proper sleep in your room. We were also surprised to see that there wasn't anyone to assist in travel information, a big hotel like this should. They do have a huge section devoted to helping the Japanese tourists but aren't concerned with North Americans. The good thing about the Miramar is that it is close to everything but if you don't mind walking, stay somewhere else. A warning to any families thinking of staying here, Ka'iulani which is a block away is full of prostitutes at night, from Kuhio to Kalakaua avenue. It's where they all hang out so just take another route if you are walking around at night. The trolleys are fun and fast to take, two dollars per person which is the same for the bus. A tip: go early to Pearl Harbor, most of Oahu is there so you might not get to see the memorial if you go late. We had friends and family staying there as well therefore we had the chance to compare prices and rooms. The Royal Garden and the Parkshore are much better in terms of service and price, they are farther but it's worth it if you want a nice place to stay. The reviews really helped us in planning our trip so I hope this helps someone else, enjoy Oahu it's a fun place and go to Duke's Canie Club in the Outrigger hotel. Order the Tropical Itch!!!

My wife recently won a trip to Honolulu from a local radio station. The trip included airfare to and from Honolulu and accommodations at the Mirimar. I've been to Honolulu many times and have stayed at various hotels - mostly higher dollar as all trips are for business - and found that the Mirimar was just right for a leisurely trip. After all, why would you stay in your room all day anyway???Our arrival at the Mirimar was uneventful. As I was familiar with Honolulu, the trek from the airport in a rental car was easy as pie. The hotel is located on Kuhio Avenue and the parking garage, if needed, may be accessed from Kuhio as well by way of a small alley that is between the Oahu East and Mirimar hotels. If driving from the airport, it is best to make a left turn on to Seaside off of Kalakauna Avenue and then a right on to Kuhio. The alley way is on the right, just past the Mirimar and directly across Kuhio from Chili's restaurant. Parking is $8.00 a day with unlimited in-and-out privileges payable to the parking lot attendant either as a lump sum payment or on a daily basis.The hotel room was really not too bad and was comfortable and clean. Amenities included a mini-refrigerator, in-room safe, ironing board/iron, coffee maker and the almighty television. There was no charge for the use of these items with the exception of the in-room safe and television pay movies. I really disliked the fact that there was a charge for the safe (about 2.50 a day of use) as it should be a standard amenity for the guests protection. If you don't use it on a particular day, you don't get charged for that day though. That was they way it was explained to me.... And I never had the need to use it as all my valuable always stay with me at all times.Our room was on the 19th floor with a partial view of the ocean. It was not the greatest view as you had to lean out over the lanai (or balcony as we Texan's call it) just to get a good view of the water which, by the way, was also partially blocked by the Hyatt Regency Towers as well. But, I am not one to complain as the most time we spent in the room was at night and was at a time when we couldn't see the water anyway. My suggestion is not to spend the money on a partial ocean view room. It is not worth the extra money in my opinion as this category only gave us small partial ocean views and full views of the rooms in the adjacent hotels. But then again, if you are a little voyeuristic and have binoculars (I did) you can get a real eyeful sometimes.Friends of ours were a little discouraged upon arriving the hotel as there were several prostitutes on the sidewalks that surrounded the Oahu East, Sheraton and Mirimar hotels. This may give some travelers an idea that they are in a bad or unsafe location. This is not true. Kuhio Avenue, as does the rest of the surrounding area, gets a lot of foot traffic and there are always plenty of police officers around to keep you safe. Plus, the prostitutes were all friendly and did not make nuisances of themselves in anyway. I encourage you not to let their presence deter you from selecting this hotel. Shopping is ample in the area surrounding the hotel. The International Market is right next door and there are many different shops and stores along the Kalakauna Avenue. Plus, you will never be more than a few hundred feet from an ABC store as they are everywhere. These ABC stores carry just about every little convenience that you could ever want or need. Items range from over the counter medicine, beach items and clothing, souvenirs, beverages, food and the like. Trust me if you need it, they probably have it.Across from the Oahu East, which is right next door to the Mirimar, is a collection of shops called Kings Alley. It has several different unique shops including a local street artist's gallery on the top floor. Check out his show four nights a week in front of the shops right along the street. He does three shows a night which are at 7:30, 8:30 and 9:30. Basically, he is a spray paint artist that creates space-like scenes using layer upon layer of paint. The whole show culminates with his unmasking the painting and displaying a fantastic piece of work from what looked like only random paint strokes only minute before. Best of all... It's the show is free!!!Fast food and normal sit-down style restaurants are all over the surrounding area. Most of them are within a casual walking distance. Examples are Burger King, Subway, KFC (all in Kings Alley area), McDonald's, Baskin-Robins, Cold Stone, Cheesecake Factory, Wolfgang Puck's Express and Tiki's. These are only a few examples of the surrounding type of food finds and I apologize to any of the businesses I missed. Believe me, if there is a certain type of food that you want, the surrounding area has it. This includes a lot of Japanese/Sushi places as there are a lot of Japanese Tourists that flock to Honolulu too!Speaking of food. The hotel did offer a breakfast buffet. In comprised of salad, two types of scrambled eggs(plain and with ham), two types of hash browns, sausage or bacon, pancakes, rice or noodles, baked beans (at times ???), miso soup and various breakfast breads, fruits and juice. Believe me, if you want coffee here, you will get it in a flash!!! Do you want the beach? Well, this is not a beach side property and is a block off the beach. This is not a problem and should not discourage you! It is a casual 5 minute walk from hotel to beach and everyone in the surrounding area does it.The bottom line. I would not discourage anyone from stay at this hotel. As I said before, this was a prize from a local Dallas radio station. I therefore can not make any comparison price-wise to any other hotel. I do, however, rank the basics such as location and room cleanliness as average or above average. There is nothing that would discourage me from booking any future vacation stay in the Mirimar.", "Date": "May 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR136809299", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "'Bed' - lam!

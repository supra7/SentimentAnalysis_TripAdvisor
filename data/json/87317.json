The folks that stay here want peace and quiet with the sound of the waves breaking on the beach on Napili Bay all night. The condo had everything we needed. The bed was huge and all the appliances were in great shape. We really enjoyed the location and views of whales breeching between Napili Bay and Molokai. That was a thrill. The staff is friendly first and very professional. After a few days we felt like family. Scott, the General Manager, Mirissa, Alena and Shannon all are so guest oriented and friendly they could teach a course in hospitality. Mirissa makes the best corn bread on the BBQ on Friday morning coffee gatherings. Do not miss that. The maintenace crew is skilled and friendly too. They have a :\"can do\" attitude and if there is a problem they fix it immediately. We truly love the Napili Surf and the way we were treated as guests. This is a first class operation.

Our unit was a Garden Studio and extremely comfortable - very spacious for two people. The kitchen was so well equipped to the point of ridiculous - a full spice rack, a blender, a sieve - you name it!! There was a BBQ grill for the guests' use and we did this one night, because we found the nearby restaurants (with the exception of the Gazebo nextdoor, which doesn't serve dinner) to be of a poor quality and very over-priced. The unit was cleaned to a high standard every day and towels changed etc. The only downsides I can think of (for us) is that being in our late twenties we were the youngest guests by at least 40 years. We wanted somewhere quiet - we don't like obnoxious parties and lots of noise - but we just felt very conspicuous! However everyone was really friendly, so this wasn't a big problem at all. Another is that the laundry of linens seems to take place in a truck that parks right outside the units and powers the washers/driers with a diesel engine. Not great for the air quality in the immediate proximity, but it didn't really bother us because we were out during the day. This is not a criticism, just an NB: the pool and other maintenance begins at 6am. It is impossible not to hear it if you sleep with the windows open for the cooling breeze. But, Hawaii seems to be an early-to-rise, early-to-bed kind of place, so we just went with it and it didn't matter too much!

Our goal was relaxation and snorkelling and Napili bay offers both. A nice central area for checking out the bays on the west side of the island, walking distance to Kapalua and lovely views across the water as well. The unit we chose was a 2nd story studio that looked out toward the bay but is not considered oceanfront. The room was quite comfortable and offered everything we needed. It was nice to have a kitchen (all appliances were full sized) and we loved sitting on the lanai. One night there was a 'mai tai social' where we enjoyed complementary drinks with other guests as the sun was setting--we were somewhat surprised to find that many of the guests make the Napili Surf their vacation destination year after year. Everyone was so nice and you will likely find us here again....as one of the repeat visitors requesting the same perfect room.

The Napili Surf embodies the best of Hawaiian hospitality without the pretentiousness of a resort. Because of zoning laws prohibiting buildings \"taller than a palm tree\", Napili Bay continues to be an enclave of low rise old Hawaiian style condos on a beautiful bay offering great value for the money. Though we were in the \"garden units\" of the Pua Mala building, the beach was less than a two minute walk away (my husband timed it at under 90 seconds - he walks faster than I do) through meticulously maintained grounds. Staff, many of which have been there for a number of years (one housekeeper will retire next year after 39 years!) treat you as family. The complex is older but well maintained. Units are individually owned so each has its own character but all come with a fully equiped kitchen including diswasher. If you find that you need something that is not stocked in your unit housekeeping can ususally find it for you. The number of returning guests was quite impressive - the Napili Surf has become a family tradition for multiple generations of families with children and grandchildren returning year after year. You could tell that returning guests felt like the Surf was a home that they were coming back to. If you want a taste of real old Hawaiian hospitality without the pretensious of a large resort, if you like quiet and aren't looking for a lot of ammenities, if you want to just feel at home and relax in a beautiful and more laid back area of Maui I would highly recommend the Napili Surf Beach Resort.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFocused on relaxation\u201d", "Author": "exafrica", "ReviewID": "UR122004347", "Content": "We stayed in 127 and 228.

The friendly staff members and the scheduled events, (Fri.

We stayed over the 4th of July holiday and the resort hired a dance troup that put on a luau show that was superior to the one we had paid for in Lahaina! All of the quests furnished an individual side-dish and the resort provided prime rib, salmon and chicken that was cooked to perfection. After the show and dinner, everyone went down to the beach and watched all the kids put on their individual fireworks shows.

Like most of Maui, the area has experienced explosive growth since my last stay here, but the Napili Surf is so tucked away that one can almost ignore the impacts if one just stays on-site. The beach is more crowded, partly because of the massive but very attractive development on the north end, but also just because it is such a lovely bay and very popular for safe swimming and snorkeling. The studio unit was clean, well-equipped for cooking meals, and quite comfortable. Most of the guests were courteous, friendly, and honored the quiet hours (bless them!). But sounds do carry, and you can hear each and every conversation from guests that sit outside on their lanai in the evening and talk, especially if they talk loudly to begin with. Some guests seemed to think the rules do not apply to them, and they sat around the pool or on the front lawn talking on their cell phones. Maybe the \"no cell phones in common areas\" signs need to be bigger? One person who used his cell phone also turned his cell phone speaker on and played music. Come on! Go to the big resorts if you want to do stupid and rude stuff like that! But most folks were very respectful. This is not a party place; it is a quiet, reserved, get-away-from-it-all kind of place. I loved swimming with turtles near the rocky reach just below the resort. The water was refreshing and calm, so it was easy to swim safely. Someone drowned off of Black Rock while I was there, so I was doubly glad for a safe area. Kapaulua Bay is another safe, warm water spot just a few minutes up the road.

This time there were four of us and we stayed in an ocean front 1-bedroom unit, number 207. It's the upstairs front unit on the second building from the beach (Lehua). We think it's got the best view in the house, with two balconies on the NW side and a big lanai on the N side. It's right above the pool so at busy times of year (holidays, summer high season) there could be significant noise from kids, but the pool was virtually unused the ten days we were there. The units are well-maintained but the sofa bed mattress in our living area, where our grown kids slept, was in bad shape, lumpy and uncomfortable. That will probably be fixed soon. Also there is no dining table on the lanai, but the inside table has great ocean views. We thought there was too much furniture in the living room for four people, but that's just us. None of the units is large, but you aren't banging your shins on the furniture to get around, either. No bath tubs, only showers. Nice thick towels. No A/C, just ceiling fans, which works fine unless there is kona weather. Garden view units are significantly cheaper and the building that houses them has great landscaping and its own pool. It's only 100 yards to the beach from that building, so if you don't care about the view it's a very good deal. In the front buildings some people actually complain about the noise of the ocean keeping them awake. The waves can be seriously loud--we love it, but others may not. The clientele is mostly either older people (many Canadians, since the property was originally developed by Canadians) and young families. Not a place to party into the night, a place where the loudest thing you are likely to hear is the wave action on the beach. There's a coffee on Friday mornings and a Mai Tai party on Tuesday evenings. Two gas barbecues that get a lot of use and are cleaned every day. The gardeners even wipe off all the benches above the beach every morning so you don't get wet sitting there with your coffee watching the waves. The landscaping is really well cared for, and there are herbs growing you are free to pick. I've read a few reviews here complaining about the rules, which made me laugh. Different strokes....seems to me like the rules are all sensible and have to do with respecting your neighbors. Simple courtesies, really. Napili bay is usually great for swimming, unless there is a big north swell, and the snorkeling is good, too, lots of little reefs in the bay with plenty of fish and sea turtles, too. We could see the turtles coming up from inside our room. It's a five-minute walk to Kapalua beach. The Napili area is nice because there are no high-rises. If you are looking for low-key and laid back, I think it's the best area on the island. There are lots of family homes in the neighborhood, though fewer every time we go. We have stayed at the Napili Bay next door and the units feel dark and not well-ventilated there. Only louvered windows, no sliders, so you can't get a clear view of the ocean or anything else from inside. The lanais are small, too, and the railings are of wood so you can only see the ocean when standing, unless you are pretty tall. Napili Surf is a much better deal, more appealing overall.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cperfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "lindatVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR49363472", "Content": "great location, wonderful beach, nicely maintained property", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return!\u201d", "Author": "KLH", "ReviewID": "UR48191196", "Content": "I hesitate to review Napili Surf since it's been almost two years since our last stay but we are true Napili Surf addicts. I also hesitate to share this special gem of a resort. We missed our now-annual Christmas visit in 2008 but are counting the days till our return this December (our fifth Christmas at Napili Surf). We've probably stayed at Napili Surf 10 or more times and have sent family, friends, co-workers. This is a small, ocean-front resort that is well maintained with dedicated fans who appreciate the less glitzy, cozier resort style. Each unit is privately owned but professionally managed and cared for. Even if your unit is a garden unit (not ocean view), the manicured lawn and sandy beach-front provide ample area for chaise-lounge viewing of the beautiful ocean and Molokai--not to mention direct access to the swimmable, often boogey-boardable Napili Bay. You'll want a car but can also find dining choices within walking distance. Larger grocery stores are a short drive, as is resort-style life (Kaanapali) and shopping (Whaler's Village). Regarding previous posts that complain of: 1) No air conditioning: It's never been a problem for us. Maybe we've been lucky with weather and the unit locations we've chosen. We've stayed during April, August, September and December. 2) Musty unit: Never experienced musty and my nose is super sensitive. 3) Lumpy bed: All our beds have been comfortable. If you don't expect the luxury bed and bedding of a Westin resort, you'll be fine. Some units have queen beds, some have kings. If I found a bed not up to standards, I'd notify the office and they would, I believe, do everything within their power to fix the problem. The staff care. 4) Too many rules: Thank goodness for those rules as people seem to need them today! More and more people are traveling with children. Kids are noisy and like to play, scream and run. Some parents forget that not everyone appreciates the constant cuteness that comes with all that joyful kid noise. It also seems there's been a decline of common sense and common courtesy in our society. Just because I'm awake and enjoying myself at 11 pm or 7 am, I can't assume the people next door want the same. Just because you can't be away from your cell phone, doesn't mean I want to participate in your one-way (usually too loud) conversations next to my patio chair or lawn chaise. You might think it's fun to throw that football across the lawn over the heads of those of us relaxing, reading, sunning, but there's a huge sandy beach 50 feet away that is full of folks who would enjoy watching your talents. No need to even mention why no-smoking rules are needed. 5) Noise from adjacent units: The resort is small, patios surround two sides of the large lawn area. Voices and noise carry. Last spring I paid $600+ a night for a condo on the Big Island and I still had to participate in the vacation trials, tribulations and joys of other vacationers. These were large, up-scale units and the screaming kids, the cell phone conversations, etc. were more disruptive and frustrating there than at little Napili Surf. Sad to say, people can be just plain clueless and rude. 6) Landscape maintenance: Either the landscape is maintained or it isn't. It often requires workers using equipment. It's been our experience that equipment use has been fairly regular but minimal in duration at Napili Surf. We've experienced far more disruption at higher-end resorts and condo complexes. We brought our extended family to Napili Surf for Christmas 2007. The young marrieds who usually travel with Hyatt, Westin, etc., loved Napili Surf. All were pleased and look forward to returning December 2010. We hope Napili Surf will continue to post and enforce the rules that enable all of us to enjoy our well-deserved vacations. Frankly, we encourage management to be even a bit more dedicated to keeping Napili Surf the laid-back aloha spot we've enjoyed on so many visits.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIt doesn't get better than this\u201d", "Author": "jenn79", "ReviewID": "UR46241190", "Content": "When you're on Maui, you're probably looking for the best beaches.

We booked a late January vacation only six weeks prior to departure, checked out their website and started e-mailing them to inquire about availability and rates. They were terrific and always responded within one business day to all of our questions. On their website is a link to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Auntie Lanis Daily Deals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with sample rates and dates for the different room categories. We called and booked a garden view studio unit for seven nights; two days later we asked to extend the standing reservation one additional night and had no problem doing so. We sent our initial deposit by check (Napili Surf does NOT accept any credit cards) and were advised we could pay the balance of our charges by cash or check after we arrived. The office is only open Monday through Friday 8 AM to 5 PM HT; however they will make arrangements if you are arriving on a late flight so you can pick up your room keys after hours. We did just that and were pleasantly surprised with the personal touch given (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what we mean if you choose to stay). The keys are placed in an envelope along with a map of the resort highlighting the location of your room and where to park your vehicle. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re renting a car during your stay on Maui, I recommend you take a compact or smaller car since this is an older property with limited, closely spaced diagonal parking in most places. We arrived just before midnight Hawaii time (5 AM Eastern time, a marathon for us), picked up our keys and made a bee line for our room. It was at the end of the building furthest from the street (Napili Place, a sleepy dead end used by the public for beach access parking) next to the service door that housekeeping uses, which was no problem at all as they were very unobtrusive (thank you, Juanita and company for great friendly service!). No fresh cut pineapple and champagne waiting for us this time but a clean, comfortable, fully furnished unit was all we could ask for and more. My best guess is that the building we stayed in was constructed in the 1970s. Everything was in good working order, clean and paint was recent. Our unit was tastefully decorated with many wooden wall accents and prints. The refrigerator even had two trays of ice cubes ready for us; kitchens had a full set of dishes, cooking utensils, small appliances, dishwasher, in sink disposal and several mismatched containers for food and beverages. Hot water was REALLY hot. Most of the light fixtures have CFL bulbs to save energy; surprisingly our shower head did not seem to have a flow restrictor. Plumbing fixtures in the bathtub were rather dated and there was no tub stopper. Our unit had a fairly new LCD television with DVD player and cable. Free wired high speed internet access from Oceanic Time Warner Cable is there too, and the resort now has free wireless internet access as well. The next morning we were awakened about 6 AM by noisy birds outside our lanai; the units have no air conditioning or heat and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need either due to the climate... also, the louvered glass panes on both ends mean there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way to keep that bird noise out, but then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting the added bonus of being lulled to sleep by the rolling surf just a few yards away. Quiet time at the resort is 10 PM to 8 AM and respected by all guests; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to use your cell phone only from inside your room and not on the lanai. After eight o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock we went to the office to meet the staff, paid our balance in full and picked up our parking sticker. We took a walk around the grounds and marveled at the level of care this place receives; there is always work being done around here to keep the place neat. Each building also features an outdoor propane fueled grill and herb garden which is shared by all guests; we used the grill one time and it was SPOTLESS but took patience to ignite. Beach access is by two sets of stairs, with the east coast of Molokai just a few miles away in the beautiful view shed. There are on site laundry facilities available to guests in the building below the office 8 AM to 5 PM which consist of two top loading washers and four dryers, all coin operated (free powdered laundry soap is there too). Another thing that sets a place like Napili Surf apart from conventional hotels is that most guests are here for very long stays, sometimes two months or longer! You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get to meet the regulars at two socials scheduled weekly, a Mai Tai reception every Wednesday evening and a coffee social Friday mornings. The guests (mostly elderly couples or widowers, very few children) are friendly too and eager to get to know you as well as share their stories. Once you meet them and understand the big picture, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see why so many choose to return to this same place year after year. Repeat guests are given a 10% discount on future stays, which makes a more convincing argument to stop searching for a better place since we doubt we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find one more appealing.

It was absolutely perfect. We are in our early 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and wanted a quiet, clean condo and the Napili Surf fit the bill. We researched many places in south and west Maui: resorts, condos and VRBOs. We decided against resorts as we did not want to eat in restaurants for every meal, and be crowded in the pool area. Not so much a cost decision as much as we prefer our own breakfasts and lunches. We ate out most evenings. We chose the Napili Bay area because none of the buildings are higher than a coconut tree. We did not want high rise, or to have to walk through endless lobby and grounds to get to the beach. We chose the Surf based on the reviews of all the condos in Napili Bay. We chose the south end of the beach because we thought it would be the quietest. We were right. At the north end there were way more people. We also chose the Surf because we wanted a small pool (it has two nice little pools), and we wanted a grassy area where we could look over the ocean without sitting on the sand when we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to. We had Unit 207, a second floor one bedroom. As a corner unit, it was a bit more expensive than the other units ($272 a night), but well worth it. There were THREE lanais: one small one off the bedroom, so as we lay in bed we could look out to the ocean (that lanai had two chairs and table); one small lanai off the living area opposite the table so we could eat and see the ocean, (that lanai also had two chairs and table); and a larger lanai off the living area that looked over the bay with a love seat, coffee table and two chairs. The other units all had the usual one lanai with at least two chairs and table, but they all looked very comfortable. The three patio doors allowed the breezes to flow as did the ceiling fans (including the one in the bathroom). We certainly did not need AC, The unit was not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxurious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as in a resort, but it was spotless, well furnished and had everything that we needed. Kitchen with corian counter and bathroom with granite. Kitchen was very well equipped, blender, toaster oven, plus the usual stove, fridge and DW, and enough pots, pans and baking trays to cook thanksgiving dinner for eight, Kitchen supplied with dish detergent, dishwasher soap. Daily maid service was great with frequent bed linen changes and daily towel change. Laundry on premises with free soap. We needed help from the office staff on two occasions: once to fix a lamp and once to access our safe (we put in the wrong number!): the help was instantaneous and polite. The views from our ocean front unit were wonderful. Clear views to Napili Bay and the ocean. There were three spotless barbecues on the site. The garden view studio units were much cheaper, and although they did not have the view, the gardens were beautiful, and the area was very tranquil. Very easy access to the beach from there too. The ocean view studios were also cheaper, and directly fronted the ocean, set back by the beautiful grounds, so they would be a great deal. (I bet they would be classed as \"ocean front\" by some resorts!) There were two full time groundskeepers and one part time, and it really showed. TONS of beautiful flowers and birds. Every day the lawn chairs were wiped down and the sidewalks washed. The grounds were immaculate. There were always plenty of lawn chairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no need to bag your chair early here, and even a small sandy area fenced off from the public beach. Good choice of sun and shade in the grounds. The beach was very clean. It was a steep entry to the ocean which could be a bit difficult for little ones, but that also made for lots of fun in the waves. Just to the left of our complex was the start of the rock shore line. There were a few little areas there that would be perfect for toddlers learning about waves and the ocean. Sandy yet protected by the rocks from the big waves. We snorkeled in many areas of the island. The snorkeling in Napili Bay was quiet good on one day we went, and too murky the next day. On the good day we saw tons of fishes and four turtles. The turtles were so close I could easily have touched! The great thing about our unit was we went straight from the unit to the beach to snorkel, then back to the unit to shower. Perfect! (There were public showers on the beach, and two showers right inside the resort to wash off the sand, then straight up to our room for a warm shower). In response to the last review, there were a few kids there and they were made very welcome. There is a notice in each room to please not use cell phones in the public areas. I very much agree with this, we come on vacation to get away from such technology. ALso the whole resort is NON smoking - a pleasure.

No complaints whatsoever and we stayed in the quiet, 'garden' view side as the beach is only a few steps away. This was the best value for the money of any room we had in our 14 day trip. Our reservation was for 2 nights but plans changed at the last minute and the fellow at the front desk was SO kind to us and refunded our entire second night stay without a second thought. even without 24 hours notice. I felt he went above and beyond. The downside: a VERY touristy, mall and resort-oriented area of Maui. Also, i'm sure with each of the units being different (privately owned) there _might_ be a couple apallingly decorated rooms, but ours was lovely. Housekeeping is the same all over the complex so they will likely all be quite clean. TIP: the curvy road around to the airport (a dotted line on some maps) is GORGEOUS. we drove the Hana Highway too, but this totally compares. it is a slow trip as it's 1 lane and 5-15 mph for much of it, but is a wonderful drive.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita, KS", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "flygirl1224", "ReviewID": "UR5351868", "Content": "I enjoyed staying here.

The beach is very nice, and fun if you like to body surf. We stayed in unit 129 which was on the back corner of the garden view units. They had this little fountain that was really loud (like it was working to hard), that I'm sure you could only hear from this room and maybe the one above it. Parking is a little tight, but adequate. They do also offer beach towels and bamboo mats which were very handy. The pools were nice, and one is heated. On the last day we were there, they were starting some sort of upkeep project, and there was a tile saw blaring at 8:00 in the morning.

We absolutely loved it there. We stayed in unit 218 in the Lokelani building in a studio unit. It had a full kitchen, complete with dishwasher, dishes, etc. The view was amazing, the unit was spotlessly clean, and the staff helpful and accomodating. The grounds were immaculate! If you're looking for a large, ritzy resort, look elsewhere. If you're looking to relax, unwind and laze away the days at a gorgeous place on one of Maui's best beaches, then the Napili Surf is for you. It's small, quiet and totally relaxing. It's just steps away from Napili Bay, as well as several restaurants and shopping. They even had sand mats for our use, as well as grills and shufflboard. We didn't get to attend, but they also have mai tai parties and coffee and donuts some mornings. Also on the plus side, the resort is totally non smoking! Nothing worse than going out onto you lanai to enjoy the sunset, only to get smoked out by your neighbor's disgusting cigarette smoke. For me, that alone is reason enough to stay at Napili Surf. There was no a/c, but we didn't need it, even in August. We simply opened up the slider, turned on the overhead fan, and listened to the waves crashing as we went to sleep. The trade winds kept the place plenty cool, which was great. The last thing I want to do while in Hawaii is sit in a frigid, air conditioned room.

There are two pools, so you don't have to walk far to take a dip and the oceanfront units are actually on the oceanfront.

It was after the holidays and the kids were gone so it was quiet with mostly older (50+) couples and condo owners. We had an ocean view studio (Rm 216 in the Locilani Bldg ...see ------ ) which came with a kitchnette. One bedrooms are also available. We recommend this building with a room on the second floor, as it has direct ocean views and gets the full breeze off the ocean. Unless all the other rooms are full, we would not recommend the Garden view bldg. We saw whales and sea turtles the the small, but steep beach which was not crowded but great for snorkeling. The resort has a couple of barbeque mixers each week. As of May 2005 it will completely non-smoking. One thing - it has NO airconditioning so we picked up a $15 fan at Wal-Mart at Kahului before driving out and we needed it a couple of nights.

Having never been to Hawaii before, we did a lot of Web research before selecting Napili Surf. Napili Surf was true to its Web site and did not disappoint in any way. Positives: - Beautiful well-maintained grounds, clean and comfortable rooms, numerous lawn chairs for guests, two Weber grills for guests to prepare dinner, close to grocery shopping, Wednesday mai-tai party, gorgeous Sunsets, uncrowded beach, courteous staff. Negatives: - During our visit the beach was experiencing some severe and rapid erosion; the ocean was consuming it. I'm not sure if this was permanent or just due to the big waves during our visit. - Swimming in Napili Bay can be treacherous in the winter, when the big waves roll in. Some winter days can be extremely calm, too. While Napili Surf is not luxurious like the Ritz up the road, or Ka'anapli, it is a true beachfront Maui experience that lives up to its advertising, and therefore I believe warrants a rating of 'Excellent'. Indeed, I found Napili so beautiful that I proposed to my girlfriend on Napili Bay Beach. She said \"Yes\", and now we have wonderful memories of Napili Bay.

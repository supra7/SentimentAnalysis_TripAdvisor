The location is great with many restaurants nearby. The hotel seems to cater to the business community and in fact I was conducting a conference at the hotel is everything went smoothly. The front desk staff are very helpful. I do want to say a special thankyou to the front desk manager. My cell phone had fallen between the seats of my can and since it was dark I could not locate it. The front desk manager used this cell phone to call my cell phone several times while I loated it fromt he ringing. Thank you!! I received a room on the club lounge and again found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The sleeping room was fairly standard, with the bedding showing some wear. Even though I was near the ice machine, the room are quiet. I did find it odd that the room did not have a flat screen TV, but rather the old model. There are many elevators and getting to the higher floors is quick and easy. The food in the club is pretty standard for a Marriott. The intent is not to make this a meal. It does seem lately that that Marriott is cutting back in their food quality. Getting to the hotel is easy, just off the interstate.

The hotel was conveniently located fairly close to the airport and near to the area where I was working. They appeared to have an airport shuttle in operation, although I did not use it. I'm not sure if this comes complimentary, or if there's a fee involved. The lobby was clean and elegant, but seemed scaled down in size from other Marriott hotels I've visited. Check in was prompt and my room was clean and perfunctory. It was laid out in the same style you are used to at the Marriott.. Bathroom was spacious and off the front door of the entrance. Two double beds and a TV cabinet... And a small desk workspace and an armchair. I had the same problem with this room that I had at my last stay at another Marriott hotel. There were no visible electric outlets near the beds for charging up my phone overnight. One of the other members of our party experienced a problem when she got to her room. The room appeared to be guest-ready at a glance, but upon further inspection, she found a bar of soap out in the bathroom, some trash on the floor, and a used coffee cup in the trash can. I'm not sure what exactly happened but they switched her room promptly. Internet access is not free in this hotel -- neither in the guest rooms nor the lobby. Paid $9.95 for access until noon the next day but other packages were available. I can't blame this hotel for charging for Internet access; however, I am really looking forward to the day when hotels just include this in your nightly rate. A couple of the members of our party were shocked that this was extra and several of us weren't surprised at all. I'm not sure what hotel chains they are accustomed to staying in, but I find it more of a surprise when you aren't charged extra. I'm used to it, but it is kind of like charging you extra for towels at this point. Based on the area where I was working during my stay, this area didn't strike me as the best neighborhood in town.

Upon checking in, i was immediately recognized as being an elite member a few times and my room requests were confirmed and was placed in a 9th floor room. Service at the front desk was very friendly and cordial. As others have alluded in previous reviews, the location of the hotel may not be the greatest. Its right off the freeway and pretty close to a residential area, and I'll agree that it doesn't appear to be in the best of neighborhoods.. But then again, usually neighborhoods near airports aren't the best. It's maybe 5 minutes from the airport, so that was a plus. In hindsight, maybe I should have booked something in downtown as I did enjoy wandering around downtown and Beale street more. Downtown and Beale St does have it's share of panhandlers though.. I had no problems with the room I was in and it was clean. The bed was comfortable and I had requested extra pillows. As reviewers have noted, you can tell its an aging property and it's probably time for a refresh of the rooms and hallways. The tube tv has got to go!

When checking in, I asked the front desk personnel why the hotel had a \"security\" gate all the way around the property. The young lady behind the desk responded: \"don't all hotels have gates like that?\". The location reminded me of an area that was probably meant to be a bustling office park, but, never actually jumped off. It is kind of an oasis nearly off by itself, and surrounded otherwise by \"out of business\" buildings on the main road, and other non-descript retail outlets on Perkins Blvd. My room on the 8th floor was rather large and clean. Bathrooms had plenty of clean, fresh smelling towels and was clean. Bed was clean and very comfortable. Room was very quiet--I never heard anyone else. Since I'm a frequent traveller, I was given access to the Conceirge level. I made a drink for myself while in the lounge, but, was abruptly confronted by the attendant to fill out an honor bar form--as if I was stealing a drink!!! They should train attendants to be careful about things like that--I could have been very insulted by her actions. Otherwise, personnel was over-the-top friendly and personable. If for no other reason, I would stay again because I felt so welcomed. The decor of the entire hotel reminded me of Las Vegas--for a moment, I fooled myself into believing I was actually in Las Vegas! I guess I've been travelling too much! Kroger's was having a Job Fair and evidently some kind of regional meeting while I was in the hotel. That made the parking lot very crowded and difficult to park at times. I hope some people got jobs. It looks like many are out of work in Memphis, as is the situation everywhere. I did have compli breakfast, which was good (not great), and had lunch in the bar area one day--a salad which I found to be exceptional. This was my first or 2nd visit to Memphis. I booked the hotel in hast, just before dashing off to the airport. I thought I was booking the downtown hotel.

Its location and the gates make me feel safer. The office complex across the street has them too. The rooms are okay for the $129+ it'll cost you. The real features are the view from the top floor or from the roof. Can we say sunset cocktails on the roof? Also, there is a koi pond (read: super private aft 9pm xcept for the occasional bar smokers) off the lobby outside the bar. You may dine and take any meal out there from breakfast til 12am when room service closes. The bar here is excellent for lounging or relaxing and one will typically encounter other business people. The pool is awesome and also very private. This is a nice hotel for couples to be alone together. Also, if you are a rewards member, why are you not taking advantage of the concierge lounge on top floor? Flatscreen tvs, books, free food and premium liquor. FREE Breakfast, good food, upstairs! Also in the evening, the cocktail session in the lounge is awesome. Open til 10pm with premium drinks, hot appetizers, nuts, cheese, fruits, yogurts, waters, free soda. Hint:stuff you can take back to your room for free. You pay for it by repeatedly being their client. Also, ask for a VIP card so that you may go into the lounge even if you don't have a million points. If you ask that means you know and if you know they figure no harm giving it to you because obviously you've been before. If you get one keep it. As long as your not at one of the properties where the card gives you access to the entire floor you can still use it. Hop on the elevator, get off, pop it in the door and when it doesn't work watch whoever is working in there open if for you and say,\"sorry about your card, please do come in\".

I travel to Memphis frequently for work, so I've tried them all. For some reason, the full service hotels in Memphis are all older properties, badly in need of renovation. The Marriott East has scuffed-up walls, banged-up furniture, old fixtures and appliances, and cranky, noisy, leaky plumbing. This would be mitigated by a strong attempt to keep the place clean, but this is Memphis - poor customer service and slovenly housekeeping are the rule. I've become used to a routine of changing rooms upon arrival until finally being given one that is semi-tolerable. The Marriott rooms were shabby and not very clean, in addition to the afore-mentioned plumbing and appliance problems. When I checked in I was told that no rooms with King beds were available, despite my request (and Marriott Rewards status). I was given a room with two double beds. After all the room-changing, the least objectionable room was found. Only one of the beds had clean sheets - the other bed still had remnants of the last person who slept in it. There were spots of some kind of sticky goo embedded in the carpet throughout the room, and worst of all, while I was sitting at the desk reading email, a cockroach ran across my computer keyboard. Access to Internet services from the room cost $12.95. The hotel advertises both wired and wireless, but only the wireless worked. My computer reported a relatively low-strength signal in my room.

The front desk hospitality was lacking and they were unwilling to make any changes to our room. Apparently, they are not committed to give you the room that you request on the website. Inside the room, the kingsized bed was only a little bigger than a normal queensized bed, and the twinsized sofa sleeper was only big enough for one of our children. Therefore, my 10 year old son slept in the bed with my husband and me. In addition, the faucet in the bathroom leaked continuously. This was irrating at 2 in the morning after my son had kicked me in the back while we were sleeping. Another issue we had was with the swimming pool.

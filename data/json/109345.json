It is across the street from SMU and in the park cities. The staff was nice and the room was very clean. The shower was large and very relaxing. The only complaint I have is with the room upgrade. I wanted a room with balcony because I thought this would give me a great view of the school and the beautiful neighborhood that accompanies it. I paid a little extra to get this room. I arrived in the room and walked out onto the balcony. It was then I realized that I had a beautiful view of a park cities alley. On the other side of the alley was a wall of a very expensive daycare center. I went down to the lady at the front desk and asked for a room facing anything but the alley. She was not very optimistic about my moving rooms. I had the impression there would be additional fees for the transfer. It also sounded like the same type of room would not be available. I probably could have insisted and forced a room change but I did not pursue it any further. I walked around the hotel and saw that the only balconies faced the alley. I would have been better off not getting the upgrade. Needless to say I felt a little dooped. It is still a nice hotel.

As a building there is not much very unique about the property. Its an old Ramada Inn that has been redone as a Kimpton but it lacks the quirky edge of most other properties. Not to worry though, there is a major expansion and renovation underway that promises to spice things up to Kimpton. The king size room was comfortably appointed and spotless as I have come to expect from Kimpton. The bed frames had an awkward length to them that, upon comparing, notes with my companions, all of us Whacked our shins on and nearly tripped over. That too will be addressed in the remodel. I had a terrific room service dinner from the hotel's restaurant \"Social\" that was very good. They made some adjustments to the menu and delivered a very nice grilled salmon filet with steamed vegetables and a fruit bowl that was not on the menu. What makes this hotel worthy of mention is the exceptional level of service provided by Mikki at the front desk, Felipe who handles kind of a funky valet set up with aplomb and Laurie at the restaurant who went out of her way with dinner.

As we are familiar with Dallas (he went to college there), we have stayed at many different hotels with different price points. Lumen was one of the more expensive and worst overall experience. We were awakened before 8 a.m. Saturday morning (12/31) by work on the pool-banging, tile saws, men yelling to one another-within 20 feet of our dust-encrusted window. Our inquiries at the front desk along with other folks staying on that side of the building were met with the excuse that management did not know work would be going on and that they could do nothing about it. However, we were assured by management that no work would be done the following holiday and Sunday morning. We ended up purchasing ear plugs from the pharmacy down the street to get a little more sleep that morning due to the noise. After ringing in the new year that night with friends, being the old married couple we are we returned to Lumen at 12:30 to get a full night's sleep free of our two small children and mindful of our plan for reasonably early departure (10 a.m. or so) the next morning. Upon arriving at the hotel, we saw people lingering in the small lobby and outside the front doors. Upon entering, we were advised by other patrons that the key card system was \"down\" preventing anyone including management from accessing guest rooms. This sorry state of affairs lasted 3 hours with few updates as to progress in opening the doors as the manager was nowhere to be found and would only communicate cryptically thru a poor desk clerk. We got back into our room around 3 a.m., after standing around in the hallway waiting for one solitary gentleman tasked with checking IDs and letting patrons back in. We were promptly awakened New Year's Day at 8 a.m. by pool construction which we had been assured the day before by management would not be taking place. Again, management shrugged and indicated they had no control over the contractor doing the work.

The style was chic, trendy and modern as have been reported by others on TA. A nice change from the \"norm\" - despite the fact that my bias is for more \"traditional\". We stayed on the top floor of the hotel in a suite with a small kitchen. The dishes were limited but were enough for cereal and snacks. There was a full sized refridgerator which was nice for us since I don't recall the place having any breakfast. The room had two flat screen televisions, one in the main room and one in the bedroom. The room was comfortable overall. The shower was large and had a full glass wall. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet so we all slept well during a 4 night stay. There were some local places to eat within walking distance. A manager's reception took place on certain days we were there that included complementary wine and beer. I do recall getting complementary coffee in the morning but arrived shortly after the cut off time and was asked to pay. That was a disappointment. There was a trendy/modern bar on the bottom floor but it never seemed occupied by more than one or two couples during our stay (at least during our 8 am to 10 pm timeframe). The two things I didn't like about this hotel were the lack of a restaurant/food and the cost of valet parking. Granted the valet service was excellent but what do you expect when you car is literally within 50 yards of the door!?!? I didn't like being required to pay for this service but can understand this strategy given the lack of other revenue options for a small boutique hotel like this one.

Being adjacent to the pretty SMU campus and Park Cities neighborhoods is a real plus. I arrived too late and left too early to take advantage of its proximity to cool areas.

The staff, especially the afternoon front desk clerks and the valet, did a great job and were very courteous. The key to this hotel is its eye for detail, which includes pineapple infused water out front, the wine social (which I didn't have the chance to attend), a $10 minibar credit if you're a Kimpton InTouch member. I also have to give strong props to this hotel having an in-room DVD player rather than taking the typical approach of pay-per-view. With a redbox and blockbuster quite nearby, this is an excellent little perk for guests. The bed is extremely comfortable and I thought the room was thoughtfully and tastefully appointed. The only odd feature of the room was the lack of curtains separating the living room and bedroom, which obviously wasn't an issue for me as a solo traveler but might well be an issue for those traveling with a family. The other thing, which is a love/hate feature, is that the rooms and hallways are fairly dark. Regarding the restaurant, I had two dinners and a breakfast there and was quite pleased. It is not cheap, but a place I would go back to even if I wasn't iced in. The short ribs in particular were quite tender and tasty.

After listening to their music and loud talking for about 30 minutes, we decided to talk to the front desk. I was expecting the front desk to call their room and ask them to keep it down and that we would end up having to deal with their loud music for the rest of night. Instead, Michael, who was working at the front desk, immediately offered to upgrade us to a suite for the rest of our stay for free.

Keys were issued, and I'm not sure if she even smiled. It was wierd that our room was inside a Separate key-access lobby area. We had to key access one door to enter into a small foyer type area to find 4 doors, one of them being our hotel. Upon entering our room, my husband immediately said \"there's no windows!?\" That was surprising and wierd too. I've never experienced that in all my travels. I asked if it bothered him and we sat puzzled and thought it's not that big of deal.but by the time we checked out the next day, we felt as though we slept in a closet, like we were imprisioned. I never asked upon leaving because there was noone at the front desk again. I went back and looked at the travelocity website and there was only one style of room offered. Also, the bathroom was new and sleek but awkward. It was a sliding wooden door next to the bed, so basically it was part of the room- no privacy. The sink was a pedestal style but there was no shelf of any kind to put your blowdryer down, much less a makeup bag or room for even a shaving cream bottle. Once again, awkward and inconvienent.

We have booked another stay in January and I look forward to the comfortable beds and bed linens as well as the shower. \"Sister\" Kimpton Hotel, The Palomar, is also an excellent and slightly more upscale choice within easy walking distance to campus and shops.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice small hotel\u201d", "Author": "Grotshops", "ReviewID": "UR10922764", "Content": "The Lumen's best features are its location (directly across from SMU), the comfort of the rooms, and the presence of bigger-hotel amenities in a more intimate setting. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the showers are, as others have observed, a fantastic experience. Flat-screen, wall-mounted TV, free wi-fi and clock radios that are also i-pod docks are all a plus. The only minus in my room was the smallish work space - perhaps the larger rooms fare better in this regard. I wasn't put off at all by the seated reception clerk, and was greeted by name by the reception desk and the car valet throughout my brief stay. I didn't mind the valet parking either, and I did not have to wait more than a minute or so for my car. Perhaps if the hotel is very full it might be different. I did not have a chance to use the restaurant, but there is a free happy hour reception daily. I will certainly return to the Lumen when I have business in the Park Cities area of Dallas.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "kai13", "ReviewID": "UR10778800", "Content": "We decided to stay at Hotel Lumen because of is proximity to SMU.

I also chose Hotel Lumen due to it's close proximity to a friend's house. This hotel lived up to what I expect of a Kimpton property, smartly decorated, clean rooms and an attentive staff. My room was gigantic! I think I was mistakenly upgraded (a nice mistake!) to a junior suite, as my room had a separate seating area with its own flat screen tv and dvd player. The bathroom was huge. I really enjoyed the size of the shower. It could have accomodated at least four people. It's located across the street from SMU, so I imagine it caters to the students' parents. It's close to Highland Park shopping and about a 10 to 15 minute drive to downtown. Pricing (under $200) was actually a little less than what I expect to pay at a boutique property. Hotel Lumen is a nice change from the cookie cutter chains and you get a more personal touch.

We had a two-room suite both stays. The room decor and hotel decor are modern, and we found it attractive. The rooms were very clean. Valet parking is mandatory, and is $10 in addition to the room charge. But the cars are parked in the building and valet service was excellent. The two rooms were very nice and had a balcony with plenty of space to sit or walk around. The suite had a standard size refrigerator but no range. There may be a microwave, but I cannot remember at this point. No coffee maker is in the room. The staff is very friendly and courteous. We enjoyed the morning coffee and the evening wine hour in Social, the restaurant. Newspaper at your door are the Dallas paper or the NY Times. The rooms are a variety of shapes and sizes. The view to the street side toward SMU is very nice. The view to the rear is toward some homes and apartments and is okay but not as nice. You may want to call the hotel and discuss room types and locations in the building. Keep your eye on the rates. They change with demand. SMU is across the street. I made a reservation for one stay about 3 weeks in advance. By the time we checked in the rate on the website had dropped 15-20 percent, and the hotel gave the lower rate. If you are a member of the Kimpton plan, you can get a room upgrade at no charge if space is available.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Romanitc Getaway\u201d", "Author": "SH1234", "ReviewID": "UR8740576", "Content": "My fiance and I spent the weekend here - what a great stay!

There were lots of things to do nearby and the hotel staff was knowledgeable about local area dining and attractions. The rooms were well appointed, and the shower was great! The only issue we had with the room were finding small ants - it was a rainy summer in Dallas and I think the ants were just looking for dry ground. The DVD library was a nice touch - we spent one evening in the room watching movies, and the wine reception was a great way to meet others in the hotel and have a chance to visit.

The beds had pillow top mattresses and were VERY comfortable. It didn't feel like a hotel at all. The bathroom was quite spacious. The shower was huge and we had a lot of counter space around the sink. The only bad things were: some stains on the carpet in the bedroom and we weren't able to turn on the Tv and refrigerator without calling the front desk for help. Appartenly, to turn on the Tv you need to make sure that one of the switches by the door is turned on. It would have been nice to have that written somewhere by the Tv. Also, we called in for extra towels and it took two additional phone calls to get them to our room. Those were only minor problems and we loved our stay at the Hotel Lumen.

I liked how big it was, I liked the bed except the part where I found popcorn under the blanket. The room was warm and had a fridge and microwave as well as cable and free wifi which is nice. I did not like how dirty the carpet was, also had a pullout bed/sofa in my room and it was just disgustingly dirty. The tub in the restroom was rusty and cruddy as well but other than that I suppose it's a good place to rest your head for the night.

As you might expect from the name, that is it's best quality. The room was very basic, but comfortable. It had a fridge and microwave, which was nice. Unfortunately, even though we had a non-smoking room, the room smelled faintly like cigarettes. The entire hallway outside the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. The hotel stupidly interleaves smoking and non-smoking rooms right next door to each other, so there's no way to get a room far away from a smoking room. The staff was very nice though, and it has a pool and hot tub which seemed clean. The continental was breakfast was nothing: just coffee, Cheerios and milk.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Would Not Recommend!!\u201d", "Author": "unicorntk71", "ReviewID": "UR99292733", "Content": "This hotel was aweful, it stunk so bad, when we walked back in after dinner it spealt like someone was cooking cat urine in their chinese food!!

The hotel's exterior was pretty much as expected, the streets & carpark were clean if somewhat deserted. The lobby was clean as was the room. It even had a fridge which surprised me. It's not situated downtown but we needed to be close to the airport to pick up our rental car in the morning. We did struggle to find a place within ten minutes walk to have a bite to eat and ended up in Hooters! Oh well!.

The sheets on the bed were never washed or changed from seeing the stain. I did show the girl at the desk and she was shocked to. I had to change the sheets myself.

The manager was there and he said we wont find a better deal anywhere else so we decided to try it. Room had a cold fridge, microwave, coffee maker, I slept very well in a comfy firm bed. In the morning we went and had breakfast. They did have a nice variety of muffins and coffees. I was very impressed with the whole pool area with spa.

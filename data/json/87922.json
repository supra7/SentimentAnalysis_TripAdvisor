And of course, when you visit Orlando, you don't have time to bicker with management, you're on VACATION.!. Our stay was for 5 nights and we could have changed hotels but that takes time away from VACATION too. Just a few things that were a problem for us: *bath faucet fixture was from the '70s, very hard to adjust water temp. *The wall outlets were loose and some worked and some didn't *Advertised as onsite guest laundry-the true fact is-it's down the street *Ice machine never had ice in it-checked for it every day and still had to buy it at a local store--$2.50 per bag *TV had a green tint on every channel-tried to adjust but no hope for it *Bad wireless internet * We had 4 people in our room and everyday we had to get a 4th towel and washcloth from front desk--housekeeping collects 4-should leave 4 *Bed mattresses are very bad-maybe 8 inches thick at most This is the worst problem I had for the week and I've seen other comments on this in other reviews. I went to the front desk about the nasty carpet in the room. Our two kids had just showered and were waiting around. Within 10 minutes, we noticed their feet looked black as coal. The front desk said they could shampoo the carpets that day but the floors would still be wet when we came back. PLZ,PLZ. This is not a problem that just arose, they know this establishment needs attention. Shame on us for staying the full length of stay at this place. I know you get what you pay for, but with the ammenities and the reviews I found while looking around the internet, they talk a good game.

We got a two bedroom suite with a full kitchen for six nights. It had a queen size hide-a-bed in the living room. We paid $488 with taxes for the entire week. The pool is huge and is open til 11pm. There is a laundry mat right next door to do laundry. Parking is not right on street and there is security. Our maid was wonderful and honest!!!! The drive to Disney and Universal is about 20-25 minutes, but you get to see so much more of the town this way! Tips if you stay here: Breakfast hotel provides is packaged donuts, coffee, and fruit drinks. The suite kitchen comes with pots and pans, but no coffee maker or can opener, and bring an alarm clock because there are no clocks in the suite. All in all we had a wonderful stay here and look forward to doing it again in the future on our next trip to Orlando.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poole, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot that bad for such a low price\u201d", "Author": "jimihat", "ReviewID": "UR3619255", "Content": "Can't complain about this place, paid $21 per night!!!, nice clean motel, fairly basic but had TV with HBO and free local calls, ample free parking etc. The location is a little far away if you're planning to just hit the parks shops every day but we're only talking an easy 35 min (ish) drive to I-Drive so not the end of the world. The surrounding area is more residential than at the disney end of the 192. Good choice of chain eateries nearby, IHOP next door, the awesome Golden Corral is just a 2 min drive away.

Got into the room and it was filthy. The windows and locks on the doors were all broken. The bathroom was disgusting. It seems that many of the locals actually take up residence at this place. I found this out when they all began to party outside there rooms at a very late hour. It was not safe to walk around this place at night because there were many shady characters also walking around. The 1 security guard didn't seem to care at all. To top it all off, the maid stole money out of my bag on the last night of our stay. DO NOT STAY HERE! Trust me, pay the extra 5 or 10 dollars a night to stay closer to disney on 192.

Towels are thin and microscopic - the first day I opened a towel to find an (albeit freshly laundered) elastoplast inside, the second day it appeared to have a footprint ingrained on it. The floor was not particularly clean and the bathroom needed redecoration. The bath had had some sort of bathmat glued to the bath and had sealant at the edges, so we stuck to taking showers. The fridge was very noisy too and the room was fusty. Breakfast was just coffee (no milk, just creamer powder), juices and donuts. Staff were fine, but the owner needs to invest some more money on it.

I recently came back from a business trip, where I had to pay for my stay, so I made sure my stay was dirt cheap and clean. Having read the other posts about Sup 8 Kissimmee and going along on those reviews, I have to say they are ALL correct. This place is dirt cheap $55/night after taxes, and clean. If this is all that matters than this place is for you. No roaches, no dirty bathrooms, or any other horror stories. I was also very surprised how cold it got in the middle of the night, considering I was expecting warmer weather in FL, since I am from NY, and was very glad the heating system made my room 90 degrees in less than 5 minutes!!! No joke!!! A+++ Once again, if you don't want to spend alot of money on hotel, but dont want to be stuck in an uninhabitable dwelling, then Super 8 Kissimmee will certainly live up to its name for you. Oh, and two more pieces of advice, DON'T sign up for (---) because these people are VERY SHADY. The prices are the same if you purchase them directly through the airline, hotel, and car rentals. And DON'T mapquest this hotel. Call the hotel directly for directions because mapquest will take you to the wrong Super 8!!!", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chickasha, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cgreat deal\u201d", "Author": "Chicacherycola", "ReviewID": "UR2266587", "Content": "We spent the last of June there going to WDW. There were 3 adults and 2 children in the party and we desperately needed some extra space from the normal 2 bed hotel rooms. This was so perfect. The childen had one room while my husband and I took the other and grandma slept on the pull out in the living room. We had the full kitchen to our disposal, but never had the time to use it. Housekeeping came in every day so the only thing we had to clean was what little dishes we had used. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who has a big party.

The motel is on the main street in Kissammee. It offers a two bedroom suite/ apartment style. A full kitchen with a microwave, full fridge and stove top. (no oven) The buildings are somewhat dated, although there have been attempts at refurbishment with newer furniture and carpets. The walls, windows and closets are old. (check your windows on check-in to ensure they are secure) The screen was out on one window...and that drew my attention to the fact the locks aren't secure and the windows could open very easily. We were moved to another room closer to the main lobby and the windows there seemed to be better. The Motel itself seemed well looked after and on close inspection of the pool it appeared clean. The suite was not clean to my standards, but still would return because of the great prices and the welcoming, ever accomodating, very friendly staff. (I'm particular, but practical, therefore, on my arrival I would clean the suite to my standards and go from there) Added bonuses are the Free Disney World Shuttle and continental breakfast.", "Date": "November 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rutherford, NJ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value for a Very Big Suite!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1278229", "Content": "I recently took the family to Florida to visit Disney World and stayed at the Super 8 Motel.

They also had a continental breakfast in the mornings and shuttle to Disney. We did not take advantage of these, but did eat a few meals at the IHOP restaurant they have on property.

The hotel also has an IHOP restaurant on property which we ate at a few times and a very large swimming pool. The staff was very friendly and always guided us whenever we had questions or doubts about our holiday. The rate was surprising low, around $55, although I don't recall the exact price. We were able to obtain this rate by booking with thier website at abcsuites. We do plan to be in the area in March 2003 and will definitley stay here again. Also, they do have a shuttle bus to Disney theme parks, but we did not use it. It is about 10-12 miles from Disney, and we decided to drive ourselves, which was no problem, and gave us more freedom and flexibility.

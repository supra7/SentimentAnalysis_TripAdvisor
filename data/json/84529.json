Parking was free but almost impossible to get in and out, especially if you had to park in the basement. We had a small car and still had to strain. Housekeeping took our dirty wash cloths and didn't replace them with clean ones twice. Had to go to the front desk to get clean ones to shower the 1st time. The second time I refused to go and insisted that someone bring them up, waited nearly a half hour to get them. The front desk said they were too busy and couldn't leave. I had to threaten to contest the charge on the credit card to finally get someone to bring me a wash cloth so I could bathe. The room was VERY small. Also found a long dark hair that was hanging out of the corner of the shower. I left it there to see how many visits from the housekeeper before it was cleaned. It took 2 visits before it was cleaned. My friend and I have very short hair, so it definately wasn't ours. The Location is what keeps this place in business.

When you are looking at lodgings in this price range you don't want to compromise on a couple of things; cleanliness, location and bed bugs. The Rodeway Inn delivers on all of those things, plus you have pleasant staff, good tv and a nice little continental breakfast. Yes, it's not silver service, but when did you even get a free cup of coffee in another low end hotel? Keep perspective and you will be very happy with this little place. I would stay again. Also there is an big amazing health food shop across the street selling sushi, smoothies and all sorts till 11pm.

Around two a.m., someone decided to turn on their television, at a very loud level. We called the front desk, but no one answered the phone, after being told the desk was manned 24 hours a day. We went to the front desk, and the guy came to our room to hear the loud tv. He stated that he would go find which room it was emitting from and have them lower the volume. Around 15 minutes later, nothing had changed. I called the front desk again, but surprise, no answer. We ended up walking the hallway, and finally figuring out it was from the floor above, went and found the room, and called it ourselves. The woman who answered stated that it could not be her tv, but I told her what was playing, and she was shocked.

Although I'm not sure how large the other rooms are compared to mine that had a queen-sized bed, the hotel is fairly small and quaint. So if you'll be traveling with a family or a group of people who'll be staying in the same room with you--you may want to consider staying at other hotels in the LA area that are more spacious. Even if another person stays in the same room with you, it may feel a tad bit crowded at times. Overall, my hotel stay was great. I stayed in room 205--and it was very clean, cozy, and quaint which fit perfect for me since I was traveling alone. The room had a microwave and mini refrigerator, and the restroom was nice and spacious. The only issue I had, was that there are 3 entrances to the hotel (the main one facing Beverly Blvd., another on the backside of the property where the small parking lot is located, and a 3rd entrance on the side facing a side street). My trip was mainly business, but there were a few cocktail party events in the evening so 2 of the 3 nights I stayed there--I returned to my hotel after 1 a.m.. Each of those times that I returned to my hotel--the side entrance glass door was wide open and at no time was it ever even closed for the safety of guests. After I noticed this occurrence on the 2nd night I became a bit concerned because I figured that it was normal that the staff kept it open. Anyone off the street could just walk inside the building and do something bad to an unsuspecting hotel guest. Furthermore, there is no security guard on the premises. So in case your wondering, would I stay there again--NO--only because of this safety issue. Other than that, I would definitely stay there again because everything else was perfect.

Food was simple.....wrapped danishes, fruit, oatmeal packets, cereals, toast, bagels, milk, coffee, juice. Happy to have the food because we hadn't found a store yet.

The clerk behind the counter didn't seem to mind him there....kind of like he was a regular!

We hadn't booked anything in advance and we weren't aware of tripadvisor.com, so by chance we rode past this Inn and decided to stay here. It's not fancy at all, but that's to be expected for these prices. We had a \"suite\" with both of us having our own bedroom with TV and a bath in between. It was clean enough, no dirt or cockroaches to be seen. The bed was perfectly okay, not the best bed ever, but I slept well. It was really quiet in my room, but my friend got woken up by a Mexican women at 5 am who continued to talk loudly on the phone in Spanish for the next five hours. So yes, the walls are kinda thin, but again that's to be expected from a property in this price range. The location was good for our purpose. We went to Santa Monica, Hollywood, Berverly Hills and a concert at the El Rey (Mid-Wilshire region). The neighbourhood is safe as far as we could see. We (two 25 year-old guys) never felt threatened during our three night stay. And we even walked back from Sunset one night. Front desk was pleasant. They called a cab for us when we asked. We didn't use their breakfast. And then finally: THE GARAGE. It was perfectly fine, we always had a spot, although admittely we did travel in January, which is probably the least busiest month of the whole year. As for the entrance being difficult to manoeuvre, not if you have a regular car. The scratches are probably mostly from people driving SUVs in which case its their own fault for driving such ridiculously huge cars. Concluding, this hotel isn\u00c2\u00b4t that bad for the traveller who expects a clean bed at an okay location for a fine price.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt is, what it is...\u201d", "Author": "Lissete", "ReviewID": "UR7489379", "Content": "and what it is, is a low budget motel a la Motel 6 .

The whole place was tiny, cramped, claustrophobic, ill-kept and with staff who obviously wished they were somewhere else. I felt sorry for them. Parking is also tiny and cramped, but is under the hotel and free. The room is a couple of feet larger than a queen bed. The window opens to an alley and a building next door.

So, I had to go to Safeway and buy some Raid, and I took everything out of my bags, on the front stoop with a flashlight, and then I had to spray both of my bags with Raid and put my clothes in the washer! Needless to say, the cheaper price of the room is not worth bring home roaches. Also, the hotel has 30 some rooms, but the there are only about 12 spaces to park in their garage.

There was a fridge and microwave squeezed in the room though, along with reliable free wireless internet. The rooms did not, however, have irons and ironing boards (which I needed) so I asked the front desk and they lent me one to use that I had to return when I was done. There is apparently a complimentary continental breakfast offered but I never tried it. The front desk staff was generally courteous. After my first night in the tiny room I asked to change rooms on the pretense that I wanted one with a working phone (normally I wouldn't care and would just use my cell phone). The second room was much larger and actually felt like a real hotel room. Overall, the place had a bit of a run down feel, with a thin flimsy blanket on the bed with an occasional small hole, presumably from a cigarette. The place seemed reasonably clean (at least I didn't see any obvious danger signs such as cockroaches or anything like that). The walls and doors seemed thin but the place was quiet throughout my stay. The parking garage is quite narrow/small but I managed to drive in and out of it for several days without scraping up my car.

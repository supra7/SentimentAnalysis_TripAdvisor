I would recommend the higher floors if you want the view since all the rooms have balconies. The room was large and the bed was comfortable. You can see some of the age throughout the building but there is a renovation that is updating the hotel. I was a bit disappointed that they did not offer wifi in the rooms. It seems a little strange when cheaper motels offer free in room wifi but a large expensive hotel like this one does not. Hardline ethernet is available in the room and wifi is available downstairs in the common areas. I was disappointed with the breakfast as well. I have Hilton Honors and so I got my free continental breakfast. It was nothing great. I could have paid an extra $5.99 to get the hot buffet but that just wasn't appealing to myself. Once again there are plenty of hotels, including Hilton brand hotels that offer complimentry hot breakfast. Why it cannot be offered at the Hilton hotel I just don' t know. I had the military rate when I stayed at this hotel for it was a good value for myself. Along with the proximity to the airport since I had to fly out.

Hotel provides a shuttle to the airport which is just 10 minutes drive from the hotel. We still used a rent-a-car to drive to different places north of San Diego; parking space is a bit steep ($19 a night). The next day we returned the car and availed of the free shuttle service to the airport. On the day of departure, the shuttle driver did not show up, and the receptionist quickly offered a taxicab alternative - paid by the hotel. Service was commendable. We used the computer station to print boarding passes complimentary from hotel. Internet requires a fee, which we didn't need and didn't use. Restaurant onsite is available, but prices of meals are high; we opted to eat at Old Town and Gaslamp quarter. Lots of restaurants at GasLamp. Indian buffet for lunch was $9.99. Hotel room: Beds were comfortable, clean, spacious, had bathrobes in the closet, non-smoking, clean smell, with balcony and chairs. Even though the hotel is close to the airport, we hardly heard any noise from the planes when the door was shut. Hot shower is a treat - no problem with water pressure. Clean towels, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and shower cap are available. They provide coffee and tea. San Diego airport has a curfew for early flights. Planes fly past 6:30am. Airport opens at 5am.

It takes a few minutes to get to/from the hotel/airport, and the shuttle seems to run on-demand. Check in was nice and quick, but this was late evening so I'd have been surprised to have seen a queue. Room was nice and large (king bed with view across the bay to downtown San Diego). Rooms have a small balcony and a couple of chairs, and sitting outside during dawn/dusk is a bonus. Given the proximity to San Diego airport and a couple of military airfields, aircraft noise wasn't that noticeable - although this may be due to it being mainly larger commercial aircraft flying around rather than the military fighters/helicopters that are more abundant slightly further up the coast. Have to admit the bathroom didn't quite live up to the room, being very small and squeezed into the corner almost as if it was after-though. The position of the shower head also made showering a bit of a limbo dance - it couldn't have been more than 5ft above the bath so if you're taller than that (like i am) you spend a lot of time stooping to get your head under the water. Wired internet in the room had decent connectivity and could maintain a VPN without any issues although the lack of in-room wireless does tie you to sitting at the desk - which was an adequate size and had a comfortable chair. As others have said, you stump up $11 a day for this connection. In the business center, printing anything other than boarding passes costs you and if my experience of using them to print a pass is anything to go buy I'd have thought them unusable if you were paying for access to the word/excel/firefox applications. They were painfully slow and froze/crashed/rebooted such that something that should have taken a couple of minutes took more like 15mins. Breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant in okay, the cooked was in plentiful supply although the choice of fruit/cereals was more limited. Waiting staff could have been a bit more attentive and the 'seat yourself and help yourself' approach they seemed to have pretty much meant all they did was pour you a coffee and then vanish from the room for extended periods. Didn't have an evening meal there but the menu looked okay, there are a handful of other restaurants on the island, and you can walk from one end of the island to the other on walkways, so there are other options available - the Boathouse Restaurant on the next lot has a $9.99 lobster special on Wednesday, for example.

They had 4 -5 drinks on tap, Stone Brewing and one other one I can't remember. Parking cost $19 a day they also do shuttle to Gaslamp District (check hotel for hours) and to the airport.

Quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Be aware that this is an older hotel and will show some signs of age. The elevators were terribly slow and were pretty noisy. The rooms were a little aged compared to some of the newer designs, but still very clean and comfortable.

We were very happy with this price compared to other (albeit newer) hotels. Unless you can get it bundled in a package, you will have to pay for gated parking. Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This was our favorite part. The hotel is situated near the airport (we NEVER heard the planes though!) on a long, narrow \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcisland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. At one end is an excellent seafood restaurant (the Lighthouse) and the other end is a Sheraton (I think). In between are just a few yacht clubs and the Hilton right in the middle. It is very secluded and not touristy at all, so it was always quiet and peaceful. In front of the hotel was a narrow road, then a jogging path and then the bay. That said, this is not walking distance from any of the usual San Diego bay area attractions. It is about a 5 min drive to Coronado (across the bridge) and 1 min drive to Seaport village. Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The service at check-in was speedy and courteous. Nothing out of the ordinary, but still a pleasant experience.

The room itself was average; something I would expect to find in a Hilton hotel. Bed was good, room was quiet. Everything appeared clean. The bathroom tiles and tub were chipped slightly, but nothing excessive. Service was good. Melanie at the front desk was especially friendly and helpful.

The room was well-maintained although the common areas were clean, but a bit spartan. Getting a taxi into the city was difficult as the hotel is near the end of a dead-end street which meant that taxis did not frequent the street, and had to be dispatched to the hotel, which would take between 10-30 minutes. The restaurant was fine for breakfast, although it was a bit underwhelming. I had room-service one night which was similarly OK, and there is a restaurant at the end of the street (~10 minute walk) which was a very good seafood restaurant.

Everyone we encountered appeared to truly enjoy working there and it showed - 3 cheers for Hilton! Cons: Parking costs $17 per day extra. But parking costs extra for almost every hotel we looked at in the San Diego downtown area before we selected the Hilton Harbor Island. They charge your room for the per day charge which includes in and out privleges when you check in. We did not have a car, but our friends did so we asked for the parking. The staff immediately and without question removed the charges when we told them which days we did not use the parking. Free WiFi in the rooms would be a big plus.

I booked the room through Priceline and got a good rate for the king bed and harbor view room. Upon checking in at the front desk I inquired if a room on the top floor was available (for the enhanced view). While the clerk was checking on the availability I casually mentioned that my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The clerk informed me that a room was indeed available but it had a Jacuzzi whirlpool tub that normally goes for a higher rate. She said she would be happy to upgrade us to the new room at no charge - if we were interested. Needless to say we were very happy with that arrangement! After leaving our baggage in our room we left for dinner at a local harborside fish grotto. Upon returning to our room we discovered a bottle of champagne in an ice-filled bucket accompanied by two champagne flutes and a personally-composed card from Kie Horike and Fatima Sayre, the two employees manning the front desk, on behalf of the hotel staff congratulating us on our anniversary. What a kind and thoughtful gesture! Our room was attractively decorated in the modern style, had a new LG flat screen television and ample dresser space. The bathroom was commodious and well appointed as well with all the usual ammenities (hair dryer, soap, shampoo, etc.) An iron and ironing board were located in the wardrobe. The bed was large and comfortable and had 5 fluffy pillows. A writing desk with a broadband connection (not free) was located in one corner of the room. Ample stationary and writing implements were available as well. The view from the balcony afforded a 180 degree vista of downtown San Diego, the Coronado bridge, NAS North Island and Point Loma.

The pros of this hotel are its convenience to the airport and the friendliness of the staff. Also the view from my room was great.

My only complaint is that the hotel believed it necessary to charge me $17 to park when the lot was so empty both the entry and exit gates were in the up position. This hotel served its purpose in that it was very convenient to turning in the rental car and catching the flight home. The room was nice and we had a small open air balcony to take in a view of the sailboats and part of the bay.

We paid $219 per night through AAA....considerably higher than other people have reported. I am not sure why rates were so high ... maybe because it was a Tuesday night stay. I checked all over and it was the best I could find for that day. The shuttle service was WONDERFUL....we dropped off our rental car at the airport and they picked us up and brought us to the hotel. It was just as wonderful on the trip to the airport the next morning and saved us lots of time. The restaurant was good but fairly expensive. My husband and I had dinner and a glass of wine for $75. Suprisingly, the children's meal prices were very inexpensive (under $4.00). My daughter enjoyed the big saltwater fish tank sitting next to our booth. We had a non-smoking room with two double beds overlooking the water. The view was very nice and the beds were comfortable. The decor in the room was a bit dated and the bathtub needed to be re-grouted. It was very clean, but smelled like someone had been smoking in there previously. In general, it was a nice hotel, and I would have been happy if I had paid less than $175 per night to stay there. There was a nice business center but it cost .49 per minute to use the internet, so I passed. I was dissapointed that it was not complimentary. There was a coffee maker in the room but they were pretty stingy with the sweetener and creamer. The hotel worked out great for us because of the shuttle and the proximity to the airport, so we were happy with that aspect of our stay.

We loved being able to sit on the balcony and enjoy the breeze and watch the boats and navy ships. Parking is easy with the lot being right outside the side entrance.

We stayed at the Hilton San Diego/Harbour Island and loved every minute of it. The hotel is centrally located which made it quite easy to get to all the destinations. After reviewing various tripadvisors for many hotels we settled on the Hilton. The hotel is very clean. The rooms all have balconies and each balcony offers the most gorgeous view of the harbour. The beds - while, what I can say, except they were more comfortable than home. The hotel staff were very accommodating and upon request we were moved to a king size bed with a pull out couch (2 adults and a child in a double bed just didn't work). I really only have two complaints - they should have queen size beds. (However, again the hotel did everything to accommodate us in a fast manner.) Second, there is a daily $15.00 parking charge (why not just include this in the hotel rate). We hadn't planned on having any meals in the restaurant although by day 3 or so we decided to give it a try. The meals were fabulous as we settled on the buffet breakfast. Excellent quality for the price and we should have had the breakfast right from day 1. Side notes: San Diego is a family oriented place to visit and this is why we chose it as our vacation spot. There is the Zoo which I highly recommend. The Animal Kingdom Park (good if you like lots of walking in the heat) (You don't really need both though). Sea World we never had a chance to visit. We did do a side day trip on our own to Tiajuana (that was different). Trolley - highly recommend this tour. You can get on and off at each destination. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the ship and submarine museums (this took my husband almost a day to do as there were so many to visit and so many interesting things to see) - the kids lasted about an hour and then we went to find shopping malls). Old Town - interesting. Made a fast stop to La Jolla - wow...wish we had more time to spend there. Coronado Island - Amazing Place (note, no beach chairs or surf boards for rent nor are their concession stands, the beach is just that - there were change rooms though). Last but not least, rent a car and drive the Pacific Coast Highway - awesome!

Yes, they have free wifi access to the internet, but it is the tragedy of the commons: It is open to the neighborhood, no password required, and so there is little to no reliable internet access for guests. It is quite obvious that the hotel's connection is shared by many within wireless reach. This is much more apparent in the evening, but it is true at all hours. I wish I could do without, but it is essential for business. I've written the management about this but it has not changed and now it is time to look elsewhere.

Had 2 rooms, one good sized one with a fridge and microwave and one smaller one. The smaller room with 2 queen sized beds is a bit tight to pass to get to the bathroom. The larger room was very comfortable. Most Manhattan hotels only allow 2 adults per room. We were 5 adults and the desk staff let that slide without charging me extra for the 5th adult. A tip of the hat to Ramada for that! The only negative thing I can think of are the bathrooms. 1- Bathroom doors are glass. If you are traveling with a frequent nighttime pee'er be prepared for lights on every 2 hours. If you like your privacy when doing your business you will find it hard when sharing a room cuz anyone that walks by can see you sitting on the pot. 2- No ventilation fan in bathroom. 6 beers, a steak, garlic crusted pizza, 4 eggs, black beans, tacos and a club sandwich with a mountain of coleslaw and no bathroom ventilation fan. Needless to say my roommates were not happy with me! Positive things: - This hotel is close to everything! Manhattan is only 17 miles wide and 30 miles long, every hotel is close to everything this one included. - It's in a great neighborhood with lots of good eats that aren't crazy prices. - There are tons and tons of shops just minutes from the hotel. - Rooms were very, very clean. - No bugs of any sort at all. - Early check in and late check out at no charge. We took advantage of the early check in. - Free luggage storage if you need it pre-check in or post check out. - And get this; FREE breakfast! Bagels, cream cheese, sweet cakes, donuts, toast, butter, coffee, tea, fresh fruit, cereals, waffles, boiled eggs, jam, peanut butter, milk, orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice and more. This easily saved us 50 to 60 dollars a day in food expense. Not to mention the time we saved by not having to go to a restaurant and wait to be served. - Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. - Elevators worked better then expected - Iron and ironing board were clean and functional. - Hotel safe was in working condition and large enough to accommodate a couple of 10 inch screen laptops. - Plenty of toilet paper, Kleenex, pens, pads, cups etc. - Plenty of towels, soap, shampoo etc. - Heating and AC was operational and effective. - Upholstery, bed covers and linens were clean and in excellent shape. - Carpeting clean and not worn. - Paint and pictures were clean and in very good shape (richly decorated too.) - Rooms are smoke detector equipped. - Furniture was all functional and in good shape, no visible dings, dents or major scratches. - Decent quality flat screen TV was functional. - All lamps and lighting were functional - Clock radio with alarm was functional. - All curtains, curtain rods and blinds were large enough and functional. - Door locks and peep hole were functional. - Fridge and microwave was spotless and functional. - Closet was large enough with a dozen hangers. - Free Wireless Internet access was operational at all times and easy to access. - Tempur-Pedic mattresses as advertised was in excellent condition. - Free calls anywhere in the USA (good to catch up with old friends!) Asides: The amount of retail in Manhattan is astounding. Exit the hotel walk west a few blocks and then head north or south and get your wallet ready because you really can shop till you drop in this city. The breakfast is available from 6:30 to 10:00. Don't show up at 9:50 and whine about there not being much left. A question that is often asked about hotels is: Did you feel safe and secure sleeping there with your kids and wife? The answer for this hotel is yes, absolutely. There were no strange noises and no lunatic party people. After a day and night of walking Manhattan every one in this hotel beds down and goes to sleep. Taxi stuff you need to know: Manhattan taxis do not have radios. If you call for a cab they will pick you up but they will charge you 3 to 5 times the price of flagging one down on the street. So a 12 dollar ride on the street can be 60 bucks if you call it in. The cabbies don't care how many people you are or what you are carrying. If you fit in the cab they will take you. Just be quick about getting in and don't complain that you are squished. Every taxi I rode in without exception needed front end work. Shocks, springs, tie rods, ball joints and tires. Thankfully their brakes all worked! If you're knowledgeable about cars some of the rides will make you want to tell the cabbie to pull over so you can check it. If you can't get a cab there are the car service guys driving some nice and some not so nice limos. They cost 30 to 100 percent more then a yellow cab but hey, you get to drive in a Lincoln Continental limo! Leather seats and air ride suspension! You feel like a million buck being chauffeured around Manhattan in one of those babies especially a newer one. Besides it's fun to do a least once to impress the kids and wife. Bargain with them and they will bargain back and always tell them that the price includes the tip. Don't be shy, certainly these drivers aren't! If you are nervous about getting into an unmarked car check their license plate on the back of the vehicle it will be marked T&LC under the plate number. This stands for the taxi and limousine commission. The driver will or should have his permit taped to the dashboard in plain site. I used these guys 3 times during my stay. Between 3 and 7 p.m. getting a taxi can be difficult. However because they are more expensive an independent limo is easier to come by during rush hour. Purely on a person note there is something special about barreling up 5th avenue in 60 mile an hour bursts in a limo with the windows open, dodging cars and obstacles like a scene out of a movie. That alone was worth the price of admission. Just tell him your late!

The location of this hotel is very close to the Empire State Building, and short walk (10 minutes?) away from the Broadway and 5th and all that jazz. The value of the hotel considering the location is great. It's not RIGHT in the middle of the action but it's not far away. There's also \"curry hill\" on your doorstep for those that like an Indian meal! Although very nice the curry we had didn't quite compare to those I'm used to in the UK. But certainly worth going if you need a curry! There's also a very nice Italian next door to hotel. The room we had was a good size for Manhattan, and as mentioned about the air con worked very well. The room was also clean and had the usual items in the bathroom; soaps and shower gel and shower caps etc...etc... There was no mini bar / fridge which was a small downside, but nothing major. The inclusive continental breakfast was very handy, and not common in New York, and was a good start to the day. The selection was good, boiled eggs, cereal, bread/toast, waffles, juice, yogurts, fresh fruit (be quick it goes fast) along with coffee and tea and all the jams and syrups you'd expect etc... no bacon, which would have made it perfect, but for free you can't complain about that. What I could complain about is the plates, cups and cutlery. The plates and cups were polysterene and the knifes and forks were plastic. While these are not brilliant to eat with the main issue was the amount of waste generated by this method. I am not sure what the reason was to use these items, presumably not having to replace broken items, so they aren't stolen, or not having to employ a dishwasher. Whatever the reason seeing the mound of waste in the bins every day did not sit very well with me. It left an increasingly bad taste in the mouth with each day. This is the major reason the hotel lost a point. Another point to mention about the breakfast is that the room is pretty small with not many tables for the size of the hotel. So at peak times you may have to wait for a table. We were lucky as when it was busy we managed to time it quite well and a table was leaving as we arrived, but I can imagine that you could easily have to wait a few minutes for a table. Apart from this I can't really think of any other issues. It's not luxury, but then in manhattan for the price, people really shouldn't expect it. I found the staff pleasant and helpful when asked anything, and the hotel looked clean and neat.

We occasionally got a good deal at a boutique hotel off-season, but those became available less and less and have evaporated entirely. I should add we are terrified of BEDBUGS!!! After reading some of the reviews here, we decided to give the Ramada Eastside a chance. Recently, we stayed there for our second time. We have booked a king room both times. The desk staff is friendly enough, although no one has ever offered to take our luggage for us and there is no doorman (that said, the outside doors are automatic, like at the supermarket!). But if someone needed assistance, I imagine they would be able to render it. Both times, the room has been scrupulously clean, and the bed very comfortable. I will mention they use tempurpedic beds, which I find sleep a little too warm, but lots of people like them. I always check the mattress and underneath (see bedbug phobia cited above), and everything is always spotless. The sheets are also good quality. For the price, room size is pretty good. Coffee makers in the room. Shower was fine as far as water pressure and temp. Plenty of clean towels. Free continental breakfast served 6:30-10AM (the usual suspects, --bagels, croissants, various muffiny things, hard-boiled eggs, Yoplait yogurt, bananas, apples, oranges, 3 kinds of cereal (all sugary). Unless you come early, there is no place to sit in the \"breakfast\" room, since I think there are 101 rooms and maybe seats for 30 people tops, if strangers sit at the same table (which never happened). On the second AM, we grabbed our stuff and juggled it back to our room. NY was having record-breaking heat last weekend, and we did find that the A/C was NOT up to the task. It helped, but set at coolest, the room was still warmer than we would have liked. Checkout was fast (almost never saw any sort of line at the front desk, despite the fact that there only ever seems to be one person there at a time). They happily locked up our bags for safe-keeping after check out so that we could spend the rest of the day in the city. Access to public transport, subway and bus, is nearby. We like this neighborhood, because it's quiet at night. It's easy to get up- or down-town, and you can't beat the price. Also, for those driving in, they have a deal with a lot a block or so away for $20/night. If that sounds like a lot, you haven't parked overnight in NYC lately.

I needed to make her stay as comfortable as possible so there were a few requirements that were essential. Top priority was a hotel in New York where you could smoke a cigarette in the room- they are LEGAL! - however majority of hotels would rather have you standing on the street and going up and down in the lift several times a day which is not really acceptable and would have spoilt the weekend. We hit the jackpot with this hotel as the room was clearly marked 'SMOKING' as requested. Next most important requirement was a bed that a) would not have bed bugs and b) would not give either of us a bad back. I have a Tempur mattress on my own bed and was amazed to see that this hotel advertized the same on their beds. When we got to the hotel I was even more amazed to see that not only was the mattress Tempur but the actual base of the bed was this VERY expensive brand. What a luxury - and completely comfortable and clean. I really don't think bed bugs can invade this solid foam mattress and we certainly didn't find any. The hotel is in a very nice area that is just far enough away from the centre to be quiet but not so far away as to be inconvenient. We easily walked to the Empire State Building to catch the Tour Bus - arranged with the front desk staff - and had a deli across the street and several restaurants close by. Duane Reed was just around the corner so I got my shopping list completed too - Dentyne Cinnamon gum, Lucky Charms, Fruity Loops, giant pots of enteric coated mini-aspirin (500! you can only buy 30 max in England! and not allowed multiple purchases), Crest 3D whitening strips and toothpaste, Band Aids in giant boxes and not assorted with all those silly sizes that you're never going to use!

So we all went up to the room that was available, and the front desk called us approximately 20 minutes later to say that other room was ready. The rooms were pretty nice for the price. They were fairly spacious with the usual amenities that any other hotel room would have. There was little counter space on the bathroom sink, but we were able to manage okay. Also, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the door to the bathroom is frosted glass and we could definitely see through it. I cannot imagine why anyone would want a bathroom door with a glass panel! One nice thing about the Ramada Eastside is that they offer a free continental breakfast each morning. This consisted of quite a few items such as bagels, a variety of donuts, fruit, cereals, yogurt, etc. I thought this was a very nice amenity for a New York hotel. The only true complaint I really have about this hotel is the lack of air conditioning in the elevators and hallways. We were there in the middle of summer in 100 degree weather and thought this was rather odd. Also, when housekeeping cleaned our room they would often turn off the air to our room, causing us to come home to a VERY hot and stuffy room after a long day of sightseeing. This seemed liked an absurd thing to do in the middle of summer! I guess this is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way of cutting costs and saving money, but it annoyed us. Overall, we had a good stay at the Ramada Eastside and would probably stay there again. I did tons of research on hotels before we left and this was one of the best hotels I could find for the price.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antalya, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly good!

This is a really good hotel to stay at when in New York, and hopefully my review of the most important things below will help anyone looking for a decently-priced hotel make a good decision. When I was looking at hotels, I really needed the place we stayed to have good amenities, medium-to-large sized rooms, be accessible to the subways, have internet access and have some kind of breakfast. In essence, I was looking for a mid-range hotel with thoughtful amenities. The Apple Core Hotel chain fit the bill for me and my family quite well. Pricing The prices are reasonable, ranging from $109/single person/queen sized bed/night to anywhere around $200. I kept watching their rates online, and was able to get the lowest prices. They offer a 10% AAA discount if you show your card when you check in. In NY, that was a great price, especially for how spacious the rooms are. Rooms We all had rooms with queen-sized beds. The rooms have been renovated over the last 6 months, and are contemporary in design (sage green, dark brown, oatmeal colors). There is enough room to walk around, and because of the high ceilings, you won't feel boxed in or claustorphobic. You won't have a ton of space, as this is NY, but you won't be cramped either. The beds are Tempur-pedic mattresses (aka memory foam), and comfortable. The linens are nice cotton, and while there aren't luxurious duvet covers, the blankets were warm. The fairly new pillows are standard foam ones. The room had a full bathroom, even though it was small, with a shower, tub, sink, toilet and hair dryer. There is plenty of drawer space, if you need to unpack for a longer trip (2 nightstands and a chest of 4 drawers). The closet was small, but there was an in-room safe, an iron and ironing board and luggage rack, so we had everything we needed. The rooms also had nice new flat screen TVs. The air conditioner worked great...we didn't need the heater as it was hot as hell in NYC...and the large window in the room gave a lot of light. Thankfully, there are blackout curtains! There was a desk and coffee maker in the room, too. Amenities We really liked the free WiFi and business center in the hotel. The Wifi is not super fast, and is shared by all guests in the hotel, so there are times when it will be really slow. Also, there aren't any ethernet ports in the rooms so you won't have the option of plugin in a cable. We were able to get email, but couldn't really watch the news or shows online on Amazon Video-on-Demand because the internet wasn't fast enough. There were plenty of brochures and maps for things to do in NY, if you need them, at the reception. The continental breakfast was basic, but good enough with mostly juices, milk, cereals, bagels, breads, English muffins, coffee, tea and boiled eggs. The breakfast items do run out by the last 1/2 hour of the breakfast time, so make sure to get there with enough time. If you miss it, there is the Brasil Coffee Shop attached to the hotel, where you can get a bigger variety of food. There is a fitness center, which we didn't use, and vending machines on the ground floor, that run out if the hotel is busy. The hotel also has a baggage check, so you can leave your luggage in their storeroom after you check out. Staff The staff was friendly at the hotel. Our best experiences were with Priya and Harry, but everyone was nice. The housekeeping folks are cool and do a great job. Neighborhood Murray Hill is a quieter part of NY. We didn't want to stay in the heart of Times Square, so this worked out to be a great location. We didn't hear the sirens or cabbies or crowds at night like you would in other parts of the city. Getting to the 4,5,6 subway lines was easy, as the 28th St & 34th St. stations are equidistance away, about 4 blocks. The neighborhood has some great Italian and Indian restaurants that are open late, and most of them can be found on 3rd Avenue or Lexington. Chinese Mirch, Lannam Vietnamese, and Turkish Kitchen were our favorites! Things to Know Overall, our stay at the hotel was really good. There are two quirks that I think anyone staying there should know about. One, there are two small elevators for the entire hotel. Guests and maintenance / housekeeping all use the same elevators. It can get pretty crazy around breakfast and check-out time in the morning, so plan for a wait. Also, ice machines are only on the 6th and 9th floors. If you get a room on either of those floors, definitely request ones away from them, as all guests who want ice at the hotel will come up there to get it, and you'll hear the ice machine working all night. Along with these quirks, there is one warning that I would give guests, simply because we experienced this. When you make your reservation, make sure that the credit card you will charge the room to is valid and is not in jeopardy of expiring. Our card expired -- which is obviously not the hotel's fault -- but because they authorize the charge for the first night of your stay to your card even before you arrive, you will need it to be valid. Since our's wasn't, the hotel didn't hold a room for us, and we didn't have a place to stay on 8/8 like we thought we did. We had a room booked for myself and my husband one night before the rest of our family joined us, and we felt like the hotel should have called us, since we'd booked multiple other rooms. We were in a bind since we didn't find out until we got there in the evening, after having flown from Los Angeles. We could have given them another credit card, no problem, but they had given our room away. Priya, who was on duty at the front desk, was helpful in trying to get us another room in the city, and she let us keep our bags in their bag check, but that was a hassle we didn't need that first evening. It could have been avoided very easily by a phone call. Luckily we found a place to stay, and everything worked out, but it was more expensive that we had budgeted for. So...word of warning, just be careful. Again, our stay was extremely comfortable and we would definitely stay again for a short trip.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery satisfied\u201d", "Author": "llbb2121", "ReviewID": "UR38024624", "Content": "We were very satisfied with our stay at this hotel.

There are a lot of nice Indian restaurants around (many of them completely vegetarian). We also tried many other types of restaurants nearby and were never disappointed. The hotel is on the green line of the subway (#6), which services a lot of museums and other tourist hotspots. Just walk around in all directions to get to know the neighborhood and you will eventually find what you are looking for. Free wireless that worked. The price was right. Now the bad side... I chose the hotel based on the reviews posted on the Trip Advisor website (the one with the mouse and the other with the cockroach were not posted then, otherwise I would not have booked with them!!!). Although efficient, the front desk staff are most unfriendly. They never greet you when you enter or exit the hotel. They just stare at you. We had a very small hotel room -- not ideal for working if you are there on business (a small desk was placed right next to the TV). There was a queen bed with very little space around for two people. It seemed quite clean, although I had an allergy to either the cleaning products or something else in the room. (Another guest was scratching uncontrollably in the elevator.) On some cleaning days, our room was cleaned to perfection. On others, they dropped clean towels and supplies in the bathroom, and did not bother doing the bed! We were there for ten days, and although I do not like wasting water on cleaning sheets excessively, I knew for sure that they did not change them until day 8 because I cut myself accidentally and got a blood spot on the sheets, which was there for an eternity! The bathroom smelled of pee when we got there, and the smell never disappeared. I don't think they clean the bathroom floors with disinfectant. For four days straight, our bathroom floor was never cleaned (the same hair was there -- and when it's so small, believe me, you notice). The remote control did not work. My husband went to the front desk to request new batteries. They sent the audio guy upstairs who showed up, I think, with the same remote. It worked while he tried it, and then it did not work again. I did not bother with it again. They encourage people to post good reviews on Trip Advisor, which I do not like very much. They should worry more about getting a supervisor to check the cleanliness of the rooms and about dealing with pest control. I did hear some suspicious noise one night. I will definitely not return, although I liked the location. The size of the room was not a big concern -- I was not expecting the Plaza for the price I paid --, but I do not tolerate uncleanliness and unwanted visitors.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, NC, USA", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "k8_raleigh", "ReviewID": "UR35951150", "Content": "My friend and I met up in NYC for a girls' weekend getaway. Initially, we were impressed by the size and cleanliness of the room. For an older building, it seemed to be quite well maintained and it was obvious that the rooms had been modernized. Still, it was nothing fancy but quite nice for the price. However, on our first evening, my friend found a cockroach in our coffee maker. Fortunately, we only saw and killed the one but where there's one cockroach, there are always many more. That was off-putting enough for us to keep all of our belongings zipped up in our suitcases for our entire stay. There was also a strange incident with some towels that were hanging in our closet. They were damp and left on hangers. Not sure why they were there, we left the closet door open one day so that the housekeeping staff would see the towels and change or remove them. However, the towels stayed there for our entire visit. The staff was competent. There weren't overly friendly or helpful but they weren't rude or unhelpful either. They served their function, nothing more or less and that was just fine with us. One slight annoyance with our check-out though. We contacted the front desk at approximately 11:15am (45 minutes before our departure) and asked them to call an airport limousine to pick us up at noon. Five minutes after our request, the front desk called our room and told us that our car had arrived, and to please come downstairs. It was a minor incident but irritating because we had to rush to finish packing and check ou of the hotel. On the plus side, we had booked a smoking room but were hoping that we could get a non-smoking room. The hotel wasn't able to accomodate us but the smoking room was was very clean and did not smell of smoke at all. If we didn't know that we were given a smoking room, we would not have been able to tell. Also, the beds were very comfortable. All in all, it was not the most enjoyable stay but it was by no means the worst. This hotel cost approximately $30/night less than any other hotel we could find of a comparable class/rating. We had originally reserved a room in another hotel which was brand new and I'm sure that we wouldn't have had the bug issues in the new hotel, but we decided to save a little money and go with this hotel. The problems weren't enough to put a damper on our visit, but it would have been much nicer to have a bug-free stay. It's an old building and I know there's only so much that one can really do to completely eliminate a cockroach infestation. This may be the reason why this hotel is available for a lower price than their competitors. We got exactly what we paid for. You need to consider your comfort level with cockroaches before booking with this hotel. If you're ok with them, then this hotel is a very good value. If they tend to gross you out, then it's worth the investment to book a more expensive hotel. Personally, I probably won't stay at this hotel again because of the cockroach issue.

The hotel is located two blocks from Line 6 of the Subway (28th and Lexington), which is quite convenient.

There is no ice at all in the breakfast room, so if you like iced tea like I do, I would encourage you to get an ice bucket and stop on the 6th of the 9th floor to get some ice before going downstairs.

They gave us a nice room but said we had to move to another room the next night because of remodeling. I asked why they didn't book us into the same room for the 4 nights, but the receptionist didn't know. She said the new room would be exactly like the first room. Well, it wasn't. It was about half the size and a smoking room. Since we specifically asked for non-smoking, we complained. They said it wasn't a smoking room (lie) and besides they didn't have any other rooms. I complained again and again and demanded to speak to the manager. He wasn't there and wouldn't be there for 2 days, so the receptionist didn't know what to do. I kept complaining and he finally offered to move us to a \"sister hotel\" near Times Square. He said it was far superior to the Ramada Eastside and that the new hotel would give us a big discount, half the price of the Ramada. Well, we looked it up online and the new hotel was 2 stars below the Ramada and the \"big discount\" was the regular price. In other words, it was a cheaper hotel, and in NYC that means lower quality in all ways. We asked him to lower the Ramada price because we didn't want to move again, and he agreed to do that. That night, our son urinated in his bed, and we asked Housekeeping to change the sheets. Well, they didn't put new sheets on the bed. When we got back and were ready to go to bed, we discovered this and asked for sheets. The hotel person came and didn't want to change the sheets himself, but I refused to do it, so he did it. The final experience was that we asked them to call us car service to take us to the airport. It turns out the car was unlicensed, had an open beer bottle in the back seat, and one of the seatbelts was broken. We went half a block and the driver demanded more money than the original flat fee. It seems the hotel receptionist pocketed ten dollars and didn't tell the car driver, who wanted an additional ten dollars from us. We demanded he take us back to the hotel and we caught a taxi.

It also passes Penn station, so I purchased a 7 day unlimited metro local bus/rail pass upon arrival for $24 and proceeded to get off at the Lexington St. stop. Buses run about every 10 minutes. Local metro transportation options are easy and the hotel has MTA maps and numerous brochures. The Murray Hill Deli @ Lexington and 34th is the best option for sandwiches/beverages/sundries etc. I Checked-in @ 8:45PM and presented my TripRewards card and Id, however when presented with the invoice, noticed that I was being charged at a higher than my AAA rate reserved through the website. I questioned why my rate had changed and she said because I hadn't showed my AAA membership card. I countered \"you never asked for it\", and showed my card (she made a photocopy) and reservation copy, at which point she changed the rate. During this process I noticed that they have a sign behind the desk about 8 feet high (I'm 6'3), stating that you must present AAA or other discount ID upon check-in to obtain that rate. Not a very classy methodology in my opinion. This is a charming, small, older renovated hotel, in the Murray Hill residential neighborhood, with about 10-15 rooms per floor. I reserved a double queen and was initially given room 1101. Unfortunately, after a few minutes I realized that the floor was wet for about 2 meters outside of the bath, and remembering another sign on the wall at check-in, regarding immediately reporting water leaks; I went straightly to the front desk and was promptly assigned to room 601. Both rooms are in the left back corner of the hotel with a view over some lower buildings and through the alley to the street, however very quiet. The room was small as always in NYC, and contained the two beds and a chair next to the one window. The Tempurpedic beds were comfortable, however I noticed the already occurring inward sag towards the middle with one. The bathroom is small and configured so that you have to close the door to sit on the toilet, which was a little annoying. However, there is a phone in the bathroom and the \"Arc\" shower curtain providing more space in the combo tub. I had some problems with the CATV and lost all channels for parts of one night and ESPN only another. The hotel free WiFI worked great and after once inputting the login/password (obtained from the desk) recognized me for the week. An open LinkSys network is also available. The room was clean and the service good. The hotel contains a small gym with solely 3 pieces of aerobic equipment. There is also a public gym located 2 blocks away. The continental breakfast is pretty good as they go, although they need to splurge for some new double toasters, as one has a sign saying \"don't use\" (one side works according to the attendant) and the other works intermittently. On my fourth day my room key no longer worked and I had to get another from the desk. The next day that key no longer worked and I got another from the desk. I immediately went to my room and that key also did not work. Subsequently, a hotel staff member escorted me to the room with a new one that did work.

The trick is to open the valve all the way and wait for the water to heat - it will be cold at first, but will be perfect in a couple of minutes. I'm not sure if every room is like this, but it's what I experienced in mine. The neighborhood is great - very residential.

For the price, you could do a lot worse than this solidly middle class hotel! This was a safe and comfortable place. And there were absolutely no bugs! Believe me, I checked this out thoroughly after being terrified by reading reviews after I'd booked the room. The only complaint I had was that the ceramic tiles in the bathroom need to be regrouted as the grout looks kind of stained as years go by, which is not a big deal, just not appealing to look at. There is nowhere to put anything in the bathroom--any little shelf would have been nice. I couldn't put anything on top of the toilet tank because it was slanted, and the little pedestal sink had no room to put anything down.

After looking at numerous websites and lots of reviews, I decided on the Ramada. We've never been to New York City before, so it was a bit of a shot in the dark, but overall I was very pleased. One note on price. After getting over the relative high price of all NYC hotels, after booking the Ramada the price quoted, despite listing 4 total people on the reservation, was the 'single' price. The actual price for four was about $30 more per night. Make sure you double check the rate based on the actual number of people in the room. The hotel location turned out to be nearly ideal. Transit to/from LaGuardia was fairly painless, even leaving on a Friday afternoon. The hotel sits at 30th and Lexington, about a 5 minute walk from the nearest subway, 10 minutes from the Empire State Building, 15 minutes from Macy's and 20-25 minutes from Times Square. The hotel neighborhood is relatively quiet, with a number of 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurants nearby. We actually had dinner on Christmas night, when we arrived, across the street in a Chinese noodel house (ala The Christmas Story) but our biggest surprise was the quaint Italian restaurant (Trattoria Belvedere) right next store (yellow awning in picture). Moderately priced with a cozy atmosphere, I'd definately recommend this place if you want something good and very close. Our dinner for four, including a bottle of wine, was just over $100...a real bargain for NYC. The hotel itself was about what I expected. The room was small, so with two queen size beds there wasn't much elbow room, but everything was clean and the bathroom looked to be recently renovated. Our room was on the 11th floor, facing opposite 30th street and we barely ever noticed street noise. Could even see the Empire State Building from our window. The free continental breakfast was above average. The dining room and food layout was very clean and well stocked, with an attendant available for any need. The food included donuts, bagels, yogurt, cereal, fruit, microwavable pancakes, and a full range of beverages. Definately a cost-conscious bonus not needing to purchase breakfast everyday. One comment on the coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker, but my wife was less than thrilled with the home brew, but there's a coffee house next door (see picture) so for a buck fifty, you're covered.

I have travelled the globe many times over, stayed in hotels around the world and definitely would count this among the few really great experiences I have had. Everyone tried to wow me! Off season prices with 5 star service - what more could one ask. I was pleasantly surprised at the Front Desk's prompt service - they even asked me which way I'd like to face - they had rooms facing North/South on the Avenue as well as street facing, non- smoking ofcourse, and I got a room high up facing the north of Manhattan - beautiful view. The rooms were delightful and sooooo clean - I couldn't find a speck of dust anywhere. The sheets were white and soft and smelled so wonderful after a long flight. When we asked for extra pillows, we were told they were in the closet-which they were. I had my two kids (one girl and one boy)with me and although we had a room with 2 queen beds, we all wanted our own beds, so they sent up a rollaway at a small fee to take care of that problem - all in a matter of minutes. We all drink tea and when we asked, the coffee in the room was promptly replaced with tea-bags. Breakfast was more than adequate - the kids were pampered by the attending lady who was more than gracious, going out of her way to get us whatever we needed. I needed a postcard mailed and the front desk took care of it right away-even though I had no stamps! With 2 growing kids jumping around New York, we constantly needed food, and although there are no microwaves or fridges in the rooms, the Manager invited us to use his fridge and the microwave in the B'fast room whenever we required-saved us quite a bit there. Besides which, my son's antibiotic was easily stored overnight in the fridge. This is what makes the difference - makes you feel at home so to speak. The next day, although we were checking out, we were able to store our luggage at no cost while we did the rounds of the sights-the front desk gave us some really useful tips-how to get up to the Empire State building viewing deck without waiting in line-can't beat that huh! When we left for JFK, we had a limo waiting at the same price as a yellow cab. Beats trying to flag a cab down at rush hour while you're glancing at your watch every 30 seconds.

When you go to Manhattan and pay those prices you expect a certain level of accommodation. Not a hotel better suited for some third world country. My apology for any third world county who has such a hotel. Ramada Inn - New York, New York is dirty, small and had an odor problem. As soon as you entered the hotel you are hit by wall of smell somewhere between musty and old gym locker. Our family stayed in this hotel for six days. We would have moved out within 30 minutes if could have found another room. For some reason most of surrounding hotels were booked. The lobby was small and dirty with furnishing showing their age. There were two small elevators so we had to split into two groups. My daughter got stuck between floors for almost an hour. This elevator continued to do this the entire time we were there so we avoid it. The other elevator was soooo slow. It was much faster to walk. Not sure they ever fixed it. Even now there may be some poor guest trapped. The hallway to our room had musty smell of mold. Although we had requested a non-smoking room our room had the odor of stale cigarettes and half cleaned ashtrays littered the room. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you how the bathroom smelled. The seat to the toilet was broken and if you did not sit just right you would slide right off the toilet onto the floor. Despite numerous requests over six days nothing was done. Bath tub was filthy (could tell by the pubic hair the previous occupant was a red head) and the drain control had a jagged piece of metal sticking out is side. The grout between the tiles had a nice coating of slimy blackish mildew. This is the only time I can remember on vacation going out to corner market and buying a bottle of bleach and scrubbing pad to clean the bathroom so we could use it. Very low water pressure and at best it was luke-warm. Tried to adjust the temperature and the faucet knob literally came off in my hand. Found major dust bunnies and debris of previous occupants in the space between the bed and the wall. There was no tv remote in the room. Called the front desk and got nothing but promises. Had to wait until the occupants of a nearby room checked out and why the made cleaned that room got their TV remote. When we checked into the room the lightbulb to the reading lamp was burned out, called down to request it be replace. Said it would be. After several days and several requests and no action we went out and bought our own lightbulb. The bedspreads on the beds were in terrible condition with a number of holes you could one or more fingers through. Then we get to the really fun part- meeting the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildlife. On our first night after checking in going out to dinner and getting ready for bed, we pull back the bedspread and blanket and watch a number of black dots scurry across the sheets- LARGE fat bedbugs. I even managed to capture one in an empty pill bottle. Took a picture of it for proof and I will post in the picture. I immediately called the front desk and they said they would take care of it. How they took care of it was to ignore the problem and continue to use the same sheets. The reason I know this is there was a stain on one of the sheets and it was the same sheet night after night. It not a very pleasant thing to have to strip off the sheets from your bed, take them out into the hallway and shake them vigorously to get rid of any wildlife. Were talking doing this for five nights in a row. Despite this the sheets felt itchy. Then we had the world famous game called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chase the cockroaches up the walls as you take a shower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too close or they might jump on you. New York Roaches are well known for being aggressive and nasty. See a race in progress in my pictures I have posted about this hotel Meeting the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildlife continued at it Complimentary Continental Breakfast. Bagels were stale, juice had an off taste, fresh fruit had some pieces beginning to rot, flies and nats buzzing around food. Got a great picture of one when he landed on our table. I think he is smiling. What do you think? See picture I have posted. The bananas were in such bad condition they should have been buried rather then served to human beings. All it took was one exposure and a resulting queasy stomach and during the rest of our stay we ate breakfast elsewhere. Among the Amenities offered were Computers with Internet access. Which was very true if you can find one that works or you can try and use a keyboard with most of the letters and number worn off. What the hotel does not tell you is that they do not provide printers. I found this out when I was in the process of trying to check in for my flight and wanted to print my boarding pass. I was informed at the front desk I would have to use the next door cybercafe. This meant you would have to pay by the minute to use the internet. I found out later from front desk that this was owned by the hotel. Nice way to earn a few extra buck from something that was suppose to be a free Amenities. Then we come to the management and staff of the hotel. By their actions and response to questions asked and various requests by guests, they seemed to look at us guests as some sort of ill smelling bottom feeding scum sucking creatures and they were deities who like Job in the bible was cursed with the affliction of having to put up with them. Not only were they not responsive or helpful, they were ant-responsive and anti-helpful going out of their way to make the guest feel small when they dared disturbed important activities of reading a newspaper, talking to their girlfriends on the phone or just staring out the window. While the price may seem right, the experience is not worth it. There are a lot better hotels than this in the area for about the same money. NYC is a fantastic place.

We stayed here for six nights. My husband and I wanted somewhere comfortable and clean and the Ramada was certainly both of these. The breakfast in the morning is good (and complimentary) and set us up for the day ahead. My only criticism is that I did not know what AAA meant (as I am from the UK) so the quote I got with Expedia when booking it was misleading. The AAA is a the american version of AA and apparently you get a discount only if you are a AAA member. I had a heated argument with the reception lady about this and she refused to give me the rate I had booked at as I did not have one of these AAA cards (my AA card was not good enough). I even showed her my email print out that I got sent by Expedia with my booking reference number on it, the hotel address, the dates of my stay and the rate i booked at but this was not evidence enough for the receptionist. After this shaky and disappointing start (and 45 mins of arguing with the receptionist and manager) I decided I wasn't going to let this blight the rest of my hols and conceded to paying $200 odd more than I had originally agreed to. OK, that I have had my rant, it was a good clean hotel. Free internet and good breakfast bar that was regularly topped up and kept clean.

Our hotel was on the 12th floor and had great views of Lexington Ave and the Chrysler Building. The room was a bit small and the bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom, which I thought was weird. There was also a ceiling to floor window in the bathroom, but instead of having curtains the window was painted over with paint. Yeah it doesn't make any sense? Also the water pressure was TERRIBLE! It would take 10 minutes to warm up and it was like showering under a leaky faucet. I would do as much washing in the sink I could before trying to get into the shower.

The move to this hotel was planned so that we could experience the Midtown area. The hotel is in a good location, where the streets are less busy than around Times Square. You're close to the subway and there are several cafe's and restaurants around the hotel. You are a short walk from the Murray Hill area, where you can sit in Madison Square Park, under the shadow of the flat-iron building. It's a nice area. The hotel was fine. Less formal than the Helmsley but I found it more comfortable and the price is more affordable too. We had clean towels every day and the room was cleaned/bed made etc every day. We stayed on the 6th floor, in a non-smoking room (as we had specified when booking through Expedia). The water pressure was fine in the en-suite bathroom, which was small but clean and well laid out. The bed was comfortable - not too soft, nor too hard. We didn't eat the complimentary breakfast - eating out in New York is so easy and affordable that we chose to skip the continental breakfasts and eat in one of the many eateries nearby. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful. We had trouble with the electronic key on a couple of occasions, but the staff at the front desk were quick to respond. My only other dealings with the staff happened when we would access our safety deposit box each day (a complimentary service). The room had an air-conditioning unit which worked fine but we still felt the room was too warm at night. We stayed over the memorial day weekend and found the weather outside to be very hot, so that probably explains the warm room. The air-conditioning *was* doing its job, it was obviously competing against some very warm weather.

The guy fiddled around with the toilet until it flushed. As for the shower handle, he looked at it and determined that a screw was missing. Not that he was going to expend any energy to fix it. More of an informational, \"That's why\" type of thing. Also later I was disappointed to find out that the fitness room was not open (renovation), the water pressure was just a trickle of lukewarm (at best) water, and worst of all, the heater just would not heat up the room at night to a comfortable level. it was not even that cold outside... but it was that cold inside too.

The m16 bus on 34th St. will take you straight to the Port Authority bus terminal. There's also a nice Mexican restaurant called La Cocina a block away on 3rd Avenue, and the hotel is surrounded by indian restaurants which we were too unadventurous to try. The downside was that it was hard to keep the room at a comfortable temperature. When the heat was on it got really hot, and when it was off it was too cold. The elevator was also a little slow and smelled strongly of cleaning products which wasn't that bad considering what it could have smelled like.

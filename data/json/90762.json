I came in a few minutes late to see that everything had already already been cleared minus the orange juice. The attendant was nowhere to be found. When she finally returned I acknowledged being a couple minutes late and politely asked if she could give me a yogurt. She rudely said no because she had already \"taken inventory\".

The room service menu also has a good selection of wine, also if you have kids. Issues with the room were there was a previous guests moldy food in the fridge, showing me that there was very little cleaning going on as it had been there a while. Also asked the front desk for some coffee packets for the comlimentary coffee machine, and it took two hours for them to arrive. The air conditioning sounded like a hammer on a frying pan every time it shut off, keeping me up all night. The shower was very nice, it had a large shower head and was powerful. The bedroom was large, and there was a lot of room to maneuver. Pay-Per-View movies were $5-$30, so make sure your kids aren't playing with the TV or you may have some unwanted charges on your bill.

Most of us, however, need to eat less anyway. Finally, I noticed a strange smell permeating through the hotel. It wasn't great, but it wasn't overwhelming either. My spouse, however, did not even notice a smell, so unless you're sensitive to smells, you probably wouldn't notice it either. As for the positives: the first is that the hotel, which is very close to MDW, offers a great park and fly deal for its guests. We got a rate of around $150/night and it included parking for the 9 days we were gone. I doubt we could find a hotel room & parking anywhere in the area for less. If I'm wrong, please email me and tell me so. In this case, however, I don't think I am. They have a shuttle to the airport that starts at 4am (its essentially 24 hours), that is complimentary. We used it to take the train into the city for dinner AND to the airport for our flight. Second, the room and hotel were pleasant enough and clean. Our room included a very comfortable king size bed and a big bathroom with a great shower. We found the hotel staff friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We didn't use the pool or exercise facility available, but both looked sufficient. We did use the business center, which has computers available for use, including printers to print out your boarding pass. Third, there is a Starbucks attached to the hotel. There is also a restaurant and bar. Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel. It's the perfect place to stay when you need a place the night before a flight. It, along with many other hotels, is very close to the airport.

At first, I was disappointed that we had to stay out at the airport but, in the end it worked out great. They have a free shuttle service which goes to Midway and back (a 5 minute trip) and you can catch the train from there to go downtown (about a 20 minute trip). The one time we did take a cab into town it cost us around $35. This was rather late at night so we didn't have to pay to sit in traffic. The hotel will call a cab service that has a flat rate if you are concerned about that though. The front desk service was very friendly, we always got a smile coming and going. We didn't make use of the restaurants except to order one room service breakfast. The food was nothing out of the ordinary but, the portions were pretty large (not typical of room service in my experience). The hotel has its own restaurant as well as a Starbucks inside and a TGI Friday's across the parking lot (which you can also order from). The pool is average and there is a small fitness facility with a few machines, it's fine for keeping in shape while on vacation. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the bathrooms especially were very spacious.

Free hotel shuttle from Midway is fast and convenient (check with the hotel before you go to find out where you meet the shuttle - I believe it was outside Door 2 on the baggage claim level). The shuttle services all the hotels in the Midway complex. All the hotels pretty much look alike on the outside in that complex. A TGI Fridays is in the center of them and will deliver to your room (I don't believe the hotel has its own room service food however - no menus in the room book for that). Starbucks is attached to the hotel. Dunkin Donuts is across the street. McDonald's is a short distance down the street. I've stayed in Marriotts that felt a bit more upscale, but this one was very clean and certainly above average for an airport hotel. I am a pretty light sleeper and did OK with the night plane noise from Midway. The train is nearby as well and you can hear brakes in the distance. I'd recommend asking to be placed in a room on the front side of the hotel if you think that noise will bother you - the trains and plane noise seemed to be more prominent on the back side. There is a lovely (but small) garden area on the back of the hotel. I have read some of the other comments here about this hotel and I agree with several about the front desk staff who could possibly benefit from additional training.

Why did we need to look up locations and operating hours, you ask? Because the employees we encountered were not knowledgeable, nor did they pretend to be interested in answering our questions or even making eye contact. They were incredibly busy with checkins and phone calls, yes, but they lacked a certain courtesy. I have encountered much \"busier\" employees who also took an interest in helping the customer.

I arrived at Midway airport and had to wait a bit for the shuttle (about 40 minutes) but then was quickly transported to the hotel. Upon check-in, I was greeted by a very friendly attendant who was able to give knowledgeable advice on activities, directions, and food. I went to my room and was moderately pleased with the functionality. I liked that the desk had a roll-out second tier in case I needed to spread out. I did not like how cramped I felt. I also did not like that I could clearly hear tv's from rooms on both sides of me. I had a view of the parking lot (not great). But the room itself was tastefully decorated, extremely clean, and richly furnished. The carpet and walls were spotless, the linens and chairs were clean, and the wood was a dark, rich wood. There was a small vestibule near the front door with a coffee maker area and microwave, but it was functionally useless as there was no spare counterspace and it was not near the desk or other counter area. The bathroom had marble and bold maroon colors on the walls. Amenities were from Bath and Body Works and were very nice. There was a tray with an ice bucket and glasses in the bathroom, as well as a useless hairdryer. I made use of the business center, restaurants and meeting rooms during my stay. The business center had three computers with free access and printing, but the printer/copiers were consistently out of paper. The center was very clean, however, and I liked that the computers automatically deleted all of your personal information everytime you exited an internet browser. The restaurant served very good food, but the service was incredibly slow each time. Once I waited to be seated and then had to wait literally 10 minutes before my order was taken. The next time I tried seating myself and waited the same amount of time. However, the food was delicious. There is also a Starbuck's in the lobby and a TGI Friday's onsite. Both the hotel restaurant and TGI Friday's will deliver food to your room, although both delivered cold food. The meeting rooms were also tasteful and served spectacular food. The rooms were large with chandeliers, supplied pads of paper, candy, coffee, etc. No tea, however. Just coffee. Regarding travel into the city, I was told cabfare would be over $35 into the downtown Loop area. I was suggested to take the free shuttle back to the airport and take the train in. The train fare was $2.25 each way, which is clearly much cheaper. While it took a few extra minutes, it was definitely a price-saving option. Luckily Midway is small and easy to navigate. A word of advice, ask the shuttle driver to drop you close to the train entrance. Otherwise, you'll end up in front of baggage claim with a much longer, more confusing walk. One last suggestion: Palermo's is a great Italian restaurant near the hotel. Ask the front desk and they should be able to give you directions. You'll find yourself surrounded by local Italians who worship the food and discover a small piece of little Italy. Amazing food and service. If you just ask the desk for suggestions, though, they probably won't mention it.

But the difference in nightly rate for most is small (less than $30) so decided on the Marriott. All the hotels have access to a shuttle service (every fifteen minutes) to Midway. Once at Midway it is easy to jump on the ORANGE line train that takes you downtown in about twenty minutes. For a two-day pass (unlimited travel) the tarif is $9 purchased in the Midway station. There is a lot of walking if the hotel-airport-train procedure is used - a person with mobility problems might consider staying downtown. The hotel room was modern, comfortable and quiet. Eating in the hotel consists of either room-service, or visiting the in-house restaurant (Dempsey's), or trying the in-house Starbucks.

Managed to get a winter special rate of 149.00+ tax and felt at that price this hotel offered good value. Positives: -Location-about a block off the magnificent mile, next to the John Hancock tower -Value-fair price for a decent room near the magnificent mile -Room-Comfortable-definitely in need of a refresh, but again the price was right -Refrigerator- I am always surprised when a hotel room does not have a refrigerator, but some do not. The Raffaello has them, at least in the suites and they had left some space for my own personal beverages as opposed to cramming it with items. Bonus, there was also a microwave, which is a rarity. -Mini Bar prices-I tend to stay away from the mini-bar and there is a Walgreens a block or 2 south on Michigan Ave; however, compared to most hotels I have stayed at the mini bar prices were reasonable. That being said, I purchased only 1 coke because I needed a caffeine kick and neglected to get any at the Walgreens Negatives: -Elevators-The hotel did not seem to be very full, so this was not a huge issue, but if it were, the elevators would definitely be a problem. The max accommodation is 4 people per elevator-2 people with bags and there are only 2 elevators. There were a few instances where we had to wait as the elevator was full. This was a minor annoyance as there seemed to be few guests. -Breakfast- Which I did not order. I have stayed at many hotels and the price for breakfast seemed totally unreasonable at 25.00 per person for what read on the menu as a pretty plain beverage, egg, bread and meat. -Bathroom-Pretty small and personally I am not a fan of the rain shower heads. As mentioned in other reviews the lack of a shower door leads to some pretty wet floors. I was happy that their was a small seating area just outside the bathroom for my wife to get ready at. All in all I was happy with the room for the price paid, at full price I may have been a little disappointed. If the room were a a little fresher, I probably would give this hotel 4 stars, but the seating, carpeting and furniture were definitely showing their age", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reggio Emilia, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "ITA_And_RE_a", "ReviewID": "UR124401863", "Content": "The hotel staff was very friendly - parking was very convenient and rooms were nice and clean.

We recently stayed there but only needed a \"base\" in Chicago as we only spent time sleeping there and to be honest that is pretty much all they have to offer. The rooms were very good, good size, clean, good condition, comfortable beds etc. The location was also very good - just one short block from Michigan Avenue and very close to all the shops. However, if you want room service the only thing they offer is from their onsite restaurant which is expensive and only available until 10.30pm. They do not offer any decent option for breakfast - you can order only room service which I presume they \"bring in\" from somewhere else and it is very expensive there is no restaurant offering breakfast onsite. They do have free coffee in the bar area (which is tiny) every morning, but if you like drinking very, very bad tasting coffee its great otherwise I do not advise anyone to try it. Everything you need service wise is done through the front desk which can be very frustrating as the hotel is not small room number wise, there are only ever 1-2 people on the front desk and you have to wait either by being put on hold from your hotel room or by lining up while they are dealing with other guests. If you need anything at night time, forget it, as I think there are only 2 members of staff on the premises one at reception and one at the door, both of which can only give basic help. There are no management onsite at night to actually help solve a problem. The day time reception staff are better and we found them helpful but good luck if you have a problem at night!!! In a time when many hotels offer free internet we found the prices very high and the system a pain in the butt as you have to ask for a new code every single day again from the front desk who are busy otherwise you can not access the net - the lobby offers free wifi but there is no privacy. They supposedly offer a business center that is unmanned and has very, very little to offer - so a waste of time in my opinion.

Unfortunately with this hotel, there was a conference in Chicago the weekend we were there on September 16 so there weren't a lot of hotel choices available when we booked our stay. We booked two rooms for two couples with the boutique hotel. Normally I enjoy staying at a boutique hotel because the hotel is not massive and the staff are friendly. However, this boutique hotel had some disappointments that we've not experienced previously. Pros: - The location is great if you desire to be near Michigan Avenue. It's literally a short walk to the magnificent mile so it's very convenient. - The price was less, especially for that location at the time. I also noticed they had a special on their website that was even better than what we paid. - The lobby area was clean as was both rooms. Cons: - The staff was not very friendly throughout our visit. From the moment we arrived, we received no help with the door nor our luggage. I will explain more about the staff below. - The elevators are very small so we had to wait for an elevator at times since they fit two people comfortably, especially if someone has luggage. - There wasn't any place to eat for breakfast at the hotel, not even a continental breakfast choice. - The lobby and bar area is also small so there is not a lot of seating available. - There were very intoxicated people who who entered the hotel and were not guests. I do not know if this is because of the location of the hotel or not but the doorman had to be notified by another guest who then went to \"find\" the intoxicated people. Had the doorman been at the door in the first place, maybe he would have seen them come into the hotel himself. - The fitness area was small and most of the equipment was broken, although there wasn't any signage on the equipment noting it was not working. - Our rental car was parked in their parking lot across the street and was damaged by another vehicle in the parking lot during our stay. The manager of the parking lot said they were not responsible even though an employee of the parking lot was aware of the damage. We were not able to reach a manager at the hotel when we checked-out because the person at the front desk said that a manager was not present (poor customer service). We were given a phone number in which to call the manager at another time.

The hotel is right next door to the John Hancock building and 2 blocks from the water. We arrived on July 21st, right in the middle of a nasty heatwave. The temperature was over 90 degrees and had been for several days. We walked into the lobby and immediately noticed how warm it was. The employee that checked us in told us that the A/C had been down since Monday and it was just fixed that morning and the hotel would be cooled down in a few hours. Annoyed but trying to keep positive, we get into our room and the A/C was on full blast, set to 50 degrees but the air coming out wasn't cold, wasn't even cool. We went out for about 4 hours and returned expecting coolness but Surprise! no change whatsoever. I talked to the same employee that checked us in and got a somewhat rude response. She said \"like I told you earlier, its going to take a few hours to cool down.\" At this point it had been about 12 hours since the A/C was \"fixed\". After a sweat-soaked night of tossing and turning, we went to the front desk and inquired again. Now we were told that the A/C has a new problem and should be fixed that day. This was Friday morning. Needless to say, we checked out on Monday and the A/C never worked the entire time we were there. I understand that things like this happen, but what boiled my blood was the fact that they lied to us every single day, telling us the A/C was going to be fixed that day. Also their indifference was annoying. They never apologized once and acted like it was no big deal. When it's 95 degrees with 90% humidity, it is a big deal! We asked to be compensated in some way for our inconvenience. We were told that since we booked and paid through Expedia, we had to worked with Expedia to get money back. So I called Expedia that night, they put me on hold and tried to call the hotel. The hotel hung up on them twice and then put them (and me) on hold for 45 minutes before I gave up. So we got nothing. If this hadn't happened, I would have given this hotel 2 thumbs up. But since they screwed us over so bad, I am not even going to tell you what was nice about this place.

The front desk is rude and doesn't get customer service and they barely speak english or understand how to deal with people. The room was big but that was about it. It was dark, dingy and was a half hearted attempt at a conversion with thermostats half hanging off the wall, no lights, etc. My daughter is allergice to feather pillows so called down to ask for FOAM and they send up feather pillows. I call down to complian and they finally send up the right ones but on one could have cared. Maybe they would have if I sued them after an allergic reaction. We travel all the time and am from Chicago and decided to try this place. Never again as there are far better in Chicago as there is little service and they could care less about trying to make it nice there. Place sucks and you can do far better. This is the first time I have ever posted and felt the need as besides a big room there was no other redeeming quality of the hotel.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201cNot Kid Friendly\u201d", "Author": "gray_goose007", "ReviewID": "UR112985204", "Content": "Me and my wife and 11 yr old daughter stayed at the Raffaello because we wanted to stay in a hotel that was in downtown chicago and close to everything, which this hotel was.

The doormen were extremely polite and helpful as were the concierge and front desk staff. Our room was very spacious and beautifully furnished with comfortable furniture. There were large, brand new flat screen televisions in the sitting area and bedroom. The king sized bed was brand new and was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom featured a wonderful rainfall style showerhead. The bathroom was a good size for a property in the heart of downtown. The suite was so large that I could sit in the large living room area with the tv on without disturbing my wife who was sleeping. It also featured a very nice mini fridge and bar as well as a nice writing table and very comfortable, full size sofa. Housekeeping made the room spotless each day. Also, on New Year's Day we asked for our room to be cleaned while we stepped out for breakfast. This request was gladly accomodated. Also, as we were eating breakfast my wife recalled that she had left her engagement ring and diamond watch on the table in the bedroom in a spot the maid would be sure to see. We were very relieved that the ring and watch hadn't been touched and that was a huge relief. What a wonderful way to ring in the New Year.

SImlply put, boutique hotels, being inately small, do not necessarily offer all of the facilities and services that one might find at larger hotels; however, for myself , this hotel was absolutely perfect! Far away from the \"maddening crowds\", boutique hotels such as the Rafaello offer the guest a totally different, but unique experience. The check-in processs was seamless ... and while I would admit the elevator may be small, it serves the purpose well. The hotel itself provides the services of a knowledgeable concierge and a small bar, both of which are available at times when needed the most. And for those who need cocktails before 5pm, there are many options in the surrounding neighborhood.. The rooms are beautifully appointed rooms,and include microwave and refrigerators. And, unlike many renovated older buildings, the Raffaelo actually has indiviual thermostat controlled accommodations, a most welcome option in the 70+ weather! . Bathrooms are on the small side but the rain shower is luxurious. Really? Does anyone really need a huge bathroom?

Quite simply, this hotel doesn't come close to 4 star standards. I have stayed at dozens of 4 and 5 star hotels, and even 3 star hotels, and I'm not sure this one even merits 3 stars. And I'm not the type that nags after every trip, on the contrary I usually am quite happy. The issues we faced: - Bad water pressure in the shower. Even after they claimed to \"fix it\". What's worse than a lousy shower on a trip? - Sticky spots on the rug. Really gross. Again, they claimed they sent someone to \"take care of it\" while we were out. No change. - Lousy elevators. Obviously this place used to be residential at some point, and the 2 small elevators don't cut it. We came and went at all times of day and this was a constant problem. Wait awhile, and then the elevator arrives, completely full. We took the stairs many times. And no, I don't need the exercise. - Internet. I'm sorry, but it's a really cheesy to charge $10 for the internet when you are paying over 300 bucks a night. Especially if it's not even wireless. You might as well charge me for electricity. I know many hotels do this, but the better ones have started to realize travelers can't stand it. To be fair, when I complained, they waived the charge. - Chipped paint on door and in room. Sure, do I really care? But really, if you want to be 4 stars, you need to look like it. - No soap in the room. Until we called housekeeping. Really? All in all, a big disappointment. In the interest of saying something nice, the staff was nice (while pretending to take care of our problems), and the beds were really comfortable.

Then she was all ears, but I was done talking at that point. Room service is DISGUSTING and OVER PRICED!! I will spend a lot of money for good food, a fortune for great food ;) I would have rather eaten at McDonald's, and I am not a fan of theirs. I have twin boys, so we ordered a lot of room service. They got orders wrong, over cooked or under cooked almost everything. The bread was soggy on the sandwiches, a $28 plate of chicken had the texture of rubbery boiled chicken with those fake sear marks with a jar gravy. The plates were inconsistent. The best thing I found on the menu was the fruit plate. Sometimes it came with a grapefruit sometimes it didn't. The potato side with the lamb had almost paste like mashed potatoes with it the next time a chopped up potato gravy spoon molded mess. You get the picture. Ahhhh, and this part just makes me laugh. On an EXTREMELY limited menu. I reluctantly settled on bacon and eggs (comes with a side of unseasoned red potatoes). No condiments ever come with any meal, so I make sure to request tabasco and ketchup with the meal. I am informed that since it is a sophisticated italian restaurant, the \"chef\" refuses to even carry tabasco or ketchup. This is a joke right? Nope, the only joke is the Rafaello itself. The room service server was extremely nice and asked me if I would complain because she gets yelled at all the time and the \"hotel\" would not do anything. She asked if it would be all right if the \"chef\" called me. I said I would love to speak with this cook. After i picked at my dried bread or under done toast and the overly fried egg (crusty brown edge and cool middle) I wait for my call that never comes, 3 hours before I left I attempted to call him again and he again did not call back. The hotel is SMALL and CRAMPED. The elevator could barely fit my 3 suitcases in it. Walls are paper thin. I got to hear all of my neighbors come in and out and hear the squeaky cleaning cart. The suite itself was ok, but it had a prison size bathroom and a shower. The shower does not have a door and the bathroom traps in steam. The phone did not work. The movies were limited and the remote had a delay. Really dimly lit. Air condition didn't work properly. I paid for 4 nights, got fed up and left after 3.

Maids were quiet and courteous. Other guests were also quiet and courteous. One thing I will list as a deal breaker though, was the air conditioning. In both of our rooms, the air was a dial thermostat. (a dial like an .am radio) the air in both rooms was set at 50 degrees. This is the lowest setting. My guess was it was around 73 to 75 degrees in the room, with no way to go lower. Not horribly hot, but never refreshingly cool by any measure. They claimed the 2nd room had updated or recently cleaned air vents, filters, etc..but it was the same. There is no reason whatsoever to choose this hotel over any other. I hope my words have a ring of truth, as I tried to mention good as well as not so good. Not bad, just not good. The 10 dollar a day internet is really too much. Many Chicago hotels are free internet, and the ones who charge range from 4-6 dollars. Also, you have to get a code every 24 hours for the internet. We take a trip to Chicago every year, for the past 9 or 10 yrs. Different hotel every time. This is my 1st review of any Chicago downtown hotel . I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never been disappointed before.

I had heard good things about Chicago and would recommend it to anyone who wanted high standard shops, things to do and friendly locals. I arrived into Chicago O'Hare and got the blue CTA line into the city, changed lines at Jackson and got the Red Line north to Chicago - which is two blocks west of the Raffaello Hotel which is in East Delaware St, it's a 5-10 min walk to the hotel. I was impressed with the size of my suite, which was on the second floor. The hotel is ideally situated for shopping, it's 5 mins from the Water Tower area, and Michigan Avenue \"Magnificent Mile\" - I have to say the shops are every bit as good as anywhere you are likely to visit, all the big brand names have shops in the area, as well as Macy's and Bloomingdales - which are wonderful shops on their own. I spent my week visiting all the sites, I did a tour of the Cubs ground - Wrigley Field, Sears Tower Skydeck 103 flrs up, I did a 90 min boat tour on the lake/river with Wandella tours - which was $ 25 and booked at their key down at the South end of the Magnificent mile, I also visited the Field History Museum, and Second City comedy club. All in all I'd totally recommend a visit to Second city - if comedy is your thing you shouldn't miss this as it was a really good evening for a $ 22 ticket. I'd also recommend taking a walk round Millenium park which is really peaceful and likewise the lakeside path which you can reach from an underpass near the Raffaello hotel, it's a nice way to spend some time walking along the lake.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Wayne, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "arsini29", "ReviewID": "UR63163867", "Content": "This was our first time at the Raffaello and will not be our last.

There is only a partial glass partition that doesn't do a good job of keeping the water from soaking the rest of the bathroom floor. The floor mat is pretty soaked halfway through by the time one person has used the shower. You may want to ask the front desk for extra towels the night before so that you'll have them first thing in the morning. Having said that the shower experience it self was wonderful.

I cannot wait to plan my next trip to Chicago, and the only place I ever want to stay in Chicago is The Raffaello!! The location is PERFECT: 1-1/2 blocks from Michigan Ave, and 1 block from Lake Michigan! I absolutely LOVE the Raffaello Hotel!!!

The location is amazing. Two blocks from Michigan Ave (and the Cheesecake Factory) Maybe four from the American Girl Doll store. Can walk anywhere. Also taxi's are always driving by. I travelled with my husband and two children (ages 8 and 11) We had a large suite which had two rooms separated by a door. It had a king size bed, a pull our couch and also had a parsons bed which was a bonus for the kids. Two flat screen TV's, a mini bar, microwave, and lots of drawers for storage. As the weather was cold we had to use the heat. In the kids room the first night it wouldn't turn on. We called the front desk the next morning and immediately it was fixed. The door men were very very friendly and helpful. Front desk was great as well. I like this hotel because it is a smaller place - very clean, nice modern decor, large rooms. Also, it feels European. One drawback is the bathroom. The shower is set up so that it doesn't close. Only half a pane of glass. Therefore its virtually impossible to contain the water in the shower space. Had to mop up the bathroom floors often. Called down for towels once (as my daughter used too many) housekeeping showed up in less than a minute with a pile of them. Last year the highlight of our visit for me was the soaps and shampoos the hotel privided. L'Occitane. I was in heaven. Too bad they changed that. Nice soaps but can't compare.

(We booked the largest room offered.) The showers were very nice, but there was one small sink and standing-room only.

We had room problems. Traveling with 2 teenage boys- 6'tall, we called several times to be sure the room had queen beds not doubles. got different stories and finally assured the website was wrong and they were indeed Queens. 2- 6' tall boys sharing a full bed- tight- particularly the night before a race and sleep needed. So, manager changed us to a \"Grand Suite\" with murphy bed, sofa bed and king bed. What a night! The mattress was so thin on the sofa bed, that my son put it on the floor to sleep, since the rods on the bed were digging into his back. The murphy bed was basically in it's own \"alcove\" and was a small twin bed. Like sleeping in a box in a box. My son reacted to something inside of it, dragged his mattress to the floor and was wheezing and coughing all night ( not an ashtmatic). He had some type of alergic reaction to something in there. The 1 bathroom was at the foot of our king bed, with full length a frosted glass door panel, the toilet faced our bed and everytime it was used during the night, the light turned on was like a spot light suddently aimed at us in bed, coming through the glass, startling us awake and the person on the toilet- well not the most comfortable situation at the foot of our bed. The bathrooms are like a telephone booth- tiny with tiny designer round sink and shower- no door- a half glass enclosure- but not long enough and the floor would get flooded. The toilet was a bizarre size, to fit in that tiny room. Had to climb over the end of the bed to get into one side. So, the next day, knowing that one son would be staying with his team and not with us, we opted to go back to a double room. There are no Queen beds and 2 rooms was very costly, as was this one. Note that we never share rooms with our kids when traveling, always have 2 bedrooms or 3, so that all can get a good nights sleep,but took a chance this time. The managers were very apologetic, sending us personal notes and one day sent us a bottle of wine with a written apology and will track down who told us they were queen beds. We had given up a long standing reservation elsewhere when we found out they were double beds at an elegant boutique hotel that would have given us 1 night free. Ended up with the same and paying more. This room was very nice,very attractive, spacious but again tiny bathroom- same setup but noraml toilet. At least this was in the entry way away from the beds! Nice rainfall showers and toiletries. Nice well stocked bar ( had pints of alcohol on counter, which we don't drink) and plenty of snack foods, refrigerator. If you don;t like feather pillows you can request synthetic. Elevator very tiny, hold 4 comfortably but no big deal. Restaurant was being renovated, to open soon so no meals there. Nice equipment in gym and a spa which we didn;t use. Terrace on roof top. Beds comfortable enough but not a heavenly bed, for sure. If you like boutique hotels, this is probably a great choice. No lobby to speak of, just a small 2 person check in desk, concierge ( who was of no help at all when asked advice) and a few chairs. Business center on another floor. Excellent location and staff- very accomodating. This is the 2nd time we stayed in a boutique hotel in 25 yrs. of marriage and it will be our last. Just not for us. Would rather stay in a Westin, DoubleTree or even a Marriott with heavenly beds spacious bathrooms and such. No need for the extra attention for us. Oh- we parked the car across the street at the garage for $26/day and left it there for 4 days. Walked everywhere and also took taxis when going far. Great little sandwich/gelato/bakery restaurant around the corner downstairs outside of water tower place. Cheesecake factory is there too. Can sit outside on the steps or inside to eat.

Budget hotels in the main Chicago district were charging $85 per night so the price and location offered by this hotel was just unbeatable. 3) Valet, doorman and bellman were extremely friendly and helpful. 4) The hotel had a business centre with internet, printing, copy, fax and telephone conferencing service, well- equiped gym and spa. Cons: 1) The Front Desk staff were not friendly and very unprofessional. The manager on duty did not smile the entire time he was helping me make bookings for my transportation and at check out. He even seemed reluctant to help me. At check in, the Front Desk staff were chatting nonstop about unrelated work stuff in front of me and complaining about the hotel being overbooked. Being in this business myself, you definitely do not want your guests to be hearing such stuff. 2) The housekeeping service. They came in only at 430pm to do the AM service when I was just back for a short rest and I did not recieve any turndown service which was supposed to be provided on my two nights. 3) Not too many facilities though. No restaurants, room service, pool etc. 4) They charged for internet! Which hotel in this age still charges for internet? It's $9.95 for 24 hours. Wanted to check my email at the business centre thinking it was complimentary but it was even more outrageous; $5.95 for 15 mins!

There is no restaurant on site, no bar, internet is not free and the doorman will call you cab, if he absolutely has to but as we had 36 degree weather, we had to find one ourself because he was inside getting warm. Service is minimal here. MINIMAL. For the money, stay at budget marriot or best western. At least then you'll have a no frills expectation. I am writing this review FROM the hotel room. Smells like fried food...probably because people have to bring food in from the outside for dinner, unless they go out. My room still hasn't been cleaned. We left at 8:30 this morning so plenty of time. Access to the internet requires a code, fine, but you must enter it in EVERY time you log in as the system does not remember it. Bathrooms are tiny, no space to put anything, one hook for a towel shared with blow dryer. I called the front desk and the concierge this morning. No answer at either. Things happen, no hotel is perfect. But the over all problem of this place is the general sense that this is just a job for the staff. They don't say hello, goodbye, open a door, ask you if you need help, or offer a smile. I'm from LA, I can get that for free. The Raffaello has a lot to learn about service and client relations. A LOT. Starting with remembering that guests come first and are paying to stay there, not the other way around. So, if you lower your expectations, this is a great place.

I never got so much as smile or a sense that they were happy to have me. I was asked for my credit card and not once did either person look me in the eye. Instead, I received a perfunctory explanation of the coffee bar in the lobby. There was NO bellman to take my bags to my room. I did it myself. The room was spacious, but devoid of charm. The walls still sport their original plaster, albeit covered in an ugly ochre paint job. The bathroom was tiny. A glass shelf installed above the sink meant that every time I bent to wash my face I banged my forehead on the shelf. There is a small closet, so filled with bathrobes, slippers, a safe, an ironing board, an iron, etc., that you cannot hang one item of clothing in it! There is NO room service yet each night a breakfast menu is on each bed. Why??? I could go on. The only saving grace is a young blonde concierge, who's name I didn't get, who helped us both nights of our stay. He was wonderful and some other hotel should go scoop him up immediately. I will never go back to the Raffaello, nor recommend it to anyone I know. The last night of my stay one of the elevators was out of service. It was a Saturday night. I, and a dozen other guests, waited more than 15 minutes to get to our rooms. No one said a word to us or apologized. Disgraceful.

A previous reviewer stated that rooms ending in \"6\" were small but I thought 710 was quite small. We drove to Chicago from Toronto and valet parking is expensive at $45/day.. We found a car park just a block down towards the lake for $24/day. The hotel self-park, around the corner is $28/day. Not enough parking for unloading/loading luggage in front of the hotel. We drove around a couple of times and finally my husband unloaded the car on the side of the hotel's front door (hotel is situated on a corner), and continued on the to the parking garage.

We stayed for six nights and found the location perfect for our many activities: heading for Starbucks for our morning coffee, walking on the shoreline for the fireworks from Navy Pier, strolling on the Magnificent Mile, getting CTA passes at Waterworks for our six days, catching a bus to the Science and Industry Museum, walking to the river, Grant Park, and the Chicago Art Institute (a very long walk), or heading up to the observation deck and the cocktail lounge of the John Hancock building late at night when no one else is there. Upon checking in, our friends ended up on the 15th floor; we ended up on the sixth. When I looked out our window I saw dirty towels in a huge basket. I immediately went down and requested a room on the same floor as our friends, and never returned to the 6th floor. We were given a two bed room which was fine with us. Our bags were moved immediately, no drama. This is not a view hotel, however, the roof top gives you a glance at the lake and an \"in your face\" view of the John Hancock building as it is right across the street. The beds were comfy, our room was always clean and ready for us at the end of the day, the business center is open 24 hours (which we needed for Oak Park reservations and the Chicago Architectural Foundation boat tour), and we found the staff cordial, helpful, and doing their jobs well- although we didn't need them except for a question or two. We did not eat here in the morning as we felt we wanted to walk for our breakfast rather than pay $15 a head for a continental breakfast. Starbucks became our morning destination. Cabs were hailed easily, the Chicago Transit Authority Red Line is a few blocks away, and the recommendation by the concierge for dinner at the Rosebud was excellent (albeit expensive but we loved it!) Only downside- a touch of soap residue on the shower corner, bumps in the floor from old wood underneath the rug, and a small glass shelf (too small to hold your sundries) in the bathroom. This was a disabled room, and our friends was too, so I am not sure if all rooms were equipped with grabrails etc... The shower is overhead, so if you are coiffed, it could be a problem for your hair- I washed mine everyday and loved it. This is not a full service hotel.

Check in is at 4 pm, and we were initially told to return then - but the concierge told us we could come back at 2 and a room would probably be ready. This was fine - we did some sightseeing and then returned. The room was not yet ready; however the bellman had already brought out our bags and so they had to be rechecked. No problem so far. We came back at 4 and check in itself went smoothly - however they had lost our bags. After some frantic searching in different employees' offices, they were finally located. It's this kind of disinterested service ethos that really brings the Raffaello down - it's the level of service one would expect from a college town Days Inn. The employees at the Raffaello are affable enough, but they really don't want to concern themselves with any problems or questions guests may have - they seem to universally want guests to just go away and leave them alone. Lousy service aside, the room itself was as pictured - quite lovely actually. Bed was great - tv was nice - all were up to snuff. Location can't be beat for the price - right off Michigan Ave. behind the Hancock building. I would probably still stay here again - I just wouldn't check my bags with them. If they find a way to work out the service kinks this could be quite a nice hotel.

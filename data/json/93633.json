It is like a Home Away from Home. The concierge and staff make it a point to get to know you. So when you return to the hotel you feel welcome. The rooms are very spacious with a living room and a separate kitchen. And the bedrooms are a nice size. After a day about town is a great feeling to be able to spread out. The decoration is traditional New York Hotel with french touches, not modern. It is located on Madison Ave. in the 60's block, near loads of great shopping and cafes.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "elmerito", "ReviewID": "UR74935573", "Content": "We decided on this hotel for its great location and affordable price.

But the room was very old feeling, very spartan. Air conditioning did not work well. Paid over $400 and they forgot shampoo. The linen wasn't good. There are no bathrobes.

The rooms are really spacious with sitting areas and kitchenettes - ours had been newly refurbished and was clean, bright and airy.

We had 2 junior suites that were really spacious, 1 had a balcony overlooking central park which was a bonus, although the door didn't open fully so it was rather a squeeze to get on to it. Rooms were really clean and the bed sheets changed daily. Just a couple of minor complaints, the wallpaper in one of the bathrooms was coming off and the hairdryer in the other had fallen off the wall. Simple problems to fix but had been overlooked resulting in the bathrooms looking a tad shabby. All in all though very good, this was our fifth visit to New York and this was by far the best hotel.

We had an extended stay, and the staff at the Club Level made us feel like we were at home. Every year we come back, we hope that things have not changed and that we can expect the same service and people, and that was the case yet again. Great: The Club Level is really outstanding, better than any other Ritz we have stayed at. The food is excellent and, as mentioned, the service is amazing. I really enjoy the atmosphere, where it is not done in some overly modern fashion that removes any warmth, as say the LA Live Ritz. Also, after trying Parallel 37, the food is great, and the remodel is well done. Good: Well, it really is only passable, and that is the room service menu, not what you would call good food. The menu is not creative at all, basic Marriott style, and the quality is sub par. Because we have a small child, we ate off this menu more than a few times, and I just could not understand how the food could not measure up, when the Club food is great, and so is the restaurant food. Needs Improvement: Hmm, they call it a Spa? I guess you should wonder when there are no pictures of it on the web site, that is a tip that there really is no spa. I was sitting in a dingy hallway, in my robe, ready for a treatment, and people were coming and going, as there was no lounge area. The treatment room was right there, accessed from the hallway, and you got to see who used the room right before you, the clean up, and then also the nice couple that was going to use it when I got out, they looked surprised to see me coming out. Okay, couple this with the smelly locker room, showers that are so hot that you can't use them (no cold water at all) and the cigarette butt that was on the carpet floor below my locker and you get the general idea. Yes, that did happen. I hate to be negative about this, but how can it be great hotel, and advertize a spa, with these facilities, or lack there of? The management was very attentive and did credit me for the treatment when I noted the deficiencies, which was nice. Transition to the final bill review upon check out, and my bill was not correct. They charged for Valet, which was included, and I also had a 3 night package, two back to back, and that was not correct, as they billed the entire amount. When I noted this, they fixed it, but then only credited back the cheapest night, not the package rate, so it had to be done again. I thought this part was really not acceptable, The guest should not be required to find large billing errors, or risk overpayment. As noted, the rooms are a bit worn and dated, but hopefully they will be updated soon.

The staff was extremely accommodating, gave me a room key and didn't bother me while a slept during the afternoon waiting for my mom to arrive back from the napa valley to surprise her. I loved the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the lobby - to summarize it, it's simple yet sophisticated. Elegant yet I didn't find it pretentious.

I have stayed at many many hotels all over North America and the world and let me make something clear, above all the service at this hotel was possibly the best I've ever seen. Period. The room was really nice (junior executive club level suite) - to be honest, a little tired but they are all being renovated in the near future from what I hear. Room service menu was EH but REALLY with so many amazing restaurants in the area it's a shame to be ordering room service. Restaurant in lobby is truly exquisite great breakfast - VERY EXPENSIVE.

The club level food is still fantastic. The club staff is attentive and have always made us feel at home during our week plus stay. There are two disappointing aspects of this hotel. First the rooms service menu is a joke. There are few options and the food is just not very good, at prices that make you want to gag. Secondly the spa is not a spa. They advertise spa services and claim that the spa has been renovated. In fact the only thing they have done is remove the pool and make the fitness area larger. One entire room is full of dirty yoga mats, a floor that was never replaced and looks like a cheap dirty gym, not a spa There is no appropriate waiting area for spa services, nothing that makes you feel like you are actually in a spa at all.

While being pleased with just about every stay I must say that my stay at Ritz Carlton, San Francisco definitely provided the WOW factor. The staff is extremely Professional, Polite and Accommodating. It all started at check in when they offered a welcome glass of champagne. It may not have be Cristal but was a nice gesture to welcome incoming guests. Every Ritz Carlton should do this. Check in was a breeze and the agent was friendly and expeditious and I was in my room in less than 5 minutes. I was in a Club Deluxe room. From what I noticed the Superior/Deluxe rooms are not tremendous but not small either but more importantly well maintained. The bathroom is a very important factor for me when I rate a hotel. Since it is a older building, the standard rooms did have a shower/tub combo and I do prefer separates but, what I did notice was the marble was actually in very good condition and shiny. Lots of hotels have marble bathrooms and never maintain or polish the marble and it ends up looking old, spotted and dirty (Ritz Carlton Marina del Rey) but not at RC SFO. The marble was clean and shiny. as were all marble areas throughout the hotel. In addition, the Club lounge definitely seemed superior to other RC Club lounges. Their offerings were extensive, offerings were nearly continuous, so there were no long gaps of in between times and every single club concierge could not bend over backwards enough to be more accommodating. I spent most of my stay in the club lounge and noticed that the Ladies & Gentlemen truly take pride in their jobs/hotel and understand the philosophy of Ritz Carlton. I took a loot at the gym and it looked like there were ample machines/weights. The SPA was a little odd shaped and the layout may not be of a typical SP but nonetheless seemed acceptable.

The next day I asked and they said they could sort of see the damage when I originally pulled in, but they could not really tell. I asked to view the tape . They said sure, but then refused to let me view the tape. The following day, a third person called me a d said they could see it , but with glare. The whole thing was ridiculous.

This Dec. we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton on Nob Hill. The building is a gorgeous Neo-Classical style, circa 1909. Upon entering the building one expects to see a grand, expansive Lobby, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. The Front Desk is off to one side and more perfunctory than impressive. We heard that a multi-phase redesign is planned for the near future. With 8 stories and located lower down the hill, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer quite the panorama that the Fairmont or Mark Hopkins does, but we were thrilled with the impressive night time views (over Chinatown, St. Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral and up towards Calif. St.) from the large windows in our corner room (#628), located at the end of the hall on the 6th floor. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d requested a quiet room and it was a wonderfully peaceful environment both day and night with absolutely no intruding sounds. I noticed that the large windows were also openable, something I would have taken advantage of had the season been warmer. Our room had a small foyer containing the honor bar and complimentary coffee station which was hidden away in an attractive wooden chest. We immediately made use of the wine glasses that were provided. The closet with automatic lighting had ample space and plenty of hangers. There were 2 luggage racks, an iron, and in-wall safe. The King bed with Sealy mattress was extremely comfortable--and you can actually arrange to purchase one of these mattresses per the guest info. booklet. In fact, it did seem that most everything in the hotel was buyable. It was a bit disconcerting to find that even a delivered morning newspaper was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for purchase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Our room was nicely sized, spacious but still exuding a warm feeling, There was a large desk, lounge chair with ottoman, large flat panel TV, (3) phones inc. one in the bathroom, and iPod/MP3 dock. What seems like a small matter, a clock on each bedstand, represented attention to detail that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found in few hotels. Decor was classic with dark woods and warm beige and gold hues. Full-length heavy drapes allowed you to darken the room completely--or (in our case) leave them open to enjoy the gorgeous City lights at night. The lamps were rheostat controlled and provided enough light to comfortably read by. The thermostat controlled forced air heating/cooling system worked efficiently and our room was kept at a comfortable temperature. The bath had marble flooring, counters and tub surround; dual sinks and a separate toilet compartment. The standard size tub/shower had a dual control water saving showerhead. Pressure and temperature were both fine, but unfortunately, the tub drain plugged up (we did report it when we checked out). Plenty of towels plus bathrobes were provided. The hotel offers a spa and fitness center but we didn't get a chance to check out those areas. For business and events guests, there is a separate lounge area and access to special concierge services and around the clock refreshments. When I originally made our reservations I dealt with Fideles, the Executive Reservations Service Coordinator and I was extremely pleased with his prompt and very helpful communications. Once we arrived at the hotel, the flawless service continued. Each time we entered or left the hotel we were greeted by staff members. The valets, front desk personnel, restaurant and lounge wait staff, and housekeepers were all genuinely friendly and attentive. In the evening, 6 large chocolate-covered strawberries on a platter were delivered to our room along with a handwritten \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd note from Fideles (once again)--a delightful surprise! And the chocolate-covered strawberries were supremely delicious. We enjoyed appetizers and drinks in the late afternoon and breakfast the next morning in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly reopened, redesigned restaurant/lounge \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parallel 37\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good quality food and good service, but pricey. When we first checked in we opted for turning over our car to valet parking for the duration of our stay, choosing to take the taxi to dinner (the fabulous Waterbar on the Embarcadero South) and walking up to Grace Cathedral the next morning. Being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153car free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a day is a rare treat for us and we bit the bullet, paying $70 for the valet parking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Superb service; pricey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sums up our Ritz-Carlton experience, but it was, indeed, a fabulous one and hey, for a special holiday stay--exactly right.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cService, Service, Service\u201d", "Author": "travelerguy23", "ReviewID": "UR121986255", "Content": "I stayed at the Ritz last week for business.

City hotels are usually not as nice as hotels out of town, have smaller rooms and less amenities (pool etc.), which was true in this case. It's a beautiful old building in a great location. 5 minutes on foot to Union Square, down hill, when walking really slowly. The room and bathroom were beautiful, albeit smalish. Also, when we first went to our room, we found that somebody else had obviously been watching TV, drinking water and washing their hands there.... When we called reception they gave us another room immediately, but that room did not have a nice view, so we waited until the room we had initial had was done up again. We stayed on the club level and the food was good, especially breakfast (top notch yoghurts but not much hot food). The waitress told us that there would be kaviar in the evening, which never appeared (I would not have looked for it had it not been mentioned). At the Half Moon Bay Ritz, you can pretty much make yourself any cocktail at night, including whiskey, gin etc. and nice wine and champagne. In San Francisco, we could order a cocktail for a small window of time, then the \"bar\" closed and wine was available. The desserts in the evening were good but there seemed to be a \"limited amount\" that did not get replenished. The same for sparkling water, it ran out and when I asked for them to refill they brought out one tiny bottle. They gym in the basement was nice; lots of space for yoga, including mats. The guide in the room talks about a pool (and hot tub) but that has been filled in to create the gym. They are building a nice restaurant that was not open yet. All in all, a very nice hotel but I am not sure I would go back for the money, especially on the club level, where i expect more.

Wallpaper is starting to curl. Carpets stained. Just not what I would expect at a Ritz. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No Bulgari bath products, relatively small bathroom (one vanity).

The jackhammers started before 9am on a Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Customer service at front desk was clearly not what we expected. Maybe we just hit hotel on the wrong weekend, but a hotel of this caliber should always have good service. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Called several times to get an answer. Also, when I went to front desk to get a copy of the bill at check-out, I noted another guest discussing how loud his room was. Apparently on the courtyard, and had a lot of noise from activities taking place. He had asked the person at the desk for a change in room, but appeared to be rudely cut off by the individual, stating that the rooms on the street side are actually much noisier. They went back and forth arguing until the guest said just to change the room and walked away.

Our room wasn't ready yet when we arrived, but they gave us a great lunch suggestion in Union Square and called us as soon as the room was available. The concierge made perfect dinner suggestions based on our preferences. We also ate in their Dining Room at the RC restaurant and it was excellent. Our room was clean and had the typical RC double sink marble bathroom. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have Bvlgari amenities, however, which used to be an RC standard, but I haven't stayed in one for a couple of years so I guess they made a change. The tub wasn't anything special but probably because we stayed in a standard room and didn't upgrade. I'd stay here again and recommend it to friends and family who aren't traveling with younger children. I know that when my kids were younger, they wouldn't have liked a hotel with no pool or kid activities, and, frankly, it's very pricey and they wouldn't have appreciated the reasons it cost so much.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmigham", "Title": "\u201cRitz San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "M M", "ReviewID": "UR118486183", "Content": "GREAT EXPERIENCE!

First off, when we arrived at the porte cochere to check the car with the valet, we were immediately approached by a bellhop, presumably to take our luggage and port our car to the garage. The bellhop had a different idea. Rather than assist my female companion with her luggage, he stood at the trunk of the car engaging her in a battle of wills to see who would ultimately extract the luggage (2 standard size suitcases). To her credit, she waited him out and he begrudgingly lifted the luggage out. I was wrestling with the duffle bags in the backseat while this exchange took place. We then were directed to the check in area where we were greeted by a friendly face. Our check in was handled professionally but unremarkably. There was no escort to our rooms. Nor were we offered any sort of refreshment at the front desk. I arrived at my room to find it in proper order. Average cleanliness and adequately maintained. The furniture showed its age (couch was worn in areas and chairs were slightly stained). The room contained a nicely stocked mini-fridge and Bvlgari toiletries (strongly scented and more feminine in smell). The pillows were just right, the mattress worn and covered with what I presume to be a bedwetting preventive cover which sounded and felt like a pamper. It crackled through the night and detracted from the sleep experience. My companion confirmed her mattress was similarly fitted with said pamper so I conclude all the beds have this deplorable feature. After check in, we decided to check out the spa for a massage. The spa facilities are small and the lockerroms more gym-like than spa-like. Massage rooms are average. We agreed to meet up in the pool/hottub area after the treatments. To my dismay, after receiving a relaxing massage, I exited the locker area to the wet area to be confronted with 5-6 children under the age of 5 screaming and running around. The children were attended to by a grand mother who yelled not less than 25 times \"no running! Last warning!\". The children did not heed warning and continued their misbehavior. Spa staff did not intervene and at least attempt to maintain a spa-like atmosphere. Our massages were shot and we decided to bail. The hotel should simply call this area the pool area/daycare for lazy parents. It is not a spa atmosphere in the least. There are no \"adults only\" wet areas in the hotel. We then had dinner at The Dining Room (the hotel restaurant). We each selected the chef's tasting menu. The food was outstanding; service was awkward with long delays between courses.

Breathtaking decor in the lobby and public spaces whisk you away into a palatial dream. Check in ran smoothly and we were within our room in moments after arrival. Our room, a \"deluxe king\", was beautifully decorated with antique reproductions in soft tones of buttery yellow and grey, and the bed was beyond comfortable. Our room faced the very European looking courtyard, and was whisper-quiet at night, though substantially smaller than the rooms across the hall which face a busy street. Rooms opposite the other side of the courtyard face a busy street with a cablecar line. While our stay was generally enjoyable, there are a few things you should know about this hotel. You are pretty much stuck there for breakfast, which is hideously expensive ($90 for 2), or you must face an alpine climb down and back up to the nearest coffee joint. Service in the grand lobby lounge was attentive, however for all they charged, not one staff member could locate a bran muffin for me even though they are listed as part of a room service breakfast. The cold buffet includes items you might not see in any other North American hotel, such as spicy, fatty cured meats, and platters of ripe cheese. There is a fairly endless array of rich and fatty foods, including sweet pastries. Healthier choices include cereal, packaged yogurt, and limited fresh fruit. The lunch and dinner menu here is very limited but hopefully the quality is better than the breakfast choices. When asked how our breakfast was, I told the server the omelette was not very good, he chuckled and walked away, charging full price. Unfortunately I cannot fully recommend the place at this time. Every morning at 9 a.m. on the dot an extremely annoying sharp drilling sound started and went pretty much non-stop both days, making a daytime snooze impossible. I asked THREE different staff members about the noise, none claimed to have any knowledge. At one point I was discussing the issue with a staffer in our hallway, who claimed he could hear nothing and knew nothing, even though we could both hear it very clearly even where we were having the discussion. One more piece of advice- if the concierge team suggests a restaurant, RUN THE OTHER WAY. Twice we were sent to sub-par eateries. Their top recommendation for Chinese food served inedible dim sum, the worst Peking Duck we've ever had, and chow mein so greasy it slithered off the plate practically of its own accord. Both places were complete tourist traps. The decor, rooms and service get high marks (the rooms are being refurbished which might have explained the ear-splitting noise in our room). If you have the money it's a grand experience overall, but do your homework as there are many top-quality hotels in San Fran. This one wants you to believe its the best, and with better food and a more-skilled Concierge team, it could be in the running.

However, you pay for luxury and luxury and adequate service are the benchmark then. I had mixed feelings about the service, the check-in and check-out procedure, the Internet billing, the Spa... Rooms are fine, nice furniture, carpet shows wear but that's a problem in all hotels if they are not brand new windows don't close that well so make sure you got the heating going but otherwise no complaints. Service was very good by the doormen - couldn't be better. A glass of Champagne was offered to me upon check-in and I certainly appreciate such. But check-in area itself is very small, there are only two working there so you have to wait for 20 minutes for check-in which is simply not acceptable. I saw people waiting at check-in, check-out all weekend; and, yes, property was fully booked. Check-in was ok, nobody showed me to the room, ok. But then it took almost an hour for the luggage to arrive and I had to call before it finally did arrive. The guy was apologetic and it's probably more a lack of staff than anything else. Again, not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Tried to contact room service and frontdesk - busy all the time and when I finally got through the girl was less than friendly - very stressed out. Again, not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. That hotel of this standard charge when Courtyard doesn't is an old story and very deplorable. As long as they get away with it they will - am waiting for the luxury htel chain that stops and will patronise them... Anyway, I did connect with two different devices and got charged for both... They promised to remove the charge but did not. Tried to call in and talk to their billing departement. Told - again quite harshly - to call back later as they're busy. Again, not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Went to SPA - booked Aromatherapy massage - girls insisted I had booked deep tissue - ok be it - an experience but it did hurt. But again, it's not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Service in breakfast area was wonderful I have to say. So was the bar and the dining was simply delightful. All in all a mixed bag. My feeling is that hotel is under staffed when it's fully booked and some people (especially on phone etc.) are poorly trained to cope with the stress araising from that fact.

My husband and I have stayed at a few Intercontinentals and decided to see if the Ritz lived up to its 5 star rating! Location is decent just a few blocks away from Union Square. While the hotel building has really great architecture, it is not very tall so you really don't get any view of the skyline from any room. The lobby is quite opulent with marble everywhere you look. It makes me think of \"old money\" rich rather than the more trendy Intercon. My husband had dropped his bags earlier in the day and we checked in later that night. They brought his bags to the room but oops, only brought 1 instead of 2 bags. They had to go back and retrieve the second one. Our room was on the 5th floor which is only 1 floor above the lobby. It was somewhat close to the elevators and also the doors to the rooms seemed very close together. At night, when our neighbors would open the doors to their rooms, I kept thinking someone was coming in to ours! Also we could hear some street noises outside the window though we didn't have our windows open. Unfortunately, we also appeared to have been put in a wedding block so when the other guests came back late at night, we got to hear their loud voices floating through the halls. It only woke me up once (I was beat!) but apparently my husband was up all night. The rooms were nice with flat screen tv and dvd player. Also an iHome which was great for plugging in the iPod. However I will point out we moved to the JW Marriott down the street after the Ritz and their flat screen tv was twice as big AND there was Bose theater system. We appeared to have received a turn down service on Fri night (we stayed 2 nights) with the blanket turned down and classical music playing. We didn't receive that on Sat night though even though we came back somewhat late. We did enjoy the complimentary bottles of water and coffee maker in the room. I always enjoy the little extras in the bathroom. In this case, my favorite was the ring holder. For a 5 star hotel, I had really hoped for more though like some fancy soaps and giant plush towels. Aside from the embroidered logos, the towels were smallish and scratchy. I didn't even bother swiping the shampoos and soaps! Some other reviews talk of fancy Bulgari soaps... must only be on the Club Level. Also, water pressure wasn't great but at least the bathroom was spacious. Some reviewers talk of outstanding service but I thought it was average. Yes, the concierge gave us maps... that's what they are supposed to do! Sometimes the doors were opened for us when we came/went but sometimes they were too busy talking to each other to help us out and certainly no one greeted us by name or went out of their way to say hello. I was glad to have at least tried out the Ritz and thankfully, I was not paying for the room. I think in general though I felt my stays at other less expensive hotels were just as good. For example, Hampton Inn has really comfy beds and fresh baked cookies with free breakfast and even Holiday Inn's nowadays have updated marble bathrooms! At least if we had a #1 location and awesome views, I could see the reason for the expense but this time, I couldn't justify it.

This time we decided to treat ourselves to 2 club level rooms. Things got off to a rather shaky start when we arrived to find that the hotel was overbooked and so our rooms were not longer available. However the duty manager, Andy, came up with a rather brilliant alternative - he put us in the presidential suite! We just had to wait until Tom Cruise checked out! This was a seriously gorgeous room with a massive balcony complete with numerous loungers and tables and chairs. The room even has a grand piano and full kitchen. If I were to nit pick it would only be the fact that we had wanted us all to have proper beds to sleep in but this room only has one king bed. One of the children slept on a sofabed and the other on a rollaway in the lounge area. Both were comfortable but not the \"proper\" beds we had booked. However this room more than made up for that minor irritation. Plenty of hanging space for clothes, an enormous master bath surrounded by candles and a full dining room. Shame we did not know anyone in San Francisco - we could have had quite a party in that space! The best, best bit though is the club level lounge. If you can afford to to it, the you should experience it. It is quite the best club lounge we have ever been to. The concerieges on the desk there are incredibly helpful and friendly. The food is amazing and plenty of it. There are soft drinks and tea and coffee available all the time, along with amazing fresh baked cookies. The breakfast selection is extensive and delicious and from early evening there is a huge array of drinks (including cocktails and champagne) with fantastic snacks available to enjoy. It really does have the feel of an exclusive club, down to the fact that only people on the club level floors can access it. Your room key has to be put into a slot in the lift to there. The main hotel is in great shape still. The main rooms are beautiful and imposing. The concerieges on the desk downstairs are a mine of information and suggested some great restaurants for us. It is an easy walk downhill to the huge array of amazing shops in San Francisco. Little more tiring on the way back up though. Both times I have stayed I have been to a flamboyant and very interesting man called Bibo for a shampoo and blowdry. You should go just for the experience of meeting him. Lovely man, full of energy and joie de vivre. Not cheap but he does a good job. His salon is a short walk from the hotel. Well done Ritz Carlton.

Mission accomplished. The Ritz is in a great location - in the heart of Nob Hill, just a block away from the Powell Street trolley and around the corner from Chinatown. Rooms were clean - and nice. There was a DVD player which was very appreciated! Kids really enjoyed the indoor pool and I enjoyed the jacuzzi after a day of trekking up the SF hills. I would not go back there with children again. Perhaps I was hyper-sensitive about my rambunctious boys, but we just didn't fit in. There is definitely snobbery in the air; down-to-earth, the Ritz is not. There is a balance between welcoming hospitality that does not compromise quality - and an overdone level of \"service\" that is forced down by management rather than a genuine expression. The Ritz on the Nob was the latter. Parking to the tune of $71 a day is ludicrous. Unless they were going to spit-shine my car daily, perform a tune-up, and leave a chocolate on the driver's seat, there is no way I was going to throw that kind of money down the drain (or a cement garage). So....I parked at St. Mary's Square just a block down the way, where they charge $32/day - but if you go on the weekend and time it just right, you'll only pay $7 for Saturday and $7 for Sunday. That's what I did - and my car didn't know the difference. Hail to St. Mary! Between that and the wi-fi charge, yes, I did feel like I was nickel and dimed. C'mon....do you really need to charge $44 for wi-fi, just because you \"can\"? I mean really, Ritz....it just leaves a bad taste.

We found this most interesting because my husband is a Marriott Gold member (Platinum for many years) so they his bio already on file. Once in the room, we were treated with the usual friendly service, but once the bellhop left, so did the concern for the guest. Pros: 1. Excellent housekeeping. We tipped the housekeeper because not only was the room cleaned promptly and efficiently in the morning, the evening turndown service was good, but see Cons. 2. Location. There is a trolley stop right outside the hotel, which is nice if you are tired of walking up and down the hills. If you're a morning exerciser, you will find how close Chinatown and Little Italy are from the hotel for your morning stroll/run. 3. Room furnishing. While the room was small, it was comfortable and clean. The furniture was positioned in the typical hotel format, but the pieces were better than average hotel grade. The sheets, pillows, linens, fabrics were all of better quality. 4. Quick valet. Cons: 1. Turndown service. When the room was turned down, it was great. However, I'm not sure why RC thought that their guests preferred late service. Consistently, the turndown service was very late in the evening. One night we had already returned and retired for the evening only to hear a knock at the door at 11pm by the housekeeper to come in. She was surprised when we refused a couple times because we were already in our PJs. Very odd! 2. Customer service. When you call down to the Concierge desk in the morning for assistance on your rental car, you are put on hold for 18 min. Yes, we timed it as we vigorously were on another phone and online trying to resolve the situation with Hertz. I decided to go down to the lobby to speak with the Concierge desk in person. When no one was there, I asked the receptionist what was going on. She stated that the Concierge doesn't come in until 9am! Think this would have been communicated somehow through their telephone system or hotel operator? Overall, our the property was very nice, considering it is a very old building in a weather environment that can be hard on structures. However, customer service was hot at the beginning, addressing you by name as you checked in, but sharply declined to a cool indifference once they charged your card and checking out would be too much of a hassle. I'm almost certain we would not stay here again, since there are so many other properties of same or higher caliber that are worth their value.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "momwith2", "ReviewID": "UR63664668", "Content": "My husband and I had a wonderful time.

We were thrilled when we found a great package on Expedia that included two nights at the Ritz and airfare. I've never stayed at a Ritz Carlton, but have stayed at comparable hotels, including the Mandarin Oriental, so I expected the same level of service that one would expect from a luxury hotel. When I booked the trip, I selected a room with two double beds, and the confirmation that later received indicated that we had indeed reserved that type of room. Upon arrival however, the person at the front desk told us that they didn't have anymore rooms with two double beds, only rooms with one king bed. I replied that I didn't reserve a room with one bed, and asked if there was anything else she could do. After a couple of back and forths, she replied that she would be happy to have a cot brought up to the room, so that we could have an extra bed. My friend immediately said no. Being offered at cot at the Ritz Carlton???? That's like paying for a luxury room and being told that you have to sleep on the couch. Obviously, our conversation with her was going nowhere, so I asked to speak with the manager. He informed us that they didn't have anymore rooms with two double beds. I showed him the printed confirmation, and after looking a bit flustered, he replied that rooms booked on Expedia cannot be guaranteed. He said that we needed to call after making the reservation to confirm that we could get the actual room we had booked. After more back and forths, he finally replied that he indeed did have a room with two double beds, but it was on the 1st floor. I said that although that wasn't my preference, if that was the best he could do, then I guess we have no choice. After yet more back and forths, he finally replied that a room on the 7th floor would be available at 2:00. Note that we had arrived early, at 11:30, and were certainly not expecting to check in until later. We simply wanted to check our bags until the room was ready, and in the meantime walk around a bit. I said that was great. I thanked him many times for his help, but he never once acknowledged my appreciation. Also note, that I was at all times during this transaction quite calm and courteous. I never got nasty, but also wasn't willing to back down. Also, why did I have to jump through hoops to get a room the I had (a) reserved in the first place and (b) would be available later that day anyway. The whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth. The room itself was fine. Clean for the most part, although we came back later in the day to find a strange comb, etc., sitting on the nightstand. The wallpaper was peeling in several places, and housekeeping kept forgetting to clear the used coffee from the maker and replenish the bar with new supplies. Overall, not what I would expect from a luxury hotel. I won't be staying at a Ritz Carlton again, especially when there are so many other great hotels that offer better rooms and phenomenal service. I guess they just didn't want to deal with customers who got a great rate on Expedia.

It is a handsome building in a good location, but several annoyances make us wonder whether it's time to change our allegiance to the Ritz brand. We had wanted to stay at the San Francisco Ritz for some time and booked a one-bedroom suite on the Club level so that breakfast, lunch and snacks would be readily available in the Club lounge, primarily for our kids (easier than going to a restaurant for every meal). When making the reservation I was very specific that there would be four of us in the suite, stated the ages of our kids, and explained that we needed a pullout couch for one child and a rollaway for the other. I was told the nightly rate for the suite when I reserved, and nothing was said about any extra charges due to the number of people in the suite (keep reading). First problem: after confirming three times in advance that our suite would have a separate pullout couch and a rollaway bed in the living room, AND that they would be made up and ready when we arrived because we were getting in late, we were taken to a suite with no pullout couch at all and no rollaway in sight. After a couple of phone calls, we were finally moved to a one-bedroom suite that met the description of what I had reserved, but it was very late and we were exhausted. It wasn't a pleasant beginning to our stay. Next problem: upon reading the Club level \"welcome letter\", we learned for the first time that only three people per suite could partake of the Club lounge food and beverage; any additional guests would have to pay $50 per day. At no time during the reservation process was this mentioned to me despite my specifically advising the reservations personnel that there would be four guests in the one-bedroom suite. This additional charge therefore effectively raised our nightly room rate by $50 per night, to a rate we had not agreed to. We immediately discussed this with the Club manager and the reservations manager, and asked that someone get back to us with their determination on the matter. No one ever did, but upon our checkout, the $50 per day additional charge had been included in our bill. On this point, it's the principle of the thing. If that's their policy, they should tell you when you make your reservation. We had paid a significant additional amount to stay on the Club floor already, and ended up paying $200 extra on top of that (for a 12-year-old girl who doesn't eat much). Housekeeping problem: on two out of the four days of our visit, our room was never made up. We left the hotel before 9 a.m. each day and returned just before dinner time, to find no clean towels and the suite uncleaned. Each time this resulted in housekeeping rushing to our suite to make it up at the same time that we were trying to shower and get changed to go out to dinner. It is a mystery to us why this should happen even once...but twice is ridiculous. Finally, more housekeeping issues: throughout our stay, plates of half-eaten food sat outside rooms on our hallway, on the floor and on furniture, for more than a day at a time. It was, frankly, disgusting. Why wasn't this cleaned up? To see this at a hotel at the level of the Ritz is unbelievable. On the plus side, our suite was lovely, and the staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful.

Check-in was smooth and quick, even at 1 PM, 2 hours before normal check-in. A small box of chocolates and card was in the room for a belated birthday. We had an almost 2-year old with us, which was noted at time of reservation (because we did not want a crib but rather a king bed since she sleeps with us). We did receive a king bed, which I thought was very nice, but no special amenities of any kind for the baby, which some properties provide. A bellman brought our luggage very quickly and offered at that time to have the windows baby-proofed by having the handles removed (we opted not to). The minibar is stocked full of your typical drinks, and a small drawer above it contains other items such as playing cards, panty-hose, spare undergarments, jelly beans, a nice pocket-size map of the area, all available for sale. If you would like a mini-fridge instead, it will cost you $25/day. A nice coffee/tea kit is provided complimentary and is (usually) restocked at turn-down service, which happened every evening. In-room Internet is available via Ethernet at the desk, or via Wi-Fi however Wi-Fi did not work for our room. Connectivity to the access point was easy, but not to the router beyond that so no IP was acquirable. Not a big deal for us since we used our notebook at the desk, and I suppose a call would have resolved the issue at some point. I enabled private/secure Internet-sharing via Wi-Fi on my laptop to provide my iPhone with faster connectivity than 3G (although 3G seemed to work very well all around the city). The Business Center is near some of the meeting rooms and is operated by the contracted audio-visual company. Available 24-hours by room-key and then payment by credit card, it was not staffed during the day when we entered, but rather a sign said to contact the operator for assistance, which I assume would then have the staff paged. Equipment included 3 PCs (MPC-brand, so not very new but OK), a mid-size color-capable copier, and a multifunction device as a fax machine. A laptop station is also available to get online via Ethernet and printing via USB or Parallel. Rates are comparable to other luxury hotels; workstation rental is 75\u00c2\u00a2/minute with a 10-minute minimum, printing is $1/page b/w and $1.75 color, copies are 30\u00c2\u00a2 or less depending on volume, and faxes are $5/page domestic. A separate PC with printer is available and provided complimentary by the hotel for airline boarding pass printing. We rented a car at the hotel via Concierge and it is quite convenient. Rather than pay the $70/night parking fee (we never saw a parking lot), we rented and returned the car the same day. Even with last minute notice, Concierge was able to obtain a car for us within about an hour. They use Hertz, and have you provide your cc and license, then they complete the paperwork and have you sign the contract when the car is delivered and waiting for you at the front entrance. You walk out, show your contract to the doorman, and the car is right there waiting for you. When you return, they make sure the car is not dinged, etc., take your contract, and you're done. I highly recommend renting a car for at least a day if you are flying in as you can drive to Golden Gate, drive down Lombard street, and even cruise up to wine country, all in an afternoon. Taxi is about $45 including tip from SFO, so better to do that R/T and rent the car from the hotel for a day. Our rental was about $85 for a Mustang convertible (we didn't specify car except to request a standard car). A very friendly and helpful doorman was the only one to repeatedly call us by our last name during our stay. No big deal, but I know that is important to Ritz. On the other hand, almost everyone here said hello as we passed by and made us feel welcome. We mostly ate out, but had drinks at the Lobby Lounge once, and it was \"raw night\" where they offered a variety of oysters, shrimp, and crab (not everything was raw). We left our camera by accident, and our nice server had it held for us by security which is a standard procedure. Concierge left a message in our room and one call had it delivered to our room by a hotel manager. Good and honest staff and appreciated of course. We enjoyed the heated pool one day, as well as the much more heated jacuzzi. There was only one other family of 3 using it at the time we went, around 4 PM. We had full access to the locker rooms which have private lockers, nice showers, etc. The adjacent fitness center shares the locker rooms. The bathroom was nice, but not spectacular. No separate shower stall in our room as is required by AAA 5-Diamond standards. Nice shower, none-the-less, and nice Bvlgari amenities. Slippers and robes are in the room. A bathroom scale is also in the room, and an important convenience if you want to weigh your luggage to be within airline weight restrictions. Large enough lighted closet had a good supply of hangers and included an iron and ironing board and built-in free safe. TV was modern and a DVD player is in the below cabinet as well as a game controller for paid games. We did not find a channel that described the hotels outlets or services, nor did we find a written sample menu and description and hours of the restaurants, etc. Maybe we missed them? Free daily delivery of Wall Street Journal and USA Today Overall, we had a nice stay. No super \"wow factor\" but for the most part, everything was positive including the staff.

Located at the top of one of SF's more challenging hills, the RC SF is away from much of the city centre's noise. If, like me, middle age is taking its toll, you can maintain your dignity by ascending the hill by cable car: there is stop right by the hotel. Good points: The hotel is immaculate: spotlessly clean, everything well-maintained, and largely tastefully decorated (though with perhaps too much yellow used in the guest rooms.) The welcome was friendly in an over-rehearsed way usual to top-class US hotels. Assistance with bags was offered, and names used throughout. The room was of a good size, well laid out and, apart from a couple of criticisms outlined below, perfect for our stay. The club lounge is an excellent idea, offering 4 food \"presentations\" (their buzzword, not mine) throughout the day, including an excellent breakfast offering and concierge service. Less good: The room had a slight foody odour. I never did work out the cause. On one morning, a workman was clambering about on the roof at 07:20! As we were on the top floor, the noise was highly intrusive. A complaint to the management led to their immediate offer of reducing the bill by one night's room charge and tax. Impressive. Other negatives are minor: Wifi was free but poor reception; the colour yellow was over-used in the room; the Bose iPod dock in the living room should have been matched in the bedroom - does anyone still carry CDs with them?

This hotel is located in a perfect location for sightseeing - close to most attractions and yet away from all the traffic/noise. The room was nicely appointed and the service was good. It is located on top of a very steep hill, but we used it to our advantage. We walked down to nearby restaurants for dinner and hike up the hill. By the time we reached our room, we weren't so stuffed anymore. :-) The suite we stayed was spacious and appreciated all the closet space. However, as a previous reviewer had stated, this property lacked the \"wow\" factor and is not one of our memorable properties like FS Maui or FS Hualalai. Granted that it is a hotel in a city, not a resort, it may not be a fair comparison. But while the amenities were good and staff was friendly, a certain element was missing. It's hard to put a finger on it, but I think it'd be best to summarize it as attention to little details. Here, we felt the staff was courteous (probably because they were trained to do so) but they didn't really go out of their way to help us. For example, there is a greeter at the front door who stands there and say \"have a nice day\". One morning, while waiting for our car outside, I realized I wanted to ask a question to Concierge. When I ran back into the hotel, the same gentleman who had just greeted me less than 2 minutes ago didn't recognize me and said the same perfunctory \"have a nice day\". One more example, the suite had a nice coffeemaker right at the door. So, one evening, I decided to brew a cup, only to realize that the water reservoir in the coffeemaker was not clean at all (it was actually filthy!). Ritz Carlton SF was a great hotel for our trip. Would we stay here again when we're in SF? Probably. Did we leave feeling \"I can't wait until I come back here again\"? No. And I think that's the difference that sets those \"memorable\" hotels apart.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cLuxury on the Hill\u201d", "Author": "travelduck111", "ReviewID": "UR37101485", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and at the Ritz. The hotel was luxurious, in a great location, and - hold on to your feathers - reasonably priced. Yes, I gave the hotel five stars (quacks) as it was everything as expected. But, I have to say that I agree with some previous reviews that it was missing that certain \"wow\" factor. While it was certainly Ritz quality, I would not necessarily remember this hotel as I would other properties, i.e. the Four Seasons Maui. I was lucky to pay $169/night on the website but honestly I would have been disappointed had I paid a rack rate of over $300/night. Please enjoy everyone's favorite Travel Duck tips below: 1. I would highly suggest taking a cab to this hotel from SFO - don't even mess with BART. A cab should cost $37 before tip. It should take about 25 minutes from SFO (or in our case 15 minutes since the taxi driver was an absolute madman!) 2. The hotel is almost at the top of Nob Hill. Folks, if you have never been to San Francisco before, bring your walking shoes, the hill is very very steep. The location of the hotel is in a high-class area, away from the touristy areas of Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. But, an easy walk to Chinatown which is about 2 blocks away. 3. I would highly recommend touring the city using the Cable Cars - which stop right outside of the entrance to the hotel. Take the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf or down the Hill to the Union Square/Embarcedero area. Buy a day pass for $11 which lets you ride the cable cars and light rail all day. If you care to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, go straight up Stockton street for a nice 20 minute walk with few hills. 4. Okay, the reason why I advised you to walk straight up Stockton Street is that you MUST go to Mama's for breakfast which is at 1701 Stockton by Washington Square. The place is cash only, small, opens at 8:00 a.m. (closed Mon) but has won the award for the best breakfast in San Francisco. Make sure you are in line by around 7:30 or 7:45 at the latest. I would recommend one of the huge omelettes or the french toast with fresh fruit. It certainly beats the expensive room service or buffet at the hotel. Yes, room service at the Ritz is very expensive, $21 for a hamburger, add $4 if you want cheese on it. 5. Oh, all this talk about food makes me forget that I am reviewing the hotel :) We had a room on the 3rd floor which is actually one level below the lobby level. It overlooked the courtyard and was perfectly nice. Again, it did not blow me away but I am not complaining for $169/night. The bath was marble and had excellent shampoos and lotions. I think my wife took some samples on the way out. 6. You cannot go to San Francisco without having Deem (Dim) Sum. Where is the best Deem Sum you ask? It is hands-down at Yank Sing at 101 Spear Street in the financial district (not in Chinatown). You are seated and welcomed with little carts of dumplings, rolls, etc. traveling through the restaurant. Pick what you like and the waiters keep track of your bill on a little card which kind of looks like a bingo card. A word of warning, while extremely delicious, it is costly and the waiters are a bit aggressive. For instance, one piece of sea bass is $16. Most dumplings are between $5-$8. 7. For a great dinner on Nob Hill, I would highly recommend Nob Hill Cafe at Washington and Taylor Streets. It is a small little Italian restaurant which was packed with locals and visitors alike. We had the gnocchi bolognese and the chicken parm which were fantastic and reasonably priced under $20. 8. Are you still reading and taking notes? How would you like to spend a day in Napa/Sonoma on a wine tasting tour? Many of travelers book one of the tour buses which take you to a few commercial wineries in Napa. Not this (travel) duck. I found an amazing gentleman, Mike, who will pick you up at your hotel in San Francisco, drive you to Napa taking you to excellent wineries, and drop you back at your hotel for $30/hour. He took us to a small family owned winery where we had a private tour and even sampled some wine right out the barrel. We had a private tasting at another winery where we sampled at least ten wines for $10/each. He also took us to a gourmet market where we picked up sandwiches for a picnic lunch with a nice view. Mike is a wealth of knowledge about wine and will spend time speaking with you before the trip to ensure that you have a day to remember on your private tour. He even let me sit up front when I felt a little car sick on the ride over. Send me a message if you would like his contact information as he does not have a website. 9. Make sure you check out the \"Painted Ladies\" which are some remarkable houses on Alamo Square in the Haight-Ashbury area. You need to take a cab or get ready for a nice long 45 walk from the hotel. 10. Are you still reading? Of course, you are probably wondering how this travel duck person gets a $169 rate at the Ritz, takes a private winery tour for $30 hour, and eats at the best breakfast, deem sum, and italian restaurants in the city. Well, I do my research and am happy to share my findings with my fellow travelers. Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any other questions. 11. If you are planning on touring Alcatraz, make sure you book the tour in advance. A lot of the tours were sold out when we got there.

This was provided as a gracious concession by the Concierge Team, and we did appreciate it. However, I feel there should be a Kids Club Menu as a standard amenity. Nothing elaborate, just a few favourite items. I found the Concierge Team on the Reception Floor of the Hotel to be incredibly aloof. On more than one occasion, I had to wait for 2 Concierges to complete conversations with each other, before turning towards me. Questions were answered with the bare minimum of attention, and I thought this quality of service unusual for a Ritz Carlton property. Housekeeping service is very good at this Hotel.

The hotel itself occupies a very nice location, midway on Nob Hill facing the skyscrapers of the financial district. The decor could be described on the stuffy side, but everything was incredibly comfortable and well kept. The room itself was reasonably sized, but certainly not large. It had a residential feel, somewhat like that of a wealthy friend's townhouse. Linens were of high quality, and soundproofing was excellent. I don't know if it was because of the light occupancy, but I never heard some much as a peep once inside my room. Overall service was good, but not superb. It lacked the \"wow\" factor that I've become accustomed to at many high end hotels. One night was a particular example - after arriving back from dinner, I walked back to my room without receiving a single recognition or \"good evening\" from a staff member, although I passed several along the way. Staying at other Ritz Carlton properties, I often found it impossible to avoid staff member greetings, but this was not the case. It may appear a minor quibble, but that's what give high end properties a certain panache - the high \"touch\" level. Although the service was very competent, this particular property lacked that \"touch\". Daily breakfast in the Lobby Lounge was always very good. Service was somewhat disorganized on the first morning, which was an exceptionally busy weekend. Food was of high quality and very well presented. My juice and coffee cups were never empty.

Since he asked my last name, I thought he would pull out my reservation, not really. Checkin was not busy, but there is some guest seems like taking forever, I just stood there for 15 min, no chair around to sit and wait, until there is another person come in for checkin, then the front desk called up for another agent. Second down point. I had reserved a king size bed, but was told they got me a junior suite with 2 queen beds. I asked if i can still get a king (since I am by myself, what is the point of having 2 beds ?) He told me if I get a king, the room would be smaller, so I took his offer. Got to the room on 6th floor, (the lobby is on the 4th floor), the queen size bed looks like a twin bed to be, much narrower than my full size bed at home. I don't really know what is really a juior suite, it just looks like I got extra sitting area. Bathroom is big, and since it is so big, I can't understand why they couldn't have separate tub and shower ? Bvlgari White Tea toiletries is the best of all, but Internet cost $12.95 per day. First night turn down there are two bottles of water, and slippers on the side. But no chocolates, and no refill of toiletries. Third down point. Since I have a $60 credit for breakfast, I got to be able to eat the most expensive item on the menus, lobster scramble, it was very good indeed, it cost $30, I also order orange juice and tea, which comes to $6 and $7 each, and the total bill after tax cost $47, that is the most expensive breakfest I ever had.

Someone did call when I first arrived to the room the first day to ask if I feel comfortable in the room, and also the second day evening to see if I need printing my boarding pass, assist my luggage when I check out the next day, that's about it. However, checked out on the third day morning, no one standby to assist luggage, no one ask if I need a car or cab, the front fesk did not even ask how was my stay, just look too cold as Ritz Carlton staff.

We had an interior view room. In many city hotels this is the kiss of death, and you look out onto a dreary courtyard or \"air shaft.\" At the Ritz SF I actually prefer the Courtyard view----its a really pretty landscaped courtyard with semi-permanent white party tent in the middle. Wonderful, classic lobby. One of my favorite experiences at the Ritz SFwas having evening cocktails in the Lobby Lounge----very sophisticated room, well-mixed cocktails, perfectly elegant. Service is incredible. When you check in, after giving your name to bellhop in driveway, they greet you by name when you walk in the front door.One of the other reviewers found this a bit hokey or over-the-top. I did not.

We visited SFO in March during our daughters' spring break. We booked a club level room and was so glad that we did. What a wonderful group of people on the club level. The food presentations that they provide are wonderful for adults but kids probably won't want to eat that fancy stuff. Never fear, just ask for a kids club menu. They will make them a PB&J, mac & cheese, or a deli sandwich for the kids but you will have to ask for it. The club has something for everybody. They also provide late afternoon cocktails for the adults with a martini menu, wine, and all of the call brands of liquor. They also have a great pool and spa area on the 1st floor so bring your flip flops and suit. Our room was a junior suite on the 7th floor and was approx. 600 - 700 square ft. The hotel provided a roll away for our daughter. There was a love seat and chair in the room but they were not pull out beds. The only thing that I could have recommended to the hotel is that we would have preferred the room have a pull-out sofa as opposed to a roll away but it was really such a small detail and wasn't an issue at all. Our room was quiet too. We did hear the cable car going by and some limited traffic but it really was muffled. Besides, hearing those cable cars just adds to the charm of the city. The cable line runs just a block away from the hotel and is just on the edge of China Town. We tried one chinese restaurant called R & G that the concierge recommended to us. I had the salt & pepper lobstser and my husband had lemon chicken. My meal was tasty but they prepare it by frying the entire lobster and brought the head and all to the table. I don't know about you but I don't want to know what it looked like in it's natural state as it's sitting on my plate. Our waitress was nice enough to remove the lobster head for us. The lemon chicken was a little on the dry side but overall pretty good. Oriental Pearl was another restaurant that the hotel recommends. Union square is about 3 blocks away from the Ritz. Bring your walkin' shoes! When returning to the hotel you will climb straight up hill and gets your heart pumpin. The hotel was absolutely fabulous and all of the Ritz staff bent over backwards to anticipate our needs and requests. San Francisco is our new favorite city and I can't wait to come back.

The Ritz Carlton is a beautiful hotel! The lobby is gorgeous and the hallways are decorated with artwork from local artists that depict famous landmarks and scenes. After flying into San Fran from NYC it was late and all of the restaurants were closed luckily there is 24 hour room service! It is expensive. My husband and I ordered: (salty) chicken fingers and fries, cheeseburger/fries along with two sodas and it came to $60. I later read the fine print on the receipt and there is a $4 delivery charge so I think there is no need to tip? I did anyway. I also ordered room service the next day for breakfast which was a 3 egg omelet (cheese, spinach) along w/toast and a coffee that came to $40. After the first day no more room service, though I must say the breakfast was superb. The room was spacious and the sheets were phenomenal (400 thread count, make it hard to get out of bed). The Ritz also has different pillows to accommodate you (fluffy, soft, hard). The room had a 32' flat screen television with a wide selection of movies to order from. Wireless internet service is available. The room was also equipped with a Bose system that allowed you to plug in your ipod. Bulgari also provides all of your toiletries. I loved the turn down service! I would come back to my room exhausted and have chocolates on my bed, a copy of the latest headlines from the New York Times, and the local jazz station playing. It was so relaxing and thoughtful. The location is perfect and a 2 minute walking distance to Chinatown, Union Square (tons of shopping), bus stops, trolley stops,and Grace Cathedral. The entire staff was very knowledgeable. I needed walking directions to the murals on balmy avenue and there was a line at the concierge (also extremely helpful) so one of the bellhops just asked how can I help you? How awesome is that? He gave me directions and I was on my way. I wish I had gotten his name because he was very helpful. The cleaning staff was awesome, I think my cleaning ladies name was Yalitza? she was phenomenal. The only problem I had with my room (#360) was that it is what I would consider the bottom floor. In order to access the room you have to take the elevator one floor down to the 3rd floor (which I think is the conference room floor), then walk down some stairs to access my room. It was directly across from the kitchen? and above the beautiful courtyard. Besides the steps which is not recommended for disabled visitors, it was loud on the last 2 days of my stay. There might have been a wedding or some function that lasted what seemed like 3 in the morning. I also think hotel guests would go there to have a smoke or drink with friends which equals loud noise. To be honest I expect to have a great room at the Ritz especially for someone who pays $500 a night. I was a tad bit disappointed in the room. I am sure I could have switched rooms but it was late and I did not expect to hear noise two nights in a row. I have visited the Ritz Carlton in New Orleans and they are all beautiful hotels with attentive staff. All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Ritz Carlton and I would visit again. I hope this review helps someone. Happy Travels! *There is parking available at the Ritz but it costs $60 a day you can park for $40 a day around the corner at St. Mary's parking lot.

We were dropped off in the scruffiest van from the airport imaginable, yet were still welcomed like five star guests. Within a few minutes of checking in we were greated by our actual names. The attention to detail and service of all the Ritz staff was amazing. On arrival in our room there was champagne and chocolates and a lovely card from guest services congratulating us on our marriage. Yes, I know that all these things are finely tuned marketing ploys, but it never once felt like that. I can honestly say that every member of staff from the cleaners to management were friendly, helpful and extremely professional. Our room (225) was of a nice size, clean and had a view of the terrace and some of the San Fran buildings. Nothing was too much trouble for the Ritz team, and to be honest, it spoiled me for the rest of the honeymoon, as no other hotel could meet their standards! The lounge bar provided fantastic cocktails (their Ritz Cosmo has to be tried!) and the lounge food menu was actually reasonably priced for such a high end hotel. We had a lovely meal in the terrace dining room, although couldn't try the food in the dining room as this was closed for a few weeks (though this was a highly priced menu).

We had high expectations having stayed at the Ritz Carlton In Bahrain. Overall, we felt that the hotel met our expectations given the fact the city was bursting at the seams! Especially good service from concierge (David). One of the notable down sides was that although they rate child-friendliness highly on their website - this did not actually happen in practice. Reception staff were unaware of their POLO scheme and I had to ask for the gadgets to make the room child-friendly, even though I had registered for the scheme online. No kids menu in the hotel room to make ordering room service for children easier. This was not rectified even after I highlighted it to them. Also huge mis-communication during reception staff hand-over led to our baby-sitter being left waiting at reception for 45 minutes and therefore making us late for our dinner reservation at 'Chez Panisse' (I don't even think the reception staff were aware of the inconvenience caused)! Although this may sound like the makings of a bad review, we were won over by the spa and pool, great breakfast and room service, spacious classically decorated one bedroom suite - ask for a high level courtyard view (we stayed non-club as the standard prices had been hiked up by $200 due to increased demand caused by the conference). If compared with the Omni which rates No. 1 on this site - I think that the Ritz Carlton was better value for money because a non-club one bed suite (2 rooms) at the Ritz costs the same as California suite (L-shaped room) at the Omni. The Omni has no spa/pool and location not that great. If you have the money to spend I would definitely recommend the hotel for location (close to cable cars, china town, shopping), good knowledgeable staff (with prompting), pool and spa, great playground a few blocks away reachable by cable car.

Then the strawberry or lemon infused drinking water is so refreshing. Our baby loved the warm pool. The indoor lap pool is very nice and the gym is well equipped. Service: I honestly didn't have any expectations for the service, since our previous experience was only okay, with some problems. This time, we spent two nights for our wedding anniversay, which I mentioned during the reservation, but I didn't ask for anything. However, there were chocolate covered strawberries in our room upon arrival, a personalized CD with music from the year we married, flower petals on the bed at turndown, and several other flourishes.

With all of the amenities offered at this hotel, it seems like free internet access should be an expectation. I actually found a business center with free internet access similar to what used to be offered at the Ritz Carlton at the nearby Mandarian Oriental Hotel where I used their computers. The Ritz definitely beats this hotel in nearly all aspects, except the free access to the business center. Furthermore, I noticed some changes in the Lobby Lounge. I have noticed a trend in the Ritz Carlton chain that properties are undergoing major renovations as the classic is being removed and the modern is being introduced. Some hotels like the Ritz in Laguna Niguel look more like W Hotels now. Fortunately, in my opinion the San Francisco hotel has resisted such extreme changes. The guest rooms have been tastefully redone, while maintaing a classic theme, and the lobby continues to define elegance. I just noticed in the Lounge that there were empty walls where pictures used to hang and new lampshades, and I hope that they are not the start of a new identity for the space. Another difference I saw during my week at the hotel was that there was no longer any live piano entertainment at night replaced with a CD recoring of \"W Hotel-style\" music that was definitely not suitable for the Ritz Carlton. I don't want to sound negative at all. My stay was basically perfect. I just hope to see that the Ritz Carlton continues to maintain its identity as it has for the past 16 years.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLoved it with our little ones\u201d", "Author": "Sweetpeasmom", "ReviewID": "UR12224895", "Content": "We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in September 2007 with our 3 children (3 and under).

It had been several years since my last stay, so I was curious to see how the hotel had aged. My review of the property follows. The RC SF is located on Stockton St. between California and Pine mid way up Nob Hill. It is an impressive looking structure with the entrance and handsome lobby area located on the fourth (street) level of the hotel. There is construction ongoing at the corner of California and Stockton, but it appeared to be unconnected to the hotel and was not (other than being an eyesore) a bother. We arrived around 1 p.m. and check in at the front desk was painless. We had 2 rooms reserved, a Club floor executive suite with a nearby club king room. The suite was ready for occupancy, but the king was not. Both rooms were located on the 8th floor which is the actual location of the club lounge, though I think the RC classifies the 7th and 9th as club floors as well. The elevator for the 8th floor is via keyed access and opens directly into the lounge area where we were greeted warmly by the club concierge. Those of you who have stayed on the club floor of an RC know the drill. There is a light breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and after dinner serving served at appropriate times with coffee, tea, soft drinks, beer, wine and cocktails available all day. The rate runs about $150 a night more than a standard room, but I generally find it worth the money. While there was always a good variety of sandwiches, crudit\u00c3\u00a9s, cheeses and desserts at the RC SF, the menu selection never seemed to change much during our stay. Still, it is a pleasant space and a popular gathering spot. The lounge is \"child friendly\" which made it a bit active during parts of our stay. Not bothersome really, but active. Our suite was in the typical RC \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd configuration. The door opened into a small foyer with a closet and half bath. The foyer opened up into a living room with a desk, a love seat and 2 arm chairs. The window provided a view of\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well, not much. (I have stayed at the RC SF several times on several different floors and have never had a view of much of anything except buildings.) No balcony, but the windows did open about 3 inches to allow a breeze. A glass paneled door with sheer curtains separated the living room from the bedroom, which was nice sized with what I found to be a very comfortable king bed. The dressing area and bath (with separate tub and shower) was behind the bed. The suite was clean and fairly well maintained. A few pulls in the carpet and a bit of torn fabric, but nothing too bad. Other than the bed, the furniture was not extremely comfortable and needed updating, I felt. New flat panel TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were present in both the living area and bedroom. Wireless internet at $12.95 a day was available, but somewhat slow. The bathroom was a bit cramped and poorly laid out, I thought, but serviceable. Good water pressure during our stay. The RC SF has a nice spa with the usual services available. It also has a very good fine dining restaurant on par with other RC properties. There is a talented harpist in the lobby bar during the afternoon and an excellent sushi chef there during the evening. There is a house car available for trips within a mile or so of the hotel. The biggest substantive complaint I had during our stay was the noise level in the room. I know that others on this site have made the same remark. The windows appear to be orginal equipment (If I recall the property opened in 1996) and do not have a great deal of insulation. There was a great deal of bleed through street noise at all hours of the day and night, which was annoying. Now on to being picky. Service at the hotel started off great and then went downhill. I was quite impressed with Valentine, the club concierge, and the front desk and bell staff...Jason and Joel at the front door were especially nice and helpful. However, the staff members at the lobby lounge and outdoor patio off the terrace bar (on the second floor in the courtyard) were weak. Several servers at the lobby bar were standing around chatting with one another, but not doing a good job watching the floor. Still, the service at the lobby lounge was stellar compared to the patio outside the terrace bar. I attempted to enjoy a spectacular afternoon there with a cocktail but could not get anyone to wait on me. When I finally asked for a drink from a passing staff member (who apparently did not work the patio) I was told to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go upstairs to the lobby bar to get a drink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and bring it back. Odd, I thought, as there were people eating (inside and out) at the terrace restaurant. Certainly not the level of service I expect from the RC. I was also disappointed in the servicing of the room. We left early one morning and did not return until 4 p.m. only to find that neither room had been cleaned. When I called the front desk to inquire when the rooms would be cleaned, I was told that I should have asked for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153early\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service. Huh? Again, these are picky comments. As I am sure Mr. Roa (whom I respect for responding to the posts on this site) will admit, however, it is the fine details that separate a 4 star from a 5 star property. In the interest of full disclosure, I admit to being a fan of the RC chain and have stayed at dozen or so of their properties around the country. (Pentagon City and Cancun being 2 of my favorites.) To be frank, though, I prefer the Huntington Hotel in San Francisco. It is up the street at the top of Nob Hill on California. Smaller, independently owned, with a wonderful view from the rooms that front California (Grace Cathedrial and the park, with the bay visible in the distance from rooms on the higher floors) and well kept (although, in fairness, somewhat dated) rooms. Impeccable service. While there is no club floor, the Big 4 bar and restaurant compensate by being clubby and wonderful. Plus, even though my favorite rooms there front busy California St., they are much quieter due to heavy, insulated windows. I would have stayed there this trip, but booked late and the property was full. So, how has the RC SF aged since it opened in the mid 90\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s? Fairly well, I think, with the exceptions noted above. I give it a solid 4 rating. If they take care of the noise problem and work a bit on service issues, it will be a 5. All in all it was a pleasant stay. I hope this has been helpful and informative.

The water cooler was filled with ice water and slices of orange and cucumber. Delicious. The locker rooms and showers were impeccably clean and well appointed. Check-Out: despite being busy on the day that we checked out, the hotel was able to accommodate our request to leave an hour later than the scheduled check-out time.

For many years my profession was customer satisfaction research where I administered and reported feedback from thousands of customer satisfaction surveys, interviews, and focus groups. I lead many, many customer service improvement teams for various industries. I've never experienced such customer service perfection. Every employee over the five days I was at the hotel was exceptionally friendly, concerned, knowledgeable, poised, and extremely well-trained. I kept trying to find a flaw and presented the staff with a number of requests and challenges. They passed each test with flying colors. RATES AND PACKAGES: This hotel is very expensive. However, compared to its main rival, the Four Seasons, the Ritz is less expensive. I highly recommend checking the hotel's website for a package. Try to get as many services included in your room rate as possible because every extra service you use is very expensive. I booked the \"Bed and Breakfast\" package which included a $55.00 per day /per room credit for breakfast, valet parking (at least 50.00 per day), and free internet access - about 13.00 per day. My package rate was $429 which I felt was a very good deal for this hotel. TIP: If you get a package, you will most likely be provided with a letter at registration that explains / confirms what your package rate includes. I recommend you read this carefully. The website did not tell me that the internet was included in my package. This detail was in the letter handed to me when I registered. Also, check the hotel's website frequently as rates can change quickly. If the hotel is not getting enough bookings for a time period, the rates may fall and the packages offer more services for less money. I was not going to stay at this hotel because I couldn't get a guaranteed king bedded room on the Club Level. However, a few days before arriving, I checked the website again and the \"Bed and Breakfast\" package was offered at $429. I thought it was a great deal so I cancelled my reservations at a 4-Star hotel and stayed at the Ritz instead. PUBLIC AREAS: Gorgeous and luxurious - - that is if you like traditional furnishings. The Ritz does traditional better than anyone. It's beautiful and yet avoids being stuffy. I really enjoyed spending time in the public areas of the hotel. ROOMS: If there is one area that did not wow me, it was my room. It was luxurious, large, and every thoughtful ammenity was placed at your finger tips. The very traditional decor, however, is understated to the point of almost being bland. The color scheme is pale yellow, gold, and taupe with white trim and ceilings - - and pretty much everything is one of these colors -- VERY monochromatic. The furnishings are top notch, however, and my room definitely had a luxurious feel and was very, very comfortable, quiet and immaculate. The bed was wonderful and had a feather bed over the mattress. While very nice, other chains - 3 and 4-star chains, are providing similar bedding so this did not stand out as much as perhaps in the past. I want to be clear that I did not dislike anything about the room, but it lacked that \"wow\" factor for me. This is, however, a matter of taste and I had friends who saw the room while I was there and loved it. I liked that my room had a laptop safe, flat screen tv, and a DVD Player. The mini bar actually had items in it that I wanted. It was very well stocked and the products were of a very high quality - - albeit expensive. I didn't mind paying for the quality and convenience it afforded me. ROOM VIEWS: This hotel is situated such that very few rooms will provide panoramic views of S.F. There are also rooms that face into the hotel's courtyard. I was aware of this before I went to the hotel so it was not a problem for me. I would be happy with either since the street views are not that great. BATHROOMS: This hotel opened in 1991. By today's standards, its bathrooms (in most rooms) are not small but not as large as newer hotels. They are, however, luxurious. Apparently some of the larger suites have separate shower and bath tubs. The tubs are larger than usual although not the huge soaking tubs some hotels are providing. Right before my visit to the Ritz-Carlton, I stayed in a 4-Star hotel. The marble bath in this hotel had an enormous soaking tub and shower that were separate. It's not that there is anything wrong with the 5-Star Ritz, it's just that 4-Star competitors are quickly closing the gap in some areas and their rates are very competitive. The Bulgari bath ammenities are wonderful. I rarely notice these when I travel (about 100 nights a year in hotels) but I really liked these and even bought some in the gift shop to have shipped home. FITNESS CENTER: There is a well-equipped fitness center on floor one of the hotel. It has all the usual equipment and a small indoor pool. The treadmills and cross-trainers had individual TVs with headphones provided. The mens' locker room was great with marble everywhere and very nice wood lockers. The steam bath was great! Shower gel, shaving cream, conditioner, shampoo, huge towels, etc. were all provided. SPA: The hotel has a small spa. TIP: If you want to get a spa treatment, I would book as much in advance as possible as treatment rooms are limited. I overheard two telephone conversations where guests were unable to get a massage because everything was booked. VALET: I used the hotel's laurdry/dry cleaning service three times. I was very expensive, but the laundry is in-house and they did a great job and were quick! I turned in some laundry early one morning and it was back by 1:00 or 2:00pm. LOCATION: This hotel is in an excellent location on Nob Hill. You're just a few blocks from everything - - although as one reviewer said, you'll be walking up some steep hills to get back to the hotel. OVERALL, I give this hotel an excellent rating. I recommend it highly as it's one of the best in the luxury category - - especially if you can snag a great package like I did. The Four Seasons may have a few more whistles and bells - - as well as higher rates, but the Ritz is just as wonderful in its own way.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, QC", "Title": "\u201cPerfection\u201d", "Author": "Daoda", "ReviewID": "UR8613613", "Content": "If only every Ritz were of the same quality!

Anyone that, like me, thought that customer service died in the 20th century hasn't stayed at the Ritz-Carlton yet. It is each of the staff member's personal goal to make sure you have everything you need and they try their hardest to satisfy you in every way possible! They really go above and beyond what you'd expect from any hotel or resort, regardless of what you are paying. We stayed on the Club level and I can tell you that it was money well spent. Traveling with a toddler and an 8-year old, it wasn't that easy to just get up and go out to eat three times a day, and the food in the Club Lounge was perfect for us. The five food presentations every day were indescribable! They have a great breakfast display and then lunch and then afternoon tea followed by a caviar and light dinner display and then all topped off by a decadent evening dessert presentation. And when they say presentation, they really do mean a beautiful arrangement of artistically crafted food creations that are as appealing to the eye as they are to the taste-buds. The pool/spa was a wonderful treat as we spent almost two hours everyday down there.

The bathroom was spacious and the Bulgari products were definitely a nice treat. Luxurious bathrobes and slippers were ready for us each day and they even had small sizes for the kids! Even the roll-away bed we ordered was soft and comfortable. As for the location, it was close to just about everything. And any place that was further than walking distance we just hopped in one of the \"House Cars\" and got whisked away in luxury to any place we wanted around the city. This is a great complimentary alternative to taking taxi's everywhere and all you have to do is give them a tip, which you would have to do for a taxi as well. My wife and I really enjoyed being driven to dinner in a brand new Mercedes-Benz S550 and when we were done a quick call to the Hotel and we were being picked up right outside the restaurant. Talk about VIP service! If you do decide to walk to your destination (which we did quite often), be prepared to walk up and down some steep hills. This is to be expected almost anywhere in San Francisco so it's no big surprise. We actually found it a bit fun, while it was challenging at times, to run up the hills while pushing a stroller! Not really a big deal even if you're out of shape like we are.

Rooms are spotlessly clean and large bowls of apples scattered round the hotel to help yourself to. Only couple of sour notes - breakfast is not that great for the rather expensive price you pay. Also, my son had a massage in the spa. When he signed the slip afterwards they had added on for \"therapist services\". Assuming this was a tax of sorts, he then also gave the therapist a tip. Afterwards we discovered that the \"therapist services\" was in fact another way of saying \"gratuity\" (20%). At no point did the staff mention to him that the service was already included and pocketed the extra tip! We had this deducted from the bill when we discovered it. Having said this, though, we had a great stay in a wonderfully located central hotel. Very comfortable and perfect for families. The hills keep you fit anyway and the shopping is fantastic! One word of caution - make sure you book your tickets to Alcatraz before you get there. We didn't, because last time we visited you could easily buy them.

This truly is a wonderfully run hotel with every amenity provided for. There was a misstep at the beginning which should have been addressed but wasn't. We arrived at 3PM for checkin only to be told our room was not quite ready and to check back in about 20 minutes. When we checked back we were told it would be another half hour at least. At that point we should have been offered a drink in the lounge or even a glass of water but they did not do so which surprised me. Upon arrival into our room at 4PM we were delighted to find a large comfortable room with a lovely view toward the front. From that point forward the service was truly the Ritz. We had a breakfast package so took advantage of that the next morning. 37.00 for the Buffet was way to steep for what was offered but that did not seem to affect anyone there except us. We were told we could go to the buffet as part of our package but later learned there is only a 55.00 credit allowed so had to pay the difference. Just another little misstep in an otherwise wonderful experience. The French toast on the regular menu was wonderful so I suggest you skip the buffet and go ala carte instead. The hotel has a Cable car stop right at the corner you can buy either an all day or three day pass to ride since it is 5.00 each way. Check with the Concierge on where to buy the three day pass as you cannot get it on the cable car. We used the system to go all around the city it worked perfectly for us. Parking is pricy at 59.00 a night (yes, 59.00) there is a garage down the street for 32.00 but you cannot go in an out during the day that is why we used the cable car.

But decided this time that I'd try the Ritz that everyone seems to talk about. Checked in on a Friday for a stay till Monday. Upon driving up to the entrance of the hotel, the valet quickly opened the door and asked us whether we wanted to use the hotel's parking service or just park in the public parking lot which isn't very far from the hotel. What I liked is that they didn't automatically assume I wanted to pay $59/night for the hotel's parking service. But ultimately we decided to use the hotel's service because it's so convenient and given that in San Fran $59/night isn't too bad. We checked in at the front desk and everything went smoothly. Everyone greets you with a smile and a \"hello\". But what was interesting and a little bothersome is through my entire stay no one bothered to find out what my name was, only my friend that came with me that the room was booked under. Hmmm.... As stated earlier, the Club Level is great. Food is available nearly all day. You really don't have to go out for any meal if you don't want to. In fact, you'd probably pay $$$'s for similar food. Prosciutto and salmon for breakfast and caviar and foie gras for dinner! What more could you ask for?! The limo service is also great. Hop on for a ride to most anyplace in the city. I don't understand why the other reviewer was upset about tipping, that's the way these folks make their living. If you took a cab it'd cost you as much or more that the tip. So what's the big deal? The room was VERY large compared to other hotels I've stayed in. Bed were very comfortable. The amazing thing is how well the windows insulated noise from the outside. Not sure if this is due to the renovation. However, we could hear folks walking around the hallway if they were talking loudly, but it didn't happen often. Security seemed good. One time I left the door slightly open and security knocked and let me know the door was open. Not bad. All in all it was a pleasant stay. Was it worth the money?

For $125 I was led upstairs, to one of the regular hotel rooms that had the beds taken out and replaced with 2 of their \"grandma chairs\", handed a remote control to the t.v., and told I could change the channel if I wanted.

On admitting that we were unable to finish Chef's Ron Howard's gourmet Valentine's dinner due to 'tiredness' and a surfeit of cocktails, Lisa empathetic to the last, mixed us some stonking Bloody Marys to provide an uplifting 'morning after' breakfast cure. Lisa's Margaritas were also some of the best we have ever had. Ritz Carlton San Francisco is located on Nob Hill, around the corner from The Fairmont and Intercontinental. It is close to the centre of the city and transport is easy and safe. We bought a $49 tourist pass and visited 2 art museums, cruised round Alcatraz and had unlimited transport for the week. The only cabs we hired were to and from the airport. Everything else is eminently reachable. One of the great attractions of this beautiful city is its lack of American sprawl and containment. We checked out 4 Seasons (see separate review) and there is no doubt that in terms of style and ambience, Four Seasons easily leads the way. There is a certain, almost French, overkill to Ritz Carlton decor. It is a stylistic challenge for RC management when the hotel will inevitably seek to attract a younger clientele with greater vigour. The hotels will need to stylistically follow on from the redesigned website. However, this is not to imply that Ritz Carlton is a stuffy hotel. We stayed seven nights and the hotel was positively buzzing 24/7 with no shortage of aforementioned young people enjoying the unbridled service of Ritz Carlton. Whilst one may hesitate over the slightly gaudy ostentation, nothing can detract from the immaculate service. It was very friendly, not the robotic 'my pleasure' scenario and equally not so overbearing that you had to escape to secure private space. Club Lounge breakfasts were not to my taste, despite the availability of rather tasty warm flans. However my wife feasted on the mountains of fresh fruit and smoked salmon. One minor gripe was that the showers were a little tame for a Ritz Carlton. We obtained an excellent flight and hotel deal through Expedia and the current exchange rate makes a USA holiday very alluring. Best restaurants: Ruth's Chris for steaks, Mama's for omelette breakfasts, Sears for coffee, Big 4 @ The Huntington Hotel for succulent crab cakes and wild boar. If you want as much as you can eat Indian food for less than $20, then the wonderful Shalimar is recommended. Avoid 'Top of the Mark' at the Intercontinental. Despite Tammy securing us the best table with magnificent views of San Francisco, my wife and I walked out. Appalling and brusque service, long waiting times in the lobby and menu restricted to two main unappetising dishes.Packed to the rafters with too many punters crammed into too small a space. Art Galleries: Make the trek to the de Young museum. It's worth it. Stunning collection, wonderful building, a work of art in its own right and fabulous views from the top of the Haman Education Tower. You can take flash free pictures too, which is a real bonus for the usually precious art fraternity. The Museum of Modern Art is another iconic building. We took an excellent tour that gave detailed insights into Pollock, Manet and home grown Arneson. Pop across the road to the Buena Yerba Park and enjoy the fountains and Martin Luther King fountain memorial. Wear some Flowers in your Hair: Well no, but a visit to the City Lights bookshop still resonates with a radical flavour that harks back to a bygone era with large volumes of Kerouac and Ginsberg on display. Buy your 'Howl' T shirts here! If you want a really strange piece of local flavour, then visit Cafe Prague on Sunday afternoon at 4.00pm, where Mark Schwarz conducts a poetry reading workshop. Like a sequel to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' a small group of aspiring poets perform their works in a muted, entirely bohemian cafe where the service is as poor as most of the poems. Try to contain your disbelief. You could not script this bizarre collection of poetically touched individuals. Art House Cinema: The Lumiere is well worth a visit if you are an outside the mainstream movie afficianado. We saw the most amazing Thai melodrama 'Tears of the Black Tiger' here. Shopping: Show your room key to the 'Pack and Wrap' sections at Macy's and secure an 11% discount on all your purchases. Finally stay at the Ritz Carlton if you can.

We had a yearly function we always attend in the City. We usually stay at a hotel on Nob Hill, but decided after numerous stays with bad service we would try a new hotel. I love to stay at the older hotels in the City, I am not into modern. The Ritz had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. We had booked a club level suite, and right from the start we were well taken care of. Within two days of booking a club conceirge had contacted us to make arrangements for anything we needed. She made sure we had our spa teartments booked, dinner reservations, and transportation from the hotel. The club level is the way to go. The food presentations throughout the day are excellent. When we needed further help all staff was there to take care of us. My husband found at 4:00 on a Saturday that he had grabbed a suit shirt instead of his tuxedo shirt. The club level manager was very helpful in getting him transportation to Union Square, and he was back in time and ready to leave for our 4:30 function. There is no salon at the hotel, but the conceirge, Sara, found a gentlemen from a nearby salon to help me with an updo for the evening. He came straight to the room. Thank you Daniel from Maiden Lane Salon. We were always taken care of at the hotel. We drink major amounts of water, and we had worked out in the fitness room downstairs before dinner. When we returned back up to our room, we stopped on the club floor on our way to get bottles of water to drink. We were surprised when we came back the first evening after dinner to find all of our empty full size water bottles on our nightstands replaced with new ones and an extra for each of us. Room Service was very quick, and they were quick to return when we called to clear our dishes. We have always stayed for the last 11 years at the Mark Hopkins at least 3 times a year. Some of the same people still work there to this day. They do not remember who you are, room service is very slow, and they have moved the club lounge to the lobby level. The Ritz is so much better, and we have found our new hotel of choice in San Francisco. The service is amazing, the staff is very cordial and helpful. It would just be nice if they had a better spa, and offered a salon on the premises. We are looking at taking our daughter there on her birthday to spend the night and partake in the afternoon tea.

Last time our friend couldn't get us in the \"main\" dining room so we had dinner in the lower dining room for a fixed price meal at $125/person. The food was mediocre and the service abysmal. Somehow we were talked into dining at the Ritz again this year. We balked but said if we could be assured we'd be in the main dining room, we'd do it. Our friend got the reservations and away we went. I can't say the food was bad and I must say the service was very good. I can say that I had been led to believe that the room was beautiful and we'd have a lovely room to dine in. Somehow our party was placed in a corner with a much-too-large table where you had to strain to hear your table companions. There was a tiny (and I do mean tiny) vase of little white tulips sitting in the middle of the large table, looking very forlorn. Oh, the tiny portions were very good, I must say. When it came time for the palate cleanser, though, our group completely lost it. The waiters came out with huge white charger-like bowls and in the exact center of each was half a teaspoon of sorbet along with three pomegranate seeds artfully placed alongside! They ceremoniously placed them in front of each of us. We howled with laughter. My husband yanked out our digital camera and took a picture. We have subsequently shown it to many friends. The photo always draws screams of laughter. Next came the dessert, followed by a huge bill. Believe me, we have no problem enjoying and paying for an expensive meal. This, however, was a comical insult that we will not repeat.

From the moment we arrived at SFO (1am) to the time we left, we were treated like royalty. (I was actually contacted before my arrival via e-mail to see if I needed anything for our stay!). Concierge arranged for a limo to pick us up at the airport. After a quick check-in, we went to our suite where a dish of chocolate covered strawberries, bottles of fruit juices on ice and a handwritten welcome note from the Chief Concierge were waiting. (The Chief Concierge is also a member of the Les Clefs d'Or!!) Our suite was beautiful (see 9/8/2005 review for details). Since we were there for wedding, we were asked if we needed anything pressed and they were taken downstairs immediately (this was about 2:30am). We were told that the garments would be brought back to the room the next morning at 10:30am. The funniest part about it was that even though I was expecting the clothing, the phone rang at precisely 10:30am and I was told that housekeeping was outside my door. I was asked if it was alright if they rang the doorbell to the suite! Once I said, \"Sure!\", the bell rang. I wondered how they did that when I noticed that the person was wearing an earpiece - like the secret service!! We hosted a small pre-wedding party in our suite and the service was incredible! Nothing was overlooked - the correct number of champagne, water and port glasses, bottles of spring water and sodas/snacks for the kids. Room service did an excellent job in preparing everything!! Concierge also set up a car to take us to and from the wedding (Legion of Honor/Art Museum) so we didn't have to worry about a taxi. It was a good thing as many guests were stranded because taxis would not go to the area after 11pm! Our driver didn't hesitate when I asked if it was alright to offer other guests a ride back with us. And upon our return, the room was spotless as all the dishes and glassware were cleaned up from the pre-wedding party. Any bottled drinks that were left over were neatly placed on the bar with a few clean glasses and napkins. I have to admit that I cringed when I read a continental breakfast was served in the Club Lounge and avoided it the first two days. (I like to have some variety of egg for breakfast while on vacation). But one day we decided to take a peek. I was surprised when I found quiche! And not only did they offer quiche, but they offered two different kinds - mushroom or ham with cheese! (We did enjoy the Jazz Sunday Brunch though - just make sure you make reservations ahead of time!). The Club Lounge was a nice place to sip a glass of wine in the afternoon or grab some milk and cookies at 1am. The afternoon \"presentation\" was phenomenal - sushi, oysters on the half shell, cheeses, caviar and a multitude of other hors d'oeuvres. When I had mentioned to the Club Concierge that I was going to host a pre-wedding party in my suite, they offered to reserve an area of the Club Lounge for me! I politely declined as I didn't want to impose on the other guests. But I was floored by such an offer. The other thing that surprised me was that I was always addressed by name. I had heard that about the Ritz-Carlton but never believed it.

Traveling with 2 small children under the age of 3 can be a challenge, and we had never stayed at a Ritz Carlton with our kids (we usually opt for the Four Seasons). But using the American Express Platinum program we got a reasonable rate for a suite and the upgrades through the program (early check in, late check out, room upgrade if available, breakfast credit, resort amenity) were really nice. The suite was fantastic. It was 1100 square feet with a very large living room with a 1/2 bathroom. There were french doors that separated the living area from the bedroom area. The bedroom area was a good size and also had a full bathroom. The only strange thing about the bathroom for me was that the shower and toliet were separated from the rest of the bathroom. I thought that was a bit odd (I'm used the the toliet being separate from the bathroom, but not used to having the shower and toliet together). In addition, between the bathroom and bedroom there was a sizeable dressing area... with a vanity, dresser drawers and closets. The dressing area was so large that we were able to put a rollaway bed in it with plenty of room to spare (the baby and toddler had to be separated one night ... they were waking each other up). Note: the living room was plenty large enough to accomodate a rollaway bed and a full size crib. The service was impeccable, very attentive. We ate at the Terrace restaurant for breakfast and I was impressed with the food, but most impressed with the kids menu. It had more than the usual chicken fingers/pizza offerings. And for breakfast, my daughter order the scrambled eggs with sausage off the kids menu and I ordered the same off the regular menu. When they brought the food to our table, her plate was identical to mine... just $9 cheaper! All facilities were top notch and my daugther was most impressed with the indoor pool. She couldn't stop talking about it. My only gripe about the place, they have a $55 (+ $7 tax) a day parking charge. That seemed ridiculous, even for a city like San Francisco. If you are looking for a good place to stay with the family, I would recommend the Ritz.

The color schemes are all warm and inviting, and as luxurious as the furnishings and decor are you will never feel as if the hotel is stuffy or cold. The staff is absolutely top-notch! We spent the extra for a club level room, and were pleasantly surprised by their daily offerings. It is well worth the extra expense- we had our (expansive) continental breakfast every morning. Most hotels would call this breakfast layout a buffet as so many items were offered. The lunches, teas, cocktail hours were all delightful. The staff was fastidious about keeping the serving trays filled and as busy as the club room would get was always picking up after you, offering you beverage service, etc. The club staff was phenomenal!

What we got was the worse vacation of our lives. We were very disapointed. The smell of the place is overwhelming including the lobby, hallways, elevator, and our room. The room smelled of mold and mildew. The ceiling had water stains all over them assuming the room above had a major leak. There were unidentifiable bugs everywhere including the bed. The carpet looked and smelled like it had never been cleaned, it was horrible and we were litterally scared to take our shoes off. We booked a queen bed and got 2 twins, I guess we were suppose to scoot them together I'm not for sure. The curtain that covered the balcony doors was broke so you could see the outside leaving everybody outside seeing in. Not very comforting to say the least. Upon inspecting the curtain we discovered that the sliding doors to the balcony did not lock this was also not very comforting. Outside directly on the balcony somebody felt that they needed to deposit their gum on the floor. This was not smashed gum but freshly chewed gum leaving us to come to the conclusion that either the cleaning crew did not bother to clean it up or they left it themselves. Either way thumbs down to the cleaning people. The room had a refrigerator and we were happy to see that although we heard it before we actually saw it. I think the people a block away also heard the refrigerator. It had some nice rusty spots decorating it also. I don't think that any of the tile had ever been properly secured to the floor as most them were up and displaced. The bathroom was a whole other story in itself. I have never in my entire life seen a bathroom in a hotel more disgusting than this. Absolutely horrible. There were what appeared to be 2 vents on the ceiling. Both were rusted so bad they were falling out of the ceiling. Ring around the tub, again thumbs down to the cleaning crew. If you were brave enough to actually stay there and shower, which we didn't, the water was black/brown. I am no plumber but I know this is nasty. The walls literally had spit on them. How nasty and disgusting is that? I mean what do the cleaning people actually clean when they go in these rooms? I'm guessing nothing. Not only did our sliding doors not lock the main entrance did not lock either. Feel safe now? After seeing the disaster we had paid for we decide it would be cleaner and safer if we stayed in the car. I called the front desk and told the man that we were going somewhere else and would not be staying there, EVER. The man just says ok. Thats it. He never asked me why. What kind of service is that? I had to go through hotels.com to get a refund, which by the way they were great in helping me. We moved down the street to Georgian Inn (GREAT PLACE). I also have something else to say. I noticed the hotel manager had responded to a few of these complaints saying sorry and that he would address the problem. I also noticed the dates on them and they are pretty wide spread. Sounds like some major changes need to be made before this hotel disapears like the others in Daytona. Maybe better managment and more powerful cleaning tools or something. This is the worse hotel I have ever seen and I would recomend that nobody ever waste any money staying there. You will just be left leaving a bad review like me. You could not have paid me to stay there.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterbury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cDISGUSTING\u201d", "Author": "Erin G", "ReviewID": "UR126416697", "Content": "Here's the letter I wrote to the GM & Sales Manager. I think it speaks for itself. No one should stay here. EVER. I'd like to take a few minutes to let you know just how horrible my stay at the Bermuda House in Daytona Beach, FL 3/14/12-3/17/12 was. I've never been moved to actually complain about accomodations before, always chalking anything negative up to all places have there issues. This time, however, was VERY different. We stayed in Room #117, under the name Kim DeLauri. We were one of 2 couple that booked two rooms. My 1st morning in the shower there was an ant-type bug in the shower with me and it was no big deal~we were in FL and we were on a ground floor. I got out of the shower, went to the counter where the microwave was, and there was another, different type bug. Then, I'm reading on the bed and reach over for my soda on the night stand and there are 2 ROACHES on the nightstand. I LITERALLY turn my head to the left and another ROACH runs across the bedspread. After screaming for my boyfriend to kill them & jumping to pack up everything we have with us immdeiately, we see a 4th ROACH running down the room divider door. Being that it was Daytona Beach during Bike Week, we were VERY aware that there was NOWHERE ELSE to stay for the night, we stayed, WIDE AWAKE, with everything but the sheets on the bed so we could immediately see any bugs that might be there. It was a HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING NIGHT. This, coupled with the DISGUSTING, rusty, filthy conditions of the bathroom and overall dirty public bathroom stench that filled the room are the reasons that I'd NEVER consider even having another conversation about the Bermuda House in Daytona Beach, FL, other than to steer EVERYONE I know away from the disgusting place that it is. I am going to send my complaints to any- and everyone I can to report the conditions, as they are unfit for anything that breathes, other than the staff that keep it running to suck a gutter-worthy level. I am also going to post this review on every site I can as no one should make one penny off of this PIT. It should be demolished & whomever is responsible for it should be ashamed that they allow it to function as it does. Or, better yet, they should be made to stay there themselves.

When I did the day before we left, I was fairly horrified and with some trepidation (and not wanting to miss Bike Week), I agreed to share a room with him. Both of us went armed. Upon our arrival and afterwards, our fears were both confirmed and dispelled. Basically, this hotel is old and weary and probably beyond the point of being economically refurbishable due to its extensive deterioration from the the heat and humidity... and possibly from neglect. Just imagine trying to replace hundreds of rust stained bath tubs and corroded fixtures Imagine trying to repair thousands of square feet of walls with plaster swollen and cracked from the moisture. Better to tear it down and build a new hotel. So while many of the reviews are pretty accurate - although thankfully we found no bed bugs or other nasty critters, live or dead - there is a positive side to the story. First, the staff was pretty nice and did their very best to make us comfortable. Second, everything worked okay - the water was hot, the door locked when we pushed it hard, the TV worked and the refrigerator kept the beer cold. Third, the swimming pool is probably the best one for miles around - big, 8 feet deep, clean and cold and no one around to keep you from diving. Fourth, there's a Denny's within walking distance if you need more early morning sustenance than a bagel or a muffin, juice and coffee, because the \"continental breakfast\" is pretty sparse. But the coffee is ready at 7 AM sharp. Fifth, you can walk to the beach and go swimming in the ocean right out back. For a trip like we made, this place was perfectly acceptable and doesn't deserve some of the bad ratings. It's a lot better than sleeping in a campground next to your Harley. For a first trip with you new lady friend or for a honeymoon, it's probably advisable to choose another hotel if you want your relationship to last more than a week. For our purpose, the place was fine... and the pool was great!

We decided to be fair and rule out the very best reviews and the very worst, which could be possible reviews written by the hotel itself or by rival hotels. That being said, this was one of the worst hotels we've stayed in. Ever. First off.... The biggest criteria for us was a balcony attached to our oceanfront room, a tiki bar at the pool, and free continental breakfast. This hotel said they had all these things. Bingo! We knew the price was really low ($65.99 a night for 2 queen beds oceanfront with balcony) but figured we could deal with a little rust on the fixtures and older furniture for the location and price. Upon check-in, we were informed that they were undergoing renovations and all balconies in the main tower were screwed shut. Wha? Nothing was mentioned about that on the website. They knew that, but apologized and offered us an oceanview room with a balcony, or our original room with no balcony. We took keys to both and checked them out. The oceanfront room was in the main tower on the 8th (top) floor. The railing outside the room overlooking the pool was very loose. We were traveling with our 14 yr old son and his friend, so we figured this was a disaster waiting to happen and went down to the oceanview room. This was on the 2nd floor with a nice view of the parking lot.... and a balcony door that wouldn't open. It wasn't screwed shut, we just couldn't get it to open, despite the brisk breeze that was blowing in from the missing concrete around the door frame. No thanks to either room. After some checking and double checking by the frontdesk clerk ( Jehmal, I think... he really was very nice) he was able to find us an oceanfront room in the short tower with a working balcony. It was on the 4th floor and was in a great location. So, all is good. For a minute. While checking out the rickety railing over the pool, we noticed the defunct tiki bar. Turns out, they decided it wasn't profitable and closed it. they didn't post that info on the website either. We like to sleep with our balcony door open at night and in the morning the room smelled like urine. I thought for sure someone had an accident. Turns out its the carpet. I don't believe it's ever been changed. Smelled that way every morning. Yuck. The so-called high speed internet was a joke. We couldn't get a decent connection the whole trip. Used our phones for internet instead. The continental breakfast was prepackaged muffins and bagels, or cornflakes... coffee or juice. That was fine, we really didn't expect much more... and the coffee was actually very good. Although, on our last morning the coffee machine broke and was dispensing water only. Our toilet was very slow to flush, you had to hold the handle down for quite sometime to get it to work. The toilet did stop up once and we sent the boys down to notify the clerk (John, I think.... not so nice) and he sent them up with a plunger and told them to make sure to bring it back. We kept it the rest of the stay in case we needed it. Thanks for the help, John. the beds were comfortable, although I doubt they were queens. I am pretty sure they were doubles, but that could have been because we switched rooms. No talk of any refund, but we never asked. The location is nice. There is a mall across the street and it's not far from the boardwalk and shops. ALSO - you will probably be approached on the beach about visiting the timeshare two doors down. DON'T DO IT. They are rude, and liars when it comes to compensation. Tell them to take a hike. We will spend a few extra bucks next time we go to Daytona.

When I phoned the house regarding the toilet, they would not even come by to see about it. The cleaning staff made up the beds the next morning and left all trash on the floor--we had to pick up the trash ourselves. To stay we would need to do hard core cleaning. I came on vacation to relax. So we checked out immediately the next morning. We didn't even shower. The good points: It did not smell too much, and the beds were decent. There was a complimentary breakfast of hard stale bagels and delicious moist muffins (I had the muffin) and the coffee was good; however, you couldn't leave the breakfast room, go poolside or take you breakfast to your room. You were forced to eat it in the breakfast room- how inconvenient. The hotel manager was very pleasant. Apparently the hotel is falling upon some hard times. This hotel has great potential.

I have a few complaints. 1. Check-in time is stated as 3pm. We arrived at 3:45 and we able to check-in but were told no clean rooms were available. We waited until 7pm before actually being assigned a room. I fear it may have been longer if we hadn't returned and sat in the lobby for the last hour before getting the room... 2. One selling point to this hotel was the balcony access for every room. The hotel is \"doing renovations\" and has closed off all sliding doors. No room can access their balcony. I think this is something we should have been made aware of prior to our arrival. The front desk stated that it would be about 1 year to finish the work (as of 7-23-10). 3. We checked in Friday night. It is now Sunday morning. The room is just now getting to a comfortable temperature. We have basically sealed off the room to allow the somewhat functioning a/c to work. Therefore housekeeping can not come in, as that would only allow all the \"cool\" air out. 4. Our mini-fridge does not seal, and can not keep anything cold. The toilet constantly runs. And the room reeks! I don't just mean a slight odor. It smells, bad! Thankfully there is a PUBLIX across the street with a wide selection of odor neutralizers/air fresheners. 5. There is no poolside Tiki Bar, as listed on the hotel features, per Hotel.com's website. That's really no big deal, but just another thing to point out. 6. Breakfast consists of either a bagel or muffin, coffee, O.J. or apple juice. It gets the job done, but not as expansive as you would normally expect. 7. There are ice machines on every other floor, but they never have ice. Further examination of the units showed the air intake filters appear to have gone unkept in quite some time. No wonder the units are so loud! 8. They keep the outside access doors open at all times. (No surprise the rooms can't cool down.) And even allow a cat free roam of the building, with pet food dishes scattered about. This isn't a guest's... Just some stray. All the complaining aside, this is a hotel worth staying at if you can find it for say $30/night. The views are amazing. It is right across the street from a shopping center, housing everything you may need. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. You can walk out on the beach and see the fireworks they display every Saturday night at 9:45 from the pier (2 miles south, along the boardwalk). And the staff! They are so nice and helpful, doing whatever they can within their powers to make you comfortable.

There was spaces u couldn't park because the building is falling off from the top. There is no lights in the parking lot you can't see when your walking to your car. They want you to pay to use the safe in the room but u have no choose to use it because your main door can be pushed open. The loungers around the pool which was suppose to be along the ocean side and is not need to be all replaced gross. Hot Tub roped off can't use it. No Tiki Bar there is 3 Beat up ripped up chairs by some portable gross looking thing. Nothing set up for drinking. Maybe someone should be shown what a Tiki Bar is. There where pets everywhere even a cat walking the front counter when we checked in gross i\"m allergic to cat's. Then the cat was eating off a plate in the breakfast room hallway. I would never eat in the breakfast room just didn't seem clean. Carpet needs to be all replaced. The main doors to your room has some latch that doesn't even match up to hook it. Our patio door was so gross and the lock didn't work and they had a rod u put in to keep the door close and I don't think it has been vacuum since they open where you put the rod. In a nut shell it needs to be all re done But the worker's all where very nice and try to do what they could under the situation. Bottom line if you owe a business it's your responsibility to keep it maintain. I have learned a big lesson I will check the room before I check in. Our friends where also so disappointed. The price was good but it is reg. 135.00 for oceanfront There is no room there worth that. The beach area is very nice and the view from the room Oceanside is very nice. I feel like I wish I could redo that part of my vacation over and be in a nice Hotel. I tell everyone do not stay there unless it is all redone. Please take off your photo's and put on the real photo's of what it really looks and not what it looked like when you first open.

Othewise, you get what you pay for.\u201d", "Author": "PICKY502", "ReviewID": "UR67613525", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Bermuda House on Daytona Beach June 9 \u2013 15, 2010. The room was described as an ocean view room with two queen beds. The description on Expedia says there is a poolside tiki bar, an oceanfront pool, a children\u2019s wading pool, and a complimentary Continental breakfast. They also offer wi-fi, kitchenettes, and balconies with pool or ocean view. The room amenities also state that there are cribs/infant beds available. The poolside tiki bar and the hot tub were both closed. I saw a white board that mentioned drinks. But, there was absolutely no lounge/bar anywhere in site. The hot tub was roped off and did not appear to be in any process of re-opening. The children\u2019s wading pool was nice. It was basically a circular pool of about 1 foot depth. The complimentary breakfast was cereal, cold muffins, cold danishes, and bagels. There was a shortage each day of the danishes. But, it was free food. So, that was good. Our room had a microwave, fridge, sink, dishes, and utensils. We did not have any way to close the sink in the bathroom or kitchenette for shaving or dishes. When I asked about a crib, I was told they did not have them. The Expedia site also mentions a surcharge for parking. However, under the fee\u2019s section it is not listed as a $5 parking fee nightly. That seemed to catch people off guard when they arrived. I heard a lot of grumbling at the pool about the $5 a day fee to park. The pool was certainly not beachside or oceanfront. The pool is separated from the beach with hotel rooms. So, there is no way to see the beach from the hotel. There is a shade on the pool for the first part of the day due to the eight or so stories of hotel rooms separating the pool from the beach. So, for sun tanners that like the pool, this may pose a problem. On the upside; it was a hotel that I paid around $60 a night for. The housekeeping was pretty good. There was a man and woman doing the housekeeping and they did an excellent job. One day a younger lady came in and she did not replace the toilet paper or tissues. I saw many on staff doing cleaning jobs such as cleaning rooms, mopping floors, emptying trash, etc. They were all needed and were busy doing a good job. I thought the hotel was overall pretty clean. We are used to staying in more expensive condos. In comparison, this hotel needs some work. The door lock on our room #307 was enlarged from abuse. There was a lot of rust throughout the building. The rope to the pool kept coming loose because it had been duck taped into the metal holder. The pool decking was painted. The concrete and paint were both chipping. The carpet appeared old; but, was not in disarray. There was a smell of mold and old throughout the hotel. Although it was clean. It just smelled. The bathrooms down by the pool were absolutely disgusting. I saw several people in there on different days spraying to try and fix the smell. But, it was over powering to just walk in. It smelled of urine. Although, it appeared clean too. Overall, this was a staff-friendly place with clean rooms and cheap prices. This hotel is located between the Playa and the Daytona Conference Center. Both hotels looked much nicer. The beach was nice and flat. There is driving on the beach behind this hotel. I didn\u2019t see much traffic; maybe one or two cars every few minutes. We have been to Siesta Key, Destin, Panama City, the Keys, Ft Meyers, and Sanibel. We love Florida and love finding good places to eat and have fun. I\u2019m not much into a carnival atmosphere and I found Daytona Beach to be just that. For something to do, we took an evening and went to the Ponce de Leon light house. That was a nice drive. They end tours before we got there though. So, we did not get to go out and see the buildings and light house up close. We went to several restaurants. Kerr\u2019s Winghouse at the Boardwalk was good food. It\u2019s a Hooters atmosphere. The boardwalk beside Wyndham and Hilton was very nice. They have concerts on Saturday (bring a chair). It\u2019s also just a pretty place to take pictures. We also went to Joes Deck & Grill. It was a bit of a drive (about \u00bd way between the hotel and the light house). But, this was probably our best restaurant that we ate at. It is located on a pier. We saw a sting ray and a barracuda while we ate. I had the BLT (about $4). It was good. We also had shark bites. Although they aren\u2019t made of shark ~ so that was misleading. But, they were good too. If we go back again, I will check out the Wyndham and Hilton. I also liked the pool at the Daytona Conference Center and all the goings on at Grand Seas Resort.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cEach year we stay there - it gets better and better!!

Boy were we wrong! There was a HUGE line at check in at 3:00, which didn't bother me until I realized that the line was due to the fact that EVERYONE'S reservations were messed up in some way. Some people's were lost, others had incorrect bedding, or other problems. I was, however, pleased after my checkin went smoothly and quickly...until getting to our room. The room appeared nice and clean on the inside, but after being in the room for about 5 minutes unloading, I heard something at the door. As I walked over to open the door and see what it was, the door opened before I reached it and another lady who was in the checkin line near me was standing there with her family. They had given us the same room! So, we both went back downstairs, cut in line (because everyone remembered that we were just there), and tried to straighten everything out. The MANAGER didn't see this as a problem and promptly told me that I should always flip the bar lock over so that no one can get in, even with a key. My response was: well, I understand that, but if we had been down at the beach, they could've easily come in (because it is impossible to use that lock when out of the room) and stolen our things, for all we know. He didn't see that as an issue at all and said that the checkin staff would fix the problem. I was NEVER offered anything for my trouble, but requested having my parking taken care of for the weekend, which they did. Now for the room and cleanliness. The room appeared very clean and nice, but there is no DVD player or anything. If you want to watch anything, it has to be on TV. The beach in front of the place is nice, but the balcony we had was just plan SCARY! We were 7 floors up, which I would normally love, but the balcony floor looked as though an earthquake had hit it - it was cracked and some of it was bubbled up like someone tried to push something up through it from underneath. The ceiling of the balcony was also peeling and dripping something, so we never could sit on the balcony that we paid the oceanfront price for! The pool itself was nice and large; however, the lounge chairs were dirty, and I wouldn't have sat my things on them and especially wouldn't have sat on them myself. The hot tub also wasn't usable and was roped off, so we didn't get to use it. It was nice to have continental breakfast each day, but don't expect more than cereal, danishes, and fruit. Nice for a small breakfast, but not filling at all.

Most of them were not good but we were hoping for the best. We booked the hotel off of hotwire.com so we didn't even know where we were staying til it had already been charged so there was nothing we could do. I went with hopes of coming home and writing a good review about the place. I won't be doing that. But I won't be writing a bad one either. The price we paid for this hotel was $44 a night. It is oceanfront so that is cheap. We knew going in that this place wasn't going to be anywhere near a Hilton or upper class hotel like that. All and all, this place's biggest problem is that it needs to be remodeled. I think the hurricanes have been hard on it. It doesn't look much like the pictures anymore. We had several problems on our stay but most were fixed pretty quickly. I will say that our room was not exactly \"toddler friendly\". Our bathroom door was missing it's door knob. And, with an almost 2 year old who wants to get into everything, not being able to shut off the bathroom caused a lot of problems. No one wants their toddler playing in a toilet. We had a leak in our ceiling on our 2nd day caused by the AC unit in the room above us. In the hotel's defense though, it was fixed pretty quickly. Our microwave didn't work but they did replace it quickly after we complained. Our sliding glass door to our balcony was so hard to open that we very rarely used it. This couldn't be fixed but we were showed how to get it open. With the hotel being ocean front, things rust easily so we let it go. The \"Tiki Bar\" of this place was only open one night for a few hours during the 4 nights we were there. We were allowed to use to hotel next door's swimming pool as well which was nice. The hot tub at both places were out of order though. For the price we paid, and the hotel being ocean front, we got our money's worth though so I am not overly complaining. The hotel needs work. If you are worried about staying somewhere really nice and ocean front, don't stay here. But if you are more worried about just having a place to sleep and being ocean front, You would save money by staying here.

Bathroom fixtures were old, somewhat stained, but all worked as expected. The cleanliness of the carpet was a concern the whole time. The door to the balcony was old, difficult to open, and had almost-rotted hardware. The view of the beach was very nice. The other room, #115, was damp throughout with a terrible musty odor. Even pulling the bedsheets back revealed the underlying covers to be damp The shower head made one small steady stream. This room should be sealed off permanently. In both rooms the TV and air conditioning were like-new and worked very well. The pool area is incredible - nice furniture, great pool area, and well maintained pool. The breakfast area was similarly nice. Every one of the outside doors (except the main front door) was in poor repair. Missing or barely-there hardware, very inclean to the touch, and quite old. Continental breakfast was cereal, prepackaged danish, instant oatmeal and grits, juice and coffee. Staff was always pleasant and accomodating. The hotel is a study in contrasts. Very nice public areas with courteous and helpful staff. Quite poor rooms that seem to have suffered the ravages of age without adequate investment in physical plant maintenance. We paid $70/night for a beach front room; comparatively a good price for a view of the beach. However, for another $40/night I stayed at the LaQuinta down the street. It too is beach front but my room was not. However, the rooms here were clean, well maintained, and comfortable. I'd spring for the extra $40/night in a heartbeat.

We got into the elevator, which was VERY scary, old, smelly, and the date to have it inspected was expired. So we rode up to the room and the door was slightly open. Not wanting to disturb anyone if it was occupied, I asked the maid if this was the room the man in the lobby told us was ours. She looked at our keys and told us that our room was on the first floor. So we rode the elevator back down to the first floor and went to the room she told us to go to...uh...it didn't even have a lock...or a door knob for that matter. So I went back to the lobby and asked the man what our room number was. He looked at me like I was stupid and said it was on the forth floor and gave me the room number. So we went back up and into the room we were at first that was slightly open. I guess the door doesn't shut all the way and you litterally have to put some body weight into it when you want it shut. The room wasn't bad, I will say. No stains on the bed or bugs anywhere that I could see. The bathroom was bad however. It was dirty and moldy and if you wanted to flush the toilet you had to hold in the handle. Our last day there we left almost all day and came back to find our room open because the housekeeper didn't shut the door all the way. Thankfully, all our stuff was still inside. The pool was nice, clean and warm. Although, one reason we wanted to stay here was for the Tiki Bar, which was only open twice the entire week and late at night, and the jucuzzi, which was not open the entire time.

I have read the other reviews from the hotel and well I dont really agree with any of them. I do not want to come out and sound completely biased either way I just want to tell in all honesty, my experience. I booked reservations for an ocean front efficiency double beds upper floor room 3 nights, total of 422.06 this was confirmed by 2 different women that work for ocean waters resort. Grand total of 422.06 remember that. Well when my boyfriend and I got there my first impression was a girl named Jamey greeting us with a look on her face like she was completely drugged up. Her eyes were rolling and she was holding her head, when we first walked up to the front she was standing up from hanging her head by her knees...Im not quite sure what was going on but she complained of a headache with \"surging pain.\" She listed some symptoms, I am a pharmacy technician and recognized these symptoms as some kind of problem brought on by chemical abuse but that is beside the point. She pulled up the reservations which were under my name but only addressed them to my boyfriend. She did not check my ID so anyone could have stayed there and charged it to my card, she got my boyfriend to sign some paper and did not ask me a single question even though the reservations were made under my name, which is obviously a female name. She tried to give me a room with a king sized bed. This was the coversation \"Is it just the two of you?\" Well reservations should have told her that. \"Yes\" looking at my boyfriend the whole time now. \"So you don't mind if you have a kingsized bed?\" me--\" Well didn't I make reservations for two queen sized beds?\" \"well yeah, but since you two are a couple I didnt think you would mind. \" \"Well, personally I would like to get what I made reservations for.\" \"Ok, well we have a room on the 4th floor.\" \"I thought I made reservations for upper level Is that not available?\" \"Oh yeah but its not ready yet.\" \"Well we can wait until it is.\" She let us see the room anyways it was terrible. It was in an older section and was quite randown. We waited for room 823. When I went to pay I asked for the total, she was just going to charge it to my card and not even tell me the price. When I asked she said 557 dollars and some change. My eyes grew wide and I politely said that I got the price of 422.06 confirmed by two different women, one just a few days earlier. She said it was 557 and another girl, who seemed to be sober told me she could knock 10 dollars a day off but I did not want to do that because my reservations confirmed at 422.06. We had mentioned wanting to charge the first night on my card and pay the rest in cash, they used this to attempt to confuse us with by saying \"well it is 422.06 after you charge the deposit.\" I told them it was the overall total that was at 422.06.I was getting no where so we said wed look at the room and used the opportunity to discuss the situation at hand,and my, now furious, boyfriend told me \"Stay in the room Im going to fix this\" He went down stairs and spoke with the manager who, proceeded to have him haggle for the price I was told I would have to pay. First she said 20 a day off, then 60 off for the deposit this is when he knew that she could give it to us for the price we were quoted, then she told him some stuff about him handling this professionally blah blah blah, this is when he came up to the room and told me the conversation. The manager called and said she would give us the room for the price we were quoted. Here's what I think happened, While my boyfriend was talking to the manager down stairs he said customers were coming in and they were telling them they were sold out, I dont believe it because in our stay they had a lot of vacant rooms. there was only one other couple in the floor we were on. I think that when we showed up they recognized us as being young, Im 20 and petite and my boyfriend is almost 25. I think that when I was discussing the price she thought she could pull it over on me because I am a girl, I will tell you right now I was going to leave that hotel before my boyfriend was and not to mention I am 1/2 irish so I know how to pitch a fit. I think the whole price jump was due to us being young and them thinking we were nieve, well Ive been to Daytona plenty of times I know the going rates of a lot of the hotels and 557 for THAT place was entirely too high, not to mentin I know what I was quoted. I also feel that they wanted us to think it was full so we would stay thinking we couldnt find another room. So if you still want to book a room here I would highly recommend booking over the phone and having them email,fax, mail the reservations I had to confirm over the phone because they couldnt email me for some reason. When we were actually in the room I noticed there was no shower curtain, only three pots, 2 mugs, 2 plats, 2 small bowls, 2 forks, 1 butter knife, 2 spoons and a weird looking knife. No frying pan or spatula, one pitiful aluminum cookie sheet. The stove, oven, fridge, microwave all worked great The view was nice, I enjoyed the balcony, the room did not look bad at all, there was a problem with termites in the bathroom though. Only two drawers, 2 vanities, one outside the bathroom one inside. Some mold on the tiles in the bathroom and the tub looked awful. There were smudges and grease all over the windows the floors needed mopping, I pretty much cleaned the entire first day. The maid only made the beds once during our stay and on that day she knocked once said \"housekeeping\" and in about 15 seconds swung the door open then apologized for barging in...She later returned with a shower curtain, more coffee, towels and made the beds. The second day she knocked a couple of times and I greeted her she asked if I needed anything, I said more coffee, she handed me some and new towels and ask that I hand her the dirty ones, well my boyfriend was in the shower so I couldnt so she told me to bring them to her and that was the last we saw of her for the remainder of the trip. Which was just as well because I cleaned everything the whole time anyways. The pool area is beautiful and the staff did a good job of keeping the place clean, it was the maid that did a bad job of keeping our room clean. So I left cleaning stuff and a frying pan in the room, maybe the people that are in it now will get use out of it. It appeared that the females that worked there were not effecient so if you book here, talk with a man, certainly not Jamey lol. Oh yeah and bewarey of the elevator it looks like its ready to break down any minute. If it was not for the haggling thing I would not completely turn my nose at booking here, I did not hate the room. It was not the best but I would consider booking it if I could not get reservations at nicer places. For the price there are better hotels to stay at especially if it really is 557 for 3 nights!! I would NEVER pay that much to stay there for 3 days. I have pictures if anyone is interested in seeing them. I just got home from the trip, actually and have not had the time to upload them so just let me know if you are interested.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Hill, FL", "Title": "\u201cLoved my stay @ The Bermuda House!\u201d", "Author": "kelsayssmile", "ReviewID": "UR7989554", "Content": "Our stay at The Bermuda House was very pleasant.

I was a little worried about the place after seeing some bad reviews. I'm not sure what some people expect, but we were both very pleased with the service, friendliness of staff, cleanliness, value, and location. There were only minor problems during the entire stay. There seemed to be a shortage of towels at one point during the weekend, which were brought up to us later that day after they were washed. At one point, we encountered no running water in our room, which was completely repaired within 10 minutes of having called front desk. The hotel is not brand new, and it is right on the beach. Some things were a little bit run down, such as there being a crack in the rear hotel access door, the floor lights of the elevator did not work, and the carpet in the elevator wasnt the freshest......which bothered some guests, but having lived in Florida before, I understand that things get wear and tear very easily, especially being right on the beach and going through hurricanes and storms almost every year. I must say that I did not check out the continental breakfast, as there are way too many great eateries in the Daytona area that I wanted to go to. The pool was sparkling clean and beautiful, and located perfectly. The pool is actually not oceanfront, but behind the largest of the hotel's two buildings, which is actually beneficial, because in the mid-afternoon when the sun starts going behind the buildings of other near-by hotels' pools, the pool at the bermuda house still had plenty of sun to enjoy into the evening. Staff was very friendly and helpful at the front desk, maintenance, and housekeeping. The view was spectacular, and the beach access was very convenient. Overall, if you can look past the minor wear-and-tear that ocean-front hotels get during the season, it was a very nice place to stay at a great bargain!", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Apharetta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal on the beach\u201d", "Author": "gardenladyApharetta", "ReviewID": "UR7365053", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel with a beachfront room the first week of April.

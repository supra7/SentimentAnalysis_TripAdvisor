It is in the 70's this week in NYC and the AC does not work in any of the rooms in the hotel. When we asked why they said, \"we don't turn it on until April\" We asked if we could switch to a part of the building that might be cooler they said that, \"All the rooms are warm right now\". I wondered if this was maybe normal in hotels this time of year so I called three hotels close by, the Westin, the Sheratin and a Comfort Inn and all three said their AC is on and working in their rooms. We booked through Hotwire and they said they would call the hotel and complain for us but that they would not let us out of our 6 day reservation to switch to another hotel. They then said the front desk of the hotel said they would bring us a fan. Finally, we found as we went to bed and woke up we can hear every bowel movement, brushing of teeth and conversation of the room next door.

It was in south tower, 8th floor but the internet speed was way low. But in the North tower on the 17th floor, speed was good. It was a queen room, smaller yet a very comfortable bed. I read in the reviews that the south tower was better, since renovated and less noisy. But our room in North tower was equally better and not noisy at all. perhaps because it was on the top floor. Now the drawbacks, there is no refrigerator in the room which could be a problem in summer if you have child and wants to use it for baby food and milk. For drinks there are vending machines and ice dispenser on every alternate floor, so cold drinks can be taken cared for. There is a deli (Roosevelt Gourmet Deli) around the corner (towards Hudson river) for great hot breakfast. Starbucks and Morton Williams (supermarket, also has a buffet meal for 6.99 per pound, we had dinner take outs there, great food) and pharmacy is within 5 minutes walking distance. Also Flame restaurant we tried for dinner, great one. Columbus Circle subway station (and Central Park) is the nearest, also with 7 minutes walk, another one 57th subway station, within 8-9 minutes. We had nice afternoon strolls with the baby in Central Park, Hudson river and at night took the broadway towards time square, had little breaks and coffee, snacks in between.

The lobby itself is below average and you do happen to have a lot of staff available there. The rooms are extremely outdated and in desperate need of a complete makeover. The internet is free in this hotel but that is a very bad idea. There are times where the network gets so overloaded that nothing works at all. Either restrict free internet to priority club members and paying customers or upgrade your connections. Or at least, offer another connection that is fast and reliable for the priority club members and/or paying customers. Not being able to load google for an hour during the night every night before everyone goes to bed is not really an internet connection. Noise in the corridors and the proximity of an ice machine to the room was very bothersome. That is specially because the doors and walls are not noise proof. The lack of a fridge in the room was also not good. It would be nice to have a minibar or at least an empty fridge to stock items in it during the stay. The cupboard in the room is just a disaster. The TV is almost ancient, did not know that those TVs still exist. Some of the staff members are helpful and nice to deal with, the others are just simply rude. The feeling I got was that the place was run by a mafia rather than just employees. Had to reserve a car for my friend to catch his flight since we were advised by the concierge at the time that we need to do that to avoid traffic (on a Sunday!!!) and because we wouldn't find a cab at that time. After agreeing to the time, my friend and I waited in the lobby and made sure the staff there knew we were waiting for the reserved hotel car to pick him up. We were there 10 minutes prior to the supposed arrival time and nothing showed up 20 minutes after the agreed upon time. Went outside and got hold of the first cab within under 5 seconds, and my friend was in the airport in under 20 minutes for half the fare the hotel wanted to charge us for. There was a bit of an unprofessional reaction from the staff in the hotel to that claiming that the car is coming, nearby and that what we did was wrong. The way this was communicated was very bad, in a thuggish way and left me with a very bad impression. Again, the staff member who was upset most was throwing words in his native language not knowing that other people may understand other languages. I let this slide because if this is the mafia the hotel management has hired to run the show for them, I can only imagine what kind of a mafia sits on top.

When we returned planning to shower and hit the beds it was close to midnight and we were all sopping wet as it had been pouring rain. They had not delivered the extra towels and the phone still didn't work so I had to go back down to the main lobby to again request towels. Also, our heater wouldn't turn off which we didn't know until we got back. We had turned it down before leaving and it was even hotter than before when we got returned. Since I wasn't making another trip to the lobby to report it we opened the window as much as possible and had a restless night. Overall a bad experience. Oh and the perk for being Platinum at this property is a free muffin or coffee in the restaurant for me only meaning the other two would have to pay. this is just a way to put paying customers in their restaurant. What a joke! We walked down the street to a great little cafe so I can't speak about the food at this property. It's really a shame that they don't do a better job with customer service here as the location is really quite nice.

On arrival we found that our booking had been \"lost\". We got given a voucher for a complimentary muffin and juice and told to come back. We went and redeemed our vouchers and got given the items in takeaway form. We had no choice other than to sit in the lobby and eat it. We were rudely told by a staff member that there was no eating in the lobby! Not really our choice since we didn't have a room nor were we offered a table in the restaurant to eat at! On going back to reception they still couldn't find our booking and promised they were looking into it. They insisted that we pay for the first nights accommodation even though our stay was already paid for. They insisted this would be immediately refunded once the booking had been sorted, we didn't really have a choice at this point so had to agree. We went up to our room and let me say this is the WORST Holiday Inn I have ever seen. The room stank of stale urine, the carpets, linen, walls were dirty. There was a hole in the roof. The bathroom was filthy. The toilet didn't flush, the phone didn't work. We asked for maintenance to come up and have a look but they couldn't fix any of the problems. So we went back to reception to request to be moved. The staff were rude and unfriendly and that goes for the duty manager as well. They gave us another room which was no better in my opinion, but as by this point we had already wasted half a day of our holiday we gave up and went out for the day. The following morning we woke to find an unopened block of chocolate had been nibbled at by some form of rodent. We went back down to reception again. We told them the problem and the reply was \"so, i suppose you want another room\" complete with an eye roll. We got moved again and offered free breakfast for 2 days and insisted on a fridge free of charge (they charge $10 per day for a fridge which is ridiculous!) Our 3rd room, whilst bigger was just as awful. Dirty carpets, walls and linen, and a hole in the roof. The bathroom was clean but small. They ask you to recycle your towels which we were more than happy to do but the only rail they provide to hang your towels on sits over the top of the bench. So not really enough room to hang a full sized bath towel! So that left us really no choice other than to receive new towels every day as there was no way to dry them. We never ordered room service but from what I could see the service wasn't great at all. We would see dirty dishes still sitting in the hall over 24 hours later! No wonder they have a rodent problem! Upon checking my friends credit card statement she found that she had been charged over $700 by Holiday Inn! We asked 3 different staff members what there \"incidental\" charges were. One person said $50, another said $300 and the duty manager in response to telling her about the charges rudely told us that there incidental charges are $100 per day for every day of your stay! Well if this is in fact the case staff should be telling patrons upon check in as this is a lot of money! The amounts charged on her credit card were neither of the amounts stated to us above but were different amounts every day .... it seemed to us as though they were recharging us for the room even though it was already paid for! We said the money needed to be refunded immediately as we still had another week of traveling. Her reply simply was that it could take weeks! We were not impressed by this point. My friend had to fill in more paperwork and provide them ID, bank details etc just so she could get her own money back which they should never have taken in the first place! The money eventually got refunded after a few days. Their hospitality promise is that if any part of your stay does not meet your expectations then that particular aspect would be refunded. We continually tried to get in contact with the manager via email and phone and we never ever received a response. We eventually, on return to Australia, had to go through the priority club website who then got in contact with them. This took several different tries before they eventually responded to us! Not exactly a very good way to run a business! Eventually they agreed to refund half of our stay but by the time you take out fees etc it did not even cover 2 nights accommodation! Considering the amount we paid to stay there we were not happy. I have advised our travel agent not to recommend this hotel to anyone. I have also warned family, friends and acquaintances traveling to new york not to stay here. We were disgusted at the treatment we received from staff and the state of the accommodation. There were signs everywhere stating they were renovating but I certainly never saw any sign of this. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

While it does have a bar and a high-priced restaurant on its inners, the most important part - the rooms, leave much to be desired. I booked this hotel through a bid on Priceline so the price was excellent for the stay, however I'd have been willing to pay a \"few dollars\" more for better quality. The hotel is in an excellent location just a few blocks from Central Park South, but that's the best I can say. Though I must add, that unfortunately, this is one of a group of hotels that says...\"you paid the Priceline price, therefore you will receive Priceline service. Upon arrival, I was checked in by Yudith who was totally unwelcoming. We didn't receive as much as a hello...just a demand for name and ID followed up with a request for a credit card for extra services. Upon signing necessary paperwork I noticed that I was assigned to a queen bed smoking room. (I did read prior reviews saying that the smoking room is a normal assignment for Priceline guests.) I asked for a non-smoking room because I have severe allergies and cannot stand the smell of smoke. Yudith promptly responded that she had no ability to change us to a non-smoking room. I explained my understanding of Priceline's bedding warning, but was hoping that they may be able to accomodate me. Yudith again replied that there was nothing she could do until later in my stay, but something decided to make her look again and she changed the rooms. I can understand non-availability as I've worked for hotels, but say that don't place the lie on Priceline. However, as this is the second time I've had this level of service connected to a Priceline room, I'm reconsidering patronizing them if this is what their partners will give. The hotel did have signs saying that they were completing rennovations, but I failed to see any evidence of that on the elevator with chipped paint on the door, a failure to operate upon pushing the floor button and severe shaking and creaking once it finally began to move. The hallway we were assigned to was lined with dirty, and bleach-faded carpeting. The room itself was small, had a \"brown\" stained comforter on the very uncomfortable bed, and of course, the vent in the bathroom filled the room with- you guessed it- a terrible stench of smoke. When we requested \"sets\" of towels we were simply brought towels...no washcloths, hand towels, etc. The bathroom was also small and had the exposed rusted pipes of a public bathroom. The replacement comforter was wrinkled and dingy. The curtains/shades in the room are also sheer and do not close completely which gave the people in the adjacent building an embarassing view of things that should remain private. Summarily, I would not wish to stay here again, and I don't reccomend you do either.

The restaurant in the lobby is large. It is not fancy but adequate. It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was always full. There are plenty of choices on 9th avenue within walking distance. The hotel has two buildings (towers). One has rooms with odd numbers and the other has all even numbers. We were in the rear tower that was very quiet. No street noise. If you are driving, pull your car in the adjoining garage. We made a mistake of pulling our car in front of the hotel on the street which can be crowded. On the whole our stay was comfortable and people were friendly. We did not feel cramped. We may stay there again because of the price and the proximity to subways and restaurants.

The parking valet was easy to access and at $27 for 24 hours was reasonable. Front desk service was ok, not particularly friendly but not rude either. The hotel is a bit \"tired\" but overall was clean. Exiting the elevator there was a putrid, sweet orange smelling chemical, maybe carpet cleaning or extermination? Once we got past that the room was ok. Definitely a good sized room for NYC. Older television, paper cups nothing fancy. WIFI was free and was ok, a little slow. One problem we had was lack of outlets. We had only one outlet at the desk and had to unplug the clock to access another. I would agree that noise is a factor here but not horrible. We were able to have pretty good pizza delivered after midnight at a reasonable price. We did not try the restaurant during our stay. Breakfast is not included and the coffee in the room is pretty sparse. There aren't many good coffee shops close by either. We stored our luggage for the day after checkout and the bell hops were friendly.

I still worried up until the week before we were going and was going to change to a different hotel however, I had booked this hotel for the price and the location and decided to take a chance as all we were expecting was a clean room and bathroom.

On entering the room we couldn't believe our eyes it was huge, spotlessly clean and the furniture was clearly brand new , the bed was a king within 10 mins the camp bed was brought up which was huge and more comfortable than the King, it was obviously recently refurbished. On our way out we stopped in the lobby for the safe key and we tipped the guy who brought the bed and the receptionist who s name was Kelsang, and we would like to thank him very much as he was helpful and polite at all times.

If you are looking at doing tours or need information on a tour, DONT bother asking the dude at the tours counter in the motel as he is just rude and arrogant, the two times we tried to purchase a tour from him, he said that he was too busy (we were the only ones at the counter both times) my advice if you want a tour, speak to one of the many Graylines people positioned on just about every corner in NY, or go into the Graylines office, they have tours for everywhere and are pretty reasonable price wise.

You could just open your windows if you want your room to be cooler. They even explained that this is occuring at all their holiday inn and holiday inn express hotels in new york.

The manager there denied this and told us that their airconditioning unit was working fine and no scheduled interruption was ever made. This contradicted to what the manager of our hotel had to say thus we just decided to trasfer to a different hotel the next day and asked them to refund us of our payments for the remaining intended duration of our stay.

I read up on the hotel here, on the tripadvisor site, and was apprehensive. I decided to keep an open mind about the property and see what happened. The first room that I was given in Tower A smelled like a cigar bar. The front desk staff insisted that it was a no smoking room, but was more than happy to provide me with an alternate room. My second room smelled much fresher, but was a bit stuffy. I would later find out that air conditioning in this hotel (or at least this room) was seasonal. This would make for a hot, humid night of sleep on an unseasonably warm November night. Because of the rodents described in other reviews, I moved some furniture around to make sure there were no flat-mates. The vacated spaces revealed a severe lack of thorough cleaning, as it looked like some of these spaces had not received attention in several YEARS. I also noticed the bathroom mold that many of the other reviewer mentioned. While the hotel may be receiving renovations, I would not recommend this hotel. The only exception to this would be if you are cash strapped, and understand what you are getting yourself into. I will be taking better advantage of the expense privileges on my next visit to NYC.

It's ok for the meetings but I am not going to stay here as a guest any longer. Staff does the bare minimum to provide decent customer services, I would not go as far to say they are all that friendly-just barely cordial. They are trying to \"update\" the rooms but really just putting on a band-aid. Evidence of delapidated ceilings with popcorn ceiling sprayed over top. Cracks in the walls, dirty corners in the bathroom, extremely worn and outdated furniture, uneven floors. I had a tray of food from a previous guest sitting outside my room for over 24 hours hours-gross! I called housekeeping at different times and the phone just rang. This also happened when trying to call the front desk a few times. No one ever answered the phone. A huge issue for me was that there was no air in the rooms! We all know there isn't much of a breeze with open windows in NYC with so many buildings. The room was hot and stuffy and I had to request a fan from housekeeping. The last issue that just erks me is that they post charges for keeping your lugguage. I travel 3-4 months out of the year staying at a variety of hotels throughout the U.S. and abroad. This is the only hotel I have ever seen try to charge for storing guests' luggage. Are you kidding me!? Also when I left I tried to ask a bellman for help getting a taxi to the airport. There were two huge tour buses in the street blocking any view of taxis. Two bellman just kept trying to push the hotel car which is of course a considerable amount more than a flat rate taxi. This is a hotel that attracts A LOT of tourists and non-residents. We are not all proficient in hailing a cab. It just a common courtesy for hotel to assist guests in getting where they need to go...by the transportation means that the GUEST wants. I ended up wheeling my luggage up the block where I could see the street and hail my own cab. I have stayed at other Holiday Inns and have had a good experience. They are usually known for reasonable prices with clean rooms with moderate quality ammenities. This midtown nyc location does not do the brand justice.

The staff in reception were friendly and welcoming. The room we had was on the 16th floor. I'd emailed the hotel to ask for a room as high as possible. We were not disappointed. The view from our room was the best we've ever had and was much better than we'd hoped for. Beautiful! The room was a good size for New York. We had a queen sized bed, with a dressing table, chair and arm chair. The bathroom was good, with a bath and shower over. Basic toiletries were provided, with more available from reception on request. The room had air conditioning. The decor was a little tired, but the reception, lifts, corridors and rooms were clean, however there was dust behind the TV and desk etc. The bed was comfortable and a selection of pillows were available. The hotel offered free wifi, that was excellent (some reviews have mentioned problematic connections, but we did not experience any problems at all). The only thing we felt was missing from the room as a safe. We've always had one in our room before and use it for passports etc. there was a sign on the door (noticed on our last day!) stating that limited safe space was available in reception for an additional fee. This is a small point, but worth considering. Overall, our experience was good. The hotel was relatively central, the room as a good size and the rates were reasonable for the room.

Only a week or so before our visit we had reminded ourselves via Trip Advisor of our selection and we were horrified to read some of the comments - rats, bed bugs, unwelcoming staff etc. so we were not looking forward to our visit. Our experience was somewhat different to this, majority of staff were helpful (mostly they were just slow), the room was clean and large enough for a family for 5 nights in fact the room was surprisingly large for NYC. The bathroom was slightly tired but was clean and functional. The a/c worked for the time we were there, therefore ticking all of our boxes. The beds were also very comfortable after a long day in a very hot city. An added benefit was free wi-fi in the hotel and this proved extremely useful in avoiding expensive roaming fees. The only element I was surprised at was no room safe - we did use the free safety deposit boxes in reception and these were small and slightly inconvenient to use - a member of staff had to open with you as they held a 2nd key. The Holiday Inn has an odd configuration (2 towers), we were overlooking the pool on the 12th floor, the pool was great to cool off after some v hot days but were suprised by the very early closing times - check times if you intend to use. Location was also very good (for our plans) 57th & 9th Ave, close to subway (Columbus Circle), possible to walk to Times Sq etc. At the end of a long hard sightseeing day the taxi fare's to return to hotel were not overly expensive so location wise we were more than happy. Overall better than we had expected, we did not encounter any rodents or blood sucking insects during our visit - what a relief.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA nice and quiet family hotel close to central park with spacious rooms\u201d", "Author": "ociTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR116092225", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at and Inn Midtown NY for 7 nights in July 2011.

When we initially arrived at the hotel we were happy to discover that the hotel's location was situated nicely between Central Park and Times Square. We were also initially happy with the comfortable beds and the fact that it had a pool for our children. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse later that night. At about two in the morning I got up out of bed, flipped on the light switch and went to walk over to use the bathroom--to my shock and horror sitting on the floor in front of me was a large brown rat. Needless to say I stumbled backwards and nearly broke the mirror to the closet behind me trying to backpeddle as quickly as possible. I have heard of bed bugs and roaches in hotel rooms, but rats!? Wow! Anyway, the rat scurried by me and went under my bed probably trying to get away from me as quickly as I was trying to get away from it. What was unsettling was when I called the front desk for assistance the clerk stated,\"Welcome to New York City. Rats are everywhere. Get used to it.\". There was no apology or concern. In fact, she offered to send a housekeeper to come pick it up as if it was no big deal--was she nuts? I couldn't get out of that room fast enough! When I explained to her that I was not going to stay in that room again (room 1532) she suddenly became irritated as if I was ruining her night!! Wow! After some additional detail as to the size of the rat and the fact that I was not going to be able to sleep in that room again we were reluctantly changed to the 14th floor to a smokers room that smelled terrible--the bottom line is that we didn't get any sleep and we all felt terrible the next day. For the price of this room I expected at least some semblence of common courtesy from the staff--what I ended up with was feeling totally insulted.

A colleague was also staying here, for one night only, and had mistakenly been booked into a smoking room.

There's an attractive bar at the far end, high ceilings, elegant front desk, etc. And with most NYC hotels, once you get to your room, you are let down by the cramped quarters. We spent 4 nights there (myself, wife, 23 year old son & 18 year old daughter). THANK GOODNESS the room was a decent size. It actually felt mostly like a room you'd find in the midwest somewhere. Two decent sized beds and some actual room to walk around the room. A couple of small sitting areas. A cabinet with a TV. All very bland and typical...but for traveling in NYC ON A BUDGET, it was surprisingly good sized. The bathroom, on the other hand, was quite small...thank goodness the sink was on the outside, because even taking the toilet/shower space combined with the sink space...two people together would have been quite tight. Closet space (for hanging items) was okay but not super generous. I think if you were spending longer than 4 or 5 nights, you'd get a bit tired of the lack of space. We were okay overall. The hotel was not terribly noisy (we were all the way up on the 2nd floor!! That's what we get for getting a low price on Travelocity, I guess), and I think we all slept pretty well. The pillows were fine (and marked as \"soft\" & \"firm\", in case you couldn't tell for yourself). Service was fine. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. We did not avail ourselves of the food or beverage service at all. Truthfully, the biggest drawback of this modest hotel was the location. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. You're about two long blocks from the nearest subway station...although it's the station at Columbus Circle, and that has just about every line running through it. And this two block walk is not terribly interesting. It's not a bad neighborhood, but you're mostly walking by Walgreens, CVC and pet supply stores...no glamour at all! You're a longish walk to Times Square, so if that's your bag (we saw several shows) you're more than likely going to take a cab or subway most fo the time. The southwestern entrance to Cental Park is a bit closer though, so if you're planning considerable time in the Park, this is a good spot. I assume the reason we got a reasonable rate WAS the location. As I looked for hotels just a little closer to the \"action\", rates went up a good 20% from what we paid...so I was okay with the inconvience. In summation, staying at the Holiday Inn won't be the high point of your visit to NYC...but if you're coming there for the hotel, you've got the wrong priorities!

One room was for my brother (age 59), the other for me (67) and my adult daughter. We were in town to see my grandson perform at Lincoln Center with his college symphony that Saturday night. Originally, we had reservations to stay at the Park Central Hotel where grandson and his group were staying. But I found a really good rate at the HI at the last-minute so we changed. And boy were we glad we did! Even though these were queen smoking rooms (18th floor) and we don't smoke, there was no detectable smoke odor in either room. We were willing to put a few deodorizers around for the rate we got, but were thrilled we didn't need to do this. The other hotel looked like spring break at Daytona - the lobby was overflowing with teenage groups and I can only imagine the noise with all of them roaming the hallways at night. We loved the HI, the front desk people were always friendly, we never had to wait in line either for check-in or check-out. Loved that one of our rooms was ready when we got there at 10:30 AM. This allowed us to deposit all our luggage there and head out sightseeing. After nearly killing our legs between walking around town and the subway steps on day 1, we got a bus map/schedule from the concierge the 2nd day and really liked utilizing the buses. The north/south line ran downtown on 9th, uptown on 10th, so we just walked to or from either corner for these and never waited longer than 5 minutes. The cross-town (57th St.) bus was right there also and we used this a LOT! This really saved our legs. Our rooms were a good size, esp. for NYC, and we liked that we could open the windows. Both of our rooms had good views, with my brother's view really spectacular as he was on the rear of the building and had the whole skyline to view plus the Hudson River off to the side. The views were such a nice, unexpected bonus. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was pretty small, but everything was clean and our rooms were made up promptly. Decor looks like any standard motel room, but as we were only in it to clean up and sleep, we were happy with it. The morning we checked out, we were able to use a dedicated computer at the end of the counter to print our boarding passes (for free), which was a great convenience. We also were able to store our luggage for the day at no charge, although we did tip when we picked it up. We had planned to get a taxi back to LaGuardia, but the hotel attendant asked if we wanted a towncar for a flat rate of $40, incl. tolls and tip. Since it had cost us $45 in a taxi to get there, we jumped on this offer. The \"limo\" was waiting for us when we got outside, and as the traffic was horrendous on that late Sunday afternoon, it took us close to an hour to get there. We were so glad we weren't on the meter! They said we could have had the same service for our arrival - wish I'd have known that, as the car was large and comfortable. We had breakfast one AM across the street at the Morningstar Cafe, a little place where the locals come and the food and service were first-rate. Ate dinner one night on 57th btwn 8th and 9th at Reynolds Pub and highly recommend for nice atmosphere, good food and fair prices. I had a huge sirloin burger (delicious) with fries for $10.95 and couldn't even finish it all. There's a Walgreen's across the street and a nice little wine shop just down the block, btwn 8th/9th, that had some really great prices.

They moved us to a \"better room,\" and gave us a breakfast voucher but the damage was done. Also, what makes them think that we would want to eat breakfast at their restaurant when we just saw a mouse in our room. The next day was our checkout and they extended it to 3 p.m. I talked to the third manager regarding this situation and her name is Janet. She was absolutely wonderfu; I told her that I did not mind paying for the days we stayed at the hotel, mildew on the ceiling and all, but that I did not feel that we should have to pay for the final night. She told me that she could not comp our room but that she could give us 50% off and take off the movie we ordered the evening before.

When i consulted this website I was horrified by some of the comments made about it, and we arrived there with some trepidation. We need not have worried at all. The hotel is being refurbished at present, and I feel sure that the public areas will benefit from this. There are at present apology notices prominently displayed. The rooms however are spotlessly clean with large and very comfortable beds. The hotel is ideally situated, in a safe and pleasant area, and is very accessible by public transport. It is in easy walking distance of Broadway, 5th Avenue, Central Park. and the Lincoln Centre, and their are excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. The breakfast was fine, and promptly and politely served.

It also helps to know that this hotel is frequented by tour groups, especially from Eastern Europe, and this will give you an idea of the overall standard to expect. Rooms Quite large for NYC, and are what you would expect - serviceable, with private facilities - but showing their age. Additionally, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the air conditioning is very loud, and in my room, condensation from the air con was so extreme that it saturated the nearby carpet on a daily basis. To their credit, the staff were concerned, and tried to fix the problem, but unfortunately to no avail. Also note that there are no safes in the room, and only a limited number of safety deposit boxes at reception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was nothing available on any day of my 9 day stay, so I had to carry around all my valuables whilst sightseeing (not ideal). It was also inconvenient when I used the hotel pool, as I had to take my valuables poolside and keep a constant look out when swimming. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are ice machines in the hotel, but not on every floor, and if you are unlucky enough to have one outside your room (as I was !) you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get noise all night long - not only of the very loud ice maker itself, but also from the slamming of the fire stairs doors as people go up and down to use the machines. Be warned ! That said, there are two big bonuses with this hotel: 1 - location 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rooftop pool Location in midtown Manhattan is within easy walking distance to Central Park South / Columbus Circle, 5th Avenue, and several subway lines. Additionally, the street outside the hotel is reasonably quiet for central Manhattan, and there are numerous eating places close by (Broadway / Times Square is about 10 minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walk south of the hotel). Very convenient location. The other plus with this hotel is the rooftop pool, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real treat to be up there swimming with a view of the skyline, but be warned that it does get very crowded, and it can be difficult to find somewhere to sit, let alone find a reclining lounge chair. The other negative is that, bizarrely, the hotel closed the pool every day at 6.00pm, which is just when you want to use it the most, after a hot day of sightseeing !!! All in all, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that this hotel is great value for money, but you are going to pay through the nose for any half decent hotel in Manhattan (especially in Midtown) and the hotel itself is quite serviceable, just set your expectations to that of a typical Holiday Inn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect too much, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just what you get !", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good Views, Easy Stay\u201d", "Author": "zeefla", "ReviewID": "UR82589922", "Content": "Room was big enough for the two of us, we had a nice view of the city from our window and the bed was really comfortable.

Booked with Priceline but only saved about $20/night. Selected this hotel because I wanted to be within walking distance of the theater district as well as the meeting place for the Sex and the City (near the Plaza Hotel) and only needed a place to shower, dress and rest my head. For my purposes this hotel worked very well. We bussed into Port Authority and took a cab to the hotel - only cost $4 plus tip and very quick trip. Initially they were going to put us in a smoking room stating that since we booked with a 3rd party we would get what was left and the hotel was pretty full. When I explained that I didn't want my pregnant daughter to be in a smoking room they immediately responded and found us a non-smoking one. When we got to our room we found the air conditioning turned all the way up but the room was warm. On our way out to the theater we stopped at the desk and complained about the air conditioning. After we retuned from the theater and were in our PJ's we noticed there was a message on our phone stating that they were unable to fix the air conditioning but they would be willing to change our room. Since we were ready for bed we stayed where we were and they changed our room the next day. The second room was better but still not as cool as it should have been with the air conditioner on max. On our way to the theater the next night we asked the concierge for a suggestion for somewhere to go for appetizers and drinks prior to our show. He sent us to the Glass House, 2 streets over from the theater. It has a modern upscale look and both drinks and appetizers were good. Like the fact that he said \" Here's where I'll send you\" rather than giving us a list of places to have to think about. On the way out, the bus boy in the lobby was very helpful with our bags. .This hotel was adequate for our needs, having all the basics as well as comfortable beds. It's not fancy and has areas that are being renovated but nothing major. No refrigerator in the room and an ice machine is not on every floor (had to go one floor down). Overall I would say this Hotel is in a good location unless you want to be right in the heart of the theater district where you will pay much more. Staff was responsive.

No safe in the room though, turns out that;s quite important at this hotel. The only major gripe i really had with the hotel was that on the last day of my stay, things went missing from my room, a brand new pair of Nike shoes & various electrical items from the bathroom (shaver, toothbrush, nose hair trimmer, etc.) now the mentality of someone who wants a second hand electric toothbrush or nose hair trimmer escapes me, but nonetheless I was not happy. Very glad I had taken my laptop out with me and my digital SLR too & that I never leave my passport in my room. I went downstairs to the lobby and went to reception to report the theft, they seemed completely uninterested and sent me over to a chap at another desk whom they said was security. This seemed to be the guy responsible for keeping the riff raff out at night, and had the air of a nightclub bouncer. I told him what happened, he seemed incredulous that anyone would want to steal things from my room and asked if I was sure I hadn't just misplaced them, and said he couldn't really do anything about it until his boss came back, that night 12 hours later. He also incredulously claimed that housekeeping may have thought I was leaving a day early and thus threw all my possessions away. The way he said this seems like he may have told people that before and had them buy it, he actually said, \"you didn't leave your new shoes anywhere near the bin did you? as they might have thought you wanted to throw them out.\" I informed him I did not, that they were in a new Nike box and as I was leaving in 4 hours there was not really a lot I could do as he seemed quite unwilling to help. All of the things he said seemed like tried and tested ways to get out of actually doing anything about the theft. He gave me a telephone number to call and check what the status was and see about compensation, or finding out who entered the room (all electronic key locks should have a list of people who have entered available) I called back on the evening I was asked to (stayed up until 4am UK time to be able to) and was told that the head of security was out and couldn't speak to me. 6 further calls at various times when I was told he would be available, to the number given, reception and finally messages on his voice-mail all went unreturned. I am not impressed at all with the way I was treated by the Holiday Inn staff, and would never stay with them again. Have told all my friends to avoid like the plague and would say the same to anyone else thinking of staying there, there are far far better places in Manhattan for the same price or less.

To be honest though, New York is such a busy place and if, like most people you are there for a few days (or 6 days like us) then the hotel is just a base, rather than somewhere you spend very much time in. The rooftop swimming pool is nice, but only opens 10am - 6pm so if you are out all day then there's no option to use it. The gift shop is useful for bits and pieces.

I asked if there could be a switch to a non-smoking room and was RUDELY told by the manager and front desk clerk that it would not be possible. There were no non-smoking rooms available. In addition, I would need to wait for a smoking room to be become available. I come back two hours later to check in. A really nice guy helped me this time and offered me a non-smoking room right away. I was very gracious for this. When I arrived, the room was in a rough condition. There was writing on the wall, the mirrors were dirty and the bathroom was DISGUSTING!!! The bathroom smelled like pee, there was grime everywhere and I believe there were urine stains in the corner. I would compare it to a public restroom. It was that bad. The room was configured so that the sink/mirror were outside of the actual bathroom. There were towels hanging and I noticed one of them had blood stains (looked fairly fresh on them). I was so disgusted. I think the one good thing about this place is the room size.

This hotel caters to a lot of European customers and they are almost always fully booked (according to one of the managers). I apologize in advance if I offend anybody, but based on personal experience I have to say that Europeans are not as picky about their hotel accomodations as Americans. After several conversations with the manager, they did comp us are parking, but if wasn't much of a discount. It was actually cheaper to book directly through the Holiday Inn than it was through Hotwire so she essentially gave us their deal. I wouldn't not recommend this hotel to anyone on a family vacation.

For the price my employer paid, I could have gotten a much better hotel in a better location, but the conference I was attending was at the hotel. The decor is a hodge podge of partially renovated areas and areas that were last updated circa 1980. The photos on the Holiday Inn web site don't lie. That is actually what the hotel looks like inside. At the risk of sounding like a snob, I personally have not seen anything like that since I was a little girl in the 1980s. Most hotel brands, even budget ones, have insisted on consistency and providing a clean, basic place to stay. This was the exception. The lobby bar had been renovated, but the rest of the lobby had not. The lobby had a weird smell like an overpowering air freshener. Stafff...The staff was OK. Check in was easy but the lady did not tell me to go to the back set of elevators, so I went to the wrong elevator bank and consequently my room was not where I would have thought and I had to come back down the elevator. Check out was easy. Bellstaff was so-so. One man helped me check my bag, but no one opened the door, and one man had to get off his cell phone to help me get a cab and assist other guests. As the bellman who did help me pointed out, most of the staff is lazy and just stands around talking. They did a good job of setting up the conference though the projector was not working at first and they actually got one of the cafe employees to try to fix it. Some staff members, particularl housekeeping, were friendly and I do want to give them credit. Cleanliness and upkeep -- The hotel was gross. The women's restroom, though tastefully redone, was a disaster. None of the soap dispensers worked, the garbage had not been emptied so there were paper towels all over the floor, and water was all over the basins and floor. And one of the toilets was not flushing. Rather than clean it up, someone just put out a \"Caution - Slippery Floor\" sign. When I arrived at my room, there was a room service tray out front. I was almost scared someone would still be in my room when I opened the door! The tray and accompanying food were not removed until mid-morning the next day. The door to the supply closet on the floor was left wide open, as the latch didn't work, and vacuums were left in the hallway the entire time. The room itself was comfortable enough and of a decent size. It had an old tube TV. The TV got bad reception, made a static noise, and had gray lines running through it. There were toiletries -- several bars of soap and some Bath and Body Works products. There was a coffee maker but no mini-fridge. There were soda machines and ice machines. The safe did not work. The bed was comfortable. Water pressure was good as was temperature. The a/c worked and was a noisy window unit. The room was horrifically outdated and dingy. The worst thing was an enormous (3-4') bubble on the ceiling where there must have been a leak. The paint was chipping and the ceiling was brown in spots. It needed to be taken down and replaced. Instead, it had just been painted over. It looked like it might cave in. There was also a rather large hole (about 2' wide) in one of the ceilings in the hallway. The location was OK. The neighborhood is residential but it's within 3 blocks of Columbus Circle. All in all, for the price paid, I could have stayed in a 4-star hotel. With some minor changes, this could be a 3-star hotel, but as it currently is, I would really say it's only 2 1/2 stars.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aussie in the world", "Title": "\u201cclose to subway, Central Park and theatre district.\u201d", "Author": "trav-lersmore", "ReviewID": "UR70395766", "Content": "Take eye covers if you wake up early with the sun, as the curtains are nylon only so you cannot block out the lights at all.

The hotel overall is in desperate need of a facelift however I expect that is why the rates are a little lower than others in the neighborhood. The worst part was being there during a heat wave with little or basically no air conditioning. It blows slightly but does not cool off the room or remove any of the humidity. Everything in the room was sticky and the ice melted in a matter of minutes due to the heat. We were attending a convention at the Sheraton and missed the convention rate deadline so we stayed here; also smoking rooms are getting harder to find and I quite honestly get tired of standing on the street corner in major cities when I want to have a cigarette so we booked at the Holiday Inn. Upon arrival I checked in which took a while as there was only one person behind the desk and a line of people. The lobby was very hot and stuffy. After checking in I noted they had booked me in a non smoking room. I went back down to the lobby; waited in line again. The only answer I received was yes you did reserve a smoking room but we are sold out of them right now. Just that nothing else. No apologies; just non smoking is all we have right now. They said they would t have a smoking room the next day b y 11:00. This room was a king and as I stated earlier a good size however the air conditioning was not working so I requested a fan; set it on the AC unit in hopes that it would help. It did not. The internet is so slow it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth the effort so I had to use my air card. The next morning we went down for the new room however none were cleaned. We were given a free drink coupon but were not in the mood to for alcohol that early in the day so we set in the hot and stuffy lobby and waited. Finally at 1:00 we were told our room should be ready soon; we elected to go back to our room and wait. And waited we did until about 3:00 PM. We packed up all our stuff and moved to the new room however they had given up a queen instead of the promised double. We went back to the front desk and they gave us two more coupons and the correct room however by this time we had lost a good portion of day and were unable to do some of the things we planned. The AC was no better in this room as well. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the small bathrooms, the peeling wallpaper and outdated d\u00c3\u00a9cor however limited AC during a heat wave was miserable.

I know it has a pool, conference room and various amenities but I'm the kind of traveler that would decline all that for renovated and spacious rooms. I was told to expect smaller rooms in NYC but the only complaint in size for the room I have is about the bathroom which is ridiculously tiny. The room was kind of old, needing new wallpaper and carpet (not a disaster, mind you, but I think it's about time they change it before it gets bad). The rate did not include breakfast, so I chose to eat out in a restaurant half block from there (The Morning Star, I'll review it soon, but recommend it if you're staying here).

Even though the room was basic and no frills, the view was wonderful! We could watch the sunset over the Hudson and look at the rooftops and towers to the south. I have to admit that we might not have enjoyed our stay if we were on a lower floor staring into windows of buildings across the street. If your focus is on the room, you will not be impressed. But who goes to NYC to sit in a hotel room? The location of this hotel is ideal! It is close to everything - but on a relatively quiet street. At the end of the block is 9th Ave with a huge selection of reasonably priced restaurants, cafes and snack options. We were approximately 2 blocks from Columbus Circle, Central Park and and the subway stop. We were happy with our maid service: our room was tidied up every day when we came back from our travels. The rooftop pool is quite nice and has beverage service and a large deck for sun tanning. Unfortunately, the pool hours do not make sense: what is the point of closing a pool at 6 pm on a hot summer night? Isn't the idea to offer a place for travelers (and their kids) to chill out after a day on the town? Even though we love swimming - we only made it back to the hotel in time for a dip twice. The lobby of the hotel was always buzzing with tourists and staff. Not the type of place you would want to lounge. Instead, take your book or newspaper to a local cafe.

Fortunately being on the 15th floor we were only disturbed by this a couple of times during the night. We also had an occasion where we had to pick out the cleaning guy who was vacuuming the room next door early one morning and allowing the door to bang continuously but after we spoke to him, there was no further problem.

The area around the hotel is also very safe and we have no issues walking back to the hotel after midnight. But generally Manhatten is really safe for all visitors. I am not sure about Harlem though as i did not explore north of Central Park during my visit. There are a couple of convenience shops(Walgreens) around the hotel as well as restaurants for breakfast. Make sure to try out Morning Star Restaurant for breakfast on the way to Columbus Circle subway station. There is a guy in there who has a slight hunch who is really friendly who dishes out lots of tips and advice for visitors. The check-in guy Valdy is also pretty helpful and friendly. Cons: the free wireless signal is really weak and you have to pay 1USD for 4 min of internet usage in the computers located in the hotel lobby. I may be thinking too much but i think i may have been scammed for tips by the bell services.

Is that even necesarry for 2 seperate guys to do a simple task? i ended paying a tip to the guy who hailed the cab for me as well. But overall, it was a really great experience at the hotel.

Now for the problem we had, and the reason we checked out a day early...the hotel does NOT have individual A/C units in each room. The entire building is either on air or heat, and the building apparently does not switch over to air until a date later than April. We were on the 7th floor and it was unbearably hot. We had the windows open, but then you have the issue of NY traffic noise. The staff at the hotel was incredibly nice and understanding of why we checked out a day early, but it is still a problem. Luckily, the rooms do have wi-fi, so I was able to get on the laptop and find another hotel (with air!) on 47th street (Hotel Edison). It was $20 more a night, and the rooms were a little smaller, and it was pain in the [--] to pack up and move all our stuff, but boy was it nice to have A/C for the last few days of our trip! A few other minor problems with our room...the TV never quite worked correctly. The remote would not work and you had to manually change the channels, some of which didnt come in clear. Also, there is really no place in the bathroom to place anything (shaving kit, brushes, makeup, etc). Minor problem, but again can be a pain when 3 people are sharing a bathroom. Once the A/C is turned on, I would recommend this hotel, simply for the location, the price, and the wonderful staff. One other NYC travel tip...DO take the hop on/hop off tour of the downtown loop. It is a great way to see all the areas (the Village, SOHO, Chinatown, etc), without having to use the subway or taxi.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cNeeds some re-hab - stat!\u201d", "Author": "mohicans", "ReviewID": "UR60487934", "Content": "This hotel needs to be renovated and I'm surprised that a hotel chain as large as the Holiday Inn is willing to risk their reputation by not attending to this.

The television is HORRIBLE - the regular stations fade in and fade out to the point where you get so angry that you decide to buy a movie - which, I suppose is what they want you to do. The location isn't great for the theatre district - its a pretty long walk if the weather is too hot, too cold or too rainy - but a little too short to justify a cab.

Housekeeping changed towels and soap daily. Running hot water throughout and good shower. 3) Large room, could easily accommodate 2-3 people. King sized bed, with a good mattress and pillows. 4) Breakfast was covered by a $20 voucher, which was enough for 1 person - 2 people could probably eat for that. Selection of healthy and non=healthy food (mostly unhealthy though) 5) Free wireless internet. 6) Mostly friendly and helpful staff. 7) Free gym though a little small but good selection of equipment and friendly staff. (swimming pool shut due to season) Minor Issues: 1) The furnishings are a little old but not so much to cause discomfort e.g. TV in my room was not a flat screen. 2) Dinner in hotel's cafe/restaurant was overpriced and food wasnt that great but plenty of restuarants/fast food/supermarkets and delis within walking distance to ensure large affordable variety. 3) Noise could be an issue for some people e.g. slamming doors in the middle of the night but its to be expected. 4) One of Cafe staff/waiters was a little unprofessional but all others were friendly and efficient.

Breakfast in the Gotham cafe was very good with a pleasant waiter and quick service. The only thing i can say i may agree with although it seems i have had this problem in most of the hotels i have stayed in in NY was the banging of doors in the night which is the thoughtless guests rather than anything the hotel did wrong .If i wanted to be really picky i would say the elevator was my least favorite thing over the weekend only because it stopped at every floor and guests realizing it was too full to get in would be too quick to push the button again so the door would open again and we we were a while getting down to breakfast .

As other reviews have highlighted, the decor is faded and a little tired, but at this price in Manhattan I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as long as you're not looking for luxury - and if you are then pay the (significant) extra $$$'s so you won't be disappointed. On reading some reviews it seems to me that some are expecting more than what they paid for - it's a Holiday Inn at a discount price after all. In our experience, even with young kids, you'll be out exploring NYC most of your time and the hotel is for crashing in at the end of a tiring day. We did not use the restaurant at all during our stay, so I cannot comment on the service or the food. There are too many options for eating out in this city so staying in a hotel to eat did not appeal to us. The location has to be the best thing about staying in this hotel, we loved the fact that we could walk to Columbus Circle subway station in a few minutes and hop on to get anywhere in the city. Central Park is also within a short walking distance, and the Times Square and Theatre District is only a 10-15 min walk away. There are also restaurants, pubs and diners nearby when you want to stay close. The neighbourhood is pleasant and safe and not too noisy. We were out with the kids after dark many times and did not feel at all threatened here. To sum things up, this is a good value hotel situated in a great location for tourists.

On one occasion our room hadn't been serviced (OK, we accept anyone can make a mistake) so we went down and asked for some shampoo and coffee (one complimentary coffee is given each day), when this was finally brought to the room the person went off with the huff because we did not give a tip for something that should have been done anyway.

We looked for extra bedding and there was none apart from a sheet and a pillow already on the pull out bed. Who cares we were so tired it didnt matter! the next day we were moved to a 7th floor room and that was fine. The rooms seemed clean, they provided an ironing board, hairdrier etc normal things. There is an ice machine on the 7th floor. There is no mini bar. I am used to having a safety deposit box in the room and was disappointed to have one in the reception area, so didnt bother and kept my stuff with me. It would have been nice to have a kettle in the room, perhaps thats just a British thing, its quite sad but we bought tea bags and boiled water through the coffee maker(you have to be quite resourceful). Breakfasts were ok, you are seated on arrival in the dining room and offered orange juice and tea, coffee or chocolate. Most of the menu involved an egg in some form or another, the pancakes were nice and the french toast was lovely! They always offered just Corn flakes but there were quite a few others so just ask. Every thing was charged separately and we had a priority club card which had points accumulated on it and this provided a discount of $10 off the bill.(it normally cost around $20.00 for 2 of us each morning.

The hotel delivered...but BARELY. Stayed from August 31 to Sept 3, 2009. First the good: As mentioned the location and price were definitely acceptable. Very safe and close to the subway and points of interest like Central Park. Housekeeping was very friendly and always greeted us with a smile. The room was spacious (we were in tower B). We didn't have time to use the gym but it is very well equipped (privately owned) but free for guests. Head east to the end of the block and you'll find a fantastic diner called Morning Star Restaurant. Family owned so the service was \"New York\" charming (and I mean that in a very good way). Not much to see from the outside...not much from the inside but the food was perfect and the service very very friendly. I regret not remembering the two waiters names but they are really good guys. So friendly and helpful, feel free to ask them for any advice, directions or suggestions on what to do. This price was also very reasonable unlike many other flashy diners. The bed was very comfortable and the a/c worked well although despite being a little bit noisy. Now the bad: For us, customer service is very VERY important. The parking guys were okay but I was not impressed with them leaning on our car as we unloaded our bags ourselves (bell hops were no where to be seen). I guess they really didn't care since they don't work for the hotel but for a contracted parking company called Apex. On a brighter note the cost of valet parking was reasonable ($25/day) and we did get our car back quickly without any noticable scratches. We interacted with 3 different front desk people on 3 different occasions and each clerk we spoke to never offered a smile or anything that resembled warmth....in fact one of them actually stopped smiling as I approached them. They did their jobs but honestly, how hard is it to be just a little friendly? HELLO!! You are in the HOSPITALITY business! A small fridge will cost you $10/day. I discovered this when I called to request one but decided to think about it. The next day I decided to invest in the convenience of a fridge since the ice machine was not on my floor (the one above was broken but the one on the floor below was barely working). This time they inform me it would cost me $25/day. I attempted to clarify why it was $10 yesterday and today it was $25...they respond \"we are sending one up now\". \"Well how much will it cost\" I reply, to which they respond \"complimentary\". I still don't know what exactly happened there but this is one of those times when 2 wrongs actually do make a right... The wifi at this hotel is very VERY slow and inconsistent. There isn't a wired option and sometimes it would give you a message that too many users are connected! The bathroom....NO counter space and an interesting stench...a body order / urinal like bouquet greeted the nose upon entering the room. The entire hotel also had a unique aroma...old cigarette smoke complimented with cheap air freshener with a delicate touch of must. The decor was also very depressing and in serious need of renovations. Summary: Decide for yourself if this is the hotel you would like to stay in.

Once the manager arrived, I spoke with her about my conversation at check in and that I wanted the room fee waived for that night. She had the audacity to say, \"You were happy with a 20% discount last night. when you checked in.\" I told her that we didn't really have much of a choice since there was no manager on staff when we arrived and with it being 1 o'clock in the morning and because we were traveling with children, we just needed shelter.

With our AAA card, we got a rate under $140/night... that's pretty unheard of for the area for a family of 4. I would only recommend the hotel if you get a rate you can't beat in a hotel where you feel like you'll be safe and it's relatively clean.

I noticed right away that a small side wondow was open. I prompltly closed it. this also lead to my discovery of the room darkening shade. Previous experieence has taught me that they can block out rays that can keep the room hot. Mine stayed shut for my entire six day stay. However, I noticed several open windows across the way in the south tower. Perhaps someone from the staff should go close those to keep the air in. This is not to say that the room temp is solely up to the guest. Holiday Inn management needs to look at shortening the floor length drapes to sill length. This will allow the drapes to close completely without blocking the AC. The drapes were flocked with an insulating maerial so the heat should be reflected outside, keeping the cool air in. Antoher issue I fretted about was smoke scented rooms. I brought along a bottle of Febreze. I thankfully did not have to use it. Yet, I have no doubt managment would have graciously honored my request to move if it had been necessary. And about the staff...they are efficient but they are not your best friend.

The bad: First off, floors 3-18 had no water for about 30 hours. This meant that if you went to the restroom before you realized there was no water that there was no way to flush the human waste down the toilet without water pressure. Second issue, guests would discard food trays outside of their rooms in the hallways. These trays would have discarded food on them. The trays would be in the hallways for days at a time. There were two on our floor alone, and one of them we had to walk by every time. Third issue, after walking by the same discarded tray of rotting food for over 48 hours, the smell started getting to my pregnant wife. So I picked up the tray and took it to the front desk so they could do something with it. I explained to the lady that the tray wasn't mine, and had been sitting in the hall by the elevator for over two days and that the food was starting to rot. Instead of apologizing, the woman at the front desk (where people check in) said, \"Why would you bring this to the front desk? What do you want me to do with this? (censored inflammatory religious reference) What nerve!\" Also, when the hotel floors 3-18 lost water, AC, and the ability to evacuate human waste from guest room toilets for about 30 hours most of the staff was rude and deceptive about the reason why and the amount of time to restoration. The staff refused to relocate me and my pregnant wife from the 12th floor to another hotel, and said that I was free to do so at my own expense. However, at the end of the trip they did refund me 50% (of one day) for the 30 hours we were without water, which is a satisfactory solution to me. The hotel also has a noise issue with doors. All of the doors slam so hard that they woke me and my wife up each time someone on our half of the floor entered or exited their room and allowed the door to naturally shut. Pool hours for the hotel were 10am to 6pm. You'd think they would be from maybe noon to midnight. My wife and I weren't able to make use of the pool because of the 6pm closing time. The elevators are slow and crowded as well and sometimes don't always function right. The good: If it wasn't for the horrible handling of the food tray situation and lack of water issue I would have had a very enjoyable stay! The best part of this hotel is the location. There are a LARGE amount of subway lines at the \"Columbus Circle\" station and you can actually access them from an underground tunnel that's at 57th Street and 8th Avenue (great if it's raining). You can quickly and easily use the subways to go anywhere, including Citi Field, The Brox Zoo, New Yankee Stadium, Anywhere in Manhattan. Also, you're within short walking distance of Times Square, the Broadway theatres, Restaurant Row, and beautiful Central Park. Although we received generally bad service, there was one very nice young gentleman that manned the front desk at night, he was a gem. The rooms aren't huge, but they aren't small either. The bathrooms are a little small and ours was showing ware, but nothing that was too bad. After all, it's a Holiday Inn, you're not there for a swanky bathroom. The TV's are alright and have lots of local and national channels to keep you entertained. While I had a few negatives listed about the pool above, it actually is a nice facility (just with bad hours). The rooftop pool, located on top the of south tower (perhaps above the 10th or 11th floor) has a great view of Manhattan and New Jersey. The pool facility is well maintained. The room cleaning staff, while they didn't fluently speak English, were very polite and did a great job of cleaning and replenishing the rooms with towels. The lady that took care of the 12th floor noticed we had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign because we didn't want room service each day and offered us towels when we came back to our room, which was very courteous and high-level of her. Also, the wireless Internet, while not blazing fast, was more than sufficient and much better than other hotels out there. It was easy to setup and use, and I was able to use it from my 12th floor north tower room.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location at a Great Price\u201d", "Author": "MaureenH19", "ReviewID": "UR33189309", "Content": "We recently spent 6 nights at this hotel.

When we arrived to the hotel, we were informed that there is only a room with king-size bed available. Since our teenager is over 180 cm tall, I could not accept that he sleeps in roll-over bed.

She promised that we could change the room next day if we like. They never delivered roll-over bed to our room. I had to go to reception again since after long flight we wanted to go to sleep. When \"brand-new\" roll-over bed came, it was horrible. Dirty, lousy mattress and too short to sleep properly. The result: our teenager did not sleep and had problems with his back. Next morning I had to go reception twice in order to get the room changed to one that was promised to us. We did not get any help with the luggages but need to carry everything by ourselves. Other challenges: If you live in lower floors, you need to wait a long time (10 - 20minutes) to get an elevator to go down. There are only three elevators and people staying in rooms above 10th floor fill those in. Breakfast is lousy. Go to deli on left side of the hotel, just in the corner.

Room was a twin bed room and was quite spacious for New York. The room itself looked a bit tired but was clean. The bathroom set up was a bit weird for me, with the sink outside!

The rooms were cleaned everyday to a good standard, but no one seemed to notice the mold in the bathroom! We used our vouchers for breakfast, and had some extras sometimes from the menu. Prices for breakfast did seem reasonable and were quick. The best thing about this hotel is its location! You could be in times square in about 15mins by walking. Did this most days - day and night - and felt quite safe. On the last day we were advised that we could actually use the breakfast vouchers we were given against the menu and minus $5 off the bill (which the reception conviently forgot to tell us). However this caused more problems than not, as when it came to the bill on check out we were still charged the full amount. The reception seemed to not care and couldnt be bothered to help and resolve the problem. So after realising it was like talking to a brick wall, we paid and left in a huff!

There is not much of a nightlife in the surrounds, but Time Square is not too far away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 15 or so blocks away (each block is not very big, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid!). There are some eateries if you keep walking towards the 9th, 8th avenues, but there is a Starbuck nearby if you need a quick feed. Duane Reade (a 24-hour convenience store) is also nearby if you need any essentials. Breakfast is available on the ground floor. The food was reasonably priced from $8 to about $15! Food was fine, with standard offerings. The food tasted a bit bland, but the fresh orange juice was very nice! Overall our stay in the Holiday Inn at 57th St was fairly standard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pleasant and expected.

Hence, we missed going inside. We found New York people to be generally unhelpful, uncaring (unless a tip was at stake) and pushy. The restaurant & room service at the hotel add on an automatic tip of 15% to all bills, taking away our right to choose how much we think the service deserves. There are plenty of cheap take out places and corner markets to buy food & supplies. We would recommend any other time to visit NY other than winter. As much as the city is beautiful with the Christmas lights, the cold, the crowds and the general attitude of the locals was hard to deal with. The traffic is a nightmare and walking is the best option. We had a fantastic day trip to Niagara Falls however the flights home were 2 and a half hours delayed due to the traffic at JFK.

On checking in we were given our room key on the 9th floor. The room itself was opposite the lift and on entering smelled damp, but worse than that were the suitcases and belongings in the room. Our room was already occupied! Luckily we are honest people and returned straight to reception rather than have a nose through other people's belongings! However the receptionist could not understand our disbelief at their error. She kept saying \"It's not my fault\" and was quite indignant rather than apologetic. I said that I hoped she would not hand out our keys to new arrivals, to which she again replied \"it's not my fault\" although after checking her computer finally said \"aah it was my fault\" although it was still not accompanied by any apology for the mix up! When we finally got into an unoccupied room it was basic and seemed clean. Luckily we had brought earplugs as whilst on the 8th floor was still noisy and located near the lift. Sound proofing is not a strong point of the hotel. The room itself was chilly and we discovered our heating was not working however the hotel sent an engineer immediately to fix and once on the heat meant we were no longer freezing. Our one and only experience of the hotel bar was using the free vouchers given to us by reception as an apology for the room mix up on check in however the surly girl behind the bar did not exactly make us want to stay and have a second drink or leave any tip as she was really quite rude. This was confirmed when a second customer arrived and queried something with her about a previous drink to which she responded that it was clearly shown on his bill. He then replied it would have been fine had she actually presented him with a bill. All in all it was a soul less bar area, chilly and unfriendly. Finally when we checked out which was early AM my friend screamed as a cockroach ran around the sink area. We assume it had been running over our toothbrushes on previous occasions which was a thought we would rather not dwell on. I reported it to the lovely (not) receptionist on checking out only to be informed \"madame this is New York, all big cities have cockroaches\". Hhmmm yes I appreciate that but where was the customer service during this whole stay. Had I paid some of the rates quoted on this site for this hotel I would have felt very hard done by, as it was we paid minimal rates as we booked a package so probably about \u00c2\u00a350 pppn. My advice would be if you are paying any more than this research other hotels even smaller boutique hotels where they actually care about the customer and wish them to return. Yes, the location was reasonable however cabs are so cheap you can get where you want at minimal cost. Personally when I return in March I would not stay here at any cost!

Let me start by saying that I am no expert on New York Hotels, this being my first visit. But I expected much more from a Holiday Inn, the previous week I had stayed in a Holiday Inn in San Francisco and the difference was chalk & cheese. However my sister was staying at the Novotel on 42nd? and said the rooms there were also below average, so maybe it's a NY thing. The room (16th floor) was very dated and smelled damp each time we entered. Also that awful Artex ceiling, which had damp patches. As a Platinum Priority Club member I was given vouchers for a complimentary continental breakfast, which mentioned Muffins, Bagels, Croissants etc. On the morning I tried it I was told by a waiter that I could have coffee, orange juice, and toast since they had nothing left. I never went back. Also tried the restaurant one night, which miraculously transforms from the breakfast room to an 'Italian Trattoria'. The only difference is the menu. It was a joke. The waiter clearly forgot to process our order and 45mins later presented us with toast, \"to keep us going\". Toast! My starter then arrived, then 30 secs later another waiter came out of the kitchen with our mains, spotted that I had just started my starter and did a U-turn back into the kitchen. No doubt our meals were kept under a hot-lamp for the next 10mins. I had no problem with the staff, other than the waiters. The bar and reception area's are fine. Was given a late 2pm check-out which was helpful, and the bell-boy arranged a car to JFK ($60). Safety deposit boxes are available at reception (no safe in room), these are free but you pay $100 if you lose the key. As mentioned already its located well for Central Park and Times Square is a 20min walk. Overall we enjoyed NY but next time I will look elsewhere for a hotel unless it gets rennovated.

She called me to ask and I asked to speak with the desk. That request was denied, and the conversation between the desk and my girlfriend went like this: 'What question does he have?' 'Cant he just ask you it?' 'I need to know what hes going to ask' 'What? (to me) Shes not beig helpful' 'I AM being helpful! Miss he can just call me at the hotel' 'Well Im on the phone with him now, right in front of you' 'Have him call...' Then i called and she denied any of the conversation had happened. She said 'I was right here and thats not what 'she' said.' Turns out, SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID IT!! Bottom line, the staff is rude and i will never stay here again.

They did have our room ready on time, so that was a plus. It's a huge holiday inn with tons of people going in and out and a very crowded lobby.

The room was OLD. Stained carpets, faded bed spreads, cracks in the bathroom, very old furniture, etc. The window in our room had fingerprints all over it (in other words, hadn't been cleaned in a long time). The beds were very worn, with a big divet in the center from so many people having slept on them. The sheets were worn (some discoloration/stains on them as well). The bed was bouncy and uncomfortable and the pillows very lumpy. Air conditioner is 100 years old, very noisy and not very cool. The bathroom was ok except for a very old shower curtain and MOLD on the ceiling. Black mold all over the ceiling. Gross! The bottom line is, it's hard to stay in a room like that and feel comfortable. You feel grossed out because everything is dirty and worn and you feel unclean even after you bathe and you can't sleep comfortably. In addition, there were several trays of half eaten food in front of one of the doors in our hallway on Saturday when we checked in. On Monday when we checked out, THEY WERE STILL THERE. Over 48 hours had passed, and half eaten food was all over the hallway. The elevators are also old and gross and smell.

The concierge provided good recommendations for meals and advice on airport transfers that would be cheaper and more convenient than a yellow taxi.

The hotel clearly does not train their employees on the value of good customer service. When we checked in, the front desk clerk looked up our reservation and said we had booked a smoking room with two double beds. My friend that booked the room, who is clearly pregnant, said no, I booked a NON smoking room with two double beds. The clerk proceeded to be argumentative and said that they were completely booked and had only a non-smoking room with one king bed or a smoking room with two double beds. We decided to try the \"smoking\" room with the two double beds and got our keys. Upon entering the room, it became apparent that the clerk gave us the wrong room - she gave us the non smoking with the one bed. Hmmm. Went back downstairs and another person (perhaps an assistant manager?) helped us. Told her we were given the wrong room. She checked the computer and low and behold, she was able to find us a non-smoking room with two double beds; which is what we had reserved in the first place. Interesting. On our last day, we were sitting in the lobby waiting for our shuttle; sat in worn out chairs with a little round table between the chairs that had a sign that said something to the effect of no eating and no drinking. Really? Can't eat or drink anything in the lobby? It wasn't as if the lobby was at all pristine; it's in desperate need of a serious make-over. Whatever. So after sitting down in the chair with one leg tucked under me (I'm on the short side and my legs didn't reach the ground in that chair!), a guy that was working the bell desk approached us and told me that I needed to put my leg (the one tucked under me) on the floor. REALLY??? Was he being SERIOUS?? The bottom of my shoe was not touching any part of the worn out chair, and the sole of the shoe was rubber so there was no risk of damaging any part of the chair. My friend and I were completely speechless. Absolutely, unbelievably, ridiculous. The hotel staff definitely does NOT make their guests feel welcome at all, nor do they make their guests want to come back! Wanting to complain about this experience, I approached the front desk to get a comment card in order to give them, well, my comments. The clerk said they don't have comment cards, but that I could write my comments on a blank piece of paper and give it to her. Wow -- it just kept getting better and better! By this time I was so completely appalled at the lack of customer service and the lack of motivation on the part of the staff to establish any customer loyalty. With so much competition out there, the company should re-think their policy on customer service. It's the little things that make a trip memorable and keep people coming back. I will never return to this Holiday Inn. No one ever greeted us the entire weekend, whether we were coming or going, or walking through the lobby. I prefer to stay in hotels that treat me like a guest. They don't have to go out of their way to make me feel comfortable, but I do prefer to be treated with respect.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMarch 2008\u201d", "Author": "MaverickViper", "ReviewID": "UR14484681", "Content": "I wouldn't use this hotel again!

The staff were helpful without being over friendly and in fairness sorted out a mix up over the rooms very quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Previous comments referred to long waits for the lifts but we did not find this a problem. Where this hotel really wins is its location. We found we could walk to Times Square in 10-15 mins and most of the other central attractions were also within walking distance for a relatively fit adult.

I was surprised to find a typical, not special, holiday inn. The hotel was nothing special. The staff seemed inconvenienced by my presence. From check-in, to the wait staff in the breakfast restaurant, to the really annoyed man who took my money in the breakfast restaurant, to the rather put-off man at check-out who really did not want to make change for a $10.00 bill, everyone was phoning in their customer service. It was the first time in a long time I've experienced such a lack of effort on the hotel's part. The elevators were always crowded. They are simply too small to accommodate the number of guests using them. I was lucky enough to get a top floor room, so could enter the elevator easily. But it always stopped five or six times on the way down, and could really only hold about six people, so people on lower floors were not able to get in (not that they did not try). There is a sign in the elevator that asks guests not to steal the elevator signs. Not a good sign. The room was comfortable and here's one real plus: very quiet. I did not hear any street noise and there was very little plumbing/mechanical noise. I usually wake up a couple of times each night when staying in NYC and slept through the night here. The linen and bathroom were clean and fresh, the bed comfortable, and the television worked very well. The hotel wireless internet was free and worked well. The location is a little north of Times Square and a little out of the way from the sites of NY, but it's just three blocks from the subway and the hotel seemed to do a good job securing cabs, airport transport, etc. for guests. It was worth it to take advantage of the low rate, but I would not say it was in the thick of things.

In my opinion, this is a totally standard Holiday Inn, which is definately not suitable for business travellers, but is a good tourist's choice. As for the problems, some of which were written about in reviews here: The airconditioning is definately inadequate (I removed the filter from the airconditioner, which improved its performance greatly). Bathrooms are very small, and the sink is outside of them (this may be an advantage for some). The overall appearance of some of the rooms is \"shabby\". The rooms facing 57th street are extremely noisy - ask for one facing the inner court. Lifts are slow and full, especially in the morning. Vending / ice machines in the corridors make terrible noise - be sure that ask for a room far away from them. Doors slam shut by themselves, and most guests don't seem to care about letting this happen, causing noise for their neighbours. The lobby is too noisy to hold a conversation in. Internet (for those who don't have a laptop) is ridiculously expensive - $1 for 3 minutes. On the other hand: Rooms are quite large (for NYC), and are clean. There is a rooftop pool and sundeck. Breakfasts were good. The location is great (in my opinion, much better than the Times Square area). Subway is 5 minutes away. Bus is 1 minute away. Lots of diners / restaurants in the nearby.

I was kinda pissed so I called American Express, they confirmed that it was a non-smoking, they talked to the clerk, who could not do anything because the mgr was on break. I was too exhausted to move to another hotel. Mgr comes at 9 apologises and promises me a room at 10:30 pm, gives me a drink voucher. I come back at 10:30 room is not ready, I had to wait.I was told by the front-desk clerk, she would let me know when the room was ready. She never did, I walked up to her at 11:30 and she comes up with some lame excuse Ithat she could not see me in the bar ( I was the only African-American man in the bar, with a drink order coupon). The room when I get in had a mediocre AC (yes the week of the tornado in Brooklyn). I called to get it fixed, and kept getting promises that they would fix it. I woke up one early morning to go outside to cool off, that is how bad it was. The only bright spot was the bellhops who helped people get cabs and car service when the subway flooded. They were a dedicated bunch. I hope another hotel steals them away.

It is the \"librarians'\" hotel for Book Expo. Last time our room was in the back tower facing onto 56th St. This time it was in the front of the building looking out on 57th St. 57th St is a busy, two-way street and gets lots of truck traffic, even late at night. We were on the 12th floor and it was still very loud. Plus the hotel room doors, like all too many, slam really loudly. It seems easing the doors closed is just too much to ask of 99.99% of all hotel guests, so you get the constant slamming of doors at all hours. Even worse, our room was directly across the hall from an ice machine that, inexplicably, was sitting right out in the hallway instead of in its own little alcove or room. Even when most folks were asleep, the machine kept making more ice and then noisily dumped it into the hopper. We had lunch in the lounge here the first day. The food was ok and somewhat fairly priced, but the beverages were outrageous. A flat Diet Coke, maybe 4 oz worth, was $4. Same with a small bottled water. Then they add 15% gratuity. I can understand adding gratuity to the bill for a large group, but adding it at a bar for a small group denies the patron the opportunity to express his or her level of satisfaction with the service, and therefore guarantees poor service. We tried to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning, but after waiting 25 minutes for a waiter, despite asking for one after 15, and seeing no fewer than 4 bored waiters wandering around with pitchers of coffee and juice, we got up and left. Pitiful service, no doubt because they know they have a guaranteed 15% coming to them no matter how bad the service. The hotel was in the process of renovation, so I won't comment on the cleanliness, although it wasn't too bad. Our room was a decent size, but the bathroom sink was separate from the shower/toilet room. Take note anyone thinking of sharing a room; there is little privacy while you shave/brush teeth, etc. The counter around the sink was so small that we had to keep our toiletries on the floor under the sink.

This is what my airport shuttle companions told me while driving from La Guardia to Columbus Circle. When I commented on the amount of construction taking place on 57th Street and its environs, the desk clerk suggested a room in their \"B\" wing which faced an interior courtyard rather than the street, adding \"Besides, there are two conventions in town and the house is full.\" Because I agreed to accept a smoking room rather than the non-smoking room I reserved, I was given a certificate good for a free drink at the bar and another certificate good for a free continental breakfast. So far, so good. The room turned out to be in an older wing of the building, and the smell of smoke permeating the corrider carpeting led me believe that the room itself would probably have cigarette burns on the furniture and carpeting. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The room itself was smell-free and had recently been scrubbed and vacuumed within in inch of its life. I can see why the locals like this place for their guests--the rooms are squeaky clean. Room service was good too.

I was surprised that free shower gel wasn't provided as this seems to be a fairly standard offering nowadays. The food in the hotel was ok. I was surprised to find that breakfast wasn't the usual Holiday Inn buffet, but just a menu-based affair - actually this worked out better for us, because they offered nice big bowls of fresh fruit and you just paid for what you ate - so if you don't feel like very much, you don't have to pay for the whole buffet.

I stay in NY several times a year and I have to say it was probably the largest room I've had. The location was much quieter than other hotels we've stayed at. It seems like it's in a quiet zone as we heard very few cab horns at night. The room's appointments weren't brand new but were fine.

The hotel provides free access to the basement-level health club which had a good selection of equipment and the usual towels, TVs, water, etc. It is, however, a windowless basement, frequented by people (and their trainers) who are there to work out, not see and be seen!

Skip the hotel breakfast and walk over to 8th avenue, head south a few blocks to the Bread Factory for a great breakfast. There is a major subway hub 2 blocks away at Columbus Circle (at the Time Warner building) where for 2 bucks you can take a train to Greenwich Village, 34th street shopping, The Natural History Museum, etc. While the hotel is not in the theater district, we opted for an easy walk back to the room after seeing a show rather than take a cab.

The hotel is lovely & clean. The staff were very nice and helpful at the reception , the concierge & the room porter's. On every second floor there are vending machines for cans of minerals.(make sure you have one dollors handy as they cost 1.25$ but r the nicest in the world if u wake up in the middle of the night gasping!! They also offer pay -per -view movies, which is really good, esp if uv been out all day & ur in bed early with ur feet up. The room service is also really good, but avoid the steak( very fatty). The hotel isn't in a bad location , it is about 10 blocks from broadway & times square. But If I was going back I think I would stay closer to the main area. I couldn't honestly fault the hotel as it is really nice, and really holds its head high to be rated as a 3 star. The reason I think I was a bit disappointed in the location is because we walked the length & breath of NYC, so by the time I got to Broadway (I was saying oh nooo not another 10 blocks!!) To stay somewhere closer good spots are the wellington, or the edison. also the Pennsylvania Hotel which is a good location, but to be honest as a travel Agent I have heard some nasty stories about it..I would highly reccommend the Holiday Inn, but I wouldn't oversell it for it's location.However there is a subway stop on 59th street that will bring you downtown, soho etc for $2pp one way.Shopping Tips for NYC: go to Pearl River in Soho, go to Cliquers on 34th Street across the road from Macy's and down a bit towards the empire state building. And also watch out for a chain shop called Rainbow, there is one on 34th St & 57th St ( next to the Holiday Inn. ALso if you are going in October try to stay for the night of the 31st and go see the Halloween Parade( the New Yorkers take it to the next level.) I was so disappointed that we were coming home on the 31st and missed it. One more tip for NYC.. if you want nice accommodation & not too expensive book the radio city apartments, excellent location, really clean and handy.You can book these through [-] or through your travel agent as sometimes the radio city give out their allocation to agents, so their website may not have availability but you will get it from another agent,but book early as they are really popular. Also one more tip: when coming from the airport instead of getting a taxi which will probably rip you off, book a shuttle on [-], it is so convienent & inexpensive. When you arrive in JFK go to the Ground Transportation desk and hand them your confirmation, the mini bus takes about 8/9 ppl and in turn drops you off at each hotel, on the return you ring super shuttle 24 hours before you travel home to reconfirm your booking and flight number, they will give you a new reservation number and a pick up time to be outside your hotel. The best thing about this is that when you pay for it at time of booking you know how much you will be charged etc, as taxis in nyc charge while they stand in traffic. If you want to tip the driver then that is up to yourself. And finally I just have to say that the 2 shopping trips one to Jersey Gardens & one to Woodbury Common are great. If you are stuck for time and money then go to Jersey Gardens(30 mins of a journey & it has a Nike Factory shop, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren etc, it is indoors and compact. Also it is a lot cheaper and shorter journey to get to than Woodbury Common, You go to the 2 nd Building on the left ( when you are standing in front of it looking at it) at the Bus Port Authority , go to the desk ask for your return ticket to Jersey Gardens , go to exit 222 and look for bus NJ Transit 111( this may change from time to time, ) Woodbury Common is also great but it takes an hour to get here and costs about $48pp for the bus alone as you are buying this from a new york sights seeing company.) Woodbury Common is outdoors and has loadsa shops, george Beene, Donna Karen, Armani , Gucci, Adidas Factory, Nike Factory. But to be honest if you are not into Gucci etc, Jersey Gardens is def the place to go. It has everything woodbury Common has but less expensive to get there!!Happy Shopping!!", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland , Australia", "Title": "\u201cvery good stay\u201d", "Author": "Boey-7", "ReviewID": "UR6709646", "Content": "Had a very nice stay at this hotel, good location, clean and tidy, friendly staff. beds a bit old and food just ok, but overall it was a very nice visit to the big apple.Thankyou Holiday inn.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "26travellers", "ReviewID": "UR6693217", "Content": "We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown for two nights in January, rooms were very spacious and clean as was the hotel.

The purpose of my trip was a girls' trip to visit friends in the city and go see a broadway play. We stayed for two nights. We arrived about two hours prior to check in and there was no problem getting into our room early. The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything from restaurants to shopping to subway routes. The rooms are huge for NY and the linens were very clean (I love crisp white sheets.) The water was very hot and you never had to wait between showers. The location of the hotel was close enough to almost everything if you don't mind walking. For people who don't want to walk a few blocks this might not be the hotel for you. When we checked out, they stored our luggage because we had a late afternoon flight. We didn't even have to ask. Finally, something that I have never had happen in all my years of travel - when we received the bill, the nightly rate was actually lower than what we were quoted when we booked.

This hotel is great value compared to many similar hotel brands in New York. On arriving at 7pm, check-in was fast & efficient. Front desk staff & concierge were all polite & helpful. Rooms are extremely spacious by NY standards, with plenty of space for suitcases etc. The bed was very comfortable & never had any problems sleeping at night. The decor is ok & room amenities just fine. Housekeeping was efficient. The hotel is well located & within walking distance to the main tourist spots. Central Park is just a couple of blocks away, & Times Square, a leisurely 10-15 minute stroll. We walked everywhere, apart from to the financial district, when we used the subway. Always felt safe when walking around, even at night. There are loads of great traditional Diners near to this hotel & most are open 24hrs. This means you can always get something good to eat & you dont need to rely on the hotel, where the restaurants are on the pricier side. I would definitely choose this hotel again as it really was a good value for money base to explore NYC. This is not a luxury hotel, but then it doesn't pretend to be. Its a clean & affordable option with spacious rooms & friendly staff. If you're going to New York to shop & do the tourist thing, then the Holiday Inn Midtown is a good choice. Why spend loads on many of the other big chains (Hilton / Renaissance / Westin etc) when you can get the same amenities for much less.

The website photos are - least to say - a glorified impression of this motel-wanna-be-hotel. I paid $300 a night in October and for this rate it is totally NOT worth it and a total dump. OK, if you get a killer rate and want basics, this is it. When I entered the lobby it stank mildew. The bellboys were just standing chatting and had no interest in helping with the luggage neither when I arrived or left. The day I left they tried to force me to book a limo-taxi for the airport and got aggressive when I declined; they earn commission on these bookings.

I don't need extreme luxury if I travel for short trips and look for budget accommodation, but for this rate I would expect something much better. The location is not good either and there are far greater hotels in NYC for better rates on better locations. The location, a bit off-beat, really kills that awesome NYC feeling you get when you visit the Big Apple and you somehow feel a bit cut-off from the real center.

We had never been to NYC before, and thought it would be ideal for a short holiday. The city and attractions were fantastic, however our experience with this hotel was extremely disappointing. We are well travelled and have stayed in hotels all over the world. Never have we had such sub-standard accommodation. We do know what to expect from a 3 star property, having stayed in many without incident. Our room was on a non-smoking floor, which we had requested - however the smoke from the room below came through the vents continuously and consequently, not only did the room have the foul odour which pervaded the entire hotel, we were subjected every day to strong cigarette odour. I have quite severe allergies and could barely manage to complete our stay here. There were food service trays in the hallways every day - the same ones that were there when we arrived. During the entire 4 days these were never removed and the odour of rotting food grew in intensity very quickly. Our room was not serviced each day. On our way out one morning we encountered a member of the housekeeping staff who threw a number of disheveled towels in our direction and were told that was it for the day! We had to return to our room to leave the towels. The shower handle fell off at least twice during every shower and the shower itself was anything but powerful - a mere trickle would be an exaggeration. I could never get all the shampoo rinsed from my hair before the water turned ice cold. Unfortunately, the only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that all the concierge staff we dealt with were pleasant, knowledgable, friendly and would obtain tickets quickly for any attraction you might want.

We did not eat at the hotel, but did find adequate restaurants (although expensive - I guess that is what you should expect in New York) in the area.

We were given a room on the 2nd floor, and as soon as we got off the elvator, there was a disgusting, rotting smell. Turned out it was someone's room service food in the hallway (meat with a sauce? coffee with milk?), super ripe, with a film on top. Called front desk, assured they would remove. The bathroom was disgusting: dirty, one towel, water on the floor, strange sewage marks, etc. We came back from dinner that night; the food was till there; called again. The next morning food was still there and the smell had pervaded the room itself. I have travelled a lot, and generally budget and hostel level, and this was grosser than anything I have seen since the hostel in New Orleans during a heat wave when I was a teenager. In other words, my standards are not super picky. So I called again, was offered free breakfast ( kids eat free anyway, so whatever). Went out for the day, came back and the food was still there, now with flies and strange colorings. The room was stinky as hell and the air conditioning was not great (this was during a 90-plus days, even into 100 degree, btw). So I went to the front desk and had some sharp words, which I have never done before. I offered to clear the food myself and the front desk person yelled at me... Talked to the manager, very calmly, and she was wonderful. She swapped my room for a lux 9th floor corner room, tra la. That was great! However, when we left the next evening, I stopped in on the 2nd floor (this is perhaps a 3-minute walk from the front desk) just to see...it was still there.

The only reason I did am not rating this hotel \"Excellent\" rather than \"Above average\" is that the mattress/box spring in my room was uncomfortable and creaked whenever I moved--larger, more absorbant towels would also have been welcomed. The location of this hotel is good for exploring the city. A major subway hub is only 1.5 blocks away at Columbus Circle. Lincoln Center, Central Park, and the theater district are an easy walk from this hotel. While the immediate area surrounding the hotel is residentual, there are numerous restaurants nearby, especially along 9th Avenue going south toward the theater district. The only meal I ate in the hotel's restaurant was breakfast, which was good, but not outstanding. The service in the hotel's restaurant was good in spite of the fact that the gratuity was automatically added. The hotel's parking garage provided a good value for NYC parking at only $20/day for hotel guests. There are no in/out priviliges, but you really don't want to drive around NYC anyway! Overall, this hotel is a good choice for someone who wants a clean, pleasant place to stay that is moderately priced ($200 or less) by NYC standards.

Leadership is abysmal, and is reflected in the outrageous treatment given to the guests by the employees. First, let me say this is a beautiful hotel and there are a few very good employees (especially the people who clean the rooms). However, for the most part, the employees reflect the worst attitudes possible in the service industry. 1. ATTITUDE. NO ONE SMILES. In fact, there appears to be a significant effort on the part of employees behind the reception counter, and in the restaurant, to avoid smiling, even when charming customers from various countries are smiling at them. 2. ATTITUDE. EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ARE RUDE. Employees behind the reception counter act as if it is a great inconvenience to them to have to listen to a customer. They interrupt before they know what the issue is, and they treat customers rudely. Again, not all employees, but most. 3. ATTITUDE. CUSTOMERS ARE THE PROBLEM. There is no effort to fix problems, but, rather, to make excuses for why they can't be fixed, especially at the management level. The bell hop dropped my computer monitor. I reported it to security and they took a report. I heard nothing more about the incident. The next morning, I walked by a bell hop I believed to be the one who mishandled my monitor. He said something like \"two, two, two.\" I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if that was a curse, or if he was saying something to the man next to him who was on the phone. It sounded more like a spit than words. 4. VALUE. YOU GET HALF OF WHAT YOU PAY FOR. There are two kinds of hotels. One provides a bed, the other provides a wonderful experience that makes guests want to come back, and to tell their friends. This hotel provides a bed (plus a bad experience). I can't recommend it to anyone. 5. GRATUITIES (TIPS). GRATUITIES ARE MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTION. Gratuities are automatically added to every check, at the bar, and in the restaurant, even for one person. There was no clear answer about the percentage rate of the tip, only that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minimal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whatever that means. This allowed the employees to take a \"could care less\" attitude, and most did. The occasional employee with excellent social skills gets screwed out of a good tip. 7. RESTAURANT. RESTAURANT SERVICE IS RUDE. Waiters walk away while the customer is ordering, the music playing is most inappropriate, and is set to produce the familiar echo of over-amplified third-world radio stations. When I asked one waiter if the tip was included, he quickly said it was included, grabbed the bill and my credit card and disappeared. The two numbers at the bottom of the check that looked like they could have been tax and tip weren't labeled, and seemed way out of proportion. He didn't bother to show me the tip, or tell me how it was calculated. The only thing that came back with my credit card was the receipt for my signature. I was in a hurry, so I didn't question him on it. It made me feel like he stole from me, even if he didn't. 8. BAR. THE BAR IS BORING AND FRUSTRATING (BECAUSE OF THE STAFF, NOT THE GUESTS). I was at the bar for about an hour one night. There appeared to be two bartenders. One was constantly away getting food for the bar, while the other sat in a chair at the bar doing paperwork. The two employees appeared to be at each other throats. The bar was full, and people were upset that they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get service. But why should the bartenders provide service when their tips are automatically included in the bill? The bar environment would drive any employee crazy (and the customers hated it too). There was disco music playing from the PA system and a loud TV playing in the lounge area of the bar. It was the most pathetic bar experience I have ever had. 9. COMPUTER ACCESS. SOMETIMES THE WIRELESS NETWORK PROVIDES PLUG AND PLAY ACCESS. I was given a wireless network bridge to attach to my computer so I could use the wireless network in the hotel. This is a free service to customers with computers. For 8 hours I worked with the people providing bridge service via a 1-800 number. Most of the time was spent waiting on them to get back to me. Finally, they had me change out the equipment at the desk, and that solved the problem. They guy behind the desk said \"you should have just brought it back right away.\" That wasn't helpful or fair, since one of the people at the desk told me to make the calls to the support company. 10. VENDING. THERE ISN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T ANY VENDING. I went to floors 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Those are the floors with soft drink machines. Not one of the machines worked (see pics). This was reported to management on the first day I was there, and it was that way when I left. On the last day, I bumped into one of the bell hops in the elevator, and even he knew there were no soft drinks to be had from the vending machines. The hotel manager whined that he could only advise the restaurant that the machines needed to be filled. But why should the restaurant fill the machines that charge $1.25 for a soft drink, when they sell the same soft drink from a refrigerator in the restaurant for $2.00, plus never having to work to keep the machines filled? The boutique/store in the hotel is forbidden to sell soft drinks. 11. HOUSEKEEPING. HOUSEKEEPING IS GREAT. The housekeeping staff did a marvelous job. They were very friendly and courteous and the room always looked great. Out of 5 stars (5 being the highest), this one gets a 1. The housekeeping staff kept it from getting a zero. It could have been amazing, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even mediocre.", "Date": "November 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

The rooms were big and the housekeeping staff were great and did a nice job cleaning the rooms. The location of the hotel is great in terms of midtown activities. Those are the positives. The week before we stayed there the temp was 87 degrees one day to the hotel decided to turn off the room heating system. The night we got there the temp out was 40 degrees and the room was cold. We tried to use the room heater and it didn't work. The next morning I complained to the manager and he informed me that once they turn off the heating system and turn on the air conditioning system, the don't reverse it due to the efforts it takes to make the change. They offered us extra blankets and we were cold most nights. One night we ran two hair dryers, the iron, and the shower as hot as it would go to warm up the room but it blew out a breaker switch and our floor lost power for about a half hour. The elevators are really slow and small, so make sure you are not on floors 3-8 because when they are coming down from the upper floors they are usually full and you have to wait to finally squeeze onto one. Places to eat and drink. Do \"Ralph's\" over on the southwest corner of 56th and 9th avenue. A great italian resturant. Great house wines and great food. Also, there is \"Jake's\" bar and grill on the northwest corner of 57th and 10th avenue, just down the street. A great place to go for a late night drink.

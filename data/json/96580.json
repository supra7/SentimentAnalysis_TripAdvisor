Still Waters offers lots of amenities, including paddle boats, kayaks, and bicycles, all free for guests to use. There is laundry onsite, a playground, and an arcade.The new Oasis pool and hot tub is beautiful, but be warned: it is much, much smaller in person than it appears to be on the website!

Again, it is fairly small, so I can see crowds being an issue. Overall, Still Waters is a great place for families to stay, is close to Silver Dollar City, and has a lot of amenities. Unfortunately, it is very expensive to stay here in the summer,(we're talking Disney-like prices!) and even on the off-season it can be pricey, unless you catch a special.

Then I decided that for the price we paid, it was average. We only booked for two nights, and did not have a coupon, so our rate was not a great bargain for the one bedroom condo in Building I. If you checked around, I am sure there are discounts to be had, especially for a longer stay. I will start with the good, as there definitely was a lot of great things about the resort. The employees and staff we dealt with at the front desk and marina were all great to deal with. They were friendly and accommodating. We loved the pools, and marina area. I also walked outside three different times around the resort during the morning and evenings. I felt very safe and was impressed with how well maintained it was. We did eat breakfast and had pizza at Parmesan's. I believe they could do more business with breakfast if they had a donut shop bring in fresh pastries, as the cinnamon rolls there were just so-so. The pizza, on the other hand, was quite good. We would have liked to try the subs, but didn't have time. Our room was clean and very spacious. We did find it odd that a condo advertised to sleep 4 only had living room seating for 3. There was a loveseat and chair. The kitchen chairs aren't overly comfy for all of us to sit together and watch a movie. The murphy bed is big enough for two kids, only if they are 7 or younger. The stackable washer and dryer were nice to have, so we could do a little laundry. I did find it a bit yucky that they have a note up to wash your own dishes and not leave dirty ones. Not that I would leave dirty dishes, but felt compelled to wash them before use, as you don't know how clean the prior guests were. It was also a bit surprising that they only offer a towel exchange and expect guests to take out our own trash. Seems that should be optional. As I said, for the price, you would think you might see some of these services. We also had the hair dryer blow up on us. This really wasn't a big deal. It was before 11:00 pm, so I called the operator number. I was told to call back after 7:00 am, and a new one would be brought up. I ended up just using my own travel dryer, but my son pointed out that my name and room # should have been taken, and they just bring a new one in the morning. He said they should not make me call twice. Again, not a huge issue, really! Our only big complaint about our stay was the NOISE! My husband figures the walls are made with 2x2 studs. We were on the 3rd floor, so we had someone on top, bottom and beside us. None of them were terrible, but we could hear EVERYTHING.

We watched as one of the hot tubs needed a repair and within hours of it failing, they had a team of 3-4 people removing concrete and addressing the failing parts.

We arrived at Stillwaters during the same week of the year as our first visit. When we arrived this year, there were many families we recognized from our visit last year. The condos are gorgeous! They are modern, spacious and clean. I would recommend trying to stay down by the lake. We tend to prefer Building J. The views are breathtaking as the sun sets over the Ozarks. Book early if you would like to have a lake view. We have already booked our room for next year and there were many rooms already booked for lake views. The staff at Stillwaters is amazing! They seem to always have a smile on their face, willing to go the extra mile to make your stay memorable and say hello as you walk by. That \"Southern hospitality\" alone makes a person feel like a member of the Stillwaters family. There are three wonderful pools. If you have kids, you will become very familiar with the \"Zoom the Flume\" pool with its waterslide, which is fun for young and old and the \"Oasis Pool\" with its zero depth entry and gorgeous waterfall. We also spent a lot of time in Table Rock Lake. They have free kayaks and paddle boats to use as you wish at the dock. Swimming off the end of the dock is the best! The water is a balmy 85 degrees and clear! The water at the end of the dock is around 25 feet deep, so there are no weeds or muck to touch. During our weeklong stay, we had one important decision...beach or pool? We also spent one morning during our stays with a fantastic fishing guide on Table Rock Lake. We fished last year with Mike Webb of Webb's Guide Service and this year we fished with Bill Beck. We had tremendous fishing this year, catching 68 bass with three lines in the water over 4 hours.

I only have two negatives....The front desk could be more friendly. Just in general more friendly, more smiley and more willing to give out info about Branson. Instead they lacked smiles, friendly voices and eye contact. This was front desk staff only....the laundry service, maintenance, and marina staff were quite the opposite and extremely friendly. The best thing we did at Stillwater was to rent one of their ski boats as well go paddleboating and kayaking. Both excellent experiences....the lake is SO clean....this was very appreciated coming from Iowa.. However I looked closer at our receipt today from the boat rental and realized I was charged near $80 to fill the boat up with gas after our 4 hour boating adventure. This seems ridiculous to me as the tank was still nearly on full when we returned the boat. Maybe this is normal or maybe I didn't read the boating charges thoroughly enough on the contract I signed.

I told them I'd join them for a few days.....but after my 4-day stay I told them that I planned to return next year for the entire week. My favorite place was \"The Oasis\" pool/spa area. It's a place for everyone from toddlers to senior citizens. The sounds of the water gushing out from the \"waterfall\" drowns out any screaming from the kids that might otherwise be annoying in any typical pool. The rooms were clean and certainly adequate. I would never consider staying anywhere else unless I found a pool area that could beat \"The Oasis\". I've read some criticisms of the place. (Just a few).

Our 2 bedroom condo was spacious, clean and well stocked. Our 3 boys loved having their own bedroom with a bath and small kitchen. My husband and I loved the master bedroom with a king size bed, large closet and jetted tub. The kitchen with high counter tops and stools was a great place to make all our meals and still be with our kids. Our condo was on the bottom floor with a screened in porch that over looked the lake and 3 docks. We spent a lot of time on that porch.The docks near us had great \"fun\" pads on the end for fishing and swimming. The kids loved the geese and ducks that visited. We used one of the 3 grills that were located close to our condo a few times. The three pools were a blast. My youngest boys adored the large pool with the waterfall, huge hot tub and hammocks. My oldest preferred the waterslide pool. I even had fun sliding down that water slide! The pools are not heated and it wasn't very warm so it was COLD, but we didn't mind. The playground area was large and we saw adults, teens and kids enjoying the area. Basketballs, horseshoes and volleyballs were provided and my kids loved the kid size basketball hoop. The whole place was clean and very pleasant. We stayed for 4 days and didn't have time to enjoy the free bikes, paddleboats and kayaks. The drive into Branson was a little long (about 20 min) but it was hilly and scenic. We enjoyed the drive! Check-in and out was a breeze and the staff was friendly. We had no issues. My husband, who travels for a living was impressed the how well the kitchen was stocked. We had a family above us at the condo for the last 2 days and you could hear them walking around and their water usage. It didn't bother us, but I could see how others could find that annoying. I highly recommend this place to any family, but not to couples who want a quite, relaxing vacation.

The drive from Branson theater district to this resort can be somewhat annoying. It's about 20 minutes. Not so bad, but driving it at night can be eye straining. The roads are winding. The other thing I didn't like was the layout of the resort. They need more walking trails or possibly a paved way to the lake. We stayed here 4 nights but barely saw the lake. The walkway and access to the lake wasn't great. While on the resort you can't tell you're next to the lake. Rooms were awesome though!

The other contains 2 queen size beds, and there's a pull-out bed in the main living area. The units also have stacked washer/dryers, a fully stocked kitchen, and a balcony. The resort also has several swimming pools that were freezing cold while we were there, but which had daybeds to read on. There are several play areas that are equipped with basketballs, volleyballs, etc., to play in them, as well as a marina with free watersport rentals. We played with the kayaks and paddleboats in the cove; it was very relaxing, and the kayaks are virtually untippable. The staff were very nice as well; the lady at the front desk told us several short-cuts to get to the attractions and where to go for hiking, cheap groceries, and entertainment. They even called on our second day to make sure we didn't need anything, which was a nice touch. We did have issues with children stomping around upstairs, but at least it was after we were already up. I think most of the rest of it is covered by other reviews, but in sum total, this is a really nice place to stay.

Being a frequent user of Trip Advisor, I used the site to find a resort that was located on the water. I selected Still Waters because of the reviews and because the location at Indian Point was closest to Springfield. We stayed April 20 - 22. Still Waters is a Condo Resort. Here is the description of the property and the amenities from their website: Stillwatersresort.com Recommended by Better Homes & Gardens as the \"preferred place to stay in Branson\", Still Waters Condominium Resort is your \"complete destination resort\". A cut above other Branson resorts, Still Waters has put it all together. Combining more accommodation choices, new Table Rock lakefront condos along with all the activities of Table Rock Lake just minutes from Silver Dollar City on Indian Point Road.... Making Still Waters your perfect vacation destination. Enjoy FREE kayaks, FREE paddle boats, FREE Innertubes, FREE kids fishing. Three outdoor pools and a free 50ft waterslide. Kiddie pools, hot tubs, five boat docks, a full service Marina, free in-room and on property WiFi, basketball & volleyball courts, a large covered pavilion for your group & more. I booked a two bedroom lake view condo through Priceline and was very pleased with the accommodations. If you go to the resorts websites, you can see the floor plans of the different rooms. The resort seems to be pretty new and has contemporary furnishings and decorating. The condo was large and had two bath rooms. The master bath was big and had a two person whirlpool tub in it but the shower was quite small. The bath off the bedroom was not large but it worked fine. The kitchen was spacious and well stocked with the exception of paper towels or napkins -so bring your own. The beds and pillows were super comfortable but if you prefer very firm bed/pillows \u2013 you probably won\u2019t like the beds. The towels were thick and fluffy \u2013 better than any hotel towels I have ever had even at many 5 star resorts. Because it is a condo resort they don\u2019t have daily housekeeping but they do offer towel exchange each day. You can take these towels to the pool but I didn\u2019t want to mess with the towel exchange so we just brought our own pool towels. There was a washer and dryer in our condo that we used to dry the wet towels. The resort also had a couple of laundry buildings too so I am assuming some rooms may not have washer and dryers in them. Our room was 223 in building F which has three floors. If you picture a horseshoe - building F would be the first building at the bottom left of the horseshoe and is close to the end of the cove of the lake. The deck faces the south. The other buildings with lake views are buildings G, H, I, J, K, L with I, J, K and L being the closest to the marina and the bigger part of the lake. These views face the west. If you are going to pay a lake view, you might see about requesting a room on the top floor in H, I, J, K if possible. The resort property and the condo was very clean overall with one small exception. The master whirlpool tub had water and some bugs in it when we checked in. Not a huge deal but I planned on taking a bath so I called down to the front desk to see if they had some cleaning supplies so I could clean the tub. They were very apologetic and said they would switch us to a new room. I told them we had already unpacked and didn\u2019t really want to move. The gentleman said that housekeeping had already gone home for the day but they would send someone up immediately to clean the tub and also give us a coupon for a free pizza which pleased me since I was just about to order one for our dinner. After a few minutes the maintenance man showed up to clean the tub. He gave me pizza coupon and said that the manager also took off $20 off my room bill. I thought that was very nice of them to do that. My sons had fun playing basketball. Basketballs are provided at the resort. There is a short basketball goal and separate court for the younger kids too. We enjoyed many of the free activities provided and also spent some time playing in the arcade. Most games were only one token. We had a lot of fun. There are three very nice pools but only one with the slide was open but it was too cold for us to swim although I did see others. The one large zero depth pool was very nice and had a large hot tub that we did use. A couple of the other hot tubs were also open at the other pools. The property was very nicely landscaped and we found it to be very peaceful and relaxing. We were going to rent a boat for 2 hours but didn\u2019t because the marina was closing in 1 hour at 5pm and all boats had to be back before then. So if you decide you want to rent a boat you should rent it in the morning or in the early afternoon. The price for a large pontoon was $119 for 2 hours plus gas. They have 10 or so speed boats and another 10 or so pontoon boats. All of the boats were new and very nice. The kayaks, paddleboats, tubes, etc. all seemed to be fairly new as well. Not having stayed at a condo resort before I wasn't sure what the expecations were upon checkout. They request that there are no dirty dishes left in the room so we just loaded and ran the dishwasher before we left. They also ask that the trash be taken out one of the nearby dumpsters. Easy enough. Pro\u2019s: - Great family resort with lots of amenities and activities - Spacious rooms with DVD players - Nice pools and hot tubs - Friendly management who cared about making my stay right Cons: - Check in/out times could be expanded. Check in isn\u2019t until 4 pm and check out is 10 am which seems a little early. I think they should at least make it 10:30 or 11:00am. - The remote control was missing a battery - Somewhat thin walls, floors \u2013 you can hear other walking around on floor above you and toilets flushing, running water, etc. in rooms next to you - TV\u2019s were not flat screens \u2013 not a big deal but for some reason my kids think so We really enjoyed our stay and I highly recommend this resort. In fact I was thinking it would be a great place to hold a family reunion.

I thought a place for everyone of all ages...Water slide .... 3 pools 2 kiddie pools, game room.. bikes...paddle boats....fishing pole...Well where do I start. Ok we live 7 hrs from the resort so we arrived at 2:30pm. Check in is at 4pm. I thought that gives the kids 1 hr to look around the resort, the pools play area and marina (that closes at 5), before we go to the room. We went to check in to let them know we were there. The man behind the desk was rude and charged my card twice. We drove around the resort and saw that all of the pools are closed, the bikes are locked up, and The Market was closed. There is not a working AC in the game room. We went back up to the desk to find out when the pools would be open. Now there was a different man behind the desk and he told me that when we made the booking they were to tell us that the pools were closed until April. How can you promote Spring break in March on your web site and leave out that the pools would be closed until April? Our condo that overlooks the marina looks like a marsh is in the back. The only cool thing about the marsh is ducks and geese that hang out there. The dishes in the cabinets were dirty, the can opener does not work and there was only 2 pans. The dish washer, Washer and Dryer can be heard through the walls from next door. We book a 4 night stay at the resort via living social. We used 2 vouchers, 2 night each, which was to come with a marina credit for $50 per voucher. No where does it state that you have to use it for a 4hr pontoon rental. We were informed this after we were out for 6 hr and came back to settle up. We were thinking that we were getting $100 off. But we were informed that we could only use 1 of the credits. There is not a single place I could find that states we could not use both credits. Also the website states that it is a $50 credit per voucher at the Marina... did not state there is a minium of 4 hrs on the pontoon. However it does state that all credits must be used in a single visit. Overall it is reall hard to find a resort that can offer things for all of our kids to do. And I thought Stillwater was the place and maybe it could have been if they would have been honest when I booked it.....

Our trip was in October, and we had been told the marina would be closed at that time, but, because weather permitted, they remained open, and we were able to enjoy the paddle boats and kayaks during the last full week of October! The water in the pools was, of course, too chilly for anyone but kids, but two of them hadn't been drained, so provided a beautiful backdrop to several days of wonderful fall weather and one of the most georgeous autumn leaf displays I have ever experienced. There are hammocks in the \"Oasis,\" the bigger of the pools, and the huge hot tub was fully operational. I must comment that the large hot tub has a LOT of class! When I heard it would hold 16 people, I was anticipating a bit of awkward sitting around with people I didn't know, trying to make conversation. It has private spaces and is rock-lined, and beautifully landscaped. BTW, we had some very nice chats with other vacationers, but when we felt like having privacy, it was available. The Oasis area also boasts some beautiful lounging space. There are \"normal\" pool chairs, but also some huge platforms with futon-type mattresses--you could feasibly eat, sleep, and hang out there at the Oasis all day. But then you would miss the gorgeous lake setting, the bikes, the horseshoes, the basketball, and watersports mentioned earlier in the article. I had checked this place out on TripAdvisor prior to our trip and some of the commenters had complained about the fact that no one makes the beds, cleans, brings linens, or dumps the garbage during the week. This was one of the BEST features to me! We didn't have to think about what we left lying around or try to be out of the condo when the maid service comes through...we could truly be on our own time schedule. When I wanted new pillow cases or linens, I just traded them in for clean ones at one of the convenient towel exchanges. When the trash can was full, we took it out to the trash room on our way to an activity. There was a barbecue grill just outside our first-floor unit. I enjoyed the trees and lake and watched the squirrels and foliage while our burgers, dogs, and corn-on-the-cob, sizzled on the very clean campground-style grill. Building G has screened-in porches, which we thoroughly enjoyed for morning devotions and just relaxing, and the bedroom glass doors open into the porch, expanding the feeling of spaciousness (and a great place to dry our swim towels). We didn't use the bicycles, but did enjoy the pizza at the Bayside Market. Absolutely every staff person with whom we dealt was very friendly and helpful. If I have the opportunity to enjoy Branson again, I WILL make every effort to stay at Sill Waters. This was a 30th wedding anniversary trip for us, but this would be a great setting for a family reunion with my adult children and my parents. I'm looking at the 4-bedroom units or the lake house as possibilities for this. Branson holds myriad activities, but we would have had plenty to do if we had stayed at the resort the entire time!

We were only in the room long enough to sleep, but we did find the kitchen handy for storing and eating restaurant leftovers and making coffee. The bathroom was fairly spacious. The room was a decent size. No real place to put your suitcase, but we only had small ones due to the short stay so that really was not a problem. There was a small bureau with a place to hang clothes. We were expected to empty or own trash\u2014which there really wasn\u2019t any. Just walked it down the way. This time of the year, with most people there just to take in a show and see the Christmas lights, I\u2019m thinking not much trash is generated and how much more work is that for the maid who comes in to change the sheets? Very convenient to Silver Dollar City \u2013 so when you come home at night in the dark, this location is convenient.

We had to check out early because a family member was sick. In the hurry to leave we forgot a few pieces of clothes hanging the the closet. When I remembered later that afternoon, I called the resort to see if the clothes had been located. The person on the phone told me housekeeping was gone and I would have to call back in the morning (mind you, this was before 5pm, but okay). Later that night we were able to stop by the resort before we left town. I asked the front desk manager if my clothes had been located. He had no knowledge of anyone missing clothes and asked if I had made a report. I told him the gal on the phone had not said anything about making a report, but surely the manager on duty would have keys to Housekeeping and could go check. I was told no. Long story sort, I filled out a report and was told Housekeeping would call me in the morning. I finally called the resort the next day about noon since I had not heard anything. I was told by the manager the room had been re-rented and there were no clothes found in the closet by housekeeping or the new renters. (I have a long history working in the service industry and in hotels, so this is where I really get upset. ) I told the manager on the phone that I was well aware that the hotel did not have the liability for my clothes...I left them in the closet and that is my fault, but clearly someone had taken them. The manager told me they had no responsbility for them and then told me that the first girl I had spoken to the night before accused me of hanging up on her (why, I am not sure, but I never hung up on anyone, nor would there have been any reason to because at that point I was just making my first inquiry into the missing clothes. Besides that, I have been on the hotel's end of upset customers many times and I know that you get a LOT further when you are nice than if you act like an angry jerk, so it ever happened). The long and short of it is this. My clothes are gone, brand new clothes, at that. I was wrongly accused of hanging up on a hotel employee, no one ever once apologized for this happening (knowing full well that it was most likely a hotel employee who took the clothes when they cleaned the room), and I have no recourse...except to give them a poor review. I hope the person who took my clothes really needs them...truly. I also hope travelers take this review to heart and consider the kind of service they might expect from Still Water's Resort if they book. AND... to top it off. We checked out early and they told us they would try to re-book te room to save us the next night's rent. I knwo the room was re-booked from my conversations above.

We normally stay at Big Cedar Wilderness Club, however we were not able to get accommodations there this go around. Since I would expect some people have stayed at Big Cedar and are curious of the comparison I will try to give one. Note that our building did seem to be one of the newer buildings. Certain buildings looked more desirable than others, but nothing looks \u201crun down\u201d from the outside. Our room was very clean and nicely appointed. First, Still Waters is like a scaled back Big Cedar. Almost everything is smaller. The entire resort is smaller, rooms are a bit smaller (but nice), the decor is more basic condo fare, there are fewer activities, no shuttle bus (but one isn't necessary), etc. If you are expecting a stay like Big Cedar when booking Still Waters you may be disappointed. Where you have several restaurants to choose from at Big Cedar, you only have one little store at Still Waters. The water activities (paddle boats and such) are very similar however. Our room had a nice condo look. Counter tops were a thin granite. This kitchen was nicely equipped with a toaster, blender, microwave, stove, fridge (with ice maker), dishwasher, plates, glasses, cups, bowls, and a sufficient assortment of utensils. Kitchen was a bit small, but nicely designed. No complaints at all. We had a 2 bedroom setup. The bed in the master bedroom was king sized with nice bed coverings. It had a reasonable sized walk in closet. There was also a door to the balcony from the master bedroom as well as the main room. The bedroom had the normal furniture and a basic small TV. The adjoining bathroom was accessed through double doors. The bathroom was large sized with a jet tub under the window. I was situated so that you could leave the bathroom doors open and see out the window from the bed. Very nice! We had the same granite counter tops in the bathroom. There is one sink and then a sitting area at the counter. Overall this part was very nice. Once significant downside to the bathroom was the shower stall. It is very small. You have to be very careful to not bump the faucet handle. Forget taking a shower with your partner if that is something you are considering. In comparison to Big Cedar the master bed and bath are not as well appointed but still they are nice. The second bedroom had basic d\u00e9cor but was nice. The bed covers were very nice. This bed room had a small (19inch) TV. The bathroom was a stand bathroom with a tub/shower combo. Nothing too extravagant, but nice. In comparison to Big Cedar, the shower was not as nice and the d\u00e9cor was less extensive. Regarding some of comments that others have made. First the walls are indeed not very sound proof. We didn\u2019t have an issue the first night, but the second night was a bit louder. It was not a problem, but you could hear more that you would expect. Note that we were at the very end of the building so we may have benefitted from that location. Second, the beds are very, very firm. I would go so far as to recommend that you take a foam topper with you to tone it down a bit. If you like your beds very firm, you are probably going to love this one. I will say that neither my wife nor myself had any back or leg pain from sleeping in the firm bed. I think it is a high quality mattress, just really, really firm. The last item is the availability of elevators. Some of the building have them and some don\u2019t. Ours did not. Be aware of this. On the positive side the pools are nice. The view of the lake is probably better than Big Cedar and you are a closer to the lake. The location of the resort is better if you want to go to Silver Dollar City as it is just down the Indian Point road a bit further. The little market makes very good, hand tossed, pizzas. I would recommend having one. Breakfast, though limited, looked very good as well.

It had all the amenities we were looking for and more. The special they were running at the time made the price even better. The rooms were nice and the resort had so many things for all the kids to do. The restaurant was better than any of us expected, especially the pizza. The kids loved all the pools, especially the water slide. It was really nice to have the marina with so many things to offer. It was great to be able to rent the boat stall and have the dock right in front of our condo. The location on the lake and proximity to Branson was extremely convenient. Most of the staff was very friendly. Our family will be back again in the future and are looking forward to another great time with family and friends! This being said, there were a few minor maintenance issues and I have a couple of suggestions for the staff. We had a shower that wasn't draining, and this was resolved when we called. Our dryer was heating but not drying. A maintenace worker came to take a look at it, but didn't seem to know how to fix it. So when we used the dryer it would take like two hours to dry a load of towels or we had to dry one at a time for about 30 minutes each. The doors to our bathroom would not close and the shower made an awful squealing noise. These two issues we just chose to let go. The vertical blinds kept falling down. I also have one customer service suggestion to make. I made a reservation for my in-laws who needed a room with no stairs. I had not been to the resort so I had no idea of the layout of the buildings. I requested a bottom floor (thinking bottom floors have no stairs to climb). But because I must have failed to mention I was booking a room for people who couldn't climb stairs, they ended up getting a room where you had to go down stairs to get to the bottom. I had to pay extra for a bigger room because all the rooms were booked. This could have been my fault, but for customer service that is above average, when a guest wants a bottom floor room and has not been to the resort, you could clarify if they just want to have ground access or if they need no stairs. It just never occured to me that a bottom floor would require going down stairs. Thanks for a great place to spend one of our best vacations yet!

Located off of Indian Point Rd, on Table Rock Lake, it is just down the hill from Silver Dollar City. The main office was small and unimpressive. But the staff was friendly and helpful, overall (we only met one staff member in the office who was not quite so helpful or friendly). The amenities include a market/deli, large game room bldg. for the kids, three pools, coin operated laundry for guests, playground, basketball/volleyball, and the recreational amenities at the lake. We stayed in a studio room w/whirlpool. We should have opted for something larger, but the rates can be a little pricey. The kids (a younger and older teen) slept on a pull-out sofa bed, with a mattress that was only about three inches thick, and not very comfortable. The queen bed that my husband and I slept on was very comfortable! There are lots of pillows and blankets for use. The kitchenette was small, but equipped and included a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, stove and oven. The bathroom was very small (the whirlpool room was twice its size!). The decor was average, overall. There is no regular housekeeping, just a towel exchange, which made us have to be a little more conscientious about room upkeep. One of the pools was very generic; the second had a fun water slide pool and was perfect for younger children/families. The third pool is called the 'oasis pool' and is well defined by its name. It is a beautiful pool with a large waterfall, lots of lounge chairs/tables, and even lounge beds. There are hammocks up above the pool area. It was truly one of our favorite parts of the resort! Our other favorite area was the lake and amenities offered. There is free paddle-boating, kayaking, and tubing. There are boats and wave runners to rent, as well. The kids loved spending time at the lake and we spent two afternoons there. Safety is observed both at the lake and the pool areas. Floatation vest were required at the lake, and there were life guards constantly on duty at the pools. It's a bit of a drive to the main strip and to Branson Landing.

She made her \"little talk\" in a tone of voice that she had said those same lines over 1,000 times; which I'm sure she has but it was not satisfying to us. Because we had made reservations so far in advance, we recieved a $50 gift card to use at the facilty. VERY WEIRD process, we had to return the card or we would have been charged $20. (???) We stayed in the \"I\" building which was a 3 bedroom/3 bath condo. It was very nice. We knew we were staying on the lake and should have packed more from home. The kitchen has pots/pans, dishes etc. and they did provide dish soap and dishwasher detergent but other than that you will have to bring everything from home or go buy new if you plan on cooking (which we did to save some $$). We had to go buy coffee filters, salt/pepper, seasonings, oil, hand soap, etc. The appliances all worked fine. The beds were ok ... not the most comfortable. Each room had it's own T.v. which was nice. All 3 bathrooms were attached to each room, all with baths/showers in them. The towel exchange is from 8-2 so plan on exchanging them first thing in the morning so you don't have to worry about it later. You can also get trash bags and rolls of toilet paper there also (which we didn't know at check it). You can also exchange your sheets there (which we didn't know at check-in). Maybe our check-in lady missed a few lines!?!?!? Our condo had a small washer/dryer unit and so we bought detergent and did our laundry there. It was so nice not coming home with tons of laundry to do after vaction. There are so many trees around the area, therefore to have a lake view is really out of the question. We had a short walk to the lake and marina which was right behind our building. The marina has lots of free items available to use, which we used without a problem. We also rented a pontoon for the whole day, (kind-of expensive). The marina staff was very nice and helpful and the pontoon rental went perfect. By the way, the Pontoon was almost brand new so we really enjoyed it!! The pools at the facility were nice also, we only used 2. One was right across the street from our buil,ding so we used that one the most. The kids loved swimming; we swam in the pools more than the lake. The pool water was colder than the lake water though. Our building had an elevator that could almost sufficate you because there is no vent or air flow in it. But we used it reguardless, because we were not on the bottom level. The one thing that irritated me was that the parking lot was so tight and there were no trash can located around the parking lots. When we got out of the car and had trash in our hands, we had to take it all the way up to our room because there are no trash cans around. Each floor had a room for trash but not conveniently located next to the parking lot. We ordered pizza from the bayside market and had it delivered to our room. One 16\" pizza was about $19. It was good pizza. We didn't use the lake as much as we should have.

We've always loved the pools, docks, grounds, store and marina. The last couple years that we went we started to feel like the prices were getting too high. This last year we took our family and another family to split a 2 bedroom condo. At check in we were told that the room in the newer built building that I requested had a sewer problem and we had to be moved. We didn't mind that and we did get a small comp towards the downgrade in rooms. The room we got however smelled bad almost like mold. My wife had to buy some air fresheners to cover the smell. The beds were very worn and needed to be replaced. The other complaint I had was the lifeguards at the main swimming pool were sitting together texting on cell phones the whole week we were there. My kids are old enough that I wasn't concerned for my family but when you advertise that you have a lifeguard and they are sitting there not paying an ounce of attention, then I do have a problem. I did email Stillwaters about this when we got home but got no response addressing this. My family has decided to stay elsewhere on Table Rock Lake this summer and we have found other resorts that are half the price and have just as nice of accomodations. The only thing different is the pools aren't as nice as Stillwaters. I feel that the pools are not worth that much money difference. I did enjoy Stillwaters the years we stayed there but it just seems as though the trips were getting more and more expensive and the disappointments were starting to mount.

It sounded like they were stomping. Then after hardly any sleep at all the smoke/carbon monoxide alarm went off again and woke us up at 6 a.m. Then more stomping from the unit above. We were exhausted after 5 hours of travel to get to Still Waters the day before. So we called the front desk and asked them to please let us move to another condo. At first they told us that they were completely full so they could not move us. After 3 calls the manager told us that we could move to a different building. 2 families with tons of luggage that we had to pack up, drag down the stairs, load up and move back up two flights of stairs, (no elevators), after no sleep the night before was very unpleasant. The manager did not offer any help in moving our things. The new condo that we were moved to was a bit ran down. It had cracks in the kitchen tile and huge spider webs in the living room. It was quieter there but dirty. We then went to the store on the property to order a pizza. A woman that works there was so nice (the only nice person that we dealt with while staying there). So the next day we went back to order the exact same pizza. A boy and a girl from Russia took our order. They charged us twice as much as the day before. When we complained they were very rude. They were so rude that we asked for our money back and canceled the order. (they were speaking in another language and laughing at us). This place could be amazing if the staff cared more and if they kept the rooms cleaner. The walls are paper thin. You can hear every little thing from the rooms above and next door to you.

No housekeepng services, must exchange towels and retreive additional toilet paper - also no small bottles of shampoo to use in a pinch. On check in we were told the opening times of three pools on the property - only one was stil open - the rest were shut down for the season. When the couple in front of me checked in they were so excited to go to SDC - the front desk flatly replied - yes you and 14,000 other people. When I called to report a toilet that ran all night and the thin walls, I was greeted with the same sort of flat hospitality. CUSTOMER SERVICE not high on the list here. The property boasts many amenities - marina, paddle boats, etc. But when we went to to check these out - the marina was closed (it was 80 degrees outside) and a note tacked to the door that the paddle boats are self serve. I travel frequently and understand lake life and rustic ambience - but the price of this hotel was too high for the quality.

The bicycles weren't much to speak of but that wasn't an issue either since you could only ride them around the property. There is a small gift shop at the main check-in and also a small sandwich shop on premises. The sandwiches were huge and very affordable. Of course the price of everything was reduced since this was off season. We later found out a friend of ours who owns a timeshare attempted to trade into this resort and couldn't. He ended up staying at another RCI resort. Of course he tried booking in the spring. We booked on the internet only two weeks ahead of time.

I cannot express how disappointed I was once we checked into our room. The surface areas (kitchen and bathrooms) were clean, however the carpet, tile, bedding and furniture were very filthy and old. I would like to add that prior to booking our condo we were told that it had been renovated. We were given old raveled towels for the bathrooms and old dish cloths for wash cloths in the bathroom. I have never seen dishes, appliances, soap, towels, mattresses, bedding so CHEAP. If we wanted different towels we had to walk to a towel exchange in another building on the property. Our room did not have a dryer like promised or any other items that were to be supplied by the resort. Upon leaving we were to have all dishes cleaned and trash emptied (per check-in form) otherwise we would have incurred additional charges. The sliding back door to access the lake did not work.

As for the amenities, all units set close to the lake and options for boat slips was very nice. The cove is also very calm easily accessible. The pools and \"grocery/grill\" was a joke. They actually advertised on signs \"fresh gourmet pizza\".

The pools were the size of a backyard swimming pool except for the one in front of building J, which was still smaller than what was advertised on the website. Upon check-out, I let them know my feelings about our stay. They apologized and told me they have better units but they are not allowed to educate their guests about the differences because they are obligated to their owners to advertise all units as the same. This was the worst hotel experience I have had and not just because of the room, but because of the false advertising, lack of full disclosure, and complete disregard for customer care.

I was told that there was a minimum 3-night stay policy towards the end of the booking process which wasn't a problem for us, but for someone unaware this could have been a serious waste of time. That should definitely be upfront information for any potential guest and didn't feel as though they thought it so. Upon check-in things seemed rather rushed but this was overshadowed by the pleasant nature and attentiveness of an employee named Connie who was happy to give me a map of the area and divulge (quite useful, actually) information and directions to area attractions that I mentioned we might be interested in. The grounds were quite spacious and the atmosphere was very family/kid friendly as advertised. We towed our boat along and liked that the slip rental was very reasonable at $12/day as compared to Big Cedar's 20. We stayed in a \"Luxury Lakefront Condo w/whirlpool\". The condo's furnishings were a bit outdated and rather boring but is was clean and everyone in our 6-person family had ample space. Something I was very displeased with was the gnat problem. Perhaps this isn't the case with all the rooms, I don't know. I do know that there were gnats buzzing all around the kitchen area of the condo we stayed in when we got there and we still saw them when we left. All-in-all the place is pretty average. It's a good place for kids with the 3 pools and array of free amenities, is very accessible to Table Rock and Silver Dollar City, and is minutes from Branson. Being located right on the lake is what really makes the place what it is. Personally speaking, if you were to take the lake away I'm afraid it would loose all class and attractability.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cRoom not at all what we had anticipated.\u201d", "Author": "EmmaL34", "ReviewID": "UR35165696", "Content": "After reading all of the wonderful reviews about this resort, we couldn't wait to spend our vacation at Still Waters. However- when we got there we were somewhat disappointed. I guess we had expected something spectacular for the price we were paying. Like the last two reviews said- you could stay at a beachfront property for what you pay to stay here. We stayed a studio in one of the older buildings. The carpet was VERY worn, the comforters looked stained, the TV is small, and the bathroom set-up is awful. While they've redone the sinks with nice granite type counters, the sink is outside of the bathroom- right as you walk into your room. It has a very small countertop, so not much room to spread out your toiletries, etc. I found this to be a real pain, as most hotels you can get ready in the bathroom and spread out your things on the counter. We did enjoy the pools and the kids loved the slide. The Oasis area is nice and works well for small children. Older children tend to like the pool with the slide. The playground is nice and the docks were perfect for the kids to fish off of. The grounds down around the lake aren't maintained as well as up around the condominiums. Overall, it's a good location and the outdoor amenities are great for a family with kids. The main problem with this resort is the overpriced rooms. When you're paying close to $200 a night for a room, you expect it to be really nice. They may have reasonable rates off season, but during the peak of summer they are WAY too high for what you're getting.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ofallon, mo", "Title": "\u201c\"OVER-PRICED\"!!\u201d", "Author": "ofallonmom", "ReviewID": "UR34434184", "Content": "When booking a condo at this resort make sure you do not get in one of the older buildings!

Our fully stocked kitchen had a flat top stove with microwave, full refrigerator, dishwasher, can opener, coffee maker, washer/dryer, mixer, measuring spoons/cups dishtowels, etc. There were frying pans and sauce pans, and dishes and silverware. The coffee maker does NOT need a filter and they provide the soap for the dishwasher. We simply zipped over to walmart and picked up groceries for the week. There were two huge grills two steps from our front door so it was easy to do hotdogs, burgers, whatever. We had a ground floor unit so we quite literally could walk off our patio and down to the lake. There was a huge sandbox for the kids right out our backdoor. The wildlife comes right up to the door as well! But please don't feed the Canadian geese! They are not friendly to begin with! Leave them alone! A few things people have complained about seem a bit petty. Like the towel exchange. (instead of complaining, just wash the stupid things, you've got a washer). or taking out your own trash. (so what, you do it at home don't you? If you can't walk ten steps to the dumpster something is wrong!) you can hear people walking around above you? (how is that the resort's fault? that happens in EVERY HOTEL!!!) even the wii-fii worked great! the marina was also incredible. The guys that work there are so freaking friendly! You can take out a kayak or a pedal boat, and they have giant inner tubes. (all free!) I actually borrowed a bungee cord from one of the marina staff and hooked two kayaks together and towed my five year old daughter along with me! they also have all sizes of lifejackets available, from my four year old son to my husband. Speaking of my husband, he rented one of their jet skis for an hour and had a blast. The fishing was also wonderful. We picked up some worms from the marina guys and got bites right away! Even our two small children managed a few sunfish with no help! The pool was still cold for May but the kids pool was wonderful and the teenage life guards are actually paying strict attention to the kids in the pool.

Although it is a decent place, it was not without it's problems. Checkin -- When we arrived an check-in, there was about a 5 minute wait. Check-in went very smooth though the sheet I was shown at check-in showed I owed $460, whereas my confirmation letter which I left at home said $434. Keep in mind that I booked directly with the hotels website, not a third party site like Expedia. This started a running theme for this resort which is don't believe your confirmation. When I arrived at my room, in building L an older building, I called to the front desk to ask them about the Room location because I was supposed to be in I, J, or K one of the new buildings and also to inquire about the price difference. The person on the other end said it should be $445, so less than front desk told me, but more than confirmation said. When I inquired about the room difference they said they had no record of me reserving a new room and there was nothing they could do. Please keep in mind that when I arrived home I checked my confirmation and it says right on it I, J, or K. Room -- The rooms are dated and overall not very nice. They are clean, but they have the feel of a cheaply made condo. You could hear every step the people above us took, and many of their conversations. There was a small 25\" t.v. in the living room, which was very roomy. The kitchen had all of the necessary things you would expect and worked well for anyone needing to cook. The pillows were rediculously small and the beds were pretty hard. The master bathroom was very large and had a whirlpool tub and was nice. When used though, debris came out of the jets of the tub that looked like crumbled leaves?? There was a separate shower as well which performed nicely. The master bedroom was a decent size with a small t.v. The other bedroom was a nice size with 2 queens as well and had a mini fridge and small bathroom. The patio was a very nice size and very relazing. There was a Bee problem near ours though so if you have a problem with bee's you might be on the lookout. Overall the rooms were o.k., but needed a few touches like larger t.v.'s new beds and pillows and an overall updated look. The rooms also had an apartment size washer and dryer. Grounds -- The property has many things to do like paddle boats, 2 pools and a very large hot-tub, however I do take issue with them calling themselves a resort. In my mind a resort has several things that this property didn't have. First of all House Keeping. They do not clean your room when you are there. They wait until you leave. If you want new towels, you have to wash them in the washer/dryer or go get new ones. from some little building that they said was manned from 9-2. Also, I believe a resort needs to have 24 employees. I can't say for sure they didn't, but if they did they were harder to find then Waldo. A resort should have a resturaunt to eat at. They had a little building that sold snacks and salads, but no resturaunt that I saw. I know now I'm being nitpicky, however a \"resort\" should also have a bellman and room service. By their definition of resort, you could end up with a \"Motel 6 resort\" or a \"Super 8 resort\". It is a property with several condo buildings, a maring, 2 pools and a gift shop. That is it. Definitely not a resort. I know my review has an overall negative vibe to it, but with all it's flaws, it is not a bad place to stay. If you have children, I would definitely recommend it.

First the Good: 1) The pools are small, but themed and very cool. Waterslide was very nice and the kids loved it. Beach pool had a lifeguard. 2) Boat slips are included in the room price, which is a great advantage, and slips and ramp are OK. Now the Bad: 1) NOT A RESORT - virtually no onsite amenities. No ice, no housekeeping, no staff after business hours, no restaurant, no laundry, no gym...overbilled 2) RUDE, RUDE, RUDE - Staff is very rude, when you can find them. They publish lots of rules, but enforce none of them. Rude and lazy, although this did appear to be typical of all Branson facilities 3) NO SUCH THING AS NO SMOKING - If you don't like cigarette smoke STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE. We had a no smoking room in a no smoking building. On the first morning I went out to enjoy a morning cup of coffe on our balcony. The guy in the room underneath me came out and proceeded to smoke half a dozen cigarettes while trying to hack up a morning lung. This filled my entire balcony with second hand smoke. Tried to retreat to the pool where half a dozen more people were chain soking an flicking ashes in the water.When I tried to get help from a staffer ( I had to interrupt his smoke break) he informed me no smoking rules don't apply to patios, and they often don't have enough smoking rooms so they give smokers no smoking spots. 4) WATER IS NOT SAFE - My son spect the last 48 hours of the trip with vomiting and diarrheah after swimming in the lake. They can post all the signs they want, the lake IS NOT SAFE. 5) QUIET HOUR RULES ARE A JOKE - They post very strict rules about quiet hours from 10 PM to 9 AM. I tried to abide and keep our kids quiet the first morning which was a waste of time. Drunks had screaming parties past midhinght every night and nobody cared. On the third morning the lawn crew started mowing at just before 8 am right below our room. Funny that they mowed until they woke up the entire bulding then took a 30 minute smoke break from 9:30 - 10:00 in front of our building while watching all of us leave to get away with them. 6) TRASH TRASH TRASH, on our 3rd day the staff took about 20 trash dumpsters and lined them up right in front of our building. I assume this was to make it easier for a truck to collect trash, but they sat there in the sun for half a day stinking and drawing flies with no collection.

I was told that the water was safe, but it wasn't. My daughter and I ended up with rashes all over our bodies caused by microscopic snails that were in the water due to the flooding.

I would give it 5 stars but for 3 reasons. When I called to book, we were talked into a newer building for 40.00 more a night because it was an elevator building and we have several with our group that have a hard time with the stairs. When we checked in we were given a ground floor unit with a view of the trash room. The room was clean but the carpet was in horrible shape. It was stained and worn and since it was the beginning of high season, I would hate to see it come September. I wore my flip flops the entire time after stepping on the carpet barefoot and finding it sticky. Our group had 3 other rooms in the resort and the carpet was the same thru-out. Lastly, the pools are great. We were by pool B and we could pretty much have the place to ourselves. The slide pool is simple that, a slide with a small pool at the bottom. No where to just get wet or relax. Sign says exit pool immediately after sliding. The last pool was the new Oasis. It was beautiful but COLD, ICE CREAM HEADACHE COLD! The kids did not seem to mind and swam under the waterfall and loved the zero depth entry pool . The 20 person hot tub was very nice. The down side to this pool was the patrons with the giant squirt guns. I am talking grown men with bad aim and kids with worse aim. My husband and I were sitting watching our two play in the water when suddenly we were both hit in the back with a jet of water. We looked around and saw the 40+ year old with a giant squirt gun trying to hit the kids running on the bridge. His aim was horrible. The fourth time my husband was hit was enough. Before lunch the pool was enjoyable. After noon was more raucous maybe because some started drinking around 10:00am. At least the lifeguards stopped the guy walking around the shallow end with a glass beer bottle!!! The lifeguards did not stop the running and water gun play because he had one of his own and joined in! I would suggest that management post rules at the pool to ensure all guests have equal chance to enjoy it. The marina was nice, took the kids to fish for the first time and they are \"hooked\". Buy your bait somewhere else or pay 3.50 for 18 worms! The lake level was extremely HIGH, trees 20 feet out in the lake with water 3-4 feet up the trunk.

I did dry the towels several times in the clothes dryer. There was a dishwasher, but we never used it, I guess maybe that would have helped. Everything was clean, and very comfortable. The furniture is very nice, clean and new looking. We had a huge dining room table with 6 chairs, and then 3 bar stools at the counter.

The view of the lake was great. We stayed in Bldg. K on 4th floor room 449. The cleanliness of the room. The CONS: The most annoying was the fact that the resort does not provide room service. Everyday we had to walk several hundred yards with a pile of dirty towels to the laundry house to trade in for new ones. This is were you also request toilet paper, trash bags, dish soap, etc. The laundry house was only open from 9am to noon. At one time it closed early and opened at a later time, which was an iinconvience due to us renting a boat for the day. So, we had to drive to the front office for towels and toilet paper. Who wants to do all of this, plus vacuum, sweep and mop, make beds...on vacation. Next, it rained for two days causing the roof to leak, which totally soaked the front bedroom carpet. After a call was put into the front desk they didn't even come and shop vac it up or make an effort to comfort us. It was like it was no big deal. The pools were very cheesy!! The pool with the waterfall is awesome for very small children but not for older children! It's a zero entry with a small area getting to 5ft deep. The older kids were board with it. The pool with the slide was probably the most fun, but the pool was only big enough for the slide, basically.

We found it here on tripadvisor, it was the highest rated place to stay under $100.00 per night. (Only about $66.00/night when we stayed, for single bedroom suite with fold-down bed in living room, and a full kitchen). I really didn't expect this much for this price. Pros: Absolutely perfectly clean. Not a spec of dust or a stain or any blemishes of any kind anywhere. Spacious. Comfortable, high quality sleeping. Plenty of TV channels, and free wireless internet that worked in every room of our condo. Not located right in a high-traffic area, but close enough, which was a plus for our family, not wanting to be in the crowds constantly. No meddlesome staff. (I didn't see a staff member, or virtually anyone else, the whole time I was there.) Parking was very adequate. View was lovely. Gas fireplace in addition to quality central hvac. Nice on-site breakfast shop. Unbelievablely low price for such a place. Full-size coffeemaker in the kitchen (bring your own coffee), dishwasher, full stove, microwave, washer/dryer, iron, ironing board, mop, plunger, broom, dustpan. Cons: These cons are so overwhelmed by the pros, I shouldn't even mention them, but I want to let you know, because if you go prepared, there won't be any cons for you at all. It was 28\u00b0 outside when we went, and there wasn't an independant bathroom heater, although the central unit worked wonderfully. There wasn't quite enough towels provided for us, but my family does use a tremendous amount of towels. I'm sure if I had asked, they would have sent more, but there was a washer & dryer right there in our room, so it really wasn't a problem at all. If I had brought a little 120 volt ceramic heater, and a few towels and bathcloths, then I literally wouldn't be able to find anything at all to complain about. And I'm a pretty good complainer.

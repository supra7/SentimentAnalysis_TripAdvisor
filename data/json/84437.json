{"Reviews": [{"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cConventional Overnight Hotel that You Might Find Along A Freeway\u201d", "Author": "Zoom_Gotti", "ReviewID": "UR122600580", "Content": "Two storey motel between the 101 and 118 on Desoto in the SF Valley. Note that at busy hours it can take some time to access either freeway. This motel is located a few minutes drive to two large shopping centers, but this particular street corner offers no real amenities. However, I had a large room with both a microwave and small fridge. I found several supermarkets nearby where I could buy groceries so I wouldn't have to drive miles trying to find an adequate restaurant. My room was sufficiently cleaned each day and had a large flat screen TV. I asked about a complimentary newspaper in the morning and the desk clerk told me that they stopped getting them because nobody bothered to read them. In my room, the message light on my phone wouldn't go off, until a higher ranking reservations clerk came in the next day to fix it. I also couldn't figure out how to re-set the room clock, so I used the one on the microwave. There's a bus stop on the corner from where you can actually get to Hollywood or downtown LA (or anywhere you can transfer to), but it will take quite some time. But if your reason for being here is to stay up here in the valley, then this would be a reasonably inexpensive lodging to use for a few days. Just don't expect too much in the way of extra comfort. And you might want to bypass this place if you're driving a trailer because there's really not suffcient space for parking large vehicles. However, I found the staff to be personable and helpful if you are cordial to them. They returned my driver's license to me the next morning after I inadvertently left it at the front desk the evening of my check-in.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cbig disappoint. be aware - 24 hrs notice is a money trap\u201d", "Author": "Steve N", "ReviewID": "UR121937081", "Content": "I reserved the room for two nights with specific requests to be away from noises like elevator and ice maker because I am light sleeper. at the time of check-in, I requested to stay away from the main street and asked for the room further inside because I am light sleeper. the manager of the hotel told me that he was aware of my advance requirements which I stated during online booking but he told me the only room #201 left which is next to the street. I told him I cannot take it since I requested for no noise room. he told me the room has no window facing the street; therefore, it has no noise. it won't bother me so give it a try. I cannot cancel because the policy requires 24 hrs notice else I lose 1 night but this hotel knowingly sold me something I did not want. Needless to say, I can't sleep the whole night because cars and trucks drove by all night long so I packed up and left next morning. I asked for my refund because I was deceived and lied to but the clerk would not return my money and not refund the second night either despite the fact that I did not stay the second night. the clerk then offered me another room in the back but I declined due to annoying deceptive practices. the clerk kept on insisting 24 hrs notice requirement but unable to provide me the answer of why he provided me a reservation when he knew his hotel has no intention to meet my requirement. I also told the clerk that i would never stay at Ramada had I know I would be in a room that is next to the street. the internet in the room didn't work either. I called the front desk 3 times and was told I am on my own so call up the 800 numbers for support. the bed spread smell strong odor of chemical which I was allergic too. the morning clerk also told me that he needs a 24 hrs notice to cancel the second night. I told him I was deceived into a product I did not want to buy and my reservation should never took place since his facility was not able to meet my requirements for the room. I feel that the system was setup to entrap customers and took customers money without properly services.

When we arrived at the hotel we were slightly early as we gained a hour due to entering a different time zone. We entered the lobby of the hotel and were greeted (if that's what you call it) by the front desk person (who appears to live on the premises). He said we were too early, and to come back in 1.5 hours (yet there were 2 vehicles parked in the parking lot, and what appeared to be many vacant hotel rooms). Read on - it gets way better! We drove to a nearby mall to waste some time, and returned to the hotel to check in. I inquired about a room upgrade, and was told that because we booked on Orbitz, a room upgrade would be very costly. It was quite clear that since we didn't book the room through the hotel, they wanted nothing to do with us. We gave a credit card for the \"incidentals\" and were handed the room key, but were not directed to where the room was - we were not even informed about where and when breakfast was served. Upon entering the room, we were greeted with a King Size bed with 3 heavily worn pillows, linens that smelt old, a LCD television manufactured by Astar (never heard of them), and a bathroom which was quite evident of severe water damage. The bathroom had grout between the tile that appeared to be tinted green by the water (like the green on a leaky copper water pipe), mold in the grout in the shower, was missing floor molding (no pun intended), and the wallpaper was peeling in multiple locations. Sure there was granite countertops, but it was evident they skimped on the \"remodel\" and just tried to get the best bang for their buck! Departing from the bathroom, the main hotel room wasn't much better. There was still the peeling wall paper, but there were also holes in the ceiling which had been patched very poorly. These holes were the size of a softball, and looked like a 3 year old tried to patch them with silly putty. Next to one of the holes, there was what appeared to be blood spatter, or some sort of red spots (which were consequently above the smelly bed). There were holes that had been poorly patched in the walls, which then had wallpaper slapped over them in an attempt to hide them. We attempted to operate the television with the remote, but the channel buttons didn't actually control the channels! We placed a call to the front desk, and were told to use the white buttons on the remote (and were given attitude which seemed like we were bothering them). Moving on to breakfast, or lack thereof. I knew there was a continental breakfast, and most hotels I stay at offer a few choices, of bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, etc. The breakfast area in this hotel consisted of 3 tables (all with granite counters) but smelt of urine. The room was about 10'x12' and had your choice of 2 cereals, white or wheat bread, a very limited selection of individually wrapped danish, orange juice, and coffee. They didn't keep the danash stocked, so I was limited to toast with grape jelly or cereal. The hotel is too far from Hollywood to be picked up by a tour bus and parking near the Walk of Fame was terrible. Universal Studios was a 20 minute trip away, and there was no wait on Thanksgiving Day for any of the rides. All in all, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, and should I return to LA, I will stick with the hotels I regularly use for work which do not include the Ramada Chain.

We were spending the days doing tourist activities so we wanted an economical room within a reasonable driving distance to LA. We had been staying in Los Angeles, in a Starwood hotel and expected this place to be a step down. We were wrong. The parking lot, lobby, all public areas are well cared for. The room was large and comfortable and very, very clean. Nicely decorated, furniture looked new, no stains on the carpet, a small microwave, fridge and a large flat screen LCD TV. Staff was courteous. Management was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants. We cannot comment on the continental breakfast as we try to stay away from carbs so we did not bother to drop in. A sign at the front desk and on the internet site listed that there would be a charge for the safe and the internet but it was included in our rate. The hotel is not located in a tourist area. The area is more industrial and a bit run down and is not that appealing for walking around but within ten minutes there is a huge new mall. One needs a car. But the freeways are nearby. This was a good experience and we would return.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Battle Ground, WA", "Title": "\u201cHidden charges, charge for internet even though advertised as free\u201d", "Author": "jettaman71", "ReviewID": "UR7752357", "Content": "Overall we were happy with our stay except for a view problems. The first problem was out 3rd night when someone's car alarm kept going off. It must of went off 4 times after 10pm and lasted 1 minutes each time. I called and complained to the front desk and after about 2 hours they dicovered that someone from the nearby Motel 6 had parked their car in the Ramada lot because they thought that it would be safer. My other complaint is the fact that there are hidden charges on the bill. My wife and I left without reviewing the bill. Once we were able to look at it I discovered that they charges us $1.75 a day for the in room safe and $2.50 for telecom charges. They charge you this every day that you stay. We had booked through Ramada.com and we're told about these hidden charges. I called the Hotel and got no where with them and then called Ramada's 1-800 number. They filed a case number and said that the hotel's owner would get a fax and call me about the complaint. I think that they should be up front about these charges. The web site advertises free wireless internet in the rooms and I was under the impression that if you don't use the phone that they don't charge you for it. Hiding all of these charges is how they can show a lower rate per night.", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc", "Title": "\u201cAvoid at all costs!!!\u201d", "Author": "longwayaround", "ReviewID": "UR5981922", "Content": "Garbage stacked up and blowing around in parking lot.

The lobby wreaks of curry, like an Indian home, which was a little jarring, until you meet the staff. They were pleasant enough. The breakfast area is right off the lobby so you can pick up your USA Today and get your food. They have a sign saying you can't take the food out of the room, but that was never a problem for me. The room was spacious enough and even had a comfy couch and a coffee table. There is a safe, a refrigerator, a microwave, and a coffee maker, which was a surprise considering they serve coffee in the breakfast area. The parking and the wireless internet are free, both points being the reason I picked this place. The hotel is a little strange in that they were apparently renovating at the time, so some of the rooms were eerily empty. The room seemed clean.

The year before, we phoned and were given a good, clean, obviously renovated room, and had an enjoyable stay. This year, however, we booked the room online, and when we got there we discovered that they reserve only a few small rooms for online bookings. These rooms tend to be in the corner of the building and therefore dimmer than others. When we requested another room, the front desk did so reluctantly and told us we would be charged more. The room they moved us to did not have a functioning safety deposit box, and the front desk manager said he could not do anything about this. The most common response the front desk had for any of our requests was that he could not do anything about it.

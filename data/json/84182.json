The staff at the desk was competent and helpful. No concierge though, but the desk staff can help. The lobby is just a step above a budget motel lobby. If you want luxury, go elsewhere. The hotel location is on the edge of sketchy. It's located about 1.5 miles east from the LAX terminal one, straight down Century Blvd. If you continue 1/2 mile further east you get into some less desirable spots for tourists (Inglewood). I walked several times 3/10 of a mile east of La Quinta to eat at Panda Express, Pollo Loco and to buy snacks at 7-Eleven. I had no problems, but the area under the overpass for the 405 freeway, that you have to walk through, is dark, dingy, and filthy. There is also a 24 hr. Subway across the street from the hotel and a Taco Bell a short walk to the west. The hotel has a reasonably priced menu in its restaurant, but I didn't eat there. I had a room with a King bed. The bed leaned to the hard side, but I slept comfortably on it. The bedspread was slightly worn with a hole in it, but the sheets were clean. The bathroom was tiny. The bathroom's open door was only about 6 inches from the toilet. Otherwise it was clean and the massage type shower head over the tub was good. Larger soap bars and conditioning shampoo were good. Towels were not thick and luxurious. They were not worn out but were thin and rough. A hairdryer is provided as well as a coffee maker. There was a nice (40\" ?) LCD Samsung TV that had three ShowTime movie channels plus various other cable TV selections. I had a microwave and a small fridge in the room. Room temp was easy to control with the wall mounted digital thermostat. Sometimes they were late (after 4pm) getting fresh towels into the bathroom. the room was cleaned but they would bring the towels later. Sounds from the hall seemed to pass through the door as if there was no door there. I started wearing ear plugs to be able to sleep well. Many guests were very inconsiderate or at least unaware of how the noise they were making penetrated into the rooms even very late into the night. The guests are a little less refined than you see at the Hilton or Radisson I stayed at recently. Pets are apparently allowed in the rooms. There was no evidence that a pet had ever been in my room, but I saw many dogs with their owners in the hotel. One very large Mastiff and its owner accompanied me in the elevator one day. Three elevators in the 10 floor hotel that are sometimes very quick to move to your floor to pick you up and sometimes very slow. Push both buttons to get one to you sooner. A small corner couch, a footstool ottoman and a desk to work at which is part of the 6 drawer dresser in the room. The room was well lit with three lamps. There is a small pool on the 4th floor and an extremely small fitness room on the 2nd floor with two treadmills, a stationary bike and an elliptical I think. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. No hot tub in the hotel. There was free breakfast 6am to 9am which included mini muffins, coffee, scrambled eggs, pre-made waffles, orange, apple juice, water, white bread only to make toast, warm oatmeal (not instant) with raisins, brown sugar, and granola to add if desired, yogurt, bananas, apples and oranges and 3 types of dry cereal and 2% milk.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Place to Stay Near LAX for an Early Morning Flight\u201d", "Author": "kjd1978", "ReviewID": "UR126565062", "Content": "I stayed here before an early morning flight back to the East Coast. I picked it based on the Trip Advisor reviews, the AAA 3 star rating, the price and the availability of parking. The parking garage is tight, of course, it is city parking. After we arrived we had to wait to check in due to an overly needy patron. This man thought the reception desk was a full scale concierge service. We got in line behind him while he was asking about local things to do........went to the rest room........came back......got in line behind somebody else in line behind him. And waited. But absolutely not because of the person at the check in desk.....this guy just wouldn't give up and apparently had no concern at all for the couple in back of him with a very young child. When we got to our checkin I was extremely impressed and happy with the speed with which we were checked in. A plus....the clerk noticed that we had gone to the restroom and immediately cut our parking fees by 50% as a result. Nice touch. I liked the fact that he noticed that we had asked the security guard where the restroom was. Details do count and I wish I had gotten his name. He also told us to take our time with our luggage from the temporary 20 minute parking and offered up security to help. There was a security person at the front desk at all times and we didn't take them up on the offer as we felt fairly secure going to our vehicle and back. We were very happy with the cleanliness of the room. We didn't experience any elevator delays and didn't try the stairs so I can't comment on that. I also cannot comment on the breakfast because I was checked out before that, but the coffee and fruit was most appreciated.

The staff were courteous, especially the morning crew. Breakfast, included, was better than I expected, with a selection of hot & cold cereals, eggs, toast, yogurt, fresh fruit. The elevators were slow, and all the stairways were blocked off for emergency use only. Inconvenient if you're only on the second floor, and would rather use the stairs.

Instead of staying at the Westin, we stayed across the road at La Quinta. It is adjacent to Holiday Inn and essentially shares the yard with it. Check-in took seconds; the clerk named Frankie was very friendly and professional at the same time. We asked for a quiet room and Frankie gave us one facing away from the road, on a higher floor. Fantastic choice! We could the the scenic mountains in the morning. The room was fairly basic, but clean and bright. Finally, this hotel figured out room lighting so you can actually see at night ! In-room fridge and microwave, coffeemaker with a stainless steel pot, iron and ironing board, free WiFi that reaches across the road and an LCD TV - all great things to have when you are away. I would call the decor Spanish colonial, with a lot of orange, warm yellow and white, with blue accents, as you would often see in tropical places. The furniture was clean and sturdy, no complaints at all. The bed was soft and comfortable; the headboard was like a large addition to the wall above, which was nice. The only surprise was feather-filled pillows, but they also had synthetic pillows. I guess every taste could be satisfied. We noticed a security representative in the lobby at all times, it was reassuring. Breakfast was nothing to write home about: scrambled eggs, toast, Belgian waffles (you don't get to make your own), muffins, yogurt, fruits and a few other little goodies. We did not encounter any meat items for breakfast over two days. Breakfast is served starting at 6 am. One more odd thing: Orange Juice had an unnatural taste to it. I gather it was reconstituted from powder. Very disappointing for a hotel in California! The first night, we grabbed a bite at the hotel restaurant. Two bowls of veggie soup and a bowl of sliced fruit came up to $19 after taxes. Call me strange, but I think it's a lot, so we never went back for lunch or dinner. Speaking of eating out, there aren't a lot of places to eat nearby. There is a Subway and an Internet cafe/restaurant across the road (both get very busy during lunch when there is a convention at Westin); Taco Bell and Macdonald's. People say, there is a Chinese restaurant on the other side of the highway, but we haven't walked there. There are about 20 car rental places in the three buildings surrounding La Quinta, and there is one downstairs in this building, but we did not rent a car this time. Check-out was a breeze, too. They have a designated computer for those wishing to check-in to their flights and to print out boarding passes. We asked to leave our luggage until later in the day, and got the luggage stored for free in a storage room.

Since this was a week night and we knew they were not fully booked, we asked for an upgrade to a nicer room, which they cheerfully gave. Mind you, it was my wife and I, plus our 4 year-old son. We originally had a King bed....After we got to our upgraded room, we found that we had a room with a full bed and a sleeper-sofa. At this point we were so tired that we did not get a different room, but it was definitely an over-site to put a family of 3 into that upgraded room with such a small bed. A/C was not working properly, room was kinda run down.....In the morning, it was a nightmare to find an elevator down to the lobby. These things are so tiny and always seemed to be full.

Additionally, it was gross waiting for the shuttle van for 2 main reasons. 1st, this hotel is in a really old and run-down part of town. Not the safest or best neighborhood at all. 2nd, the shuttle stop is located EXACTLY at the same spot as the smoking area. Trust me when I say that a VERY large number of Europeans use this facility, and ALL of them seem to puff away non-stop, which is kinda gross. We had to retreat at one point inside the lobby because it got so bad. Unfortunately, it got worse at that point. The other main lobby door that leads to the parking structure was blocked open, and another group of smokers was out there, so a stiff breeze was blowing in that door and it was filled with cigaret smoke. It was just too much for us...Would not stay here again just for that fact. Only 2 exit doors from property and so there is no choice but to walk through a thick cloud of smoke to get somewhere... We did the Stay&Park deal, and when we came back several days later to get our car we had to interact with front desk staff again, and once again they were as nice and professional as can be. I really enjoyed how good they were towards their guests...For guest service I would give this property 5 stars, but with being an old and run-down property, plus the smoking issues, my overall rating is 3 stars..Oh, shuttle van drivers were great.

Overall, same good impressions as my first time there (see my earlier review), no sunrise in the window though :) Breakfast was better than in January 2010 as no strange taste of the omelet. Standard La Quinta menu: omelet, supermarket bagels and muffins, cream-cheese, orange juice and coffee. Fries on Sundays. Pretty poor selection and average quality but enough to get your engine going until lunch. In addition, what other breakfast would you expect from 72 dollars a night for 3 people in Los Angeles in order for the hotel to break-even? Remember, free street parking just off La Cienega Blvd is a 5 min walk away! Very few other hotels near LAX could claim the same precious (like 12 bucks a night) benefit :) As I arrived LAX late night, taking a free bus to the hotel was a much better option than going immediately to the car rentals with a family and the luggage. In the morning I went back to the terminals and took a free car-rentals bus to Avis (or Hertz last time) there. Not unique convenience compared with other LAX hotels, obviously. As someone below mentioned the elevators recently, it looks like their work has not improved much since October 2010: I had to use stairs a couple of times back then, especially in the mornings.

The front staff were exceptionally nice and helpful, in person and on the phone. After reading reviews which commented on the traffic noise, I requested a room away from the road. The room which we received was in the back of the hotel and very, very quiet, perfect for a light sleeper like my boyfriend! It was also clean and had a nice decor. The bed was very comfortable and we slept soundly every night. The free shuttle service to LAX was convenient and the drivers courteous. The front staff also gave us great advice about where to go in Manhattan Beach and made it easy for us to purchase tickets for the Trolley to get there, which conveniently stops right outside the hotel. We did not rent a car, so we did not have to worry about parking. The maid service was unobtrusive and efficient. The only cons were the slow elevator, which isn't really a big deal, and having no meat at breakfast. There was a great variety of muffins, yogurt, cereal etc., but I prefer a heavy breakfast while I'm on vacation, so we just skipped the breakfast at the hotel and went to the Denny's down the street. Even though it doesn't seem to be in a great area, we still felt safe walking down Century Blvd., even very late at night.

All the hotels that the conference recommended in downtown LA were $200+. I decided to give this La Quinta a try to save some cash (free breakfast to boot). I was pleasantly surprised at the service and cleanliness of this hotel. It's a great location to the airport and the freeway. There's free WIFI in-room, the beds are very comfortable and considering it's proximity to the airport, it's very quiet. The adjacent parking garage is safe a convenient ($12 per day). The breakfast is always fresh and there is a decent variety of pastries, waffles or pancakes, juice, fruit, donuts, etc. The rooms also have a fridge and some have microwaves. I stayed for a week on that first visit in October of 2009. I returned in February of 2010 for 3 days, and again in October of 2010 for another week. It has been consistent. I should also note that I usually arrive later in the evening on my trips to LA (around 10pm or later) and the hotel restaurant closes at 10. However, there is a Denny's just about a block away that's very convenient and open 24 hours. Now for the cons....A minor thing - but something to mention: Elevators... They are VERY slow! The elevator in the parking garage on the first visit was almost useless. However, on the last visit it seemed to run a bit faster. The lobby elevators took so long on this last visit in Oct. 2010, that I rarely used them for the week I was there. Fortunately, I had a room on the second floor so I used the stairs most of the time. All in all - a great value for the money. Clean and comfortable. I'll be staying again in 2 weeks (Feb. 2011) and have made reservations for the Oct. 2011 conference I attend downtown.

There were three or four fast food places right next door which were useful for a hungry traveller who just wanted to grab a bite and get to bed. The room was very clean and well equipped with more furniture and better quality fittings than I was expecting. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable and I got a great nights sleep - so good I slept in and missed the free breakfast they provide so unfortunately I can't comment on that.

The hotel is well equipped - there is a restaurant/bar area, internet in reception and an outdoor pool with towels provided; which was to cold for us to use during our stay and it looked a little dirty to be honest anyway!

During the night of our first stay my husband started to get chest pains and was struggling to breathe so I rang down to reception in a panic to ask for advice on getting a doctor, but no-one answered so I rang 911, who whilst I was on the line rang reception to let them know which room we were in and that the emergency services would be coming over, so I expected someone from the hotel to come and check we were ok, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, nor did they after they had left, or the next morning when we checked out. I was really disappointed that the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about its guests and their wellbeing only about making money off them. 2. Hours after eating the eggs at breakfast I was very ill (can only really link getting ill to the eggs??)- vomiting etc, and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold anything down for a day or 2 and I was very weak. We went to Palm Springs for one night after LA and spent the whole night / day in bed and never got to explore and was very upset about this.

I travel through LAX once a year from Australia, and I usually stay at the Super 8 LAX, which is also excellent value, but wanted a change of pace. So for avout $10 more, I thought I'd try out La Quinta. Check-in was very quick, and even though I arrived a little early before the check-in time, they were very understanding about my long overseas flight and got me into a room right away. This meant a lot to me, as I was dead on my feet. The room was absolutely spotless - being a former housekeeper, I am a harsh judge. But this place passed with flying colours. The decor was modern and very appealing - the sheets on the bed were new and crisp, and felt like 100% cotton. The bed was very comfortable, and the heater was easy to figure out, and the room was toasty in no time. The bathroom was totally modern, and again, super clean, with nice fluffy towels, hair dryer, etc. Hot water was no problem, and the water pressure in the shower was great. The room was also more spacious than I thought it would be. The view was rather average, but that was not a huge factor for me - the quiet of the room was more important, and it was nice and quiet during the day and during the night. The area is also pretty average, but then again, we're talking the LAX airport neighborhood - not a lot going on except for hotels and gas stations, it's not where the \"action\" is! The staff was great - very nice, and very professional. The free breakfast was pretty basic, but just fine for a light appetite - juice, bagels, muffins, that sort of thing. The dining area also had a nice decor. I had brought my laptop, and the WiFi service worked easily, no problems hooking up to the internet at all. The only criticism I have is the airport shuttle - be forewarned that unlike the Super 8 shuttle, it stops off at three other hotels, so I found it to be not as quick. I was worried that I would miss my flight, as I misjudged the time it would take the shuttle to get to the airport (hadn't expected all the stops!). And I did end up missing my flight, actually!!! So plan ahead, and take an earlier shuttle than you think you'll need. Not a big deal, just be aware of the time, and take a little more than you think you need.

Parking was $12 per day, added to $86/night made it quite reasonable. La Quinta has a boutiquish feel to it, with small rooms and nice (fancy) light fixtures, shower curtains, etc. Breakfast was adequate: scrambled eggs (quite good), pancakes with syrup, yogurt (strawberry?), cereal with milk, orange juice, iced tea (or maybe it was regular tea?), bagel w/cream cheese, bread with butter or jam, mini muffins like blueberry (teeny tiny muffins approx 2\" wide), there was a toaster machine to do all the toasting which lots of people wound up getting in line for, and fruit like small apples. Breakfast served from 6a to 9a. Do get there in time because this area gets crowded in the morning. Front desk is nice, the security guy is nice person too. I didn't know about the hotel shuttle service because I rented a car. There is a pool on the 4th floor that is kind of hard to find. It's all the way down on the end of the hall and you have to look for it and take some stairs down to an outdoor area. From what I could tell the pool was heated, but it wasn't 80 degrees or anything, maybe 68? It wasn't freezing cold. I enjoyed using the workout facility on the 2nd floor. Didn't use the treadmills, but did do my jump rope routine happily in front of the mirrors. The workout room is small, only 3 or 4 treadmills/bicycle machine type things (I didn't even bother to look because I don't use those things). There is a tv with remote inside with a water dispenser. The water dispenser was useful because I only needed to buy 1 bottle of water and refill it each day (learned this trick in Thailand). There was an ice machine on my floor (8th). I like the 12pm check out time, anything earlier is usually too early for me. Staff is all hispanic. There is a funny gift shop across the way, selling Mickey Mouse items, candy bars, and other misc stuffs. I don't like the way they do parking. You drive into the parking garage, grab a ticket, and then you have to take that ticket to the front desk so they can put it through the machine so you can leave the facility without paying twice. If someone is already at the desk, or there is a long line, you may wind up waiting a while just to get your parking ticket validated (potentially inconvenient). There is a McDonald's in the area and Subway. I didn't see any other fast food nearby. There is also AM/PM store next to the McDonald's that had the Listerine I needed to buy. This location is very close to \"rental car row\" which has all the rental cars people rent from the airport (Hertz, Budget, Avis, etc.). Would definitely consider staying here again when I come back into town in a few days. Oh, you are very close to the airport. I'm surprised airplane noise was not a bigger issue because those planes pretty much fly right over you. I could hear the airplanes flying overhead, but it was not really a big deal at all. Maybe if I were on the 10th floor it would be a big deal, but I was on the 8th. It was very quiet, sound proofing is very good, although if rude people were talking in the hallways I could hear it. The bed was great, not too soft, not too hard. 6 pillows total. Sheets were thin, I didn't like that part. The heater was quite loud, wound up turning it off completely. Temp control wasn't a big issue, Los Angeles in December, is not really hot or cold. My desk wasn't equipped with a free pen, not sure why. I had the King bed so it came with microwave and fridge. The fridge was useful to keep my fruits and water cold. Coffee maker located in the bathroom with coffee packets ready to use. This hotel is located approx 3 miles from decent shopping area. Just head straight west on Century (towards McDonald's) for about 3 miles and you'll run into Target, Ross, Marshalls, and a bevy of restaurants and stores. Free internet only worked for me in the lobby. I couldn't get it to work on the 8th floor. There are $5.99 lunch specials. Dinner is a little more pricey but they give you 20% off your restaurant meal when you check in. The food at the restaurant is surprisingly good, do not hesitate to eat there. I ate there for breafast lunch and dinner, and I'll be honest, I am not the kind of person that enjoys eating inside the hotel because 1) generally hotel food is not very good and 2) I like to broaden my horizons and see what's out there.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei", "Title": "\u201cSolid Value, Clean Rooms\u201d", "Author": "tulipjones", "ReviewID": "UR50664019", "Content": "Stayed here during a layover.

The bed was fine -- nothing special but I slept well. There was a standard color TV that appeared to have in-room movie and video game options as well as an array of TV stations and HBO.

The bathroom was small but clean and perfectly adequate, except that toiletries have to be requested at the front desk.

If I were consumer reports, I'd rate this a \"best buy\" My family and I stayed one night in December and another in January on layover to and from Mexico. The location was very convenient. It's close to the airport (located next door to the Holiday Inn Express) and we found the free airport shuttle service easy and reliable. The hotel is on the main strip of airport hotels (Century Blvd) which is a 6 or 8 lane main drag which can be congested at some times of the day. We had no problem at all in the evening, early morning or over the weekend getting to and from the airport in about 10 minutes. Also, regarding the location, there were some late night fast food options available within walking distance which included Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds. There was a subway across the street, but it was a very challenging and big street to cross, so I did not consider it. The hotel also offered some room service options. I walked to Taco Bell one night (little less than a block away) at about 11 p.m. The streets were pretty deserted and I noticed the hotel security watched me leave and waited and watched for my safe return. I found this comforting and thanked him. The hotel is not luxurious, but was EXTREMELY nice for the $72 rate we paid. (I booked on the LaQuinta website - checking often for price reductions as the rates did go down a couple of times and it was easy to cancel and rebook at the lower rate) In fact, the hotel would have been acceptable at $125 - $150. The rooms were recently remodeled, very modern with all standard amenities and very clean. The bathrooms were huge. We found the double rooms very accommodating for our family of four. I have attached photos for your review. Some of the extra values that I found impressive were the FREE wireless internet, FREE breakfast, Free airport shuttle (mentioned above), secure luggage check room and the Manhattan Beach trolley ($3 RT-tickets sold at hotel lobby desk) which stopped right in front of the hotel. I was able to access the hotel wi-fi easily with both my laptop and my iPhone. It also proved to be a fast connection. The breakfast was far more than continental. It offered fresh made waffles, yogurt with optional granola topping, 3 cold cereal choices, oatmeal, bagels with assorted optional toppings, muffins, apple and orange juice, coffee and tea. That's what I recall off the top of my head, but it seems there were even more selections. The Manhattan Beach trolley presented an awesome opportunity to kill a few hours during our layover. It makes several stops including the beach (where there is also an aquarium), stolling/shopping areas with boutique type stores and small cafes/restaurant and a stop at a beautiful large mall (where you will find an Apple Store, Bath & Body Works, Victoria Secrets and many other upscale mall stores of this type). The secure luggage check area is a room secured by a security guard (no one else has access) and we were able to check out early, spend the day at Manhattan Beach, retrieve our luggage by 4 p.m., take the airport shuttle and catch our 5:30 p.m. flight. Best of all, I found the staff at this hotel to be very friendly and willing to assist. From the desk clerks to the breakfast team, everyone was extremely nice and helpful. One last thing I forgot to mention is that the hotel has a pool. It is located above street level on the 3rd or 4th floor (I think). It was a nice size and looked inviting. I believe it is a heated pool, but check with the hotel as we did not use it during our stay. I would recommend the La Quinta LAX to anyone looking for a quick and easy airport hotel during a layover. I'd also say that it would be a suitable and affordable option for longer stays that needed to be in this particular area of town.", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Temple Hills, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jedivader", "ReviewID": "UR26104023", "Content": "Hotel is in a good location (near rental cars, LAX and freeways).

We arranged for Prime Time Shuttle to pick us up at the hotel and take us directly to the pier, so all our transporation requirements were met. In addition, we purchased tickets at the front desk for the Ocean Express shuttle to Manhattan Beach for $3.00 per person. The shuttle picks you up right outside the front door. We took a VIP Tour (#9) of Hollywood and Universal Studios. The bus took us to all the famous sites - the Hollywood sign, Rodeo Drive, Melrose, The Chinese Theater, The Walk of Fame, and Venice Beach, then dropped us off at Universal. They came back at closing time and took us back to the hotel. I would book in advance directly through VIP, though, as the prices seemed less expensive than what the hotel charged. We walked down the street to Denny's one morning for breakfast and ate at LaQuinta's buffet the next day. The buffet was good with basics like toast, waffles, (cold) hard-boiled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, coffee, tea, etc. No hot eggs or breakfast meats. I had read many reviews before booking so we requested a room on the back side of the building.

For the price we paid through Priceline, I don't feel like my friend and I received a bad deal at all. The room was ready for us when we checked in around 3 or 4pm and everything in the room was clean. The room was a bit small and not particularly well-stocked but again, based on the price, it wasn't anything we couldn't overlook. Pros: Close to several fast food restaurants, which is nice when it is late and you are looking for cheap eats. Decent breakfast buffet from 6am to 9am each morning. Close to the 405 highway and to many of the rental car offices, gas stations and LAX. Rooms have a hair dryer, microwave and refrigerator. There is a gift shop on the property that sells snacks, drinks, medications, magazines, etc. Cons: The parking situation is a pain. It is $12 a day for guests but in order to get into and out of the lot, you have to use pain in the neck parking stubs. And there is a prominent sign that warns if you lose your parking stub, you are facing a $200+ fine. To me, that seems rather harsh and we had to spend our time in LA paranoid that we had possession of the parking stub all at times. To leave, you must stop at the desk and have the clerk validate your parking. When there is a long line, this is particularly maddening. One afternoon, we had to wait 30 minutes behind a huge church group of people who were checking into the hotel one at a time. One clerk was working with these people while the other clerk was talking on the phone. All this waiting to simply have a parking stub validated seemed rather needless. There were times at night when noise became a major factor. Surprisingly, there wasn't much noise coming from the airplanes but there seemed to be quite a few guests making noise at all hours. A party of drunks knocked on our door at 2am each night that we were there and one night, we had to roll towels under the door to block out the smell of cigarette smoke and burnt food. These elements are not the fault of the hotel, but are things you should be aware of if you stay there. Bringing earplugs may not be a bad idea if you need a good night's sleep.

This isn't your typical La Quinta, the hotel has been completely remodeled. As others have mentioned, it looks like you walked into an IKEA catalog. Most important part, the hotel and the rooms are very clean that I can walk barefoot. Breakfast: Scrambled eggs, may have sausage (offered on Monday, wasn't there fri/sat/sun), fried potatoes, bagels, toast, cold cereal, OJ, AJ, milk, coffee, apples, oranges, bananas, yogurt. It's free, and pretty much the same like any other 2 or 3 star hotel. As for food. There is a Mickey D's next door. Subway sandwich shop open 24hrs across the blvd. Nothing else around within walking distance. FYI, don't chance going across the blvd for Subway at night, LA drivers are horrible. Too dangerous, you can get hit. Internet access: Wireless in every room, free, although very slow at 30k/sec. Speeds up to 50k/sec when not many guests around or asleep. Business center: Didn't use, they charge for access. It's located across the lobby in the garage section. There is a complimentary PC kiosk in the lobby, but it's like playing with a kid protection software. Basic web mail, boarding pass print outs, and tourist attraction info access only. I tried using it, couldn't access my pass but the folks at the counter were more than happy to assist me and print my boarding pass out. Shuttle: It comes every 20-30 mins. It's shared service between 3 or 4 hotels, so unlike other dedicated hotel shuttles, they won't drive you anywhere else, no nearby restaurants or to the local subway. Noise: I can confirm what others say. This hotel is in the flight pathway and yes, you can hear the planes overhead. I recommend you bring some earplugs or turn on the noisy AC on low -- it's noisy like any other hotel AC.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Value\u201d", "Author": "IaTravel", "ReviewID": "UR13466933", "Content": "This was a pleasantly surprising hotel.

The hotel is very conveniently located to the airport, but is not your typical airport hotel - nor your typical La Quinta. The decor in the rooms is very \"boutique\", just incredibly sophisticated. When you walk into the room you might as well be staying at a \"W\" or another hip property. From sculptured towels in the bathrom, to high tech lighting fixtures, from smart duvet covers to incredibly comfortable beds, it is hard to believe that this is a La Quinta. Really, the rooms are that nice... and spotlessly clean! Even the lobby suprises in its decor, presenting a mix of sophisticated California with a hip, New York edge. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, though not overly knowledgable about the area. We asked them where to eat and they clearly had no idea outside of the hotel restaurant. However, here is something that will amaze you. I was in LA calling on a client with corporate offices located nearly 20 miles away. Even our client knew about what a value this hotel offers. Our client actually said that the hotel restaurant was one of the best near the airport. I hardly ever eat at hotel restaurants, and didn't during this stay, so I can't say if their claims proved to be true. But isn't it surpising that a major buyer with one of North America's largest retailers would actually know about this hotel? Much less the restaurant? The LaQuinta LAX must enjoy an excellent reputation with the locals. Two suggestions... (1) All of the lighting fixtures in the room are in brushed steel, however the handles on the closet, main and bathroom doors are in tacky brass. They actually detract from the unbelievable presentation in the decor and would be easy to change out. (2) The television, which you aren't really going to watch anyway, is an old fashioned CRT model. This hotel cries out for an LCD wall mount television. The bathroom vanity is stunning. The artwork tasteful and sophisticated. Everything else about the room is fantastic. I have spent hundreds of dollars a night all over the world for rooms that aren't as well appointed as this.... just please replace the door hardware and the televisions. If you want a great location, convenient to the airport and interstates, friendly staff, and a room that will exceed your expectations.... book THIS LaQuinta. One final word, the check in girl said it was unsafe to walk anywhere after dark in the neighborhood. We had a car and never sensed any danger... however be cautious if you are on foot and don't receive a similar warning.", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice value\u201d", "Author": "danielgriffin", "ReviewID": "UR11485948", "Content": "Recently remodeled rooms were nicely appointed and very clean .

On arrival at LAX, we were quite concerned to find that their phone number had been deliberately removed from their advertisement on the hotel phone-boards. However, on enquiry at the LAX information desk, we found that their shuttle stops regularly and continually at the red sign in the outside booth (too bad they didn't say this on the phone-board). The shuttle comes very quickly and service by the driver was exemplary. He loaded everybody's bags and then, once reaching the various hotels, unloaded the bags, remembering whose bags were whose -- pretty impressive! The shuttle serves about three different hotels which are very closely spaced and the total trip is only about 7 minutes max. The hotel was quite nice. Since we booked one of the cheaper rooms, we did not expect too much but it was very clean. The king-size bed was a bit hard but quite adequate. There was no room-safe which would have been a problem on a longer stay. The sink drain was clogged but on calling reception, a plumber appeared within 2 minutes and, when he couldn't fix it immediately, they very quickly apologized and moved us to a room down the hall. The employees wear a button asking you to tell them if they are not a \"10\" and I would say they tried very hard and we easily gave them a \"10\". The people in the restaurant were extremely friendly and bubbling over with enthusiasm and most helpful. Prices were reasonable and we had a great clubhouse sandwich. On the return stop-over, we stayed with them again. Booking via the internet gets a decidedly lower rate but I suspect a lower quality room as well. They must have changed cooks because the clubhouse sandwich this time was a total embarrassment to the facility but I wouldn't hold this against them since it was so great the previous time.

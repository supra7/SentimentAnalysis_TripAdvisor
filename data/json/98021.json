The East/Park Avenue Courtyard is an older facility, but very clean, and our room was absolutely spotless.

Not much in the way of toiletries, no lotion included, and the coffee holder sported those one cup packages we really don't care for, but it was Royal Cup and tasty. The tub had a good safety bar--all hotels should--and that was appreciated. Our room rate included the breakfast buffet from the little restaurant in the lobby (scrambled eggs/cooked to order omelets, bacon, sausage, potatoes, biscuits/gravy, fruit, pastries, oatmeal) and it was plentiful and good. Hostesses showed Marriott hospitality and served our coffee, juice in good mugs and glasses rather than the usual styrofoam. It was a pleasant change from the substandard fare most chains call a \"free\" breakfast. I would suggest salt/pepper shakers be wiped and refilled...ours were not, but the good breakfast was worth that little inconvenience. The breakfast area was light-filled, gas logs were lit and it was really a nice way to begin the day. Staff was friendly for the most part.

We were more than willing to come back later, but they insisted on getting it ready right away. We were very pleased with our room (king): very spacious and well-appointed. We had a sofa area, and the bed was tucked around a corner and sat parallel to the entry walkway instead of the usual perpendicular placement that 99.9% of hotel rooms use, which gave the space an entirely different, refreshing feel. It didn't scream: \"You're in a hotel room\" (if that makes any sense). The only problem we had had very little to do with the hotel itself. We were in a room facing the courtyard/pool (as others here have suggested to tone down the sound from the railroad). There was a group of adults hanging out in the courtyard until after 1:00 am, which in and of itself was fine. It was a Saturday night; we didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn. Had they been simply chatting and having a laugh or two, it would have been okay; but unfortunately, this one woman kept shrieking and screaming every few minutes. Should we have complained to the front desk? I suppose. So we have only ourselves to blame for enduring having to listen to this drunken stumble bum. I guess my mentioning it here is just to say that the train noise on the other side of the building might have been preferable to having to listen to the Queen of the Harpies.

The hotel's best asset is its location. It is very conveniently located just about 3-4 blocks from the train station, the Lincoln Park Zoo & Park (free) and several other amenities such as restaurants, pubs, shops, etc. We felt very safe in the neighborhood and were happy to have chosen this location. The hotel is also very clean inside and out and has courteous, friendly staff. We also made an advance purchase for our room and got them at $88/night for a King bedroom which is a great rate. The drawbacks of the hotel are the breakfast, which, in my opinion, is truly a bare-bones continental. Rolls, waffles, doughnuts, that sort of stuff. But no eggs, ham, sausage or things that will truly hold you up through the morning. The breakfast room is also long but very narrow and doesn't seem to accomodate hotel guests too well at any one time, it always seem crammed and crowded. The actual room also seem small by most King-bed rooms nowdays. Overall, a good value when you consider we were only paying $88 for the location, but if we go and stay there again next time we'll budget for eating breakfast elsewhere around the hotel.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBest value in Chicago!!\u201d", "Author": "MamaFish52", "ReviewID": "UR126135592", "Content": "My son and I went on our first trip to Chicago to visit DePaul University. Days Inn Chicago was one of the recommended hotels through the DePaul website. I called several hotels and Days Inn offered a great rate. I opted for the larger room, which included 2 queen beds and a fridge. Usually, hotels look better in the photos you see ahead of time, but in this case, not only did the Days Inn deliver what it seemed to be by the website and photos, it hugely exceeded my expectations. The room itself was immaculate! The bedding was plush, white cotton, and the beds were so comfortable. I am often \"skeeved out\" by the bedspreads in hotels, but Days Inn uses white cotton duvets, which appear to cleaned and replaced with the fresh linens daily. That went a long way in making me feel the place was clean. The only drawback of this room, and I suspect the others as well, was that there is no vanity in the bathroom. The sink was a pedastal sink, making it a little inconvenient to not have a place to put down my toiletries, except for a small glass shelf above the sink. But then, I have a lot of toiletries and makeup and I'm used to spreading my stuff out. The bathroom did have a towel warmer though, which was a really nice feature, especially on the chilly mornings!! Our room was on the second floor, facing the street. I did hear some traffic, but didn't find it to be a negative. I signed up for a vacation in the city, so it was welcome. And when it snowed one night, we were able to watch the snow fall over the city street. Pretty cool (we're Floridians, so it was pretty novel for us). Best of all, there was an Urban Outfitters AND a Trader Joe's literally across the street. Loved it. The hotel is an older building (I think it was built around 1920) but has been renovated. The continental breakfast was standard fare and fine. Nothing fancy, but I'm not a big breakfast eater, so it was perfectly fine. And free. Cereals, fruit, oatmeal, bagels, juices and coffee, and make your own belgian waffles. It was enough. What I really have to compliment the most, though, is the service at the front desk. Being brand new to Chicago, I had no idea how to get around, where to go find the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, where to buy a CTA public transportation pass, etc. The folks at the front desk were so helpful, consistently. Can't say enough about them!! The hotel was located in Lincoln Park, north of downtown, and required a bus or train ride into the heart of the city. Bus took longer because it stopped every block or so, but I preferred it. Even though it took a little getting to to get into downtown, I still felt like the hotel was part of the city, which I wanted, and the rate was unbeatable. We stayed 4 nights, and it didn't break the bank. If you've never been to Chicago, don't miss Lou Malnati's pizza (walkable from the hotel), Italian Beef Sandwiches from Portillo's on Ontario Street (OMG!!), and The Field Museum. It was truly a fantastic trip, largely because of a great hotel experience!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent\u201d", "Author": "Thomas C", "ReviewID": "UR126105762", "Content": "I visited Chicago for about 5 days in October 2011 on the weekend which happened to conflict with the Chicago Marathon, so many of the downtown Chicago hotels were booked up.

I was a fan ;) The staff was apathetic and not very helpful when it came to answering our questions. I'm not sure if tipping them would have helped? It shouldn't have. The big negative of this hotel is that you have to pay for parking. I know...I know it is like that all over Chicago, but a hotel needs to be very specific and tell a traveler that they should add $25 for their car's nightly room and board.

They say on their site they have access to a health club - they DON'T. One of the major reasons I booked the hotel was because their website says they have access to a health club right next door - we're travelling for 6 months then going home to get married and it's really important to us to exercise while we're away. We checked with the front desk girl on our first morning and she gave us directions to the gym. When we got there we were informed that the gym had changed hands 3 months earlier and there has been no agreement with Days Inn since then. We went back and the front desk guy said there had been negotiations and he would ask the GM what was going on. We went out for the day and checked back in the afternoon. One of the afternoon staff - the front desk supervisor - went and asked the GM when we got back. He returned to say no, there is no access, they are still working on it. I told him I wasn't very happy with this as one of the major reasons I booked the hotel was because they said they had gym access. He sarcastically informed me there was a lake I could run around 4 blocks away - I replied that I don't have running gear suitable for 0 degrees Celsius temperatures. I asked if he knew that it said on the website they have a gym, and he replied, \"yes, but it still says Bally's too\" - the name of the old gym franchise. I have no idea what this is supposed to do with the fact they haven't bothered to update their website information in 3 months - as I said to him, I should be able to trust the information on THEIR site and not have to fact-check. Other than that the hotel is fine. We were checked into an accessible room which was a little weird but not an issue, there is just a very large bathroom with 2 showers - I've just never had it happen before when there are other rooms available. I asked about this after we first saw the room and the same supervisor told me it was booked that way - I double checked my booking email and it just says 'standard room'.

As a photographer, I need my car several times a day as the sun moves around a building and it's somewhat of a hassle to have to keep going to the valet folks to get my car to go to the project site, not to mention the expense of tipping everytime.

I had a business suite which was a little bigger than a regular room and included a much-needed desk area. The bed was great and I didn't notice any outside or adjacent room noise really that I can remember. The bathroom was nice although a bit tight just because of the space limitations of such a small hotel.

The room had a small fridge and microwave and ironing board, hair dryer, nice, thick towels and all the things you've come to expect from a hice hotel chain in a location like this. The location of this hotel is great, it's close enough to downtown that you can sneak down there using streets instead of the freeway which is quicker. Or, hop on the L which is probably a better idea since then you don't have to pay for parking once you get downtown. I paid $100 for my room which was an absolute steal for Chicago and for such a nice hotel.

Also, my first room had a very strong smell of urine in one particular spot on the carpet- (probably a toddler accident, it happens) and I had to complain. But they moved me to another room, no questions asked. Some of the tvs have upgraded new flat screens, some of them still have big box tvs. I don't really care about this, but I noticed when I switched rooms.

The property itself may appear slightly dilapidated to some, however it provides considerably comfortable and homely accommodations. It is at this hotel that I have, quite possibly, had some of the best sleep that I have ever had (albeit with earplugs in). To begin with, I was allocated a room on the hotel's front, facing the very noisy Diversey Pkwy. Shortly after arriving to my generously sized room, I called the front desk to be relocated to a quieter room. Unfortunately, there were none available in my room type, and I was asked to wait to the following day for a room change. This was quickly arranged the following morning, and I was moved to a very quiet, interior facing room, although the room itself was considerably smaller. This did not bother me in the slightest. I might add that I was perfectly able to sleep, regardless of the street noise, as I had an unfortunate experience from my prior hotel, whereby I was unable to sleep all night. In addition, I was wearing earplugs. The new room was very much the same. Well equipped, comfortable and most importantly, much quieter; although it was considerably smaller. The room provides adequate amenities, and is very clean. The bathroom is quite small, however it is perfectly adequate. The television is an older cathode ray style set (CRT), but it works, and the air conditioning unit is also of older style, and did not appear to cool the room down in the slightest. The rooms also feature an in-room safe, which is always a positive. The complimentary breakfast is plentiful and well presented. Food items include, but are not limited to, cereals, doughnuts, croissants, freshly made waffles, Bagels, muffins, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. A vending machine for snacks and drinks is available in a room adjoining the front desk, in addition to clothe washing appliances: all for a very minimal fee. There were very few negatives to my stay. The first, was the fact that my room was very noisy. This was soon rectified. The rooms and their furnishing's could do with a modern update, although they are quite comfortable and adequate as is. I was never able to take a shower, as the hot water would flow sporadically. I was required to take a bath each and every time, as the water temperature was never stable. The complimentary in-room coffee and condiments were only refilled occasionally. At one time, I was required to call to arrange for some sugar and milk substitute to be brought to my room, however this request was fulfilled immediately. The property features no restaurant facilities, although it is a stone's throw from multiple restaurants, many of which are quite good! There is also no room service, spa or swimming pool. No gym lies within the hotel, however guests are offered complimentary access to a gym nearby. Days Inn Chicago is not an upscale hotel, so the fact that it is lacking these services should be expected. I will also add that I did not feel it was in the best location for my needs. To reach the city, the most appropriate avenue is via the train line, which is a 15 minute walk from the property. If wishing to visit Lincoln Park or Lincoln Park Zoo, it is approximately a 30 minute walk. It is in a very suitable location for Lincoln Park, but not if wishing to frequent the city. Otherwise, Days Inn Chicago offers a comfortable, homely atmosphere for all guests. It is by no means a classy or luxurious hotel, but it certainly does the job, and it does it well.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPerfect to see the Cubbies!\u201d", "Author": "bellamia123", "ReviewID": "UR110358315", "Content": "We stayed at the Days Inn for 2 nights to attend a few Cubs games.

Note about the location: The hotel is located in \"Wrigelyville,\" or the Lincoln Park neighborhood, which is a perfect area for walking around and hitting some great bars and restaurants with fellow baseball fans before (and especially after) a game.

We don't smoke! We did notice someone partaking in a little ganja, but it was not us. Now while I can understand the need to remind guests of hotel policies, I do not feel it was necessary to enter our room, with all of our valuables laying out, they could have easily slid it under the door, or called us, but instead someone basically made us feel unsafe by just walking in when it was obvious we were not interested in being disturbed.

The hotel itself is surrounded by bars, cafes, pubs and restaurants of varying nature and should really satsify just about every taste you could think of. The room I had on the second floor was very near the tiny lift, but I never heard it at all, and the hotel in general was quiet despite being obviously fairly busy during my three nights there. The beds, as another reviewer commented recently, were ultra comfortable and my only slight complaint, being tall and fairly stout, was that the toilet in the bathroom was very close to the wall and very uncomfortable to sit on properly. Facilities were, in general, superb and the breakfast was worthy of having every morning I was there. Plenty of choice and nothing ever seemed to run out. My only other observation - if you have a laptop and want to carry it with you when on holiday, then take it to the DIC - their public access computer is, frankly, hopeless and crashed every time I tried to use it after only a couple of minutes.

As always, the staff was top notch, and can't find even one complaint. So I wanted to let you know how impressed i am with the house keeping. To let you know how fantastic of a cleaning job they did, i hadn't shaved in a week and thus, i had lots of facial hair. I trimmed it first, prior to shaving which left trimmings unfortunately scattered around. The next morning, when we left to let housekeeping do their thing, when i returned, I swear there was not even 1 hair trimming from the night before, ANYWHERE in that bathroom. I was amazed. I felt bad when i left that morning but their cleaning seemed virtually magic. I was impressed beyond belief. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. You don't have to spend a fortune to have great service and even then, doesn't guarantee you top notch service. I am spoiled by your hotel and everything/everyone.

He lifted his head to look at us walking through the door, but didn't say a word. We next passed the bellman, who didn't even meet eyes with us, much less say hello. They were the only sour notes. The check in was pleasant and the front desk people were very friendly. Our room had 2 double beds and was huge! Room was clean & beds were comfy. We were right on the street and it would be loud at night if you don't travel with a fan...we don't leave home without ours. : ) I loved people watching out our window...and Walgreens right across the street came in handy a few times. I didn't ever personally make it to the breakfast, but my hubby did and came back to the room with different yummies every morning. Free breakfast with the awesome low rate can not be beat! Now location: Lincoln Park is a wonderful base for your next trip to Chicago...we parked our car at the hotel with in/out privileges for $22 a day, but never took it out. We walked to Wrigley Field for a Cubs game and enjoyed some \"dolla no holla\" tacos at The Bar Celona where the service was excellent We walked just down the street from the Days to The Half Shell for killer crab legs and then headed to Kingston Minds for some rockin' Jimmy Burns Blues starting at 9pm on Wednesday and trust me, Jimmy knows blues! We also did Chicago Near North Food Tour and it was just okay...not the best, but not the worst. We did end up renting bikes at Bobby's Bikes ad going along the lake, through the Lincoln Park area including the FREE zoo, and back to some of the neighborhoods that the food tour took us through - Old Town is a great place for lunch.

We wanted to stay around the Loop area so we would be closer to things, but there was a large convention in town and the Blackhawks were also playing for the Stanley Cup. I read some pretty good reviews so I felt comfortable about choosing this hotel. When we arrived on Sunday around 1:00 we were unable to check in as a room was not ready. The girl at the front desk said a room may be ready in an hour or it would be guaranteed at 3:00pm. She said we could check our luggage at no cost until that time. This was fine with us because we were ready to eat lunch and take a walk down to the beach near the lake. By the time we returned it was very close to 3:00 and our room was ready. There was a different person checking us in and when he pulled up our information he said that we were now upgraded to a larger room. We didn't know what we did to deserve the upgrade, but we were very happy about it as I heard some of the rooms were very small. Our room had plenty of room. We had a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker. It had a futon type couch in the room that would double as a bed for someone (sheets and blankets in the closet). We did not have a view because we were facing the inside of the building which was fine with us as I had heard the outside rooms were a bit noisy due to the traffic on the streets. The airconditioner worked really well in the room. Of course it was pretty rainy and cool while we were there so it wouldn't have had to work too hard. A plus to the airconditioner is that it helps drown out noise from other rooms. While we didn't hear our neighbors too much you could hear all activity in the hall. They do give you one set of earplugs just in case you are bothered by noises. The bed was very, very comfortable. The room and bathroom area was very clean. The front lobby is very nice and would always have people gathered around the seating areas which seemed so inviting.

What this hotel is not: Fancy (although the lobby has some very nice seating areas). What it is: Affordable, clean, quiet, and convenient, with a genuinely warm and friendly staff. I booked a few months in advance to make sure I wouldn't be scrambling to find an affordable room for our short May visit. I explained that it was just myself and two children, that this was the kids' first visit to Chicago, and that we'd need to get around the city via public transport. When we arrived in May and checked in, we had been upgraded - at no additional charge - to a suite, so that we would have more room to stretch out. The king bed was massive enough to comfortably sleep all three of us, and there was a separate dressing area with full-length mirror, which was a nice bonus. The bathroom was tiny but immaculate (and anyway we didn't come to Chicago to hang out in the hotel bathroom). The free breakfast was a godsend, with two hungry kids ready to take on the city each morning. We did the \"make-your-own-waffle\" routine - fun and really pretty tasty - but the kids seemed to prefer the donuts and juice (go figure). Location-wise, the hotel is in the Lincoln Park area, so it's a bit off the tourist-beaten track (which, it must be said, I prefer.) But it's close to a number of bus and El lines, and within walking distance of both Lake Michigan and the Lincoln Park Zoo, which is free. (Did you catch that? Let me say it again: FREE.) With younger kids in tow, I found it necessary to pay for transportation to the farther-flung attractions in the city, but one could feasibly walk downtown if one had enough time to spare and the right pair of shoes. Best of all: The staff was marvelous, directing us to the closest bus and El stops, and helping us plan routes to the sites we visited each day. At one point my MP3 player refused to charge on the laptop I'd brought, so they helped me locate a place to charge it up (thank God, or I'd have gone nuts on the long, late train ride home). When an old friend stopped by with a bottle of wine one evening, they lent us a corkscrew. The doormen hailed cabs for us. Every member of the desk and door staff, and even a couple of the housekeepers, recognized and remembered us as we came and went, frequently asking about our day and how our outings had gone and if we'd enjoyed ourselves. We plan on making another trip to Chicago in the next year or two, and I would definitely stay here again. I've also recommended it to a number of people.

We had to get a train and then a bus from the airport, which took a while and wasn't that easy to navigate.

The neighbourhood was very nice, with some nice places to eat and such nearby. The Lake Michigan shore is not far away, and walking along the beach to get into town was a lovely stroll.

The Brown Line El runs quite close too (Diversey is the closest station, not Belmont as a reviewer down the page states!). It's a few minutes walk to the station. You can buy transit cards for the CTA (buses and El), from the Currency Exchange store across from the hotel on N Clark St. Lincoln Park is an ideal base as well for theatres (Steppenwolf, Victory Gardens, 2nd City and others are in the nighborhood), and it's close to Wrigley Field. It was absolutely no problem at all staying out of the downtown area, and in fact it was nice being in what is a lively, interesting residential neighborhood.

Unfortunately, it was a busy weekend, most hotels were booked solid, and, the only rooms available downtown started at $400 per night--at least according to the various hotel booking sites on the internet. According to the Days Inn central reservations, this hotel was also booked solid, however..... ...Important Tip! Even if all the internet hotel reservation sites and central reservation center for a hotel chain CLAIM that a particular hotel property doesn't have any available rooms, it is usually worth a shot to try calling the hotel property directly, as they usually \"hold back\" a few rooms for phone reservations and their regular guests. I like to call the hotel after midnight and talk to the night auditor, which is what I did, and sure enough, he was able to \"force\" the system to book a reservation irregardless--and was also able to give me a special \"package\" rate of $132--really good rate for this particular weekend! (When calling the hotel, do not select the menu option for reservations - \"1\" as it will transfer you automatically to Days' Inn central reservations; Instead press zero '0' to speak directly to the hotel's front desk staff.) In truth, I called 9 other hotels as well which were supposedly booked solid, and found only 2 that had not held a few rooms back. However I booked at this Day's Inn because of its reputation and exceptional Lincoln Park location--an upscale neighborhood which is safe and secure, close to Lincoln Park Zoo (free admission!) with numerous eating establishments and popular clubs--walking distance to Cub Stadium (about 1 mile) and easily accessable to Navy Pier and \"the Loop\" via subway, or by hailing any one of numerous taxis that run directly past the hotel at all hours of the day and night. Taxi cabs in Chicago charge very reasonable rates, our ride to Navy Pier, for example, was under $5. OK, so maybe this hotel isn't The Drake or a Hilton, but far superior to any other Day's Inn we ever stayed at. The beds are all \"triple sheeted\", meaning there are 2 top sheets that completely encase the blanket for added cleanliness. The furnishings were a little older, but very clean. The free deluxe continental breakfast includes fresh Belgum Waffles which you make yourself by pouring the preprepared batter into Waffle Irons, along with complimentary copies of USA Today, and complimentary day membership to the Bally's Gym next door. Free \"wifi\" and expanded cable are also included. Parking: You can either park your car yourself in the self-parking garage located next to the hotel ($14.95) or use the hotel's valet services ($20).

North Clark and West Diversey in the heart of the Lincoln Park residential and shopping district -- an easy, safe 1-1/8 mile walk from Wrigley Field past great shops, bars, and restaurants, and about the same distance to Lincoln Park Zoo and the waterfront. Valet parking is $20 per night, fast, and reliable -- a bargain for Chicago. Every room has very fast wireless internet service at no charge. The executive rooms are apparently newly remodeled and refurnished, quiet, very clean, and fully appointed -- and about half the price for a comparable room in a downtown hotel. Service is exceptional by any hotel's standards. Everyone -- from the valet parking attendant to the bellman to the front desk staff -- rank among the best I have encountered in Chicago. We left a valuable item in our room when we checked out. In many hotels it would have been lost. The Housekeeping staff secured the item and left a message at our home phone number before we were able to call them. Nothing at this hotel could be considered a \"bad point,\" but here are three very minor issues: Because of the structure of the building (which apparently was not built to be a hotel) the hallways and rooms are very dark. The included buffet breakfast is a good value,but the dining room is small and sometimes uncomfortably crowded. Again, there is not much that the hotel can do about this without cutting into the quality of the breakfast.

There was a nice section in the room to but all of our luggage and shopping bags, and they stayed out of the way. The bathroom was nice, a large mirror. The downside is there really isn't any room to put your toiletries in the shower, and their isn't a fan. The A/C worked the entire stay and kept our room very cozy. The best part was the bedding.

Third: Shopping Right as you exit the hotel there is a Jamba Juice, Barnes and Noble, Walgreens, and many restaraunts. Renaldis pizza is less than a block away. Also a shopping mall is less than a block away. If you walk a little further you will find a Best Buy, more shopping and more eating. Fourth: Valet The Valet service was very good. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my car. They were very friendly to me. I even forgot something in my car, and the man went and got it for me, instead of having to get my car and take it out myself. That was very nice.

That's a lot of nights in hotels. While I love to stay in the big cities' downtown districts when I get the chance, my travel budget won't allow for $200 plus per night hotel stays. That's why I rely on the reviews in trip advisor to help me make a choice. I have seen some mixed reviews on the Days Inn Lincoln Park north. It's common to see some negative reviews, one can't be something for everyone. But I can say I do not have any thing negative to say. My room was a double. It had fresh paint and carpet. Yes the room was on the small side, but again this isn't a $200 plus per night hotel on Michigan Ave. It had a metal tub (often hotels have the fiberglass ones). The water pressure in the shower was fine. The bathroom was clean. My sheets were clean - new mattress. After watching so many news stories on hotels, I always peel back the corners of the sheets to see if I can find any bugs - none here. I had a window overlooking Clark, Diversey and Broadway. The hotel had a conceirge (very nice) as well as valets for parking your car. I called the valets for my car before leaving my room and by the time I went downstairs my car was there. Security was on site late in the evening. I was suprised that none of the reviews mentioned anything nearby. There's a mall beind the hotel with a movie theatre. A Walgreen's next door. Barnes and Noble across the street. Borders next door. Also at the doorstep is a smoothie place, a nuts and popcorn store, Panera Bread, Chipolte, Buca Di Peppo and lots of mom and pop restaurants and cafes. Boystown was just a short walk away - had a blast on Halsted and felt very safe walking back at wee hours of the morning. The lake is a quarter mile walk east. The continental breakfast was great. My favorite was the big waffle machine. The pastries were fresh. The staff was very nice. I did not have any negative experiences. I would absolutley stay in this hotel again and can't wait until my next visit to Boystown Chicago.", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cGem of a Hotel in a Great Loc\u201d", "Author": "bernamac", "ReviewID": "UR5773089", "Content": "We miss this hotel!

I'm sorry that others only gave it a 1 or 2. We've stayed here at least 3 times and have recommended it highly to others.

The hotel room was clean and wasn't really small. We were in Room 211. It had a coffee maker and iron, but no microwave or frig,(but neither was expected). The staff help was hit or miss. Some of the staff went out of their way to help you, where others couldn't be bothered. The valet people were very friendly although we didn't use their services. While asking directions to different attractions, some of the clerks gave them and were very helpful, others would have gotten me lost. The continental breakfast was nice, they had the usual bagels, cereal, juice milk, waffles. My real complaint was with the showers; very little water pressure and then you would get a shot of cold water, then it would go back to hot. You could tell when this happened by the scream from the bathroom. Our room faced Diversey and it was loud from street noise. I never heard any noise from the hall ways it was all from the street.. Stair way was narrow,(never used the elevator - it seemed to take way too long) but much quicker than the elevator.

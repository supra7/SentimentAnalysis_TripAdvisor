The hot breakfast was great with slightly different selections every day and the attendant Frank took good care of everybody, even our little kiddies! All the staff, front desk, housekeeping, facilities were friendly and professional and service was always very prompt. The hotel is walking distance to lots of restaurants, grocery stores and shopping (Marshall's, Ross) and there is also a golf course nearby. Parking is free. I have just a few complaints/suggestions: There is not wifi throughout the complex. In our room (on the ground floor) there was only one wired internet connection. We inquired about getting another cable, but learned the room had only one port, so we were unable to both work on our computers at the same time. (There is wireless in the lobby.) There were no luggage racks in either bedroom so you have to leave your bag on the floor of the closet or room or unpack if you don't want to have to squat everytime you want to get at your stuff. My bathroom had only a shower and it was *tiny* and had only a soap dish; no where to put shampoo, razor, etc. The other bathroom was better with a full tub.

The room was beautifully decorated, very modern, and very clean. The kitchen almost looked as if it had never even been cooked in! Very nice full-size fridge, stove and dishwasher......the kitchen itself is a little small, as are all the rooms, but because of the layout, we did not feel crowded at all! The rest of the facility was really nice too, especially the recreation area. We enjoyed being able to eat our breakfast out on the patio under an umbrella-table (they have a really nice indoor eating area as well)......and the breakfast was very nice! Lots of variety......better than most hotel buffets I have had! Also, we were not there to take advantage, but saw that they have complimentary dinner-time meals Monday through Wednesday, and the menu hanging on our fridge looked pretty yummy, including a BBQ on Wednesdays. We only wished we could've stayed longer! They had lots of amenities for familiy activities, such as a ping-pong table, basketball/tennis court, pool & jacuzzi (pool was a nice depth for kids.....shallow on the ends and just slightly deeper in the middle). There was also a dog park, and a really nice outdoor sitting area with a pretty fountain and comfortable, cushioned chairs. Also wanted to mention that the hotel is in an excellent location.....just off the 15 freeway in a beautiful residential area.....great restaurants nearby; we walked to an Olive Garden and had a delicious dinner. We were exactly halfway between the San Diego Zoo and the Wild Animal Park (Safari Park), which is what we were on vacation to do (20 minutes from each park).

From the get go, I had an issue because I'd somehow mistakenly booked a room at the Courtyard Rancho Bernardo instead of the Residence Inn. Since I booked only a couple of days before we left, I didn't notice the problem until we were already at the Courtyard. The woman at the front desk there was thoroughly unhelpful as far as contacting the Residence Inn for me (they are both Marriott hotels, right???). Anyway, once I got Marriott reservations on the phone, they told me the rate for the Residence Inn was $108/night, while my rate for the Courtyard had been $87/night. This was a bit upsetting, but I thought of it in terms of free breakfast and a kitchen, and decided to change my reservation. Luckily, you can cancel without penalty until 6pm on the day of check-in. I think we happened to be at the Residence Inn on a fairly quiet weekend for the hotel. We had no trouble parking the entire time we were there (including one night when we came back at midnight), and we were in Building 2, which is right near the main building and the pool area. Our room was 1 queen bed and sofabed. French doors separated the bedroom from the living room, and bathroom had doors to both the bedroom and the kitchen. The kitchen was small, but perfect for the two of us. The only issue we had with the room was that the TV was outdated and not visible from the bed. An argument could be made as to not needing TV in the bedroom, but I think most people are used to being able to watch TV from bed if necessary. It was in front of the sofabed, though, so that's something. The sofabed mattress was stained, so we never used it (didn't need it anyway). The room also had a small balcony which overlooked the parking lot. I never used the fitness room, but it looked adequate. Breakfast was good each morning. The hot dish the first morning was make-your-own breakfast burrito. The second morning, it was biscuits and sausage gravy. You could also make your own waffles. My husband brought breakfast up to the room the second morning, and they provided him a tray and said just to leave the dishes in the room. Housekeeping, btw, was excellent. I can see how walking to breakfast from the other, further away buildings could be a chore. I would recommend requesting a room closer to the main lobby building. We used the pool on the second day. We had the place entirely to ourselves. The only problem was the lack of shade, and the wasps. Live wasps kept flying into the pool and floating in there. Also, the lounge chairs were dirty, and there wasn't a lot of shade. We didn't use the jacuzzi because we'd noticed painters near it the day before, and the residue from their paint might've gotten into the water. The location of the hotel is excellent for the Wild Animal Park (only a few miles down the 15 fwy). Also, it is near a HUGE outdoor shopping and dining area. We literally had every store or restaurant we could ever need within walking distance (up and down some hills, though). There is also a gas station/car wash right by the hotel parking lot, and a few restaurants and stores right next door. The staff was friendly, check-in and check-out were a breeze.

I booked through arestravel.com which allowed me to pay only a deposit of $15 up front - the rest was billed to me at the end of our stay. I booked a one room suite. We arrived late on a Friday night - we stayed in Building 6 - I had read the previous review about the higher the building number the closer you are to the freeway (and the noise) and I was happy - I could definitely hear the freeway, but it wasnt enough to keep me awake at night, although I assume if you are in Bldg 10 you would definitely run into this problem. The hotel is convenient enough to the I-15 freeway (it is right off the freeway) and is in the middle of a great shopping area - you can walk to the Olive Garden, Carls Jr., Subway, Chevron, etc. and is literally a 2minute drive to the Calif.Pizza Kitchen, Chevy's, Marie Callendars, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, etc. There is also a Ralphs Supermarket and Rite Aid right around the corner...VERY convenient. I loved the location! The room itself was kept very clean by housekeeping and I found nothing that I could complain about. Also, FREE high speed internet connection in the rooms! At the main office you can use their computer in their business center if you need to print out boarding passes, admission tickets, etc. I used it to print out our Sea World tickets - they charge your room $.10 for every page you have printed. The pull out sofa bed in the room was adequate - my kids brought their own bedding for the sofa bed, which was totally my preference, there were sheets for the sofa bed and extra pillows provided. My only complaint (which had nothing to do with the hotel) was the mosquitos - they were everywhere! I was going to ask to switch rooms as I thought it was a room problem, but my husband found a mosquito swatter in the closet and we guessed that this was a San Diego problem and not a room problem. I may be wrong, but we didnt let the mosquitos ruin our vacation! The morning breakfasts were great, but take everyone else's advice and get there early as tables fill up fast. There was a party of six that came to breakfast every morning and then leisurely sat at the tables chit-chatting while people waited for tables to sit at. Nothing wrong with that but common courtesy I guess would be to continue conversation elsewhere where the seating is not so limiting --- literally maybe 6-7 tables to sit at. The breakfast buffet always had dry cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, doughnuts and pastries, toast, bagels, fruit, scrambled eggs and fried potatoes. They alternated the hot entree offerings by serving hot croissants, french toast, pancakes the first day; french toast, biscuits & gravy the second day; and sausage patties and tortillas the third day, along with a rice-cooker filled with steamed rice. There is also a waffle maker available all days, but it only makes one belgian waffle at a time. I would definitely stay here again -- driving to the San Diego Zoo took maybe 20minutes and the same time when driving to Sea World.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cBetter than average continental breakfast\u201d", "Author": "YOGAMOMMAs", "ReviewID": "UR5535009", "Content": "We stayed in this Residence Inn July 26th-30th. I was a little disappointed at the size of the room, compared to another Residence we had stayed previously a couple of years ago. BUT... the bedding was very nice. New, clean and comfortable. I can say it's the best hotel bed I have ever slept on. The first night we stayed, I was awoke from 11:30 to 2:30 in the morning, by VERY loud construction on the nearby freeway. The next day I tried to change rooms, but the hotel was booked. The front desk staff was very friendly and tried to help, but not a lot they could do, except offter ear plugs. Same thing the following night, but used the ear plugs. Didn't have any more problems following that night. But I did learn a good lesson. Call ahead to see if there is any construction near by, and it wouldn't have been a problem except our building was near the freeway. If you book here, try to get a building closer to the main area. We were in building 8. They have 1 through 10 buildings and the closer to 10 the closer you are to the freeway. The FREE breakfast in the morning was very good. Cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, donuts, coffee, juices, soft drinks. The eating area is a bit small though and had to wait each morning to find a spot to eat with a family of 5. Oh, and they had a FREE dinner, snack at night Monday through Thursday, which also was very good. The front desk was able to print directions to areas of interest, which was convienient.

We checked in on a Thursday around 7:45pm, and just missed 'happy hour' which is a variety of food served from 4:30pm-7:30pm, Mon-Thurs. We were told that they offer a full breakfast buffet daily, so we decided to check it out. It was great! Depending on the day, you can choose from French toast, pancakes, tacos, or biscuits & gravy, AND, donuts, fruit, cereals, muffins, bagels, toast, scrambled eggs, seasoned potatoes, sausage, yogurt, coffee, tea or milk. We ate by the pool one day, and in our room on another. The room, had a full kitchen (complete with utensils, plates/cups, pots/pans), private balcony, central air/heat, and free internet access. We felt as if we had found the perfect 'apartment'. If you want to visit San Diego and experience a nice, quiet, upscale setting, then the Residence Inn in Rancho Bernardo is for you. The staff was always friendly, and helpful. They offer to pick-up groceries, provide 24 gym privileges, and the use of a clothing valet service. We have both decided to make this 'our' special place when we visit in the future.
